Business outlook for Q1 2024 forecasts a decrease in total net revenues. Positive comments from Chairman and CEO Yan Tang regarding the company's performance in 2023. Negative Decrease in net revenues for Q4 2023 and full year 2023. Reduction in Monthly Active Users and paying users for Momo and Tantan apps. Forecasted decrease in total net revenues for Q1 2024. Financial Analyst The financial results reported by Hello Group Inc. show a mixed picture, with net revenues declining by 6.5% year over year in Q4 2023 and by 5.5% for the full year, which may raise concerns about the company's top-line growth. However, the increase in net income, both GAAP and non-GAAP, suggests that the company has effectively managed costs and improved profitability despite revenue headwinds. This could indicate a stronger operational efficiency that investors may view favorably. The decrease in costs and expenses, particularly in revenue sharing with broadcasters and virtual gift recipients, as well as optimized personnel costs, contributed to the increased profitability.Furthermore, the declaration of a special cash dividend and the expansion and extension of the share repurchase program reflect confidence by the board in the company's cash position and future prospects. These actions typically signal to the market that the company believes its stock is undervalued and that it is committed to delivering value to shareholders. The special dividend and share buybacks could potentially support the stock price in the short term.However, the forecasted decline in revenues for Q1 2024 suggests that the company anticipates continued challenges. Investors should consider whether the improved profitability is sustainable in the face of persistent revenue declines and what strategies the company has in place to return to revenue growth. Market Research Analyst The reported decrease in Monthly Active Users (MAU) on the Tantan app and the decline in total paying users for both Momo and Tantan apps are concerning trends. These metrics are crucial for evaluating the company's engagement and monetization capabilities. The decline in MAUs and paying users could be indicative of increased competition in the social and entertainment space, changes in user preferences, or challenges in user acquisition and retention strategies.On the positive side, the growth in mobile marketing revenues and the mention of new standalone apps contributing to revenue growth suggest that the company is diversifying its revenue streams. This diversification could help mitigate the impact of declining revenues in its core services. It will be important to monitor the performance of these new initiatives and their contribution to the overall financial health of the company.The company's efforts to pivot away from less dating-centric live video services and to improve the Momo app's ecosystem are strategic moves that could pay off in the long term if they lead to a more engaged and monetizable user base. However, the short-term impact of these product adjustments on revenue should be carefully assessed. Economist The macroeconomic context in which Hello Group Inc. operates has been highlighted as a factor affecting consumer sentiment and, consequently, the company's revenues. The soft consumer sentiment could be a result of broader economic challenges, such as slowing growth, trade tensions, or regulatory changes in China's tech sector. Such external factors can have a significant impact on discretionary consumer spending, which is critical for entertainment and social platforms.Despite these challenges, Hello Group's ability to improve cost efficiency and profitability in a difficult economic environment is commendable. The company's proactive adjustments to operations and cost control strategies have shown resilience, which may be seen as a positive indicator of management's capability to navigate through economic headwinds.Investors should also consider the potential risks of regulatory changes and the impact of international expansion as the company seeks to invest more resources abroad. While diversification into overseas markets could offer growth opportunities, it also introduces new risks and uncertainties that need to be managed. 03/14/2024 - 04:12 AM BEIJING, March 14, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Hello Group Inc.

Fourth Quarter of 2023 Financial Results Net revenues Total net revenues were RMB3,002.9 million (US$423.0 million) in the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease of 6.5% from RMB3,212.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Live video service revenues were RMB1,523.9 million (US$214.6 million) in the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease of 11.6% from RMB1,724.2 million during the same period of 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to a soft consumer sentiment in the current macro environment and our proactive operation adjustments to de-emphasise large scale competition events in the Momo app, and to a lesser degree, Tantan pivoting away from the less dating-centric live video service. Value-added service revenues mainly include virtual gift revenues and membership subscription revenues. Total value-added service revenues were RMB1,424.9 million (US$200.7 million) in the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease of 1.7% from RMB1,449.5 million during the same period of 2022. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of the macro economy on consumer sentiment as well as our product adjustments to improve Momo app's ecosystem, and to a lesser extent, the decline in Tantan's paying users that resulted from a reduction in channel investment, the anti-spam campaign and the adjustments to subscription renewals. The decrease was partially offset by the rapid revenue growth from the new standalone apps. Mobile marketing revenues were RMB44.9 million (US$6.3 million) in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 36.4% from RMB32.9 million during the same period of 2022. Mobile games revenues were RMB5.4 million (US$0.8 million) in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 2.4% from RMB5.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Net revenues from the Momo segment decreased from RMB2,865.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 to RMB2,728.7 million (US$384.3 million) in the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily due to the decrease in net revenues from value-added service and live video service on Momo app. The decrease was partially offset by the revenue growth of the new standalone apps. Net revenues from the Tantan segment decreased from RMB346.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 to RMB272.2 million (US$38.3 million) in the fourth quarter of 2023, mainly due to the decrease in net revenues from live video service, and to a lesser extent, the decrease from value-added service. Cost and expenses Cost and expenses were RMB2,431.8 million (US$342.5 million) in the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease of 11.2% from RMB2,738.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to: (a) a decrease in revenue sharing with broadcasters related to live video service on the Momo app and on the Tantan app, and a decrease in revenue sharing with virtual gift recipients of virtual gift service on the Momo app. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenue sharing with virtual gift recipients for new standalone apps; (b) a decrease in salary expenses and share-based compensation expenses, due to our continuous optimization in personnel costs and the newly granted share options which had lower fair value; (c) a decrease in sales and marketing expenses due to our initiatives to control cost and optimize Tantan's channel marketing strategy and, to a lesser extent, Momo's strategy to trim inefficient channel marketing spend. Non-GAAP cost and expenses (note 1) were RMB2,369.5 million (US$333.7 million) in the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease of 10.5% from RMB2,648.3 million during the same period of 2022.

Financial Analyst The financial results of Futu Holdings Limited indicate a mixed performance, with a notable increase in total revenues and net income on an annual basis but a decline in net income for the fourth quarter. The growth in paying clients and client assets reflects a positive trend in user acquisition and asset retention, which is crucial for the company's revenue model that relies on trading volumes and margin financing. However, the decrease in total trading volume and DARTs suggests a potential reduction in user trading activity, which could impact future revenue streams.From an investment perspective, the expansion into new markets, such as Malaysia and the strategic focus on reducing friction in the account opening process are promising signs of Futu's growth strategy. These moves could potentially offset the sluggish trading volumes observed in the Hong Kong market. Investors should monitor the company's ability to maintain client growth and asset accumulation, as these are critical drivers for sustained revenue growth in the brokerage industry. Market Research Analyst Futu's performance in various geographic markets provides insight into the company's strategic positioning. The decline in client acquisition in Hong Kong due to poor market performance contrasts with the sustained growth in Singapore and the rapid expansion in Japan and Malaysia. This geographical diversification could mitigate risks associated with market-specific downturns and is indicative of Futu's adaptive market entry strategies.Furthermore, the company's focus on leveraging technology to streamline account opening and targeted marketing efforts are indicative of a user-centric approach, which is essential in the competitive fintech space. The increase in margin financing and securities lending balance suggests a growing trust in Futu's platform and services, which could enhance customer lifetime value and contribute to long-term profitability. Economist The performance of Futu Holdings in the context of global economic trends shows resilience amidst market volatility. The increase in client assets and margin financing indicates a robust demand for wealth management and trading services. However, the decline in trading volumes and DARTs may reflect broader economic uncertainties affecting investor behavior. As the company expands into new markets, it will need to navigate varying economic conditions and investor sentiment, which could influence its operational success.The contrast between the year-over-year increase in revenues and the quarterly decline in net income could be indicative of rising costs or increased competition affecting profit margins. The company's future performance will depend on its ability to manage these challenges while capitalizing on growth opportunities in emerging markets and new investment products. 03/14/2024 - 04:00 AM HONG KONG, March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Futu Holdings Limited (“Futu” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: FUTU), a leading tech-driven online brokerage and wealth management platform, today announced its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023.

Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Highlights Total revenues increased 4.1% year-over-year to HK$2,373.3 million (US$303.8 million).Total gross profit increased 0.1% year-over-year to HK$1,939.8 million (US$248.3 million).Net income decreased 8.6% year-over-year to HK$876.4 million (US$112.2 million).Non-GAAP adjusted net income5 decreased 6.3% year-over-year to HK$950.5 million (US$121.7 million).

Mr. Leaf Hua Li, Futu’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “In 2023, we added over 220 thousand paying clients, bringing the total number of paying clients to 1.7 million, up 15.0% year-over-year. We acquired over 59 thousand paying clients in the fourth quarter, down 8.6% quarter-over-quarter. In Hong Kong, client acquisition trended down due to sluggish Hong Kong stock market performance. In Singapore, client acquisition sustained the momentum in the third quarter as clients continued to demonstrate heightened interest in money market funds. Our efforts to reduce friction in the account opening process, combined with targeted marketing, led to an increase in client acquisition in Japan towards year-end, which further accelerated in the first quarter owing to the Japan stock market's exceptional performance. We officially launched our brokerage business in Malaysia on February 26th, 2024. Leveraging the high brand awareness we garnered in the region through our rapid share gain in Singapore, we added over 30,000 clients within just one week of official launch, the fastest growth we have seen in any new market. Overall, we saw strong paying client growth across all markets in the first quarter as U.S. equities continued to post new highs and sentiments around Chinese equities rebounded. We are confident about client acquisition in 2024 and are guiding for 350 thousand net new paying clients.” “Total client assets increased by 16.3% year-over-year and 3.7% quarter-over-quarter to HK$485.6 billion, driven by robust net asset inflow across all regions and market appreciation of our clients’ U.S. stock holdings. Notably, client assets in Singapore grew 25% sequentially as we continued to attract higher quality clients with our richer product portfolio and growing brand awareness. Margin financing and securities lending balance increased by 2.1%.” “Total trading volume decreased by 12.2% quarter-over-quarter to HK$956.6 billion. Hong Kong stock trading volume fell by 12.8% sequentially to HK$237.7 billion against weak market performance. U.S. stock trading volume declined by 12.4% quarter-over-quarter to HK$704.6 billion due to lower turnover of the key U.S. technology names, partially offset by resilient trading turnover of leveraged and inverse ETFs.” “Wealth management asset balance was HK$57.6 billion, up 82.3% year-over-year and 10.9% quarter-over-quarter. Clients’ bond holdings jumped by over 60% sequentially given robust demand for U.S. Treasury bills. In Hong Kong, we enriched our structured note offerings for professional investors. In Singapore, we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with Fullerton Fund Management for its SGD-denominated money market fund, the first and only SGD T+0 money market fund for retail investors in Singapore.” “We had 414 IPO distribution and IR clients as of quarter end, up 24.3% year-over-year. We underwrote 37 Hong Kong IPOs in 2023 and ranked first among all brokers, according to Wind. In the quarter, we acted as joint bookrunners for several high-profile HK IPOs, including those of J&T Express and UBTech.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Revenues Total revenues were HK$2,373.3 million (US$303.8 million), an increase of 4.1% from HK$2,280.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Brokerage commission and handling charge income was HK$904.0 million (US$115.7 million), a decrease of 13.8% from the fourth quarter of 2022. This was mainly due to lower trading volume. Interest income was HK$1,331.9 million (US$170.5 million), an increase of 17.1% from the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was mainly driven by higher interest income from bank deposits and higher margin financing income due to an increase in daily average margin balance. Other income was HK$137.3 million (US$17.6 million), an increase of 45.6% from the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to higher fund distribution service income. Costs Total costs were HK$433.5 million (US$55.5 million), an increase of 26.7% from HK$342.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Brokerage commission and handling charge expenses were HK$59.2 million (US$7.6 million), a decrease of 7.5% from the fourth quarter of 2022. This decline was roughly in line with the decrease of our brokerage commission and handling charge income. Interest expenses were HK$270.8 million (US$34.7 million), an increase of 48.8% from the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher expenses associated with our securities borrowing and lending business and higher margin financing interest expenses. Processing and servicing costs were HK$103.5 million (US$13.3 million), an increase of 7.6% from the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher cloud service fee for new markets and higher system usage fee. Gross Profit Total gross profit was HK$1,939.8 million (US$248.3 million), an increase of 0.1% from HK$1,938.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Gross margin was 81.7%, as compared to 85.0% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Operating Expenses Total operating expenses were HK$916.0 million (US$117.3 million), an increase of 12.0% from HK$817.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Research and development expenses were HK$363.1 million (US$46.5 million), an increase of 8.6% from the fourth quarter of 2022. This was primarily due to an increase in research and development headcount to support new product offerings in new markets, though the magnitude of the headcount growth decelerated throughout 2023. Selling and marketing expenses were HK$182.5 million (US$23.4 million), an increase of 19.2% from HK$153.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. This was driven by a 41% year-over-year increase in net new paying clients, offset by lower client acquisition costs. General and administrative expenses were HK$370.4 million (US$47.4 million), an increase of 12.1% from the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in general and administrative personnel, partially offset by lower professional service fees. Income from Operations Income from operations decreased by 8.6% to HK$1,023.8 million (US$131.1 million) from HK$1,120.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Operating margin declined to 43.1% from 49.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Net Income Net income decreased by 8.6% to HK$876.4 million (US$112.2 million) from HK$958.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Net income margin for the fourth quarter of 2022 declined to 36.9% from 42.0% in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP adjusted net income decreased by 6.3% to HK$950.5 million (US$121.7 million) from the fourth quarter of 2022. Non-GAAP adjusted net income is defined as net income excluding share-based compensation expenses. For further information, see ""Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" at the bottom of this press release. Net Income per ADS Basic net income per American Depositary Share (“ADS”) was HK$6.40 (US$0.82), compared with HK$6.88 in the fourth quarter of 2022. Diluted net income per ADS was HK$6.31 (US$0.81), compared with HK$6.80 in the fourth quarter of 2022. Each ADS represents eight Class A ordinary shares. Full Year 2023 Financial Results Revenues Total revenues were HK$10,008.4 million (US$1,281.3 million), an increase of 31.4% from HK$7,614.0 million in 2022. Brokerage commission and handling charge income was HK$3,944.8 million (US$505.0 million), a decrease of 1.6% from HK$4,007.6 million in 2022. This was mainly due to lower trading volume, largely offset by higher blended commission rate. Interest income was HK$5,536.4 million (US$708.8 million), an increase of 72.2% from HK$3,214.3 million in 2022. The increase in interest income was mainly driven by higher interest income from bank deposits and securities borrowing and lending business. Other income was HK$527.2 million (US$67.5 million), an increase of 34.5% from HK$392.1 million in 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to higher fund distribution service income. Costs Total costs were HK$1,536.2 million (US$196.7 million), an increase of 54.2% from HK$996.1 million in 2022. Brokerage commission and handling charge expenses were HK$249.6 million (US$32.0 million), a decrease of 24.3% from HK$329.8 million in 2022. This was attributable to lower trading volume and cost savings from our U.S. self-clearing business. Interest expenses were HK$910.8 million (US$116.6 million), an increase of 211.4% from HK$292.5 million in 2022. The increase was mainly driven by higher expenses associated with our securities borrowing and lending business. Processing and servicing costs were HK$375.9 million (US$48.1 million), an increase of 0.6% from HK$373.8 million in 2022. Gross Profit Total gross profit was HK$8,472.2 million (US$1,084.7 million), an increase of 28.0% from HK$6,617.9 million in 2022. Gross profit margin declined from 86.9% in 2022 to 84.7% in 2023. Operating Expenses Total operating expenses were HK$3,464.7 million (US$443.6 million), an increase of 13.6% from HK$3,049.0 million in 2022. Research and development expenses were HK$1,440.9 million (US$184.5 million), an increase of 17.9% from HK$1,222.1 million in 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in research and development headcount. Selling and marketing expenses were HK$710.3 million (US$90.9 million), a decrease of 20.7% from HK$895.8 million in 2022. The decrease was mainly due to slower paying client growth and lower customer acquisition costs. General and administrative expenses were HK$1,313.5 million (US$168.2 million), an increase of 41.1% from HK$931.1 million in 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in headcount for general and administrative personnel, especially in new markets. Income from Operations Income from operations increased by 40.3% to HK$5,007.5 million (US$641.1 million) from HK$3,568.9 million in 2022. Operating margin increased to 50.0% from 46.9% in 2022 primarily due to strong topline growth and operating leverage. Net Income Net income increased by 46.2% to HK$4,278.9 million (US$547.8 million) from HK$2,926.9 million in 2022. Non-GAAP adjusted net income increased by 45.9% to HK$4,569.8 million (US$585.1 million) from HK$3,131.4 million in 2022. Non-GAAP adjusted net income is defined as net income excluding share-based compensation expenses. For further information, see ""Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" at the bottom of this press release. Net Income per ADS Basic net income per American Depositary Share (“ADS”) was HK$31.00 (US$3.97), compared with HK$20.55 in 2022. Diluted net income per ADS was HK$30.59 (US$3.92), compared with HK$20.34 in 2022. Each ADS represents eight Class A ordinary shares. New Share Repurchase Program The Company announced its US$500 million share repurchase program in March 2022, and by 2023 year-end, the expiration date, the Company had repurchased an aggregate of 11 million ADSs with approximately US$365 million in open market transactions. In addition, the Company's board of directors has authorized a new share repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to US$500 million worth of its ADSs, until December 31, 2025. The Company plans to fund the repurchases from its existing cash balance. Under the new share repurchase program, Futu may repurchase its ADSs from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions, in block trades and/or through other legally permissible means, depending on market conditions and in accordance with applicable rules and regulations. Futu's board of directors will review the share repurchase program periodically, and may modify, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In evaluating the business, the Company considers and uses non-GAAP adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, as a supplemental measure to review and assess its operating performance. The presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company defines non-GAAP adjusted net income as net income excluding share-based compensation expenses. The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by the management to evaluate the operating performance and formulate business plans. Non-GAAP adjusted net income enables the management to assess the Company's operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses, which are non-cash charges. The Company also believes that the use of the non-GAAP measure facilitates investors' assessment of its operating performance. Non-GAAP adjusted net income is not defined under U.S. GAAP and is not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure has limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP adjusted net income is that it does not reflect all items of expense that affect the Company's operations. Share-based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be incurred in the business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP adjusted net income. Further, the non-GAAP measure may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. The Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measure to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. For more information on this non-GAAP financial measure, please see the table captioned ""Unaudited Reconciliations of Non-GAAP and GAAP Results"" set forth at the end of this press release.

SIMULIA fluid dynamics applications predict real-world conditions, aiding in noise reduction and design optimization. Eve Air Mobility's eVTOL production facility in Brazil is underway, with deliveries expected in 2026. Positive None. Negative None. Aerospace Engineer The collaboration between Dassault Systèmes and Embraer represents a significant advancement in the aerospace industry's approach to designing eVTOL aircraft. The use of SIMULIA PowerFLOW for fluid dynamics simulation is a testament to the industry's shift towards more sustainable and efficient design processes. By virtually testing propeller aerodynamics and aeroacoustics, engineers can iterate designs rapidly, reducing the need for costly physical prototypes and mitigating potential design flaws early in the development cycle.From an engineering perspective, the ability to predict real-world operating conditions is crucial for the success of eVTOLs in urban environments. Noise pollution is a critical concern and the emphasis on aeroacoustics simulation underscores the industry's commitment to minimizing the acoustic footprint of these new aircraft. Moreover, the human-centered design approach ensures that the comfort and safety of passengers and the surrounding community are prioritized.The move towards electrically powered aircraft aligns with global sustainability goals and could lead to a reduction in carbon emissions from the aerospace sector. However, the successful integration of eVTOLs into urban airspaces hinges on regulatory approval and public acceptance, which are influenced by factors such as noise levels and safety records. Market Research Analyst Embraer's strategic decision to partner with Dassault Systèmes for eVTOL development is likely to have a positive impact on their market positioning in the burgeoning Urban Air Mobility (UAM) sector. As traditional aerospace manufacturers face increasing competition from startups and technology companies in the eVTOL space, collaborations that leverage advanced simulation technologies can provide a competitive edge.The announcement of Eve's production facility in Brazil and the timeline for delivery and service commencement by 2026 offers investors and stakeholders a clear roadmap of Embraer's UAM initiatives. This transparency in progress can contribute to investor confidence, particularly as the UAM market is still in its nascent stages and carries significant investment risks.Given the potential of eVTOLs to disrupt the transportation industry, particularly in congested urban areas, Embraer's progress in this area could be a signal to investors of the company's long-term growth prospects. The emphasis on sustainability and noise reduction also aligns with increasing regulatory and consumer demand for environmentally friendly transportation solutions. Environmental Sustainability Analyst The integration of eVTOLs into urban transportation systems presents an opportunity to alleviate traffic congestion and reduce the environmental impact of commuting. Embraer's focus on electric propulsion in their eVTOL design is a significant step towards a more sustainable aviation future. By optimizing the aerodynamics and aeroacoustics of eVTOLs, the company is addressing two of the most pressing environmental concerns associated with urban air mobility: energy efficiency and noise pollution.While the environmental benefits of electrically powered aircraft are clear, the long-term sustainability of eVTOLs will depend on the sources of electricity used to charge their batteries. If the energy comes from renewable sources, the environmental impact will be substantially lower compared to traditional fossil fuel-powered aircraft. Additionally, the reduction in noise pollution is not only beneficial for urban inhabitants but also contributes to a higher quality of urban life.As urban air mobility evolves, it will be important to monitor the lifecycle environmental impact of these aircraft, including their manufacturing, operation and end-of-life disposal. The development of sustainable materials and recycling processes for eVTOLs will be crucial in ensuring that the industry's growth does not come at the expense of environmental health. 03/14/2024 - 02:00 AM Dassault Systèmes’ SIMULIA fluid dynamics simulation applications optimize eVTOL propeller aerodynamics and aeroacoustics Engineering team has been accurately performing virtual tests of real-world operating conditions VELIZY-VILLACOUBLAY, France--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Dassault Systèmes (Euronext Paris: FR0014003TT8, DSY.PA) and Embraer (NYSE: ERJ; B3: EMBR3) announced today that Dassault Systèmes’ simulation technology has been utilized to simulate, analyze and test virtually Eve Air Mobility’s (NYSE: EVEX) electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. Dassault Systèmes’ SIMULIA PowerFLOW application has provided robust and industry-proven fluid dynamics simulation to predict real-world operating conditions, allowing Embraer and Eve’s engineers to evaluate how the aircraft flies and test its sound emission. “One of the main advantages of eVTOL aircraft is that they are electrically powered and a more sustainable option than combustion-powered aircraft. However, they are meant to operate in urban areas, making noise reduction a key driver in their design. SIMULIA fluid dynamics applications will enable Embraer and Eve to experience and optimize the most critical parts of their eVTOL aircraft in a virtual environment,” said David Ziegler, Vice President, Aerospace & Defense Industry, Dassault Systèmes. Embraer and Eve have been working in collaborative efforts with global partners in line with the commitment to safely provide more reliable, affordable, sustainable, integrated and human-centric Urban Air Mobility (UAM) solutions. “Numerical validated models have demonstrated accuracy when compared with experimental results and have helped accelerate product definition,” said Micael Gianini, Interiors, Noise and Vibration Senior Manager at Embraer. “The human-centered design ensures the safety, accessibility, and comfort of passengers, the pilot, and the community by minimizing noise.” In July 2023, Embraer and Eve announced that Eve’s first eVTOL production facility will be located in the city of Taubaté, in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. The company has begun assembly of its first full-scale eVTOL prototype, which will be followed by a test campaign in 2024. Eve’s eVTOL is scheduled to begin deliveries and enter into service in 2026.

(“Mattr” or the “Company”) (TSX: MATR) reported today its operational and financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023. This press release should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Management Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) and audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 20221, which are available on the Company’s website and at www.sedarplus.com. “During the fourth quarter of 2023, Mattr continued to execute on its strategy to deliver long-term growth, margin expansion and volatility reduction, completing the sale of a substantial part of our legacy pipe coating business, which concludes our strategic review process and firmly positions the Company as a harsh-environment infrastructure products provider, delivering high-value solutions to customers as they expand and renew critical infrastructure around the world,” said Mike Reeves, President & CEO of Mattr. “In 2023, Mattr’s Continuing Operations delivered year-over-year Adjusted EBITDA growth of approximately 16%, with Adjusted EBITDA margin expanding by 140 basis points in the same period. This was accomplished while also completing a fundamental business transformation and despite unfavorable interest rates, slowing North American oilfield activity, US infrastructure permitting challenges and automotive sector labor disruption.” Highlights include1: Full year Continuing Operations revenue was $925.3 million and operating income from Continuing Operations was $81.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations was $165.1 million, a 16% increase compared to $141.8 million for full year 2022. The results from 2023 included $2.6 million of one-time costs associated with the Company’s North American manufacturing footprint Modernization, Expansion and Optimization (“MEO”) program, which encompasses the Company’s growth and efficiency improvement initiatives;The Company completed the sale of a substantial part of its Pipeline Performance Group (“PPG”) business, reported as Discontinued Operations, to Tenaris S.A. (“Tenaris”) on November 30, 2023, for a contractual purchase price of $225 million ($166 million USD), subject to a customary working capital adjustment, concluding the Company’s strategic review process. The Company currently anticipates receiving aggregate net cash proceeds of approximately $278.5 million, consisting of the cash provided to the Company by operating activities from Discontinued Operations between signing and closing of this transaction, plus the contractual purchase price, net of its aggregate transaction fees and expenses and the currently estimated working capital adjustment. The Company expects the parties to finalize the net working capital adjustment during the second quarter of 2024;As at December 31, 2023, the Company had total net cash of $334.1 million and a Net Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA2 ratio (using a trailing twelve-month consolidated Adjusted EBITDA2) of approximately (0.26) times;For the full year ended December 31, 2023, Consolidated Net Income was $87.2 million, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA was $388.0 million, fully diluted Consolidated EPS was $1.25 and fully diluted Adjusted Consolidated EPS was $3.43;Fourth quarter revenue generated by Continuing Operations was $210.8 million and fourth quarter operating income from Continuing Operations was $2.3 million. Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations was $32.8 million, a 21% decrease compared to fourth quarter of 2022. Fourth quarter 2023 results included $1.7 million of one-time costs associated with the Company’s MEO program and a non-cash impairment charge of $18.5 million associated with a production facility closure as discussed in further detail below;Composite Technologies segment fourth quarter revenue decreased by 19% to $112.5 million compared to $139.6 million in the prior year’s quarter. Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA for the Composite Technologies segment was $18.8 million, which included $1.5 million of one-time costs associated with the Company’s MEO program, decreased by 31% from prior year’s fourth quarter;Subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, and consistent with its MEO program, the Composite Technologies segment discontinued the production of fiberglass reinforced plastic (“FRP”) tanks within its Anaheim, California facility and took steps to exit the site, which is expected to be complete by year end. Once completed, this action is expected to lower annualized segment fixed costs in its Composite Technologies segment by approximately $2.5 million, elevate overall production footprint efficiency and substantially lower its exposure to potential environmental, employment and other regulatory risks associated with business operations within the State of California. This action is not expected to alter previously shared revenue growth potential and related returns expectations tied to the segment’s MEO program. Consequently, the Company has reported a related non-cash impairment charge of $18.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2023 and expects to report a related non-recurring charge during the first quarter of 2024;Connection Technologies segment fourth quarter revenue increased by 4% to $79.0 million compared to $76.0 million in the prior year’s quarter. Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA for the Connection Technologies segment was $14.7 million, which included $0.2 million of one-time costs associated with the Company’s MEO program, was relatively flat compared to the fourth quarter of prior year;For the fourth quarter, Discontinued Operations generated revenue of $265.1 million, operating income of $105.4 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $104.9 million;On a total consolidated basis (consisting of both Continuing Operations and Discontinued Operations), for the fourth quarter Mattr reported Net Loss of $23.0 million, Adjusted EBITDA (“Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA”) of $137.7 million, fully diluted Earnings (Losses) Per Share (“Consolidated EPS”) of $(0.34) and fully diluted Adjusted Consolidated EPS of $1.51 during the fourth quarter;The Company generated $101.4 million in cash in the fourth quarter from operating activities from Continuing Operations and Discontinued Operations on a consolidated basis (“Consolidated Total Operating Activities”), compared to $163.0 million of cash generated from Consolidated Total Operating Activities during the fourth quarter of 2022, while investing approximately $19 million under the 2023 portion of its previously announced capital investment program to support longer-term growth in its Composite and Connection Technologies segments;A net repayment of $30.0 million was made on the Credit Facility (as defined herein) bringing the outstanding balance to zero;The Company remained active under its normal course issuer bid (“NCIB”) repurchasing 2.9 million of its common shares during the fourth quarter for an aggregate repurchase price of $41.9 million and completing the maximum number of repurchases of common shares permitted under its current NCIB, which is eligible for renewal starting in June 2024; andSubsequent to the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company was renamed to Mattr Corp. and changed its US OTC ticker symbol from SAWLF to MTTRF. 1 The Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, report Continuing Operations as the Company’s Composite Technologies and Connection Technologies reporting segments and Discontinued Operations as the Company’s PPS reporting segment. Total consolidated figures include figures from both Continuing Operations and Discontinued Operations. 2 Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP measures.

See Section 5.0 – Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures for further details and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures. Mr. Reeves continued, “Each of our continuing operating segments achieved new record annual revenue and annual Adjusted EBITDA results for 2023. Connection Technologies delivered its largest ever premium wire and cable order and significantly expanded its US infrastructure market participation, while Composite Technologies increased fuel storage tank revenue by over 7%, reached a new annual water products revenue record and saw larger diameter Flexpipe® product revenue rise by nearly 70% versus the prior year. In parallel, the Company repurchased over 4.4 million shares during 2023 and deployed nearly $76.3 million of organic growth capital, with four substantial, high return, North American production facility additions remaining on-time, on-budget and scheduled for first production between mid-2024 and early 2025. In these last twelve months the employees of Mattr have achieved a long list of extraordinary outcomes and have done so while setting a new safety performance record. I could not be prouder of this organization and the many talented, creative and committed people who work here.” “During the fourth quarter of 2023, our ongoing actions to lower fixed costs and enhance production efficiency enabled Continuing Operations to maintain Adjusted EBITDA margins1 in excess of 15%, as Connection Technologies delivered year-over-year revenue growth, partially offsetting the previously anticipated impacts of lower North American onshore oilfield activity and temporarily reduced fuel tank production and shipment activity, both of which weighed on our Composite Technologies segment.” “Notwithstanding its sale at the end of November, our Discontinued Operations delivered substantial revenue growth, both year-over-year and on a sequential basis, driven by continued strong operational execution on the Southeast Gateway Pipeline (“SGP”) project and around the world, a testament to the capabilities and professionalism of the entire pipe coating organization.” Mr. Reeves concluded, “Entering 2024, normal seasonality combined with flat early-year North American oilfield activity is anticipated to cause Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of the year to be modestly below the fourth quarter of 2023, before an expected significant upwards shift in the second quarter of 2024.” “Our businesses serve large and growing end markets, we have a robust balance sheet, significant opportunities for investment in high return organic growth and the capacity to seek and complete meaningful, accretive acquisitions. Consequently, management believes Mattr is well positioned to deliver substantial value creation for shareholders over the coming years. While we will be impacted by one-time costs tied to our North American production footprint MEO activities during 2024, we believe that full year 2024 revenue and underlying profitability will be higher than 2023, and that our Company is poised to meet our stated growth, profitability and free-cash-flow conversion objectives in the years that follow.” Selected Financial Highlights (in thousands of Canadian dollars, except per share amounts and percentages)Three Months EndedYear Ended December 31December 31 2023 2022 2023 2022 $%$%$%$% Revenue210,767 225,751 925,271 861,786 Gross profit65,873 31%69,551 31%296,43932%258,230 30% Income from Continuing Operations(a)2,319 1%12,383 5%81,5429%110,971 13% Net Income from Continuing Operations2,336 13,489 55,859 93,347 Net (Loss) Income from Discontinued Operations(25,342) (80,299) 31,360 (124,323) Net (Loss) Income for the period(23,006) (66,810) 87,219 (30,976) (Loss) Earnings per share: Basic (0.34) (0.94) 1.26 (0.43) Diluted(0.34) (0.94) 1.25 (0.43) Adjusted EBITDA from ContinuingOperations (b) (c)32,787 16%41,413 18%165,07818%141,823 16% Adjusted EBITDA from Discontinued Operations(b) (c)104,933 40%15,044 13%222,88427%9,910 3% Total Adjusted EBITDA from Operations (b) (c)137,720 29%56,457 16%387,96222%151,733 12% Total Adjusted EPS from Operations: (b) Basic1.52 0.44 3.46 1.01 Diluted1.51 0.43 3.43 1.01 (a)Operating income for the three months ended December 31, 2023, includes $18.5 million impairment charges, $1.7 million gain on sale of land and other and $2.5 million restructuring costs and other, net; while operating income for the three months ended December 31, 2022, includes no gain on sale of land and other, $2.2 million in impairment charges and $4.1 million in restructuring costs and other, net.

The amounts presented above reflect restated figures for all prior periods to align with the current presentation. 1.0 FOURTH QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS The fourth quarter of 2023 saw the Company’s Composite Technologies segment revenue and Adjusted EBITDA decrease compared to the same quarter of 2022, as the segment navigated sequentially lower average North American oilfield activity, normal seasonal slowing of underground storage tank installation activity and the first of two quarters of lowered underground fuel tank production in response to transient customer permitting challenges encountered earlier in 2023. The segment also sold its Oilfield Asset Management (“OAM”) business during Q4 2022 and therefore the Q4 2023 results did not reflect any contributions from the OAM business line. In parallel, the Company’s Connection Technologies segment delivered fourth quarter revenue and Adjusted EBITDA similar to the same quarter of 2022, with sales growth in North American infrastructure markets offsetting continued slowness in the Canadian distribution sector and US automotive labor disruption effects. The Company delivered operating income from Continuing Operations of $2.3 million and Adjusted EBITDA1 from Continuing Operations of $32.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease of $10.1 million and $8.6 million, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Operating income from Continuing Operations in the fourth quarter included impairment charges of $18.5 million booked in connection with the closure of the Xerxes®’ Anaheim manufacturing facility and restructuring costs of $2.5 million, whereas the comparable period for the prior year included $2.1 million of impairment charges and $4.1 million of restructuring costs. Additionally, share-based incentive compensation of $2.1 million was recorded against operating income from Continuing Operations during the fourth quarter of 2023, while operating income from Continuing Operations in the prior year’s fourth quarter included a $12.9 million share-based incentive compensation expense. The Company continued to execute on its portfolio optimization strategy during the fourth quarter. On November 30, 2023, the Company completed the sale of its PPG pipe coating business to Tenaris. The Company has received gross proceeds of $241.2 million (USD $177.6 million) which include the agreed-upon purchase price of $225.4 million (USD$166 million) and initial working capital adjustments. The final net cash proceeds received by the Company in satisfaction of the contractual purchase price for the sale of the PPG business remains subject to completion of a customary final true up of the estimated working capital calculation as provided in the definitive purchase and sale agreement in respect of the transaction. The Company expects the parties to finalize the net working capital adjustment during the second quarter of 2024 and the Company currently anticipates its net cash outflow to settle the working capital adjustment will be approximately $32.0 million. The completion of this transaction concludes the Company’s previously announced strategic review and portfolio transformation process. As at December 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents totaling $334.1 million, an increase from the $98.0 million as at September 30, 2023 (December 31, 2022 – $264.0 million). The increase in cash compared to the third quarter of 2023 was largely attributable to $241.2 million of gross sale proceeds received from the sale of PPG and $101.4 million of cash provided by consolidated operating activities (including Discontinued Operations). This was offset by (i) repayment of $30.0 million of the Company’s syndicated credit facility (the “Credit Facility”), (ii) an aggregate of $41 million of share acquisitions under the Company’s NCIB in the fourth quarter of 2023, (iii) $18.8 million of growth and maintenance capital expenditures for its Continuing Operations and (iv) $6.6 million spent on repayment of lease liabilities during the fourth quarter of 2023. Since the beginning of 2021 and up to December 31, 2023, the Company has repaid $291.5 million against the Credit Facility. The Company will continue to focus on maximizing the conversion of operating income into cash, optimizing its capital structure, investing in organic and inorganic growth opportunities, and enhancing shareholder value. 1 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EPS, and net debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures.

See Section 5.0 – Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures for further details on the changes in composition for Adjusted EBITDA. The amounts presented above reflect restated figures for all prior periods to align with the current presentation. Composite Technologies segment revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $112.5 million, a decrease of $27.1 million, or 19.4%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Operating loss in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $4.4 million compared to operating income of $15.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The segment's 2023 fourth quarter results included air permit and equipment non-cash impairment charges of $18.5 million booked in connection with the closure of the Xerxes®’ Anaheim manufacturing facility. Excluding impacts from the OAM business (which was sold in November 2022 and generated no revenue or operating income in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to revenue of $6.2 million and operating income of $0.2 million in the comparative period), the impact of the previously discussed impairment charge and the impact of $1.5 million in MEO costs associated with the establishment of the segment’s two new North American production sites during the period (no MEO costs were incurred during the prior year period), the segment's revenue decreased by $21 million and the operating income increased by $0.6 million. Excluding the impacts discussed above, the decrease in revenue was mostly attributable to lower demand for the Company’s Flexpipe® product line due to lower drilling and completion activity levels by North American oil and gas operators, and lower production and shipment of FRP tanks due to normal seasonal slowing in project execution compounded by the lingering impact of customer permitting delays experienced earlier in 2023. Despite these revenue reducing factors, the segment continued to optimize its cost base and delivered growth over the comparable period in sales of its large diameter Flexpipe® products and established a new quarterly revenue record for its Xerxes® stormwater product line. Adjusted EBITDA1 in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $18.8 million, a decrease of $8.5 million compared to $27.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The Connection Technologies segment delivered revenue of $79 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 which was an increase of $2.9 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. This was primarily driven by an increase in wire and cable product shipments into infrastructure applications in North America. Its operating income in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $11.8 million, a modest increase from $11.6 million reported in the prior year period. The segment incurred MEO costs of approximately $0.2 million associated with the relocation of its North American footprint during the quarter. The segment delivered Adjusted EBITDA1 of $14.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2023, a 1.2% increase versus the prior year quarter. Discontinued Operations, which consists of the businesses formerly reported under the PPS segment (excluding the entities not within the perimeter of the transaction with Tenaris), generated revenue of $265.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, representing an increase of 121.5% versus the same quarter of 2022. Operating income in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $105.4 million which represented an increase of $106.7 million versus the fourth quarter of 2022 operating loss of $1.4 million. This significant increase was a result of strong performance in pipe coating facilities across all regions, bolstered by 2 full months of coating activity within the SGP project. Discontinued Operations generated $104.9 million of Adjusted EBITDA1 in the fourth quarter of 2023, a substantial increase from the $15 million reported in the prior year’s fourth quarter. Execution efficiency and favourable revenue mix resulted in Adjusted EBITDA margins1 of 39.6% during the quarter, compared to a 12.6% Adjusted EBITDA margin1 in the prior year’s fourth quarter. The Company has recognized a $105.0 million loss on the sale of PPG to Tenaris in Discontinued Operations in the consolidated statements of income (loss). The loss includes a non-cash Cumulative Translation Adjustment of $13.0 million that reflects the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the sold business. The PPG business, which has historically comprised the vast majority of the Company’s bid and budgetary estimates and total order backlog, was sold in November 2023 and as a result the Company will no longer report these supplementary financial measures as the Company does not believe that going forward such measures will provide investors with useful information to understand or evaluate the Company’s Continuing Operations or its respective performance and prospects. 2.0 OUTLOOK The Company expects to experience a modest sequential increase in consolidated revenue within its Continuing Operations during the first quarter of 2024, driven by broadly higher activity levels in its Connection Technologies segment and higher sales of composite pipe products into international markets within the Composite Technologies segment, partially offset by lower production and shipment of FRP tanks and lower pipe coating activity within its Brazilian operations. The Composite Technologies segment’s first quarter revenue outlook is primarily driven by expectations that North American onshore drilling and completion activity levels, and therefore North American demand for Flexpipe® products, will be similar to those observed during the fourth quarter of 2023, while shipments of Flexpipe® products to support international projects will move sequentially up. This is coupled with the normal seasonal low point for FRP tank installation activity as unfavorable weather and ground conditions are experienced across much of North America. The first quarter of 2024 is also anticipated to see the segment continue to limit FRP tank production activity to control customer-owned inventory levels which elevated over the course of 2023 in the face of permitting delay issues faced by some North American customers. This is the last quarter in which the Company anticipates this action will be necessary, as most customers have adapted their permit application strategies and are indicating greater confidence that permits will be available for projects in 2024 and beyond. First quarter revenue outlook within the Connection Technologies segment is primarily driven by expected sequential strengthening of demand within North American industrial and infrastructure markets. Despite an expectation of modest favorable movement in revenue generation in the first quarter of 2024, the Company anticipates some margin compression as a result of its MEO activities and the specific mix of product sales. During the second quarter of 2023, the Company detailed several planned 2023 and 2024 capital investments into high-return growth and efficiency improvement opportunities in both segments. These investments and other MEO activities, which are currently progressing on time and on budget, include: The addition of two new manufacturing facilities and elimination of one aging manufacturing facility within its Composite Technologies network, namely: a new Xerxes® FRP tank production site in Blythewood, South Carolina that is expected to commence production in mid-2024; anda new Flexpipe® composite pipe production site in Rockwall, Texas that is expected to commence production in mid-2024; andthe shut-down and exit of a Xerxes® FRP tank production site in Anaheim, California that is expected to be largely complete by the end of 2024. The replacement of its Rexdale, Canada facility and expansion of its Connection Technologies’ North American manufacturing footprint via: a new heat-shrink tubing production site in Fairfield, Ohio that is expected to commence production in late 2024; anda new wire and cable production site in Vaughan, Ontario that is expected to commence production in late 2024. The Company expects to continue to make sizeable organic investments throughout 2024 to modernize, expand capacity in targeted geographies and improve efficiency within the North American production network of its Composite Technologies and Connection Technologies segments. Given the anticipated timing of these MEO actions, the Company continues to expect to recognize meaningful MEO costs throughout 2024, with these costs weighted towards optimization and growth activities within the Composite Technologies segment during the first half of 2024 and weighted towards the modernization and growth activities within the Connection Technologies segment during the second half of 2024. In aggregate, once completed, these planned investments are expected to result in the Company creating at least $150 million per year of incremental revenue generating capacity with comparable margins to those realized in its Composite Technologies and Connection Technologies segments. These levels of output are expected to be realized over the 3–5 year period following completion, as the facilities reach efficient utilization levels in accordance with their currently expected timelines. The Company does not expect the recently announced shut-down of the Xerxes production site in Anaheim, California, to alter the output expectations. In management’s view, the underlying mid and long-term market trends for all of Mattr’s core businesses remain favourable. Despite elevated interest rates, demand for products in support of critical infrastructure renewal and expansion is expected to remain robust; its fuel tank customers have made adjustments to accommodate elongated permitting timelines which are anticipated to result in a return to more normal FRP tank shipment patterns during the second quarter of 2024; and anticipated stable oil and gas commodity prices combined with a new annual capital spending cycle for North American oil and gas producers is expected to provide opportunities for market share gains by the Company’s Flexpipe® business, particularly within its recently commercialized larger diameter product portfolio, moving through the year. More broadly, management expects that demand for its differentiated products designed to withstand harsh environments will continue to rise in the coming years as a result of the global need to renew and expand critical infrastructure, including energy generation and distribution, electrification, transportation network enhancement and storm water management. The Company continues to closely monitor raw material and labour costs and accordingly, will continue to ensure its pricing appropriately reflects the value of its products and its cost inputs. The Company continues to take an “all of the above” approach to capital allocation, skewed towards investment in organic and inorganic acquisition and investment opportunities viewed as having the highest risk-adjusted return on investment potential. With substantial capacity to deploy capital and the expectation to deploy available capital over the next several quarters, the Company continues to elevate focus on inorganic opportunities, including opportunities of meaningful scale, particularly related to differentiated wire & cable sectors and water products, where long-term tailwinds are expected. The Company remains focused on ensuring any capital investments provide superior returns (both near and long-term) to shareholders in light of all available options, including the return of capital to shareholders. We expect to apply to renew our NCIB and continue to repurchase the Company’s common shares on an opportunistic basis. Opportunities also exist to further enhance the Company’s organic growth trajectory. 1 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margins and net debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP measures do not have standardized meanings under GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures provided by other companies. See “Section 5.0 – Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” for further details and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures. Adjusted EBITDA is adjusted for all periods presented as the Company updated this non-GAAP measure in the first quarter of 2023 to include adjustments for share-based incentive compensation cost and foreign exchange (gain) loss. See “Section 5.0 – Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” for further details on the changes in composition of Adjusted EBITDA. The amounts presented above reflect restated figures for all prior periods to align with the current presentation. The Company expects the current calculation methodology of Adjusted EBITDA to be consistently applied in future periods. Composite Technologies Segment While the Company anticipates continued year-over-year expansion of its stormwater products business, Composite Technologies segment performance in the first half of 2024 will largely be driven by three factors: production and shipment of FRP tanks into North American fuel station applications; baseline volumes of Flexpipe® product consumption driven by North American oilfield activity levels; and continued market share gains by the Company’s larger diameter Flexpipe® products in North America and internationally. Production and shipment of Xerxes® FRP tanks will be at their seasonal low point during the first quarter, as weather and ground conditions across much of North America remain largely unfavorable to fuel station construction activities, before normal seasonal construction activity rises in the second quarter of 2024. The first quarter of 2024 is also anticipated to see the segment continue to limit FRP tank production activity to control customer owned FRP tank inventory levels, which elevated over the course of 2023 in the face of permitting delay issues faced by some North American customers. This is the last quarter in which the Company anticipates this action will be necessary, as most customers have adapted their permit application strategies and are indicating greater confidence that permits will be available for projects in 2024 and beyond. Consequently, the Company anticipates a substantial increase in FRP tank production and shipments in the second quarter of 2024, and currently expects full year 2024 Xerxes® revenues to expand compared to 2023. The Company anticipates North American onshore oil and gas drilling and completion activity will remain relatively flat throughout the first half of 2024, as generally stable commodity prices and the favorable impact of new calendar year customer capital budgets are offset by broad, large-scale, customer consolidation events which typically result in temporarily lower activity levels within the impacted organizations. Normal seasonality effects are expected to occur, with robust first quarter Canadian oilfield activity anticipated to move lower in the second quarter of 2024, due to weather and ground conditions, while US completion activity is anticipated to move higher in the second quarter, as weather and ground conditions become more favorable. The Company currently anticipates a substantial increase in North American Flexpipe® revenue moving from the first quarter to the second quarter of 2024, as continued adoption of its recently commercialized larger diameter products enhance normal seasonal cycles. Overlaying North American oilfield trends, the Company has been successful in securing multiple Flexpipe® orders, including larger diameter product orders, for delivery into international projects during the first half of 2024, and expects these deliveries to enhance first quarter and, more substantially, second quarter performance. The Company currently anticipates full year 2024 Flexpipe® revenues to expand compared to 2023. The segment continues to execute the establishment of two new US production sites, with its Rockwall, Texas Flexpipe® and Blythewood, South Carolina Xerxes® facilities progressing on-time and on-budget. First production is expected from both sites during the third quarter of 2024. In addition, the segment has taken steps to lower its fixed cost and operating risk base by ceasing production of FRP tanks from its aging Anaheim, California facility, and will fully exit the site by year end. In combination, the actions taken to modernize, expand and optimize the segment’s North American production footprint are expected to lower average production costs, increase total production capacity and position the segment to deliver meaningful growth and margin expansion in subsequent years. The Company continues to expect MEO costs will lower segment EBITDA margins during the first half of 2024. The Company expects that there will be sufficient incremental revenues from these new facilities to absorb incremental fixed costs during the ramp up periods, and both new facilities have sufficient physical space to enable further production line additions in future years. The segment continues to closely monitor raw material and labour costs and, as a result, will continue to ensure its pricing appropriately reflects the value of its products and its cost inputs. Connection Technologies Segment The Company is expecting demand for its Connection Technologies segment products to rise in the first quarter of 2024 to levels similar to those observed in the prior year’s quarter, despite the non-recurrence of a large aerospace wire and cable order which favorably impacted Q1-2023 results, before moving further upwards in the second quarter of 2024. Profitability in the first and second quarters is expected to be modestly impacted by one-time costs associated with the Company’s MEO activities, although the majority of MEO costs for the segment are expected to be recognized during the second half of 2024. The Company continues to monitor recessionary concerns and broad supply chain impacts. Its outlook does not incorporate any expectation of meaningful growth in total global vehicle output within the automotive end markets, which represented approximately 29% of the segment’s revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023. The Company does not anticipate any material impact from the continuing stabilization of EV demand and production. Despite the macroeconomic backdrop, demand for the Company’s automotive products is expected to continue to outpace overall automotive production as a result of electronic content growth in premium, hybrid and full electric vehicle markets, particularly in the Asia Pacific and Europe, Middle East and Africa regions. The Company is expecting to benefit from continued infrastructure spending in 2024 and beyond as new and upgraded utility and communication networks are constructed, nuclear refurbishments continue in Canada, and federal stimulus package impacts persist. The segment continues to execute the establishment of two new production sites, with its Vaughan, Ontario and Fairfield, Ohio facilities progressing on-time and on-budget. First production from both sites is expected during the second half of 2024. The Company expects that there will be sufficient incremental revenues from these new facilities to absorb incremental fixed costs during the ramp up periods, and both new facilities have sufficient physical space to enable further production line additions in future years. The segment continues to closely monitor raw material and labour costs, particularly copper, and, as a result, will continue to ensure its pricing appropriately reflects the value of its products and its cost inputs. Strategic Review Update On November 30, 2023, the Company completed the sale of its PPG operating unit, a substantial part of its legacy pipe coating business, which concluded its strategic review process that was initially announced on September 12, 2022 (the “Strategic Review”) to review strategic alternatives for its PPG, SPS, and OAM operating units. Pursuant to the Strategic Review, the Company considered and explored a range of options for each of these operating units, including the sale of such units. To date, the Strategic Review process (including the sale of a non-material business unit preceding the formal launch of the Strategic Review) has resulted in the successful completion of the following: the sale of its Lake Superior Consulting business (which formed part of what was previously the PPS segment) in September 2022;the sale of its OAM business (which formed part of the Composite Technologies segment) in November 2022;the sale of its Socotherm subsidiary (which formed part of what was previously the PPS segment) in December 2022;the sale of its specialty pipe coating facility in Ellon, Scotland (which formed part of what was previously the PPS segment) in the second quarter of 2023;the sale of its SPS business (which formed part of what was previously the PPS segment) at the end of May 2023;the sale of its facility in Pozzallo, Italy (which formed part of what was previously the PPS segment) in fourth quarter of 2023;the sale of one of its real estate assets in western Canada; andthe sale of the substantial majority of its PPG operating unit (which formed the majority of what was previously the PPS segment), at the end of November 2023. In connection with the Strategic Review, the Company announced its official re-brand to “Mattr” in June 2023, and then completed its legal name change from “Shawcor Ltd” to “Mattr Corp” in January 2024, reflecting its transformation from an energy services organization to a material technologies company providing differentiated, high-performance products to critical infrastructure markets around the world. During the fourth quarter and prior to the completion of its sale to Tenaris in November of 2023, the PPG business generated significant revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and cash from operating activities for the Company. The Company benefitted from this significant generation of cash, but consequently this has resulted in the incurrence of related income tax and other liabilities for the PPG business which will require settlement with Tenaris as part of a customary working capital adjustment process. As such, the final net cash proceeds received by the Company in satisfaction of the contractual purchase price for the sale of the PPG business remains subject to completion of a customary final true up of the estimated working capital calculation as provided in the definitive purchase and sale agreement in respect of the transaction. The Company expects the parties to finalize the net working capital adjustment during the second quarter of 2024 and the Company currently anticipates its net cash outflow to settle the working capital adjustment will be approximately $32.0 million. The Company continues to explore options to divest of its Brazilian pipe coating operations (“Thermotite”), formerly part of the PPG operating unit, which was excluded from the perimeter of the transaction completed in November of 2023. While the Company does not anticipate Thermotite’s financial results to be material to the organization, the business is fully booked throughout 2024 and is expected to deliver increased full year 2024 financial performance when compared to 2023. The Company remains committed to divest of this entity and considers its Strategic Review to be substantially complete. 3.0 CONFERENCE CALL AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Mattr will be hosting a Shareholder and Analyst Conference Call and Webcast on Thursday, March 14th, 2024 at 9:00 AM ET, which will discuss the Company’s Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results.

These non-GAAP measures do not have standardized meanings under IFRS and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures provided by other companies. The Company discloses these measures because it believes that they provide further information and assist readers in understanding the results of the Company’s operations and financial position. These measures should not be considered in isolation or used in substitution for other measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following is a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures reported by the Company. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA In an effort to reduce the volatility of the Adjusted EBITDA metric imposed by factors outside of the Company’s control and to provide enhanced comparability of the Company’s results from its principal business activities with those of the Company’s peer group, the Company has modified the composition of Adjusted EBITDA. Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, Adjusted EBITDA includes adjustments for share-based incentive compensation costs and foreign exchange (gains) losses. Share-based incentive compensation costs have recently experienced a high degree of volatility derived from movements in the market value of the Company’s shares and the related impact on such plans. Given the Company’s global presence and its exposure to several foreign currency rates, the Company experiences fluctuation from foreign exchange gains or losses outside of its control. The Company believes this modified composition will present a more accurate representation of the Company’s results from principal business activities. The amounts presented below reflect restated figures for prior periods as needed to align with the updated definition. EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is also a non-GAAP measure defined as EBITDA adjusted for items which do not impact day to day operations. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding back to EBITDA the sum of impairments, costs associated with refinancing of long-term debt and credit facilities, gain on sale of land and other, gain on sale of investment in associates, gain on sale of operating unit, acquisition costs, restructuring costs, share-based incentive compensation cost, foreign exchange (gain) loss and other, net and hyperinflationary adjustments. The Company believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful supplemental measures that provide a meaningful indication of the Company’s results from principal business activities prior to the consideration of how these activities are financed or the tax impacts in various jurisdictions and for comparing its operating performance with the performance of other companies that have different financing, capital or tax structures. The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of EBITDA that excludes the impact of transactions that are outside the Company’s normal course of business or day to day operations. Adjusted EBITDA is used by many analysts as one of several important analytical tools to evaluate financial performance and is a key metric in business valuations. It is also considered important by lenders to the Company and is included in the financial covenants of the Credit Facility.

The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA margin is a useful supplemental measure that provides meaningful assessment of the business results of the Company and its Operating Segments from principal business activities excluding the impact of transactions that are outside of the Company’s normal course of business. See reconciliation above for the changes in composition of Adjusted EBITDA, as a result of which the applicable tables reflect restated figures for the prior year quarter to align with current presentation. Operating Margin Operating margin is defined as operating (loss) income divided by revenue and is a non-GAAP measure. The Company believes that operating margin is a useful supplemental measure that provides meaningful assessment of the business performance of the Company and its Operating Segments. The Company uses this measure as a key indicator of financial performance, operating efficiency and cost control based on volume of business generated. Adjusted Net Income (attributable to shareholders) Adjusted Net Income (attributable to shareholders) is a non-GAAP measure defined as Net Income (attributable to shareholders) adjusted for items which do not impact day to day operations. Adjusted Net Income (attributable to shareholders) is calculated by adding back to Net Income (attributable to shareholders) the after tax impact of the sum of impairments, costs associated with repayment of long-term debt and credit facilities, gain on sale of land and other, gain on sale of investment in associates, gain on sale of operating unit, acquisition costs, restructuring costs, share-based incentive compensation cost, foreign exchange (gain) loss and other, net and hyperinflationary adjustments. The Company believes that Adjusted Net Income (attributable to shareholders) is a useful supplemental measure that provides a meaningful indication of the Company’s results from principal business activities for comparing its operating performance with the performance of other companies that have different financing, capital or tax structures. Adjusted Earnings Per Share (“Adjusted EPS”) Adjusted EPS (basic) is a non-GAAP measure defined as Adjusted Net Income (attributable to shareholders) divided by the number of common shares outstanding. Adjusted EPS (diluted) is a non-GAAP measure defined as Adjusted Net Income (attributable to shareholders) divided by the number of common shares outstanding, further adjusted for potential dilutive impacts of outstanding securities which are convertible to common shares. The Company presents Adjusted EPS as a measure of Earning Per Share (“EPS”) that excludes the impact of transactions that are outside the Company’s normal course of business or day to day operations. Adjusted EPS indicates the amount of Adjusted Net Income the Company makes for each share of its stock and is used by many analysts as one of several important analytical tools to evaluate financial performance and is a key metric in business valuations.

The Company believes Total Net debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA is a useful supplementary measure to assess the borrowing capacity of the Company. Total Net debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA is used by many analysts as one of several important analytical tools to evaluate how long a company would need to operate at its current level to pay of all its debt. It is also considered important by credit rating agencies to determine the probability of a company defaulting on its debt.

(“Prospera” or the “Company”) (TSX.V: PEI, OTC: GXRFF, FRA: OF6B, OF6B.SG, OF6B.F, OF6B.BE). Prospera Energy Inc. (“PEI”) is pleased to announce a 508% increase to its proven developed producing reserve value of 27MM$, reflecting the success of PEI’s 2023 development program. In addition, the company’s proven plus probable (2P) reserve value increased by over 60MM$ to a total of 133MM$ – largely driven by the undeveloped reserve value increase from 58MM$ to $98MM$. PEI’s December 31, 2023, year-end reserves were independently assessed by InSite Petroleum Consultants Ltd. (“InSite”) in accordance with COGEH standards. The Insite report confirmed a current recovery rate of 9% (of 397 MMbbl discovered OOIP) using a combination of vertical and horizontal wells, primarily in core assets located in Southwest and West-Central Saskatchewan (>42,000 acres). PEI’s 2P reserve value only reflects a portion of the remaining recoverable reserves and does not include the development of the largest core property in Saskatchewan (282 MMbbl OOIP) that is scheduled to commence exploitation in 2024. Also, there have been no improved recovery method benefits applied to these fields to date, yet. These upcoming development and enhanced recovery methods are expected to provide substantial steady upside to PEI’s future reserves valuation. The 2023 Reserves Report demonstrates substantial upside for PEI, with highlights as follows: PDP reserves increased 508% from 4.4MM$ to 27.1MM$ at a discount rate of 10%.2P reserves increased by 60.8MM$ from 72.5MM$ to 133.3MM$ at a discount rate of 10%.Total proved and probable reserves value increased by 25% from 4,306 to 5,403 Mboe (97% liquids).The reserve life index increased by 6% from 28 to 30 years.PEI elected to apply modest price of 79$/bbl (WCS) for NPV estimation, allowing for substantial NPV appreciation if oil price sustains.2024 TPP F&D costs of $5.7/boe (4.3x recycle ratio).Net asset value per share: TP of $0.21 & TPP of $0.31 NI 51-101 Table 2.1.1The following table discloses, in the aggregate, the Corporation’s gross and net proved and probable reserves estimated using forecast prices and costs by product type. “Forecast prices and costs” means future prices and costs in the InSite Report that are generally accepted as being a reasonable outlook of the future or fixed or currently determinable future ,prices or costs to which the Corporation is bound.

Production & Development As per the Corporate Production Diagram (above) Prospera attained peaks rates of approximately 1,800 boepd in late December 2023. Additional production was shut-in to complete the drilling program. A combination of shut-in and new production from horizontal wells provided the capacity at an estimated 2,200 boepd. However, in January (as shown), the freezing weather conditions reduced existing production to an average of 900 boepd and curtailed shut-in and new well production. Compared to 2022, 2023 corporate production rebounded much quicker from these wintry weather conditions due to infrastructure improvements. Currently Prospera is producing 1,200 boepd with an additional 500 boepd to bring online. The success from PEI’s 2023 drilling program supports the 2024 robust development plan to drill vertical / directional / horizontal wells in the medium oil property and horizontals in the core Saskatchewan assets. Furthermore, PEI also has planned to pilot a pressure support scheme to further improve recovery. The 2024 development plan is to be funded through a combination of cash flow and non-dilutive credit facilities to be secured against the 27MM$ of PDP reserves value. PEI’s robust 2024 capital development and acquisition plan is to achieve a 2024 year-end exit target rate of 5,000 boepd. About ProsperaProspera Energy Inc. (TSX.V: PEI, OTC: GXRFF, FRA: OF6B) is a publicly traded energy company based in Western Canada, specializing in the exploration, development, and production of crude oil and natural gas. Prospera is primarily focused on optimizing hydrocarbon recovery from legacy fields through environmentally safe and efficient reservoir development methods and production practices. Prospera was restructured in the first quarter of 2021 to become profitable and in compliance with regulatory, environmental, municipal, landowner, and service stakeholders. The company is in the midst of a three-stage restructuring process aimed at prioritizing cost effective operations while appreciating production capacity and reducing liabilities. Prospera has completed the first phase by optimizing low hanging opportunities, attaining free cash flow, while bringing operation to safe operating condition, all while remaining compliant. Currently, Prospera is executing phase II of the restructuring process, the horizontal transformation intended to accelerate growth and capture the significant oil in place (400 million bbls). These horizontal wells allow PEI to reduce its environmental and surface footprint by eliminating the numerous vertical well leases along the lateral path. Phase III of Prospera’s corporate redevelopment strategy is to optimize recovery through EOR applications. Furthermore, Prospera will pursue its acquisition strategy to diversify its product mix and expand its core area. Its goal is to attain 50% light oil, 40% heavy oil and 10% gas. PEI continues to apply efforts to minimize its environmental footprint. Also, efforts to reduce and eventually eliminate emissions, alongside pursuing innovative ESG methods to enhance API quality, thereby achieving higher margins and eliminating the need for diluents.

These outcomes could potentially result in a positive impact on Oracle's revenue, as satisfied customers are likely to increase their investment in Oracle's cloud services and potentially attract new customers seeking similar benefits.Moreover, the integration with Oracle Fusion Accounting Hub suggests a strategic move to provide a more comprehensive solution, thereby increasing the value proposition of Oracle's offerings. This can be seen as an attempt to drive up the adoption rates of Oracle's ERP Analytics, which could enhance the company's competitive position in the cloud analytics market. Market Research Analyst Oracle's announcement aligns with the broader market trend of integrating AI and machine learning into business intelligence platforms. The market for AI in business analytics is rapidly growing and Oracle's move to enhance its Fusion Data Intelligence with new AI capabilities is strategic in maintaining relevance and competitiveness. By offering prebuilt AI models tailored for specific business functions, Oracle is reducing the barrier to entry for organizations that may lack the expertise to develop these capabilities in-house.The focus on predictive insights across various domains—finance, supply chain, HR and customer experience—indicates a deep understanding of the diverse needs of modern enterprises. As businesses increasingly demand real-time, actionable insights, Oracle's solution could gain traction, potentially influencing market dynamics by setting a new standard for integrated AI analytics solutions.Furthermore, the emphasis on prebuilt analytical models and managed data pipelines highlights the importance of ease of use and scalability, which are critical factors for businesses when selecting a cloud analytics provider. Oracle's enhancements could shift customer expectations in the industry, prompting competitors to accelerate similar integrations to meet market demands. Legal Expert One of the notable AI capabilities introduced is the model that surfaces hidden biases in hiring, internal mobility and compensation practices. This feature not only has the potential to improve HR processes but also addresses a growing legal and ethical concern within the business community regarding workplace discrimination. By providing tools to identify and mitigate such biases, Oracle is proactively contributing to the creation of more equitable workplaces.These enhancements could also have legal implications for Oracle's clients, as they may help in ensuring compliance with various regulations concerning fair hiring practices and equal pay. Companies using Oracle's AI-powered analytics could leverage this technology to demonstrate due diligence in their efforts to prevent discriminatory practices, which could be beneficial in the event of legal scrutiny.It is important for Oracle and its customers to ensure that the AI models themselves are free from biases and that their use complies with data privacy regulations. As AI becomes more integrated into business processes, the legal landscape will likely evolve and Oracle will need to continuously update its offerings to align with new regulatory requirements. 03/14/2024 - 04:00 AM New AI capabilities in Oracle Fusion Data Intelligence help improve decision-making and quickly turn insights into action LONDON, March 14, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Oracle CloudWorld -- Oracle today announced new artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities in Oracle Fusion Data Intelligence that will help Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications customers improve decision making by combining data-driven insights with intelligent actions.

Leaders prioritize cybersecurity, GenAI, and talent development. AI-centric customer experiences and innovation culture key to success. Financial institutions to increase cybersecurity investments by 28% in the next two years. Positive 75% of executives confident in tech transformation roadmap. Leaders prioritize cybersecurity, GenAI, and talent development. AI investments in customer interaction crucial for meaningful engagement. Financial institutions to increase cybersecurity investments by 28% in the next two years. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The insights from the Broadridge Financial Solutions study underscore a pivotal trend in the financial sector: the aggressive investment in technology and the intensifying competition for digital talent. The distinction between digital 'leaders' and 'non-leaders' is particularly noteworthy, as it suggests a widening digital maturity gap. This gap could have significant implications for market dynamics, potentially leading to shifts in competitive advantage and influencing investor sentiment towards companies that are perceived as either innovators or laggards in digital transformation.From a market perspective, the increased investment in cybersecurity and cloud platforms is a response to the growing threat landscape and the need for scalable infrastructure. The 28% projected increase in cybersecurity investment reflects the urgency of protecting digital assets, which could influence the performance and valuation of cybersecurity firms. The focus on AI, including GenAI, quantum computing and blockchain, indicates a shift towards more sophisticated technology solutions, which could foster new revenue streams and enhance operational efficiency for adopters.Moreover, the emphasis on customer-centric digital experiences driven by AI investments highlights a broader industry trend of leveraging technology to enhance client engagement and satisfaction. This could potentially lead to increased customer retention and acquisition, contributing to the top-line growth of financial institutions that successfully implement these technologies. Human Resources Expert The study's findings on the war for talent align with the broader narrative of a skills shortage in the technology sector, particularly in emerging technologies such as AI and blockchain. The disparity in digital skills and talent strategy between leaders (71%) and non-leaders (12%) is a critical factor that could impact the ability of firms to execute their digital transformation agendas. Firms with advanced digital talent strategies are likely to have a competitive edge in innovation and operational agility.As firms vie for top tech talent, the impact on human capital management and recruitment strategies will be profound. Companies that foster a culture of innovation and prioritize skills development are more likely to attract and retain the talent necessary for sustainable growth. This focus on human capital could have long-term benefits, such as increased productivity and innovation, which are essential for driving enterprise value and investor confidence. Cybersecurity Analyst The projected increase in cybersecurity investment reflects a strategic response to the heightened risk environment in the financial sector. As digital transformation accelerates, so does the attack surface for potential cyber threats. The prioritization of cybersecurity by executives not only affects internal security protocols but also shapes the expectations and selection criteria for third-party technology vendors.This trend has a dual impact: it drives demand for cybersecurity solutions, potentially benefiting providers in this space and it influences the operational risk profile of financial institutions. Investors may look favorably upon firms that demonstrate robust cybersecurity measures, as these are critical for maintaining trust and ensuring the continuity of digital services. The focus on cybersecurity as a top capability expected from technology vendors could also lead to industry-wide improvements in security standards, further shaping the competitive landscape. 03/14/2024 - 04:00 AM Firms pacing investments in core technologies and cyber while promise of GenAI and the war for talent becomes the next battleground NEW YORK, March 14, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- As the digital revolution accelerates, financial institutions are racing to create enterprise value by investing heavily through the economic cycle, according to a new study by Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (NYSE: BR). The study found that 75% of executives are confident in their tech transformation roadmap, but a digital maturity gap is growing between leaders and non-leaders. While more than two-thirds say they have made meaningful progress in modernizing their core IT platforms, organizations must make progress against multiple tech and talent frontiers as they grapple with new technologies like GenAI, rising cybersecurity challenges, and accelerating needs for seamless digital customer experiences. The 2024 Digital Transformation and Next-Gen Tech Study gauges the perspectives of 500 global C-suite and senior executives across the buy side and sell side, illuminating the forces driving the industry's technology modernization. The study categorized firms as digital ""leaders"" versus ""non-leaders,"" based on their advancement levels across ten essential aspects of digital transformation, including modernized core IT, the use of automation tools, innovation culture, data management, and digital customer experiences, among others. When it comes to areas of focus, more than 80% of all executives indicate that they are making the biggest day-to-day investments in cybersecurity technology and building an advanced IT cloud platform. Meanwhile the majority also expect to maintain or increase their investment in next-gen technologies like AI, quantum computing, crypto/digital assets, and blockchain over the next two years. ""It's no surprise that we are seeing significant momentum in the adoption of next-generation technology like GenAI from financial services firms looking to solve their most pressing business challenges, while they're also gaining measurable value from more established technologies including AI, blockchain, cloud and core infrastructure platforms,"" said Chris Perry, President of Broadridge. ""Focusing on the human aspect of digital transformation – attracting and retaining digital talent and fostering a culture of innovation – has proven to be just as critical to ensuring these initiatives succeed. Our study also revealed that firms with a decentralized approach to innovation are more likely to be leaders in transformation."" AI-Centric Customer Experiences Anticipated to Be the New Norm Personalized and seamless digital customer experiences have become an expectation in the financial services industry. In fact, 40% of respondents indicate that being customer obsessed with priorities deeply rooted in client needs is the top accelerator of digital transformation. Fueling many of these changes in the customer experience paradigm is AI. Seventy percent of leaders (52% overall) indicate that they are prioritizing their AI investments in customer interaction to fuel stronger and more meaningful customer engagement. When it comes to Generative AI, leaders are more likely to be making large or moderate investments in the technology (44%), more than twice the level of non-leaders. Despite the higher levels of investment by leaders, the lower cost of entry to deploy GenAI may allow non-leaders to get in on the action more easily, enabling them to catch up in their efforts to deploy the technology to both customer-focused and internal use cases. Focus on Talent and Culture for Innovation Initiatives to Succeed There have been significant IT advancements year-over year, however there is still work to be done in enterprise-wide skills development. Only 28% of all executives surveyed have reached the advanced stages of implementing a digital skills and talent strategy, a year-on-year increase of 4%. In addition to the technology aspects of transformation, digital leaders have not neglected the human side. Seventy-one percent of leaders have reached the advanced stages of implementing digital skills and talent strategy, compared with 12% of non-leaders. A further 85% say they have created an advanced innovation culture versus 24% of non-leaders. Cyber Risks are Still a Top Challenge As financial organizations accelerate digital customer experiences, they continue to put enormous effort into strengthening trust and security. Over the next two years, financial institutions plan to boost their investments in cybersecurity by 28% on average; impacting their internal security protocols, but also how they engage with third-party technology vendors. According to the study, cybersecurity is the top capability executives say they expect from their technology vendors, outpacing their ability to deliver projects on time and on budget and building next-generation technologies into their solutions. Executives also cited cybersecurity risks as the top challenge currently inhibiting the pace of digital transformation at their company. Tech executives, who often understand the risks of an insecure environment more than other senior leaders, tend to care more about cybersecurity than business executives. The full 2024 Digital Transformation and Next-Gen Tech Study can be found here. Methodology This Broadridge survey was conducted by ThoughtLab Group to understand how financial services companies are digitally transforming and adopting next-gen technologies. C-suite executives and their direct reports from 500 financial institutions globally on the buy side and sell side were surveyed, with fielding completed in Nov 2023. The total assets or AUM of companies in the sample ranged from $1 billion to over $250 billion. The study scored firms on a range of factors related to progress with digital transformation. Firms were then categorized as digital leaders or non-leaders in the Broadridge Digital Transformation Maturity Framework.

Pharming provided a revenue guidance of US$280 million – US$295 million for 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in total revenues by 19% to US$245.3 million for the full year 2023, with a notable 10% increase in RUCONEST® revenues, is a strong indicator of the company's growth trajectory. The introduction of Joenja® (leniolisib) and its subsequent uptake, with 81 patients on paid therapy in the U.S. and full year revenues of US$18.2 million, demonstrates the company's successful market penetration and diversification strategy. The overall increase in cash and marketable securities to US$215.0 million provides a cushion for future R&D investment and operational flexibility.Looking ahead, the 2024 revenue guidance of US$280 million – US$295 million, which represents 14% – 20% growth, suggests confidence in the continued demand for RUCONEST® and the expansion of leniolisib's market presence. This forecast could be a positive signal for investors, indicating sustainable growth potential. However, it is essential to monitor the progress of ongoing regulatory reviews and commercialization efforts in additional geographies, as they will be crucial in achieving this growth. The successful expansion of leniolisib for additional primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) could further drive long-term value creation. Medical Research Analyst The mention of leniolisib's development for activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS) in additional geographies and pediatric patients, as well as its indication expansion to other PIDs, is indicative of the company's commitment to address unmet medical needs in rare diseases. The APDS patient finding initiatives and VUS resolution are critical for increasing the patient base eligible for treatment, which could directly impact future revenues and market share.Moreover, the orphan drug designation (ODD) by Japan for leniolisib and the initiation of pediatric clinical trials are strategic moves to broaden the treatment's label and market reach. The company's engagement with regulatory authorities like the US FDA and EMA and its submissions for marketing authorization in various countries, reflect a proactive approach to securing approval in multiple markets, potentially leading to a diversified and stable revenue stream. Market Research Analyst The competitive landscape of the Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) market and the rare disease sector, in general, is highly specialized, with significant barriers to entry due to the complexity of drug development and the necessity for targeted patient finding strategies. Pharming's strong performance with RUCONEST® in the HAE market and its strategic initiatives to identify and diagnose APDS patients position it favorably within this niche market. The company's ability to grow its prescriber base and patient enrollments, despite the competitive environment, indicates effective marketing and sales strategies.Furthermore, the company's plans to develop leniolisib for additional PIDs based on the PI3Kδ signaling pathway showcase its intent to leverage its expertise and existing platforms to tap into new market segments. This could potentially lead to the creation of new revenue streams and increase the company's market share within the rare disease space. However, the success of these initiatives will depend on the outcomes of clinical trials and regulatory approvals, which are inherently uncertain and can impact market expectations. 03/14/2024 - 02:00 AM Full year 2023 total revenues increased by 19% to US$245.3 millionRecord fourth quarter RUCONEST® revenues of US$73.3 million resulted in a 10% increase in full year 2023 RUCONEST® revenues to US$227.1 millionStrong start to Joenja® (leniolisib) launch with 81 patients on paid therapy in the U.S. nine months following launch and full year 2023 revenues of US$18.2 millionOverall cash and marketable securities increased to US$215.0 million at the end of 2023 from US$208.7 million at the end of 2022 Progressed leniolisib development for APDS in additional geographies and for pediatric patients, and leniolisib indication expansion to primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) with immune dysregulation linked to PI3Kδ signaling2024 total revenue guidance of US$280 million – US$295 million (14% – 20% growth)Pharming to host a conference call today at 13:30 CET (8:30 am EDT) Leiden, The Netherlands, March 14, 2024: Pharming Group N.V. (“Pharming” or “the Company”) (Euronext Amsterdam: PHARM / Nasdaq: PHAR) presents its preliminary (unaudited) financial report for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2023. Chief Executive Officer, Sijmen de Vries commented: “We are pleased to have delivered an excellent year in which we transformed Pharming into a multi-product, commercial rare disease biopharmaceutical company. We grew RUCONEST® revenues by 10% in 2023. This demonstrates the continued need for, and importance of, RUCONEST® as a trusted cornerstone of treatment in the competitive HAE market. We launched Joenja® (leniolisib) for APDS in the U.S. in April 2023, shortly after FDA approval, and saw meaningful initial uptake for what is the first and only FDA approved treatment for APDS. We have identified and confirmed over 840 APDS patients in global markets, including over 200 in the U.S. We have started family genetic testing initiatives, important since the majority of APDS patients will have family members also afflicted with the disease. In addition we have commenced studies to determine which of more than 1,100 patients in the U.S., with inconclusive genetic testing results showing a variant of uncertain significance (VUS), have genetic variants that cause hyperactivity in the PI3Kẟ pathway and can, therefore, be classified as APDS disease causing. This allows for an important APDS diagnosis for these patients, who could potentially be eligible for and offered treatment with Joenja®. We also made strong progress preparing for the commercialization of leniolisib in key global markets. We have been receiving requests for individual treatment on a named patient basis, in markets outside of the U.S., and provided the first patients with leniolisib around year-end 2023. Numerous regulatory reviews are ongoing and we are preparing for commercialization in key global markets including Europe, the U.K., Japan, Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Canada. These results reflect Pharming’s dedication to developing and delivering therapies to unserved rare disease patients. Looking to 2024, we remain focused on our goals of identifying additional APDS patients globally, continuing the momentum for Joenja® revenue in the U.S., to obtaining regulatory approvals and bringing leniolisib to APDS patients in need of treatment in additional global markets and to further developing our rare disease pipeline and footprint. We are also seeking to significantly expand the leniolisib market opportunity and revenue growth by pursuing development of leniolisib for additional primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) beyond APDS, and have advanced plans to start a Phase 2 proof of concept clinical trial in PIDs with immune dysregulation linked to PI3Kẟ signaling.” Fourth quarter and full year 2023 highlights Commercialized assetsRUCONEST® marketed for the treatment of acute HAE attacks RUCONEST® performed strongly in the fourth quarter of 2023, with record revenues of US$73.3 million, a 34% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. RUCONEST® revenues for the full year 2023 were US$227.1 million, a 10% increase compared to 2022. The U.S. market contributed 97% of 2023 revenues, while the EU and Rest of World contributed 3%. The RUCONEST® revenue acceleration in the second half of 2023 can be attributed to strong performance in leading key revenue indicators in the U.S. including new physicians prescribing RUCONEST®, new patient enrollments including high frequency attack patients, and the total number of patients. We achieved over 70 RUCONEST® new patient enrollments for four quarters in a row. Total enrollments in 2023 were up 25% vs. 2022 and were a significant driver of the strong RUCONEST® revenue growth. We also increased the RUCONEST® physician prescriber base by 13% during the year, in many cases adding previously unknown HAE prescribers. Joenja® (leniolisib) marketed in the U.S. - the first and only approved disease modifying treatment for APDS Joenja® (leniolisib) received U.S. FDA approval in late March 2023 for the treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS) in patients 12 years of age and older, and first commercial shipments to patients took place in April 2023. During the nine months following launch, Pharming made strong and rapid progress transitioning known patients onto commercial therapy. Revenues increased to US$7.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, driven by the continued increase in patients on paid therapy, and revenues were US$18.2 million for 2023. As of December 31, 2023, we have 92 APDS patients enrolled in the U.S., of which 81 patients are on paid therapy. APDS patient finding Based on available literature, Pharming estimates APDS prevalence of 1.5 patients per million. Our U.S. and global APDS patient finding efforts progressed during the year and as of December 31, 2023, Pharming has identified over 840 diagnosed APDS patients of all ages in global markets, including over 200 patients in the U.S. Of the identified patients in the U.S., approximately 75% are 12 years of age or older, the majority of whom are currently eligible for treatment with Joenja®. Over 730 patients are in the U.S., Europe, the U.K., Japan, Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Canada, key markets for Pharming with estimated total prevalence of ~2000 APDS patients. Pharming advanced several initiatives during 2023 to diagnose additional APDS patients, including a sponsored genetic testing program in the U.S., partnerships with several genetic testing companies who undertake their own testing efforts and family testing programs. We have initiated a number of programs collaborating with clinicians and patients to aid in reducing the barriers and allowing the appropriate testing in families with APDS, to help identify family members of APDS patients who may also be affected by this disease. APDS is an inherited genetic disease and Pharming believes that many of the over 200 APDS patients already identified in the U.S. are likely to have family members who remain undiagnosed. APDS patient finding - Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS) resolution APDS is diagnosed based on clinical symptoms, assessment of immune cell function and genetic testing. For a patient to receive a definitive APDS diagnosis, a genetic test revealing a disease-causing (pathogenic or likely pathogenic) variant in either the PIK3CD or PIK3R1 genes is required. Patients with clinical symptoms compatible with APDS frequently receive inconclusive genetic variant test results, i.e. previously unseen variants in the PIK3CD or PIK3R1 genes. It is important to determine if these Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS) cause APDS. As of December 31, 2023, Pharming has identified more than 1,100 patients in the U.S. with a number of VUSs in the PIK3CD or PIK3R1 genes and is setting up validation studies with various laboratories to confirm which of these variants should be classified as APDS. As results become available, patients with validated variants could be diagnosed with APDS and, therefore, potentially be eligible for Joenja® treatment. Completion of these studies is expected during the fourth quarter of 2024. Leniolisib highlights - regulatory, clinical and commercial strategy updates Leniolisib for APDS Pharming made continued progress in the fourth quarter of 2023 on leniolisib regulatory filings for APDS patients 12 years of age and older in key global markets. In addition, Pharming progressed ongoing clinical trials to support regulatory filings for approval in Japan and pediatric label expansion in key global markets. Pharming’s strategy is to make leniolisib commercially available for APDS patients in additional key markets in Europe, U.K., Japan, Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Canada. Pharming intends to market leniolisib directly in most of these markets following regulatory approval. We currently have 96 patients on leniolisib therapy as part of an Expanded Access Program (compassionate use) or an ongoing clinical study. In addition, Pharming makes leniolisib available on a named patient basis to ensure that physicians can request leniolisib on behalf of individual patients living with APDS, who meet the eligibility criteria and receive local health authority authorization, in certain countries where leniolisib is not commercially available. European Economic Area (EEA) As part of the review process of the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for leniolisib for patients 12 years of age and older, Pharming submitted its response to the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) Day 180 list of outstanding issues (LoOI) in October 2023. In November 2023, Pharming received a Day 180 Second LoOI from the CHMP. The CHMP consulted an Ad-Hoc Expert Group (AEG) at a meeting held at the end of November. Pharming is working closely with the CHMP to address the remaining outstanding issues and we are now awaiting CHMP’s opinion on the leniolisib MAA. United Kingdom In November 2023, Pharming announced its intention to file an MAA with the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) through the International Recognition Procedure (IRP) which replaced the European Commission Decision Recognition Procedure (ECDRP) from January 1, 2024. Pharming submitted an MAA for leniolisib on the basis of the US FDA approval on March 12, 2024. Japan clinical trial In May 2023, leniolisib was granted orphan drug designation (ODD) by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan (MHLW) for the treatment of APDS. In August 2023, Pharming announced that the first patient was enrolled in a Phase III clinical trial in Japan evaluating leniolisib for the treatment of APDS in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Patient enrollment in this study is now complete. The single-arm, open-label clinical trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of leniolisib in three patients, 12 years of age and older, who have a confirmed APDS diagnosis. The study’s primary efficacy endpoints and secondary endpoints mirror those used to evaluate the clinical outcomes of the earlier leniolisib APDS trials. Pharming plans to file an application for the approval of leniolisib with Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), following completion of the appropriate clinical trials. An approval decision would be expected in nine months based on priority review of the application due to ODD. Eligible patients enrolled in the trial will continue to receive the investigational drug for at least an additional year through an open-label extension trial. Additional markets Pharming filed regulatory submissions in Canada and Australia in the third quarter of 2023, and Israel in the second quarter. These submissions are progressing as expected and we anticipate regulatory action in 2024 for Canada, Australia, and Israel. Pediatric clinical trials In 2023, Pharming initiated two pediatric clinical trials, for children ages 4 to 11 and ages 1 to 6 years old, at sites in the U.S., Japan, and the EU. The single-arm, open-label, multinational clinical trials will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of leniolisib in 15 children, per clinical trial, who have a confirmed APDS diagnosis. The primary efficacy endpoints and secondary endpoints of the studies mirror those used to evaluate the clinical outcomes in the previous leniolisib Phase II/III APDS trials for patients aged 12 and older. Pharming is nearing completion of enrollment in the clinical trial for children ages 4 to 11 years old. In November 2023, the first patient was dosed in the clinical trial for children ages 1 to 6 years old. Enrollment in the study is continuing as planned. Leniolisib for additional indications (PI3Kδ platform) - Primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) beyond APDS As we continue to work towards regulatory approvals of leniolisib for APDS in additional geographies and pediatric label expansion, we have also commenced work to identify and prioritize other indications where leniolisib has the potential to deliver value for patients. PI3Kδ has been identified as an important player in a variety of disease states, and leniolisib has demonstrated an attractive, long-term efficacy, safety and tolerability profile in clinical trials conducted in both healthy volunteers and APDS patients. This provides a solid basis for our plans for the investigation and investment in further leniolisib indications. In December 2023, Pharming announced the expansion of its rare disease pipeline with plans to develop leniolisib for additional primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) with greater prevalence than APDS. Pharming has engaged with and received feedback from the US FDA on its plans to develop leniolisib for PID disorders with immune dysregulation. Primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) with immune dysregulation Leniolisib, by reducing PI3Kδ activity, could help rebalance immune dysregulation in PIDs, positively impacting clinical manifestations including lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity. Pharming is now in the final stages of preparation for the start of an initial Phase 2, proof of concept, clinical trial in targeted PID genetic disorders with immune dysregulation linked to PI3Kẟ signaling in lymphocytes, with similar clinical phenotypes and unmet medical need to APDS. These PID disorders include ALPS-FAS, CTLA4 haploinsufficiency and PTEN deficiency. The epidemiology of these targeted PID genetic disorders suggests a prevalence of approximately five patients per million. The Phase 2 clinical trial is a single arm, open-label, dose range-finding study to be conducted in approximately 12 patients. The objectives for the trial will be to assess safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and explore clinical efficacy of leniolisib in this new PID population. The trial has been designed to inform a subsequent Phase 3 program. Organizational highlights During 2023 our new Chairman, Dr. Richard Peters, was elected, succeeding Paul Sekhri, who came to the end of his maximum term (eight years). Dr. Peters is a highly respected and proven industry leader, who brings extensive medical and commercial acumen for difficult-to-treat and rare diseases, from development stage to large global biopharmaceutical companies, to Pharming. We also strengthened our Executive Committee with the appointment of a Chief Business Officer, Dr. Alexander Breidenbach, who has more than 20 years of partnering, R&D and management experience in biosciences and, in this newly created position, is tasked with the development and execution of Pharming’s growth strategy.

This growth was primarily due to a 34% increase in net sales for RUCONEST® compared to the same period last year, as well as an 18% increase compared to the third quarter of 2023. Additionally, Joenja® revenues in the fourth quarter were US$7.9 million, a 21% increase compared to the third quarter. Gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2023 increased by US$25.8 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. This growth was driven by higher revenues, although it was partially offset by increased RUCONEST® production costs and royalty payments to Novartis on Joenja® sales. Operating expenses increased by US$16.1 million in the fourth quarter compared to last year. US$8.3 million of this increase is directly related to research and development expenses for leniolisib and marketing and sales expenses for Joenja®. Pharming’s expansion efforts, driven by preparations for the launch and further commercialization of Joenja®, led to a US$7.1 million increase in payroll expenses. In the fourth quarter of 2023, an operating profit of US$1.1 million was realized, in contrast to an operating loss of US$10.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. This improvement was primarily driven by the rise in gross profit, partially offset by the increase in operating expenses. Full year 2023 In 2023, Pharming revenues increased by 19% to US$245.3 million. However, operating profit declined to a loss of US$5.4 million, compared to a profit of US$18.2 million in 2022. Similarly, net profit decreased to loss of US$10.1 million, down from a profit of US$13.7 million in 2022. This section will further elaborate on Pharming's financial performance in 2023. Revenues and Gross Profit The 19% increase in revenues was a result of higher unit sales volumes, supported by a price increase below CPI, of RUCONEST® in the U.S. market (US$221.2 million in 2023 compared to US$200.1 million in 2022) and the initial sales of Joenja® (US$18.2 million in 2023) following the launch in April 2023. Revenues in Europe and the rest of the world increased by 12% to US$6.2 million in 2023. Cost of sales increased by 44% from US$17.6 million in 2022 to US$25.2 million in 2023. Cost of sales related to product sales in 2023 amounted to US$23.5 million compared to US$17.4 million in 2022. In addition to the higher unit sales volume, the rise was primarily attributed to rising production costs for RUCONEST® and royalty payments to Novartis on Joenja® sales. The remainder of cost of sales in 2023 (US$1.7 million) stem from impairment charges on inventory (2022: US$0.2 million). Gross profit increased by US$32.0 million, or 17%, to US$220.1 million for the year 2023. The main reasons for this increase were higher sales of RUCONEST® and the launch of Joenja®. Operating Profit (loss) and Other Operating Costs For 2023, operating profit (loss) decreased by US$23.6 million to US$(5.4) million compared with US$18.2 million for the prior year. This decrease was driven by increased operating costs (US$64.5 million) and offset by increased gross profit (US$32.0 million) as mentioned above and increased other income (US$8.8 million). Of the US$64.5 million increase in operating costs, US$10.4 million is attributed to milestone payments for Joenja® following its first commercial sale in the second quarter of 2023. An additional US$25.7 million in expenses is directly related to research and development expenses for leniolisib and marketing and sales expenses for Joenja®. Pharming’s expansion efforts, driven by preparations for the launch and further commercialization of Joenja®, led to a US$24.2 million increase in payroll expenses. Finally, Pharming incurred additional impairment expenses related to our DSP facility at Pivot Park in Oss, the Netherlands, amounting to US$4.7 million in 2023 compared to US$3.9 million in 2022. In 2023, other income increased by US$8.8 million to US$23.3 million as a result of the definitive agreement to sell the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (PRV) to Novartis for a pre-agreed, one-time payment of US$21.3 million. Pharming was granted the PRV by the FDA in March 2023 in connection with the approval of Joenja®. The amount differs from the previously disclosed US$21.1 million in the press release of the second quarter of 2023 due to currency fluctuations throughout the year. In 2022, Pharming reduced its minority stake in BioConnection from 43.85% to 22.98%. As a result of this one-off transaction, Pharming had recognized a gain of US$12.2 million in 2022. Finance income and expenses Other finance income decreased by US$0.8 million, to US$3.7 million in 2023. This decrease was caused by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro during 2022 and 2023, which primarily impacts our net cash position. In 2022, the U.S. Dollar strengthened against the Euro, resulting in other finance income of US$4.4 million. However, in 2023, the U.S. Dollar weakened relative to the Euro, leading to other finance expenses of US$3.0 million. This decrease in other finance income was for largely offset by increased interest income from US$0.1 million in 2022 to US$3.7 million in 2023. This was driven by general interest rate hikes as well as investments in short-term readily convertible S&P AAA-rated government treasury certificates using excess cash. Other finance expenses increased by US$3.6 million, from US$5.5 million in, 2022 to US$9.1 million in 2023, mainly caused by foreign currency fluctuations as mentioned earlier. The fair value loss on revaluation (US$0.9 million) relates to fair value adjustments in the BioConnection preference share. This share is included in Pharming's balance sheet as an investment in debt instruments designated at the fair value through the statement of profit and loss (FVTPL). Income tax credit (expense) Income tax credit (expense) shifted from a US$1.3 million expense for the year ending December 31, 2022, to a US$1.9 million credit for the year ending December 31, 2023. This change occurred due to incurring a net loss before tax in 2023, as opposed to a net profit before tax in 2022. Profit (loss) for the year The total net loss in 2023 amounted to US$10.1 million, compared to a total net profit of US$13.7 million in 2022. This decrease was primarily caused by higher operating costs, due to Pharming’s growth trajectory and investments in its product pipeline. In addition, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates adversely impacted the foreign currency results in the statement of income. These increased costs were partially offset by an increase in gross profit and other income. Intangible assets In 2023, intangible assets decreased by US$3.8 million, from US$75.1 million in 2022 to US$71.3 million in 2023. This decrease primarily resulted from regular amortization (amounting to US$5.9 million), partially offset by foreign currency effects (equivalent to US$2.2 million). The amortization relates to regular amortization of software and the existing re-acquired rights related to the acquisition of all North American commercialization rights from Bausch Health in 2016 and the acquisition of all European commercialization and distribution rights from Swedish Orphan International AB (“Sobi”) in 2020. In addition to the aforementioned, the amortization of the Joenja® license commenced, following the FDA approval per March 24, 2023. Amortization is charged based on the economic lifetime of the intangible asset. The economic lifetime of the North American commercialization rights from Bausch Health is 20 years, where the economic lifetime of the European commercialization and distribution rights from Swedish Orphan International AB is 12 years. These estimates did not change compared to the previous year. The economic lifetime of the Joenja® license is established at 14 years. Property, plant and equipment The value of property, plant and equipment decreased from US$10.4 million in 2022 to US$9.7 million in 2023. This decline was primarily driven by regular depreciation (amounting to US$2.4 million), partially offset by capital expenditures (totaling US$1.4 million), which were mainly associated with acquiring new machinery and equipment for Pharming's production process. Right-of-use assets The right-of-use assets decreased from US$28.8 million in 2022 to US$23.8 million in 2023. This decline was primarily driven by regular depreciation (amounting to US$4.2 million) and an additional impairment related to the DSP facility at Pivot Park in Oss, the Netherlands (totaling US$4.7 million). Pharming remains exploring alternative utilization possibilities for this asset. The decrease in the right-to-use assets is partially offset by investments in buildings (US$1.9 million) and cars (US$1.4 million). The 2023 building investments were related to adjustments in the existing right-of-use assets to account for inflation-related higher lease payments. Investments Investments increased by US$0.7 million, reaching US$10.4 million as of December 31, 2023. This growth was primarily driven by a US$1.6 million increase in the equity investment in Orchard, which is designated at fair value through the statement of other comprehensive income (FVTOCI). The rise in value was primarily triggered by the announcement that Orchard had entered into a definitive agreement with Japanese company Kyowa Kirin Co. LTD for the acquisition of Orchard at a premium over the prevailing share price. This transaction was successfully completed on January 24, 2024. Additionally, the overall investments saw a US$0.3 million increase due to favorable currency exchange movements. The increase in investments was partially offset by Pharming’s share of US$0.3 million in the net loss of BioConnection, which is accounted for using the equity method. Furthermore, the investments were impacted by a fair value decrease of US$0.9 million in the preference share in BioConnection, carried at fair value through the statement of profit and loss (FVTPL). Inventories Inventories increased from US$42.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to US$56.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This was largely due to an increase in finished goods and work in progress inventory. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities Cash and cash equivalents alone decreased by US$145.8 million to US$61.5 million, as of December 31, 2023. This decline was primarily driven by negative cash flows from operating activities (totaling US$17.5 million) and net-purchases of marketable securities (amounting to US$149.2 million). This decrease was largely offset by the aforementioned PRV sale of US$21.3 million. In 2023, the Company invested in euro-denominated readily convertible S&P AAA-rated government treasury certificates with a maturity of six months or less from the date of acquisition. As of year-end 2023, these marketable securities amount to US$151.7 million. The combined total of cash and cash equivalents, together with restricted cash and marketable securities increased from US$208.7 million at year-end 2022 to US$215.0 million at year-end 2023. In addition to the movements mentioned earlier, this increase is partially attributable to favorable currency exchange fluctuations. Equity The equity position increased by US$14.5 million from US$204.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to US$219.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by transactions recognized directly in equity relating to share based compensation and exercised options (totaling US$17.4 million) as well as other comprehensive income relating to the currency translation reserve (amounting to US$5.9 million) and fair value changes on investments designated as fair value through the statement of other comprehensive income (contributing US$1.2 million). This increase was partially offset by a net loss of US$10.1 million for the year. Convertible bond The convertible bond has increased by US$5.0 million to US$138.4 million at year-end 2023, moving from US$133.4 million as of December 31, 2022. This increase was mainly driven by foreign currency effects. During 2023, a total of US$4.0 million of interest was paid on the bond. Lease liabilities Lease liabilities decreased by US$0.2 million, moving from US$33.3 million as of December 31, 2022 to US$33.1 million as of December 31, 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by monthly or quarterly lease payments of US$5.1 million. However, it was partially offset by new leases (amounting to US$3.2 million), regularly accrued interest expenses (equivalent to US$1.2 million) and foreign exchange effects (totaling US$0.8 million). Outlook/Summary For 2024, the Company anticipates: Total revenues between US$280 million and US$295 million (14% to 20% growth), with quarterly fluctuations expected. Continued progress finding additional APDS patients in the U.S., supported by family testing and VUS validation efforts, and subsequently converting patients to paid Joenja® (leniolisib) therapy.Increasing ex-U.S. revenues leniolisib - from commercial availability or through our Named Patient Program and other funded early access programs in key global markets.Completion of leniolisib clinical trials to support regulatory filings for approval in Japan and pediatric label expansion in key global markets.Progress towards regulatory approvals for leniolisib in the EEA, the U.K., Canada, Australia, and Israel.Initiate and advance a Phase 2 clinical trial for leniolisib in PIDs with immune dysregulation linked to PI3Kδ signaling to significantly expand the long-term commercial potential of leniolisib.Continued operating cost investments to accelerate future revenue growth.

The Company's ADS closing bid price has been at $1.00 or above for the last 10 consecutive business days, ensuring compliance with Nasdaq rules. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Regaining compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement is a significant financial milestone for AirNet Technology Inc. It directly influences investor perception and can affect the liquidity of the shares. The company's ability to maintain a bid price above the $1 threshold over the consecutive 10-day period demonstrates a recovery in investor confidence and potentially an improved financial outlook.For stakeholders, the immediate benefit is the continued listing on the Nasdaq, which is crucial for access to capital markets and institutional investors. However, the underlying reasons for the stock's appreciation are paramount. If the price increase is due to fundamental improvements in the company's operations or financials, the long-term outlook may be positive. Conversely, if the increase is driven by speculative trading or temporary factors, the company may face future risks of non-compliance. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price signals a stabilization in AirNet's market valuation. This could attract additional analysis from brokerage firms and market researchers, which in turn can lead to higher visibility among potential investors. However, it is essential to monitor the company's subsequent trading patterns and market performance to ensure that the stock price reflects its intrinsic value and is not subject to volatility.A critical analysis should include the company's market position, competitive landscape and growth potential. Any discrepancies with industry norms, such as revenue growth, profit margins, or return on equity, should be closely examined to assess the sustainability of AirNet's stock price recovery. 03/14/2024 - 04:00 AM BEIJING, March 14, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- AirNet Technology Inc., formerly known as AirMedia Group Inc.

This partnership aims to streamline workload migration to the cloud, offering customers the best of Oracle with Microsoft's cloud services like Azure AI. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The expansion of Oracle Database@Azure into new regions represents a strategic move to capitalize on the increasing demand for cloud services. This collaboration between Microsoft and Oracle is a significant step in the multicloud strategy, which allows customers to leverage the strengths of multiple cloud providers. The inclusion of regions such as Germany, Australia, Brazil and others is indicative of a targeted approach to capture diverse markets, each with unique regulatory and data sovereignty requirements.From a market research perspective, this news suggests that the cloud services market is highly competitive and that partnerships between tech giants can be a powerful way to address customer needs for integrated solutions. The ability to run Oracle's database services on Microsoft's Azure platform simplifies the cloud migration process for enterprises, potentially increasing the adoption rate of cloud technologies. This move could also influence the competitive dynamics, prompting other cloud service providers to seek similar partnerships or to innovate in order to maintain market share. Financial Analyst The announcement is likely to have positive financial implications for both Microsoft and Oracle. By expanding the availability of Oracle Database@Azure to 15 regions, both companies are poised to capture a larger segment of the cloud market, which could lead to increased revenues. The synergy between Oracle's database services and Microsoft's cloud infrastructure, including Azure AI, can create a comprehensive offering that may drive sales and improve customer retention.For investors, this expansion could be seen as a growth indicator for both companies' cloud segments. It's important to note, however, that the costs associated with the expansion and the time needed to realize returns on investment should be considered. As the service is now available in key regions, monitoring the uptake and customer feedback will be crucial in assessing the financial success of this initiative. IT Infrastructure Expert The technical implications of Oracle Database@Azure's expansion are considerable. The service promises high performance, scale and availability, which are critical factors for enterprises when migrating mission-critical workloads to the cloud. The mention of feature and pricing parity with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) suggests that customers will not face a premium for the multicloud flexibility.Moreover, the integration of Oracle's database services with Azure's development and AI services could facilitate the creation of new, cloud-native applications, presenting a significant opportunity for innovation. Enterprises stand to benefit from a unified operating environment that reduces latency and security concerns, which are often hurdles in cloud migration. The ability to maintain consistency with on-premises deployments could also minimize the need for extensive rearchitecting, thereby reducing the complexity and cost of cloud transitions. 03/14/2024 - 04:00 AM Powerful cloud database service now in Germany and announcing five additional cloud regions for a total of 15 regions planned this year REDMOND, Wash., and AUSTIN, Texas, March 14, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Microsoft Corp. and Oracle are expanding our collaboration to meet growing customer demand for Oracle Database@Azure around the world. Oracle Database@Azure will expand to five more regions, which brings the total planned multicloud availability footprint to 15 regions globally. ""Bringing Oracle Database@Azure to Europe will enable customers in the region to locally employ Oracle database services running on OCI hardware deployed in Azure datacenters for the first time,"" said Microsoft CVP Azure Infrastructure Product and Design Erin Chapple. ""The expansion of our collaboration with Oracle demonstrates our mutual commitment to help customers streamline the migration of workloads to the cloud so they can combine the best of Oracle with the breadth of Microsoft cloud services, like Azure AI, to empower business innovation."" ""We have embraced the tremendous global customer demand for Oracle Database@Azure and are hence announcing five additional regions to the road map today,"" said Karan Batta, senior vice president, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. ""We are energized by the Global 500 companies in financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, oil and gas, pharmaceuticals, and more that are already utilizing Oracle Database@Azure. The increased uptick in demand and emerging and unified use cases across OCI and Microsoft Azure demonstrate just how important the multicloud deployments are for our joint customers."" Customers can now place orders for Oracle Database@Azure in the Microsoft Azure Germany West Central region in Frankfurt. This marks the debut of Oracle Database@Azure in Europe, and the second region after Microsoft Azure East US general availability in December 2023. To meet the growing customer demand this year, the service will further run in the Australia East, Brazil South, Canada Central, France Central, Central India, Italy North, Japan East, Southeast Asia, Sweden Central, United Kingdom South, Central United States, South Central United States, and United Arab Emirates North cloud regions. ""Enterprises that use offerings from multiple vendors are having a hard time moving their workloads to the cloud,"" said Holger Mueller, vice president and principal analyst, Constellation Research. ""Effectively CxOs need to pick the better offering and then live with the integration cost and risk going forward. The Microsoft and Oracle partnership is an innovative departure from this challenge, by allowing enterprises to even deliver their Oracle services through Azure's console.

Threat actors are increasingly using novel malware to target high-value data, indicating specific motivations towards particular attack targets. Commercial enterprises, including retail, manufacturing, automotive, and professional services, were targeted by 33% of all threats, with a focus on information-stealing malware. Ransomware gangs are exploiting new Zero Day vulnerabilities, posing a significant threat to vulnerable targets and motivating profiteer groups. The BlackBerry Threat Intelligence team predicts a rise in attacks on critical infrastructure and supply chain cyberattacks in 2024, with an increase in APAC attacks from China and North Korea. Negative None. Cybersecurity Expert The revelation of the increased frequency of novel malware attacks, particularly targeting the financial sector, is a significant concern for cybersecurity professionals. The reported 27 percent increase in new malicious samples per minute intercepted by BlackBerry's AI-powered solutions is indicative of the escalating arms race between threat actors and cybersecurity defenses. The shift towards AI as a tool for both offense and defense in cyber warfare is particularly noteworthy. The implication here is that organizations must continually adapt their cybersecurity strategies, incorporating advanced technologies like AI and machine learning to identify and mitigate threats more effectively. This trend is likely to influence cybersecurity budgets and priorities, with a possible surge in demand for AI-driven security products and services. Financial Analyst For investors, BlackBerry's report underscores the company's pivotal role in a sector that is experiencing exponential growth in threat activity. The increased attack rate of 31 attacks every minute stopped by BlackBerry solutions suggests that their products are critical in combating these threats. This performance could positively influence the company's stock as it demonstrates the effectiveness and necessity of their cybersecurity offerings. However, investors should also consider the broader market implications, as the report indicates a growing risk to critical infrastructure and commercial enterprises. This could lead to increased volatility in the stock prices of companies within these sectors, as they may face higher costs associated with bolstering their cybersecurity defenses. Risk Management Specialist The report's focus on the potential for increased attacks on critical infrastructure and the rapid weaponization of CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) by ransomware gangs highlights a significant risk management challenge. Organizations in the targeted sectors must prioritize identifying and mitigating these vulnerabilities to prevent potentially crippling cyberattacks. This could involve reassessing risk management frameworks and investing in more proactive and predictive security measures. The anticipated rise in supply chain attacks further emphasizes the need for comprehensive risk assessments that extend beyond an organization's immediate network and include third-party vendors and partners. 03/14/2024 - 12:01 AM Continued Increase in Novel Malware Fuels 3.7 Attacks per Minute WATERLOO, ON, March 14, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- BlackBerry Limited (NYSE: BB; TSX: BB) today released its latest Global Threat Intelligence Report, revealing threat actors focusing efforts on targeting high-value data held by the global financial sector, with one million attacks logged over the 120 day period. This ""death by a million cuts"" is revealed to be using mainly commodity malware, which indicates a large number of independent actors targeting the industry in pursuit of financial gain. Critical infrastructure attacks, including those targeting government, financial, healthcare and communications industries, altogether accounted for 62 percent of industry-related attacks over the report period, September to December 2023. The BlackBerry Threat Research and Intelligence team registered a 27 percent uptick in novel malware to 3.7 new malicious samples per minute prevented by its AI-powered cybersecurity solutions, compared to 2.9 per minute in the previous reporting period. Overall, BlackBerry® cybersecurity solutions stopped 31 attacks every minute, a 19 percent increase on the last reporting period. ""We're consistently seeing increased volumes of attack in highly lucrative industries using novel malware,"" said Ismael Valenzuela, Vice President of Threat Research and Intelligence at BlackBerry. ""Novel malware typically indicates specific motivations from threat actors towards particular attack targets with intent to evade defenses, which are often based on static signatures. We've reached a pivotal point where traditional detection methods alone are not enough to combat this increasingly complex problem. AI is already being weaponized by malicious entities, so it must equally be the dominant tool for detection and defense."" Highlights from the latest BlackBerry Global Threat Intelligence Report include: 62 percent of industry-related attacks targeted critical industries: Digitization and the prospect of debilitating national infrastructure attracted notorious gangs and Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) groups who attempt to exploit security misconfigurations and vulnerabilities for varying motives.Commercial enterprises also under attack: 33 percent of all threats targeted commercial enterprises (including retail, manufacturing, automotive and professional services), with the majority (53 percent) of those deploying information-stealing (Infostealer) malware with the aim of accessing highly sensitive data.Rapid weaponization of CVEs by Threat Actors: Ransomware gangs observed taking advantage of new Zero Day vulnerabilities and mass mobilizing against potentially vulnerable targets, with zero-day exploits motivating profiteer groups.Based on its data analysis, the BlackBerry Threat Intelligence and Research team predicts that 2024 will bring an increase in attacks targeting critical infrastructure and other profitable segments. VPN appliances will likely remain desirable targets for nation-state-level threat actors and it is anticipated that there will be a continued increase in supply chain cyberattacks targeting hardware and software vulnerabilities. Further, APAC will likely see an increase in attacks from China and North Korea, particularly financially-motivated attacks.

Shell publishes Energy Transition Strategy 2024,2024-03-14T07:10:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,Shell announces Energy Transition Strategy 2024 with ambitious emission reduction targets and significant investments in low-carbon energy solutions.,"Shell publishes Energy Transition Strategy 2024 Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Shell announces Energy Transition Strategy 2024 with ambitious emission reduction targets and significant investments in low-carbon energy solutions. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Market Analyst Shell's commitment to halving emissions from its operations by 2030 and the subsequent investment in low-carbon energy solutions is a strategic pivot that aligns with global decarbonization trends. The energy sector is under increasing pressure to transition to sustainable practices and Shell's update indicates a significant shift in capital allocation towards cleaner energy. This transition not only responds to regulatory pressures but also to a growing consumer demand for sustainable energy sources. The investment of $10-15 billion earmarked for low-carbon solutions over the next few years is poised to position Shell as a leader in the energy transition, potentially creating new revenue streams and mitigating long-term risks associated with fossil fuels.Furthermore, the reduction in net carbon intensity of energy products sold by Shell suggests an improvement in operational efficiency and a portfolio shift towards less carbon-intensive products. This could lead to a competitive advantage as carbon pricing mechanisms become more prevalent, potentially increasing operating costs for less proactive competitors. However, the transition also involves risks, such as the potential for stranded assets and the challenge of maintaining profitability while investing in emerging technologies with uncertain returns. Environmental Policy Expert Shell's energy transition strategy is indicative of the broader industry movement towards meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement, particularly the ambition to limit global warming to 1.5°C. The company's focus on reducing Scope 3 emissions—those produced by customers using its products—is particularly noteworthy, as these emissions typically represent the largest share of an oil and gas company's carbon footprint. By setting a target to reduce customer emissions by 15-20% by 2030, Shell is acknowledging its responsibility in addressing downstream emissions and is likely to influence consumer behavior and choices towards low-carbon alternatives.The strategy also reflects an understanding of the need for a 'balanced and orderly transition' to ensure energy security and affordability. This approach is crucial to avoid potential negative social and economic impacts, such as energy shortages or price spikes. However, the success of this strategy will depend on the company's ability to effectively implement new technologies and to navigate the complex regulatory environments that govern energy markets globally. Sustainability Investment Analyst From an investment perspective, Shell's update on its energy transition strategy can be seen as a proactive measure to future-proof its business model against the backdrop of a changing energy landscape. By diversifying its portfolio and investing in low-carbon technologies, Shell is not only reducing its environmental impact but also potentially enhancing its appeal to sustainability-focused investors. This could lead to improved access to capital and possibly a re-rating of the company's stock as it transitions from a traditional oil and gas company to an integrated energy provider.It is important to monitor Shell's progress towards these targets, as well as the company's ability to balance shareholder returns with the significant capital expenditures required for this transition. Investors will be looking for evidence of Shell's commitment to these goals, such as the development of renewable energy projects, carbon capture initiatives and partnerships in the electric mobility sector. The company's performance in these areas will be a key indicator of its long-term viability and success in a low-carbon economy. 03/14/2024 - 03:10 AM Shell publishes Energy Transition Strategy 2024 Shell will continue its drive to halve emissions from its operations (Scope 1 and 2) by 2030, compared with 2016 on a net basis. By the end of 2023, Shell had achieved more than 60% of this target. Shell also reduced the net carbon intensity of the energy products it sells by 6.3% compared with 2016, the third consecutive year it hit its target.To help drive the decarbonisation of the transport sector, Shell has set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of its oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11). [A]Shell confirms it will invest $10-15 billion between 2023 and the end of 2025 in low-carbon energy solutions, making Shell a significant investor in the energy transition. London, 14 March 2024 – Shell plc (Shell) has published its first energy transition update since the launch of its Powering Progress strategy in 2021. At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the “more value” part. In this energy transition update, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers “less emissions”. Our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across all our operations and energy products is transforming our business. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Shell’s strategy supports a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy solutions to maintain secure and affordable energy supplies. “Energy has made an incredible contribution to human development, allowing many people around the world to live more prosperous lives. Today, the world must meet growing demand for energy while tackling the urgent challenge of climate change. I am encouraged by the rapid progress in the energy transition in recent years in many countries and technologies, which reinforces my deep conviction in the direction of our strategy,” said Wael Sawan, Shell’s Chief Executive Officer. “Shell has a very important role to play in providing the energy the world needs today, and in helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future. Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can have the greatest impact through the energy transition and create the most value for our investors and customers. We believe this focus makes it more, not less, likely that we will achieve our climate targets. By providing the different kinds of energy the world needs, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition,” said Sawan. Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is a critical fuel in the energy transition, and we are growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity. We are cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil production stable, and growing sales of low-carbon energy solutions while gradually reducing sales of oil products such as petrol, diesel and jet fuel. As one of the world’s largest energy traders, we can connect the supply of low-carbon energy to demand, as we have done for many years with oil and gas. We have made good progress against our climate targets: By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016. This goes above and beyond the targets set by signatories to the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter agreed at COP28.We continue to be an industry leader in reducing methane emissions. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030. In 2023, we achieved 0.05% methane emissions intensity – significantly below our target of 0.2%. And in 2023 we also contributed to the World Bank’s Global Flaring and Methane Reduction Fund – further supporting industry-wide action to drive down methane emissions and flaring. In 2023, we achieved our target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016 – the third consecutive year we hit our target. As Shell transforms into a net-zero emissions energy business, we aim to take the lead in the energy transition where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. To help drive the decarbonisation of the transport sector, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).[A] Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a strategic shift in our integrated power business. We plan to build our power business, including renewable power, in places including Australia, Europe, India and the USA, and have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe. In line with this shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we will focus on select markets and segments. This includes selling more power to commercial customers, and less to retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect lower total growth of power sales to 2030, which has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against our previous target of 20%. We will continue to transparently report our progress against our targets and ambitions every year. Driving towards a net-zero future We are investing $10-15 billion between 2023 and the end of 2025 in low-carbon energy solutions, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. And in 2023, we invested $5.6 billion on low-carbon solutions, more than 23% of our total capital spending. These investments include electric vehicle charging, biofuels, renewable power, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. Our investments in new technologies are helping to reduce emissions for Shell and our customers. We aim to help scale new technologies to make them an affordable choice for our customers and are focusing our advocacy on key areas which we believe are critical to the energy transition: policies that support national net-zero ambitions including carbon pricing, supplying the secure energy the world needs, driving changes in demand and growing low-carbon solutions. [A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021. ENDS Notes to Editors For full details of updates to our climate targets, ambitions and performance please read the full report, online here: www.shell.com/ets2024pdf Shareholders will have an advisory vote on the Energy Transition Strategy at Shell’s 2024 AGM. Shell’s net carbon intensity is the average intensity, weighted by sales volume, of the energy products sold by Shell. It is tracked, measured and reported using our Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) methodology. We have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11). That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards.Reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by both Shell (Scope 1 and 2 emissions) and our customers (Scope 3 emissions). While we can encourage the uptake of low-carbon products and solutions, we cannot control the final choices customers make. Support from governments and policymakers is essential to create the right conditions for changes in demand. In 2023, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon energy solutions, more than 23% of our total capital spending. This includes the acquisition of Nature Energy, which makes Shell one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas in Europe. And our ongoing investment in Sprng Energy, one of India’s leading renewable power platforms, demonstrates our determination to invest in growing renewable capacity in areas that play to our strengths and add most value. We are also pioneering efforts to scale up low-carbon solutions, such as by starting construction in late 2022 of Holland Hydrogen 1 in Rotterdam, which is anticipated to become one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe.

It comes three years after we launched our Powering Progress strategy, and builds on our Capital Markets Day in June 2023 when we set out our plans to create more value with less emissions. Our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains at the heart of our strategy and is transforming our operations and energy products. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit the rise in the global average temperature to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. As we work towards net zero, we are reducing emissions from our operations and energy products while becoming an increasingly successful organisation. Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses: Integrated Gas, Upstream and Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions. In this publication, we set out pathways to net zero for our two biggest customer sectors – transport and industry – based on where we believe we have the competitive advantages to provide our customers with the products they need through the transition. Helping reduce emissions for our customersWe want to lead in the decarbonisation of transport using the strength of our brand, deep customer relationships and global reach. We aim to grow our public charging network for electric vehicles, and remain one of the world’s largest blenders and distributors of biofuels [A]. As the energy transition progresses, we expect to sell more low-carbon products and solutions, and less oil products including petrol and diesel. To measure our progress, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [B]. Includes volumes from our joint venture RaízenCustomer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021. The world needs a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to maintain secure energy supplies, while accelerating the transition to affordable low-carbon solutions. We are growing our world-leading liquefied natural gas (LNG) business so that we can continue to provide a critical fuel in the energy transition. Our investments in carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and renewable energy will help us produce LNG with lower carbon intensity in the future. Through our world-class trading business, we can connect the supply of low-carbon energy to demand, as we have done for many years with oil, gas and LNG. As we work towards net zero, we are making clear choices about where we can add most value for our investors and customers. We expect renewable power will be critical for helping our commercial customers decarbonise, and plan to build our integrated power business in places including Australia, Europe, India and the USA. We have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe because we do not believe we have a competitive position there. Technologies of the futureWe are increasing our investments in research and development, and investing in the fuels of the future. We aim to scale up new technologies to create affordable options for our customers into the 2030s. We are building Holland Hydrogen 1, one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe, close to our Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands. We are also investing in carbon capture and storage technology to reduce emissions from our own operations such as refineries and LNG plants, and, in the longer term, to help our industrial customers reduce their emissions too. I saw first-hand the potential of some of the exciting new technologies we are developing when I visited Oman in January 2024. We are part of a group exploring a project to produce green ammonia and liquefied synthetic gas from renewable hydrogen. These technologies are still in the early stages, but they could help to decarbonise industry and commercial road transport in the future. More value with less emissionsAt our Capital Markets Day, we said we would deliver more value with less emissions. We have made good progress in our first year under our new Chief Executive Officer Wael Sawan. In 2023, we returned 42% of our cash flow from operations to our shareholders, the upper end of our 30-40% range through the cycle. We also reduced carbon emissions from our operations by 31% compared with 2016 levels, putting us well on the way towards our target of a 50% reduction by 2030 on a net basis. We achieved our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction against our target of 6-8% compared with 2016. Transparency and shareholder supportIn 2021, 89% of our shareholders voted in support of our Energy Transition Strategy. Since then, we have published two progress reports, which our shareholders have also supported. Along with other Board members, I met with many of Shell's largest institutional shareholders following those votes. I appreciate their time and feedback and look forward to our next engagement in April 2024. The publication of our Energy Transition Strategy brings increased transparency, and better dialogue with our institutional investors. We heard that following Capital Markets Day, for example, some wanted us to be clearer about how we will deliver both more value and less emissions, and we are showing exactly that in this update. This year, we are again asking our shareholders to vote at our Annual General Meeting on our Energy Transition Strategy. As before, this vote is purely advisory, and not binding for our shareholders. The legal responsibility for approving or objecting to Shell's strategy lies with the Board and Executive Committee. We believe our strategy will transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business, creating value for our shareholders, customers and wider society. We will offer shareholders an advisory vote at the 2024 Annual General Meeting based on the energy transition plans described in this publication and our Annual Report and Accounts 2023. The Board recommends that shareholders vote in favour of the Resolution asking them to support those plans. Sir Andrew Mackenzie Chair Chief Executive Officer's introduction This is our first update to the Energy Transition Strategy that we published in 2021. It is an opportunity to take stock of our progress, to reflect on what we have learned, and to look forward as we transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. Over the past three years we have seen the critical importance of secure and affordable energy for economies and people's lives. As the world's population grows by an estimated 2 billion people by 2050, and the benefits of energy are extended to the hundreds of millions who do not have it today, demand for energy will only grow. At the same time, the world must achieve an orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy to achieve net-zero emissions. Today, fossil fuels meet around 80% of global energy demand, with an even greater reliance in many developing countries. We support a balanced energy transition, one that maintains secure and affordable energy supplies as the world moves to net zero. I am encouraged by the rapid progress in the energy transition in many countries and technologies in recent years, including the continued growth in demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG), a critical fuel in the energy transition, and for low-carbon energy solutions such as solar and wind power, and electric vehicles. This progress reinforces my deep conviction in the direction of our strategy. Shell has an important role to play in providing the energy the world needs today, and in helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future. There are exciting opportunities to use the strength of our innovation capabilities in the areas where we can have the greatest impact. Our purpose – to provide more and cleaner energy solutions – sets the direction for everything we do. Progress towards our targetsSince we launched our Powering Progress strategy, we have made good progress against our climate targets, and learned where we have competitive strengths. By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016. We achieved this by adapting our portfolio, including by repurposing refineries, and making changes to our operations such as powering some oil and gas platforms with renewable energy. We continue to be one of the leaders in reducing emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that can be released during oil, gas and LNG production. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030. In 2023, we continued to keep our methane emissions intensity well below 0.2%. We made good progress towards our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations, compared with 2016 [A]. We also met our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction against our target of 6-8% compared with 2016. More value, less emissionsAt our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our Powering Progress strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the ""more value"" part of our strategy. In this energy transition update, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers ""less emissions"". Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses. In Integrated Gas, we are growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity. In Upstream, we are reducing emissions from oil and gas production. In Downstream and Renewables and Energy Solutions, we are growing sales of low-carbon products and solutions such as biofuels, electric vehicle charging and renewable power, while investing in hydrogen and other fuels of the future. Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can create the most value for our investors and customers through the energy transition. Our ability to raise and invest capital depends on delivering strong returns to shareholders, shaping the role that Shell can play on the journey to net zero. We believe this focus makes it more, not less, likely that we will achieve our climate targets and ambitions. Reducing emissions from productionWe believe the world will continue to need oil and gas for many years -- produced with much lower emissions -- alongside cleaner energy such as advanced biofuels, renewable power and hydrogen. We expect LNG will play a critical role in the transition. It continues to provide a secure supply of energy in many European countries. It also offers flexibility to electricity grids as wind and solar power grow, and opportunities to lower carbon emissions from industries such as cement and steel by replacing coal. In the future, by powering our LNG plants with renewable electricity, and adding carbon capture and storage, we aim to lower the carbon intensity of our LNG plants. Our LNG joint venture in Canada (Shell interest 40%), for example, the largest private-sector investment in the country's history, will use natural gas and renewable electricity to reduce emissions from the plant by more than one-third compared with the world’s best performing facilities. The Vito platform in the Gulf of Mexico (Shell interest 63.1%) is reducing emissions from oil and gas production. The platform started production in 2023 and is expected to produce around 80% less carbon dioxide emissions over its operating life, compared with the original design. We are using the same concept for two more platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, Whale (Shell interest 60%) and Sparta (Shell interest 51%). Supporting our customers as they decarboniseWe aim to lead in the energy transition where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. The transport sector is a good example. We are building on our customer relationships and expertise to help drive the decarbonisation of passenger cars, heavy-duty trucks, planes and ships. We aim to grow our public charging network for electric vehicles, and stay a leader in biofuels including sustainable aviation fuels or renewable diesel made from waste. By repurposing our remaining integrated refineries to focus on four regional energy and chemicals parks, we are creating the low-carbon production hubs of the future. As we grow sales of low-carbon fuels we expect to reduce sales of oil products such as petrol and diesel. We have set a new ambition to measure our progress, to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [B]. Our ambition is in line with the European Union's climate goals for transport, which are among the most progressive in the world. Our focus on value has led to a strategic shift in our power business towards select markets and segments. One example is selling more power to commercial customers, including renewable power, and less to retail customers. As a result, we expect lower growth in sales of power overall. We have updated our net carbon intensity target to reflect that change, with a 15-20% reduction by 2030, compared with 2016, against 20% previously. Towards net zeroIn total, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon solutions in 2023, which was 23% of our capital spending. We are spending $10-15 billion on low-carbon solutions between 2023 and 2025, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. With our focused approach, we believe our investments will have an important impact, allowing us to develop low-carbon solutions at increasingly affordable prices for our customers. Shell will provide the different kinds of energy the world needs. We will invest in producing LNG with lower carbon intensity, in reducing emissions from oil and gas production, and in providing cleaner energy solutions. As we transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition. Wael SawanChief Executive Officer Subject to the completion of the sale of Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDCCustomer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021. Our Energy Transition Strategy 2024 Our key beliefs have informed our strategy, enabled our progress, and will allow us to deliver on our updated targets and ambitions. 1 Today, the world must meet growing demand for energy while tackling the urgent challenge of climate change. There needs to be a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy solutions to maintain secure and affordable energy supplies. 2 Our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across all our operations and energy products is transforming our business. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit the rise in the global average temperature to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. 3 At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our Powering Progress strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the ""more value"" part of our strategy. In our Energy Transition Strategy 2024, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers ""less emissions"". 4 By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016, and reduced our total methane emissions by 70%. 5 We believe liquefied natural gas (LNG) will play a critical role in the energy transition, replacing coal in heavy industry. It also has a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, helping to reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. LNG helps to provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewable generation is growing rapidly. 6 Investment in oil and gas will be needed because demand for oil and gas is expected to drop at a slower rate than the natural decline rate of the world’s oil and gas fields, which is 4-5% a year. 7 We expect rapid growth in electric vehicles, including electric trucks, and believe biofuels and natural gas will also play a role in reducing emissions from heavy-duty transport. To help drive the decarbonisation of transport, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. [A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards. 8 We believe carbon abatement technologies such as carbon capture and storage will be needed for the world to reach net-zero emissions. We believe once key regulations, technologies and standards are in place, a large-scale business for carbon credits will emerge. 9 Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can create the most value for our investors and customers. We believe renewable energy will be an essential part of a net-zero world. In line with our strategic shift to prioritise value over volume in power, we are concentrating on select markets and segments. As a result, we expect lower growth of power sales overall. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 2030, compared with 2016, against 20% previously. 10 We are investing $10-15 billion in low-carbon energy solutions between 2023 and the end of 2025, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. By providing the different kinds of energy the world needs, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition. Our journey towards net zero 2023 Invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon solutions, of our total capital spending of $24.4 billion in 2023. This included the acquisition of Nature Energy, one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas in Europe.Our Timi platform in Malaysia, mainly powered by solar and wind energy, started production. The Vito platform in the US Gulf of Mexico also started production, with 80% less CO2 emissions expected over its lifetime compared with the original design.The Hollandse Kust Noord wind park off the coast of the Netherlands became operational.Shell’s management team hosted its first Capital Markets Day in New York and set out Shell’s strategy to deliver more value with less emissions.Achieved our target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 6-8% by the end of 2023 compared with 2016.Reduced our operational emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 31% by the end of 2023 compared with 2016, more than halfway towards our target to reduce them by 50% by 2030 on a net basis.Won majority shareholder support (80% of votes) for our energy transition progress at our Annual General Meeting. 2022 Completed the acquisition of renewable power company Sprng Energy, and took a final investment decision on Holland Hydrogen 1 and LNG expansion projects in Qatar.Introduced three new metrics in the annual bonus scorecard to reflect Shell’s role in the energy transition. Simplified our share structure, allowing us to manage our portfolio with greater agility through the energy transition. 2021 Completed the divestment of our Permian assets in the USA and bought solar company Savion in the USA.Offered shareholders an advisory vote on our energy transition strategy. The strategy was overwhelmingly supported. Introduced target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, and a target to halve Scope 1 and 2 under our operational control by 2030 on a net basis (2016 reference year). 2020 Announced ambition to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050.

Operational control boundary. Scope 1 and 2 target is on a net basis.Reference year.Shell's NCI is the average intensity, weighted by sales volume, of the energy products sold by Shell. Estimated total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions included in NCI correspond to well-to-wheel emissions associated with energy products sold by Shell, on an equity boundary, net of carbon credits. This includes the well-to-tank emissions associated with the manufacturing of energy products by others that are sold by Shell. Emissions associated with the manufacturing and use of non-energy products are excluded.2021 target 2-3%, 2022 target 3-4%, 2023 target 6-8%, all achieved. Acknowledging uncertainty in the pace of change in the energy transition, we have also chosen to retire our 2035 target of a 45% reduction in net carbon intensity.Our target is to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030.Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that market their gas (including LNG and GTL assets), defined as the total volume of methane emissions in normal cubic meter (Nm3) per total volume of gas available for sale in Nm3.Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that do not market their gas (e.g. where gas is reinjected) defined as the total mass of methane emissions in tonnes per total mass of oil and condensate available for sale in tonnes.Our target is to eliminate routine gas flaring from upstream operations by 2025, subject to the completion of the sale of SPDC.We have set a new ambition to reduce absolute emissions related to the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030, compared with 2021 (Scope 3 Category 11). Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021. The energy system: our beliefs Today, fossil fuels meet around 80% of the world's primary energy use. There is even greater reliance in many developing countries where security of supply and stable prices are critical to their development. The world's primary energy demand is just over 300 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (mboe/d); with around 250 mboe/d from fossil fuels. Of this, 100 mboe/d is from oil, 80 mboe/d is from coal and 70 mboe/d is from gas. As demand for energy continues to grow, driven by rising populations and increased prosperity, the world must transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy in a balanced way to achieve net-zero emissions. The transition to net zero will not be linear, as different countries take different approaches and move at different paces. Public policy, developments in technology and infrastructure, and a functioning carbon market are essential to create the demand signals for the private sector to invest at scale. This will require collaboration between policymakers, customers and private organisations like Shell that have the financial strength, experience and capabilities to help build the new energy system. Developing our beliefs We have developed our beliefs through our engagements with customers, policymakers, scientists and thought leaders from around the world. We have used research from our technology programmes, along with work carried out by the International Energy Agency, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and several other external bodies. We have also drawn from the expertise in our own energy security scenarios, Sky 2050 and Archipelagos, which we published last year. Although our scenarios are not expressions of our strategy and are not our business plans, they help inform our beliefs. Our scenarios are quantified by our World Energy Models, which are supplemented with climate analysis done in conjunction with Massachusetts Institute of Technology. We will continue to challenge our own beliefs as technology, policy and customer preferences evolve. Increasing demandSince 2000, annual air mileage has tripled, passenger road mileage has doubled, and production of steel has more than doubled. We expect continued growth in the transport and industrial sectors, driven by rising populations and higher living standards in emerging and developing countries, where more than a quarter of the world's population still lack basic energy provisions. Oil demand has grown from 57 million barrels a day (mb/d) to almost 100 mb/d in the last 40 years, with occasional annual declines in recessions, and the notable decline caused by the Covid pandemic. In all cases, demand has rebounded. However, we believe growth in oil demand is set to slow in the second half of this decade, and could start falling in the 2030s because of increasing vehicle efficiency and growth in electric vehicles. Population, GDP, demand and consumption of energy 2000-2040 2000-2040 Population x1.5 GDP x3.4 Aviation (passenger km) x5.3 Passenger road (vehicle km) x3.1 Marine (tonne km) x2.2 Heavy industry (tonne steel equivalent) x2.6 Source: Shell analysis and IEA's Extended energy balances 2023). Demand for natural gas has also seen steady growth over the last 40 years, adding an average of about 60 billion cubic metres (bcm) of new demand a year. Demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) has grown much faster, from about 30 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) in 1983 to more than 400 mtpa in 2023. Today, LNG makes up around 13% of the global gas market, a figure expected to exceed 20% by 2040. The global LNG market will continue growing at least through the 2030s, mostly driven by industrial decarbonisation in China, and strengthening demand in other Asian countries. LNG can help displace the use of coal in industry and power generation, and can top up supply in regions of declining domestic gas production such as Europe. The prospects for LNG demand are increasingly independent of pipeline natural gas because the fuel can be transported at short notice, and can also be used as a substitute for higher-carbon liquid fuels in shipping. Global demand for coal rose by 3.6% from 2013 to the end of 2023, when it reached a new high. This increase was fuelled by strong demand in developing economies. Coal demand increased by 35% in India and by 13% in China during this10-year period, due to rising demand for electricity and weak hydropower output. We believe replacing coal with natural gas, LNG and renewable power will be a key factor in reducing emissions.

Some of these sources are also used to generate heat instead of electricity.[B] Electric renewables include hydroelectricity, solar and wind.Source: Shell analysis of IEA Extended Energy Balances (2023). Energy investment Significant investment will be required to keep supplying oil and gas while low-carbon alternatives are developed and made commercially available. This continued investment is needed because demand for oil and gas is expected to drop at a slower rate than the natural decline of the world's oil and gas fields, which is at 4% to 5% a year. Worldwide oil and gas production, outside North America, has been at around 120 mboe/d from 2013 until the end of 2023, despite cumulative oil and gas investment of more than $2 trillion over the same period. Current global investment in low- and zero-carbon energy is around $1.7 trillion a year. To reach net zero by 2050, scenarios suggest that $3-4 trillion of commercially viable investment in low-carbon energy is required each year.

Global greenhouse gas emissions in 2023Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the energy system amounted to almost three-quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2023. Tighter government policies will help to reduce carbon emissions at a rate consistent with the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. Even without these policies, we expect that the global demand for fossil fuels would fall from today's level of around 80% to below 70% by 2040. If the world follows a path to net-zero emissions by 2050, the figure could go down to 50%. This will be driven by electrification and the scaling-up of renewable energy generation.

Industry Industry makes up 44% of the world's final energy use, with oil, gas and coal meeting almost 64% of this demand. Today, industry also uses substantial amounts of power generated by fossil fuels. The sector includes heavy industry, light industries such as manufacturing, mining and agriculture, and non-energy use feedstocks in chemicals. Heavy industryHeavy industry includes the energy-intensive production of steel and cement, which use high-temperature processes that can be hard and expensive to electrify. This sector represents 17% of final energy use, mainly in the form of coal, gas and electricity. Higher standards of living are built on the output of heavy industry. For example, the in-use stock per capita of steel in OECD countries ranges from 10-15 tonnes per person (t/p) compared with a world average of around 4 t/p [A]. Since 2000, OECD countries have seen a modest decline in energy demand as industrial output has plateaued. Innon-OECD countries, demand has nearly tripled, driven by industrialisation. Much of this increase in demand comes from China, which currently produces around half the world's steel and cement. The use of coal in heavy industry has fuelled much of the industrial growth in non-OECD countries over the last two decades, while OECD countries use far less coal and proportionally more gas and power. In non-OECD countries, gas and electricity have increased their market share against coal, and we expect this trend to continue. We believe natural gas and LNG will play an important role in replacing coal in high-temperature heavy industry applications. They can help address both local air emissions and wider climate considerations. More plentiful and affordable renewable electricity will also play a role in decarbonising this sector. Once electrification has taken place, gas will have a back-up role because many industrial processes require a high reliability of power supply. We also see potential for hydrogen in the long-term when it becomes cost competitive. Light industryLight industry constitutes around 17% of final energy use. Its energy requirements vary from fuel for heavy equipment to medium-level heat and electricity for manufacturing facilities. The energy mix for light industry includes coal, oil, gas, electricity and some commercial biomass. Many areas of light industry have already switched to electrification. We see this trend continuing with more action needed to increase efficiency. Supportive government policies are also needed to decarbonise the sector. Non-energy useNon-energy use is dominated by petroleum feedstocks and natural gas, and some coal in Asia. It represents about 10%of final energy use, but there are limited emissions as the feedstocks are transformed into material goods such as lubricants, plastics and fertilisers. Many of these products indirectly help reduce emissions when used in insulation in buildings or in plastics which reduce the weight of vehicles. We believe bio-feedstocks and recycling will grow in importance in this sector. Source: International Energy Agency. Iron and Steel Technology Roadmap reserved.

Transport sector The transport sector represents nearly 30% of final energy use, with oil products meeting more than 90% of this demand. The remainder is mostly met by LNG, compressed natural gas and biofuels. Global CO2 emissions from transport amount to around 8 gigatonnes (GT) a year, which is about one-seventh of global emissions. Oil products dominate transport because of their high energy density, convenience and cost competitiveness. In some markets, such as Europe and the USA, alternative transport fuels like ethanol are mandated. In Europe, where road transport fuel taxes are high, electric vehicles are increasingly cost competitive. However, in marine and aviation alternatives remain expensive. Bio-alternatives are at least twice the cost of oil products, and synthetic fuels manufactured from hydrogen can be up to eight times more expensive.

Range shown is home/deport charging to highway fast charging.Source: Shell Scenario team interpretations of 2023 market data when Brent crude oil prices averaged $83/barrel Passenger road transportToday, there are around 1.3 billion cars on the road, consuming around 25 million barrels of oil per day (mb/d), which is a quarter of the world's oil production. Biofuels such as ethanol are used in some markets but currently amount to less than 5% of demand. We expect a rapid growth in electric vehicles, including plug-in hybrids. Today there are around 40 million such vehicles on the roads, with up to 275 million expected by 2030. The availability of charging points will be critical for the growth in electric vehicles. The share of electric cars in new car sales has increased from less than 3% in 2018 to 18% in 2023. The most rapid growth is in China, the world's largest car market, followed by Europe and the USA. In China, there are a wide range of vehicles for sale at under $40,000, while in other markets electric vehicles generally sell at above this price before government subsidies are applied. Commercial road transportCommercial road transport, which includes 70 million trucks, uses 16 mb/d. We believe the shift of commercial road transport towards low-carbon solutions is less than a decade behind that of passenger cars. We expect that biofuels and renewable natural gas will keep playing a role in reducing emissions from trucks. In the long term, we expect electricity or hydrogen to become the main paths to decarbonisation, depending on advances in technology, government policy and customer preferences. AviationDemand for aviation fuel has rebounded from its Covid lows and is now at about 7 mb/d. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from used cooking oils and other feedstocks is seen as a credible alternative to jet fuel. Today, SAF represents less than 0.1% of total demand, but we expect its market share to grow with support from governments. Around 11 markets have SAF targets, including Europe and Singapore. Some 25 airlines representing a combined 35% of global aviation emissions also have SAF targets. Government mandates are essential to increase demand for SAF because it costs consumers between two and four times more than conventional aviation fuel. There is limited evidence that passengers will voluntarily pay a premium to cover the extra cost. In the long term, advances in technology may create opportunities to use synthetic fuels such as e-kerosene, but further research and development is required. ShippingShipping represents about 6 mb/d of oil demand. About 5% of shipping gross tonnage in operation today is fuelled by LNG, which can reduce emissions by up to 23% compared with conventional fuels. Of the new ships on order, about 25% of gross tonnage is being designed for LNG. A significant number of the ships in operation today already have dual fuel capabilities, giving them the flexibility to run on alternatives. We believe demand for LNG in shipping will grow, including for liquefied biomethane. Fuels such as methanol and ammonia could be options for shipping in the long term, but we see challenges with both of them. Buildings Residential and commercial buildings represent just under 30% of final energy use. This energy is used to heat the buildings and power electrical devices, and around two-thirds of it comes from low-carbon sources. The global building stock has become about 75% more efficient in the last 40 years due to improved building standards, better insulation, and more efficient appliances. Electrification has helped to decarbonise this sector and we see this continuing, with an increased use of electric heat pumps and cookers, reducing demand for natural gas in homes. Supportive policies will be key to continuing this trend. Information technology services, including data centres, artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies, are a rapidly growing part of the building sector. We believe global electricity demand in this area could double from 2023 to 2026. Power Power is the most rapidly decarbonising part of the energy system. More than 40% of electricity is now generated from renewables and nuclear. There has been rapid growth in wind and solar generation in the last 10 years, expanding from 3.5% of total power generation in 2013 to nearly 18% in 2023. Around 22% of final energy use was electrified by the end of 2023, up from around 18% in 2010. We think this trend is accelerating, aided by the adoption of electric vehicles and heat pumps. Electrification of final energy use could reach 30-40% by 2040. We expect that wind and solar will continue to dominate power generation growth as governments rightly support their scale-up, which will also require significant expansion of national electricity grids. We see natural gas having a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, which helps reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. Natural gas also helps provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewables are growing rapidly, and its role is especially crucial in managing seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand. Carbon abatement We believe carbon abatement will be an important tool to reach net-zero emissions. Once key regulations and standards are in place, a large-scale business for carbon credits could emerge. Carbon credits may be used to compensate for emissions in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate. The cost of carbon abatement can be split into three tranches. Abatement for less than $100 a tonne of CO2 includes efficiency measures in industry and buildings, changes in agriculture, forestry and other land use practices, and some switching from coal to gas or renewables in power generation. The middle tranche of abatement costs between $100 a tonne and $200 a tonne and includes the use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in power generation and industry. The highest abatement costs are at more than $200 a tonne. These include parts of the transport and industry sectors, and directly capturing carbon from the atmosphere. Carbon removals are likely to become an important way to limit the long-term temperature rise. Both of Shell's energy security scenarios envisage the need for multi-billion tonne a year carbon removals, which will need to be financed by emitters purchasing carbon credits. Demand for carbon credits in the voluntary carbon market is expected to grow significantly. CCS also has the potential to make a meaningful reduction in CO2 emissions. While there are only around 50 million tonnes per annum (mpta) of CCS in operation today, there are around 300 mtpa of projects under consideration [A]. Many net-zero scenarios show the industry growing to more than 1,000 mtpa by the mid-2030s. Global CCS Institute, 2023. The Global Status of CCS: 2023. Australia Shell's strategy to 2030 Our strategy transforms Shell into a net-zero emissions business by 2050 by delivering more value with less emissions. It supports our purpose– to provide more and cleaner energy solutions Our beliefs inform our strategy. While the energy transition will move at different paces in different countries, we expect global growth in demand for oil will slow this decade, and is likely to start declining in the following decade. We also expect global demand for LNG will continue to grow at least through the 2030s. We believe the world needs a balanced energy transition, one that maintains secure energy supplies, while accelerating the transition to affordable low-carbon solutions. Our strategy supports a balanced transition by providing the oil and gas people need today, while helping to build the energy system of the future. As we implement our strategy, we are becoming a multi-energy business offering our customers more and cleaner energy solutions. We are reducing emissions from our operations, and helping our customers move to cost-competitive and cleaner energy. Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses: Integrated Gas - Growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity.Upstream - Cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil production stable.Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions – Transforming our businesses to offer more low-carbon solutions while reducing sales of oil products. Delivering more value less emissions CFFO NZE Grow leading LNG position ~70% Leading Integrated Gas ~25% Achieve near-zero methane emissions Keep oil production flat ensuring cash flow longevity Advantaged Upstream Eliminate routine flaring High-grade portfolio ~30% Differentiated Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions ~75% Decarbonise our operations Apply value over volume Reduce oil product sales Pursue selective growth Grow low-carbon offerings Help customers decarbonise Decarbonise our operations Trading and optimisation capabilities [A] Net absolute emissions cover the Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions from our energy products; these are calculated by product and allocated to businesses based on final point of sales, so emissions associated with upstream production are largely included under downstream as point of sale. Today, around 70% of our cash flow comes from our Integrated Gas and Upstream businesses, with the remaining 30% generated by our Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses. The opposite is true for emissions. Around 75% of Shell's recorded emissions come from our Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses, with the vast majority generated when our customers use our products. The remaining emissions are generated within Integrated Gas and Upstream, with a large proportion also coming from when our customers use our products. Across all our businesses, more than 90% of our emissions are reported as Scope 3. Shell will reduce emissions over time as our product mix evolves to meet changing customer demand. We will continue to produce LNG and oil with less emissions, while the mix of our sales will move more towards low-carbon solutions such as biofuels, renewable energy and hydrogen, and away from oil products such as petrol, diesel and jet fuel into the 2030s.

Leading Integrated Gas Growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity We plan to grow our LNG business by 20-30% by 2030 compared with 2022. We are developing new projects with lower carbon intensity by using renewable power and carbon abatement technology in the form of carbon capture and storage. Beyond our own production, we will continue to add scale and flexibility to our portfolio by buying LNG from others. Our LNG business will remain a key priority for Shell, meeting continued strong demand especially in Asia where we send most of our shipments today. As we grow our LNG business we will be targeting opportunities which have an internal rate of return of 11% or higher.

It continued to play a vital role in providing energy security in Europe in 2023. LNG is also a critical fuel in the energy transition. It is the lowest-carbon fossil fuel, producing around 50% less carbon emissions than coal when used to generate electricity, according to the International Energy Agency. Compared with coal, LNG emits far lower amounts of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and other compounds that contribute to local air pollution.

LNG is the lowest-carbon marine fuel available at scale today and offers significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions compared with conventional fuels. LNG also offers a long-term decarbonisation pathway through bio-LNG when the supply is scaled up. Shell has developed the world's largest LNG fuelling network of ports and bunker vessels on key trading routes, enabling more customers to choose LNG. To deliver the full GHG benefits of LNG, methane emissions must be minimised. We are working with partners, industry and universities to develop and implement technologies that reduce methane emissions associated with the use of LNG. Reducing methane emissionsMethane emissions from natural gas and LNG contribute to global warming. Methane is a potent GHG and reducing emissions of methane is considered one of the most effective near-term actions to keep the more ambitious 1.5°C goal of the Paris Agreement within reach. As we grow our LNG business, we continue to make the reduction of methane emissions a priority. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030 across all our operations. Through our more efficient new plants, and projects to reduce methane emissions from existing assets and our shipping fleet, we aim to deliver LNG with some of the lowest methane emissions in our industry. We are working with others to increase transparency on methane emissions, improve accuracy of reporting and drive reductions in methane emissions across our industry. We have been enhancing the accuracy of our reported emissions through the implementation of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 reporting framework in our operated and non-operated assets. In 2023, Shell received UNEP's recognition for being on track to achieve OGMP 2.0's gold standard of reporting in its operated assets by the end of 2023 and non-operated assets by 2025. This would be the third consecutive year that Shell has achieved this highest standard. Working with others Shell is a signatory of the Oil and Gas Decarbonisation Charter launched at COP28, which focuses on driving down Scope 1 and 2, flaring and methane emissions. We led the development of the Methane Guiding Principles Coalition which brings together industry and civil society to drive reductions in methane emissions from the natural gas supply chain. Signatories of the Methane Guiding Principles are engaging with governments and industry in 20 countries to inform policies and regulations and disseminate best practice. Shell is a contributor to the OGMP 2.0 Methane Reporting Framework which is the only measurement -based international framework for methane emissions in the oil and gas sector. We are also a member of the Oil & Gas Climate Initiative which has launched the Aiming for Zero Methane Emissions by 2030 initiative. Role of LNG in the energy transition Supporting renewable energy: Using LNG for power generation offers flexibility and the ability to quickly ramp up or down. LNG will be essential for maintaining grid stability as the share of renewables increases. Reducing air pollution: Gas-fired power generation can help significantly reduce air pollution when compared to the emissions released by coal-fired plants. Industrial and high-temperature applications: Gas and LNG are important for sectors where electrification is challenging, such as high-temperature industrial processes. They provide the necessary energy intensity and reliability that renewables currently cannot match, helping industries like cement and steel on their decarbonisation journeys.

Energy security: While displacement of coal by renewables is expected to be dominant in the power sector, gas and LNG will also have an important role. They will continue to provide the flexibility electricity grids will need, and energy security in the coming decades in developed countries. Climate policy and emissions trading: In regions with stringent climate policies and emissions trading systems, such as the European Union, gas and LNG can help meet emissions targets by replacing more carbon-intensive fuels. Lower-carbon fuel for transport: In some of the slower-to-abate transport sectors, such as long-distance commercial road transport and marine, LNG can help with their decarbonisation journeys. It is a solution that is both available and more affordable today when compared with other low-carbon products, and reduces emissions when compared with oil-based products.

Advantaged Upstream Cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil production stable We continue to focus on more value and less emissions, and expect that our oil production will remain stable through to 2030. The oil we are producing will increasingly come from our world-class deep-water business. Through innovative designs, our deep-water platforms are producing higher-margin and lower-carbon barrels. Maintaining oil production this decadeOur oil production peaked in 2019, and by the end of 2023 had fallen by around 20%. We believe that continued investment will be needed to maintain oil supplies as existing fields naturally decline faster than reductions in demand. To keep production of crude oil and natural gas liquids stable to 2030 at 1.4 million barrels per day, we are focusing exploration on our existing positions and basins where hydrocarbons have been discovered already. This includes our high-margin deep-water positions. Across our upstream portfolio we are targeting an internal rate of return of 15% or higher. We do not anticipate any new frontier exploration entries after 2025 [A]. From the beginning of 2023 until the end of 2025, we will have started projects with a total peak production of more than 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. Around 40% of these projects are in deep water. They include the US Gulf of Mexico, where we are the leading operator and have one of the lowest GHG intensities in the world for oil production. As we continue to meet the world's demand, we will build on the strengths of our current portfolio to continue to deliver lower-carbon barrels with higher margins. A frontier entry refers to Shell participating in new exploration activities (seismic activities, exploratory drilling) outside countries where hydrocarbons have been discovered already (by Shell or other companies).

Decarbonising our operationsAs a responsible energy producer, we are implementing carbon management plans and reducing carbon emissions from our assets. We are looking at ways to electrify our offshore oil facilities, and using wind and solar power to reduce operational emissions. We see carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a core technology to further capture emissions from our facilities, reusing our own depleted oil and gas fields where possible. We are working towards our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations by 2025, five years ahead of the World Bank's initiative [A]. Routine flaring burns gas that is not used or reinjected into wells, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change. Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC Demonstrating progress on eliminating routine flaring million tonnes of hydrocarbons flared (reduction 91%) 2016 1.1 2021 0.2 2022 0.1 2023 0.1 Differentiated Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions Transforming our businesses to offer morelow-carbon solutions while reducing salesof oil products We are reshaping our Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses with a more focused geographic portfolio of products to deliver more value with less emissions. We aim to lead in the energy transition in areas where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. We are starting from a place of strength. Our global customer reach, and our supply and trading capabilities in low-carbon products, mean we are well placed to profitably deliver the low-carbon solutions people and businesses need. We are also able to identify changes in demand for products so that we can respond quickly. In the transport sector, for example, we see attractive growth opportunities in charging for electric vehicles and in biofuels for cars, trucks, planes and ships. We are strengthening these businesses to support our customers as they decarbonise and move from oil products to lower-carbon alternatives. As the energy transition evolves, we expect that growth in demand for oil products for transport will slow, and then decline. We are transforming our refinery portfolio and targeting value over volume in our marketing business. As a result, we will sell less oil products and more low-carbon products. Our strategy is to: Repurpose our remaining integrated refineries to focus on four regional energy and chemicals parks, providing cleaner molecules such as biofuels and hydrogen to help our customers decarbonise.Transform our marketing business by gradually reducing exposure to oil products used for transport, while changing our product mix by investing in areas such as electric vehicle charging, biofuels, and integrated power.Use technology and innovation to develop the business models and fuels of the future. The strength of our trading capabilities, coupled with our own production, will help us deliver affordable and low-carbon solutionsfor our customers. Focused on developing low-carbon solutions for today, tomorrow and the future Delivery today: Repurposing energy and chemical parks, Mobility and lubricant offeringsBuilding for tomorrow (2025+): Electric vehicle charging, low-carbon fuelsPreparing for the future (2030+): Hydrogen, Carbon removal and storageSupported and enabled by Integrated Power, trading and optimisation Delivering today Today, we are repurposing our remaining integrated refineries to focus on four regional energy and chemicals parks, which we are transforming into the low-carbon hubs of the future. As part of this process, we have completed the strategic review of our Energy and Chemicals Park Singapore with divestment as our preferred option. We are also high-grading our European energy and chemicals parks. This means retiring certain units and continuing with some divestments we have already announced. We are looking to strengthen our global retail and lubricants marketing businesses as the energy transition evolves, meeting the changing needs of our customers, and making value-driven choices region by region. That means growing our portfolio of low-carbon fuels and charging for electric vehicles in markets that meet our investment criteria such as China, Europe and the USA, and reducing our presence in others. As an example, we have signed an agreement to sell our shareholding in Shell Pakistan. Oil for lubricants and chemicals Most of the oil products sold by Shell are used in the transport sector. We estimate that 15-20% of the total oil products we sell are used for non-energy products such as lubricants and chemical products. Chemicals are used in many parts of modern life, from cosmetics to household goods. Lubricants are needed for virtually every machine and engine in operation. As these products are not combusted, their use does not cause Scope 3, Category 11 emissions. In 2023, Shell invested $2.3 billion in producing non-energy products including lubricants, chemicals, convenience retailing, agriculture and forestry, construction and road. We are upgrading our retail network, with expanded electric vehicle charging and convenience offers, in response to changing customer needs. In total, we plan to divest around 500 Shell-owned sites (including joint ventures) a year in 2024 and 2025. We are growing our premium lubricants portfolio to supply key energy transition sectors such as transformer oils used for offshore wind parks, and cooling fluids to support the development of electric vehicle car batteries. Supply, logistics and trading play a crucial role in ensuring we meet our customers' needs and generate strong returns. Our world-leading trading and optimisation business generates additional value by connecting supply and demand, for both conventional and low-carbon fuels across our global businesses. We will continue to grow our trading business in low-carbon molecules, carbon credits and power as the energy transition accelerates. Building for tomorrow (2025+) To build the businesses of tomorrow, we continue to strengthen our offer of low-carbon solutions where we see a significant increase in customer demand and supportive government policies. Between now and 2030, we are focusing on three areas where we have the potential to positively impact the energy transition by reducing the cost for our customers – electric vehicle charging, biofuels and integrated power. Electric vehicle charging We are growing our electric vehicle charging business to support customers who choose to change from a petrol or diesel vehicle to an electric one. We are focusing on offering our customers choices where we see increasing demand, such as in the fast-growing electric mobility markets of China and Europe. We aim to increase the number of public charge points we operate to around 200,000 by 2030, from around 54,000 today. Scaling our network of public EV charging points Thousands 2020 2021 2022 2023 2025 2030 Other 0.5 0.002 0.022 0.021 ~70 ~200 Asia 0.5 0.068 0.27 1.002 China 0 1.964 17.55 32.576 Europe 0 5.021 8.937 16.579 Americas 0 0.044 0.07 3.605 We are focusing on public charging, rather than home charging, because we believe it will be needed most by our customers. We have a major competitive advantage in terms of locations, as our global network of service stations is one of the largest in the world. We have other competitive advantages, such as our convenience retail offering which allows us to offer our customers coffee, food and other convenience items as they charge their cars. As we grow our business offering charging for electric vehicles, we expect an internal rate of return of 12% or higher. Biofuels We are expanding our world-leading biofuels business to meet growing customer demand and where we can use the strength of our supply and trading positions. Aviation and shipping remain some of the slower-to-decarbonise sectors and will require low-carbon molecular solutions such as biofuels and synthetic hydrogen-based fuels at scale in the future. Shell is already one of the world's largest energy traders and blenders of biofuels selling significantly more low-carbon fuels than we produce. We expect to continue to grow both our own production and sales of biofuels in the coming years. We are focusing on producing premium biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas (RNG). These fuels will help to reduce emissions in commercial road transport. To support our production of biofuels, we are investing in new feedstocks through investments and partnerships while using the strength of our trading business to expand sales beyond our production volumes. Through our Raízen joint venture in Brazil we are already the largest producer of second-generation ethanol and the leading sugar-cane ethanol producer globally. To support growing demand for biofuels this decade, we are developing more second-generation technologies. We are also developing technologies and feedstocks that aim to allow continued and sustainable growth in biofuels while minimising impacts on the environment and food supplies. Following the 2023 acquisition of Nature Energy, one of the largest producers of RNG in Europe, we have a strong position in RNG. We are actively looking for more opportunities to meet emerging demand for RNG, especially in north-west Europe. We expect to generate an internal rate of return of more than 12% from our new investments in low-carbon fuels. Integrated power We will continue to grow our integrated power business with selective investments in renewable power generation. We will also use the strength of our trading and optimisation capabilities to meet the growing need for flexible power storage solutions such as batteries. We already have a significant presence in battery and storage through both our ventures programme and investments in research and development. We are making disciplined choices to create value from our power portfolio, stepping back from activities that do not fit our strategy or that do not generate enough returns. We have exited renewable projects in Ireland and France, and sold our home energy businesses in the UK and Germany. We are focusing on selling power, including renewable power, to business customers. We are also using renewable power to decarbonise our own operations. Over time, we will also use our renewable power capacity to produce low-carbon molecules such as hydrogen. We expect returns from power generation to be in line with the market, at around 6-8% ungeared, with opportunities to create higher returns from areas such as trading and optimisation.

Preparing for the future (2030+) This decade, we are also focusing on developing integrated energy hubs, select carbon capture and removal businesses, such as CCS, and fuels of the future, such as hydrogen, to prepare to meet our customers' needs after 2030. We plan to create integrated energy hubs around our energy and chemicals parks in North America and north-west Europe, and other locations where we see significant potential for high growth in demand in the future. These include Australia, Brazil, China and India. We will be focusing our investments in these hubs as we integrate our businesses and trading capabilities to deliver affordable low-cost solutions to our customers. We are researching the development of fuels such as liquefied synthetic gas (LSG), which is produced when renewable hydrogen is combined with captured carbon dioxide (CO2) to create natural gas, which is then liquefied. This low-carbon gas can be directly used in existing gas networks and infrastructure, including LNG plants. Carbon capture and removal We are developing technologies related to carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon removals, which are necessary to reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives. For the rest of this decade, we will direct most of our investments in CCS towards decarbonising our own operations. We are also looking to turn this into a profitable business for Shell by helping other companies decarbonise their operations in the future. However, in many countries CCS still lacks a clear business model. To address this challenge, Shell advocates policy mechanisms to enable CCS, and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of commercially viable CCS projects. Direct air capture (DAC) technology can also play a key role in the energy transition. We are aiming to make it more affordable and scalable through several pilot projects. DAC extracts CO2 from the air to provide a carbon feedstock for synthetic products, or when coupled with transport and storage, to enable it to be stored underground. In combination with carbon capture and removal technologies, a functioning global carbon market will be a critical enabler of an accelerated energy transition. We are actively participating in carbon markets, and building and managing a diverse portfolio of high-quality carbon credits, including nature-based and non-nature based solutions, to help our customers decarbonise. Our transitions plans cover all our businesses Leading Integrated Gas Advantaged Upstream Differentiated Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions Focused decarbonisation pathwaysWe have identified pathways to net zero for our two biggest customer sectors, transport and industry. These two sectors make up more than 70% of global final energy demand and more than 55% of global carbon emissions today. Our pathways are based on where we believe we have the competitive advantages to provide our customers with the affordable productions they need though the transition.

Leading to our strategic decarbonisation areas for this decadeElectric vehicle charging Biofuels infrastructure Integrated power positions Co2 capture and removal value chains Enabled by our strengths and competitive advantages Trading capabilities and infrastructure networks Technology and innovation Policy and advocacy More value with less emissions: our actions Putting our strategy into action across all our businesses Our beliefs about the energy transition inform our strategy to deliver more value with less emissions. Our strategy is based on the areas where Shell has unique competitive strengths, allowing us to be a successful business through the energy transition. Growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensityAs we grow our world-leading liquefied natural gas (LNG) business by 20-30% by 2030, we will continue to reduce the carbon intensityof our operations. Our LNG joint venture in Canada (Shell interest 40%,non-operated) will use natural gas and renewable electricity to reduce emissions from the plant by more than one-third compared with the world’s best performing facilities when it starts up. The commissioning process is expected to begin in 2024 and will continue into 2025. In Qatar, Shell is a partner in the North Field Expansion, the largest LNG project in the world. It comprises the North Field East (Shell interest 6.25%) and North Field South (Shell interest 9.375%) projects. By using carbon capture and storage, these projects will help provide LNG with a lower-carbon footprint to our customers. Shell's share of these projects will be around 3.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG when production starts later this decade. Shell is working with shipping companies to help decarbonise the marine sector. Parts of the marine sector uses LNG to power some of its ships, with the aim of switching to liquefied biomethane or liquefied e-methane, a hydrogen-based fuel, in the longer term. Artificial intelligence for LNG Artificial intelligence (AI) is helping us reduce carbon emissions at LNG plants by using information from sensors to calculate the most efficient settings for equipment. At one LNG facility, we estimate these technology developments are reducing carbon dioxide emissions by around 340,000 tonnes a year. We have used these automation and optimisation technologies to reduce emissions at multiple LNG facilities. Reducing methane emissions We continue to enhance the accuracy of our reported methane emissions and reduce emission sources across Shell-operated assets. By the end of 2023, around 80% of fugitive-emission sources at our operated oil, gas and LNG production facilities used leak detection and repair programmes to tackle leaks and monitor equipment. Shell works with others to share our learnings and drive industry-wide action on methane operations. We are a founding signatory of the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 reporting framework and have been implementing the framework in our operated and non-operated assets, engaging with our non-operated joint-venture partners to achieve improved accuracy or reporting beyond our operations. We test and use latest technologies to monitor our emissions. In 2023, we successfully completed a pilot with GHGSat, a pioneer in methane detection, to test satellite capabilities for monitoring methane emissions from offshore facilities. The aim is to use this technology more widely in the future. We have also been using drones and satellites to monitor the methane emitted during the production and processing of natural gas, and the export of LNG. This has helped us reduce wells maintenance periods and carefully control gas dryness during processing to limit venting. We have reduced vented methane emissions at our QGC business in Queensland by more than 2,800 tonnes since 2017.

Reducing operational emissions is a key factor in the development of new projects. Our Vito deep-water platform (Shell interest 63.1%) in the Gulf of Mexico is one of our newest platforms and has a peak production of 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. The platform is expected to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by around 80% over its operating life, compared with its original design. In addition to the reduced emissions, Vito also cost 70% less than the anticipated cost of the original design, an example of creating more value with less emissions. Vito's design is being replicated in two other deep-water platforms in the Gulf of Mexico: Whale and Sparta. The Shell-operated Whale project (Shell interest 60%) is expected to start production towards the end of 2024 and is expected to operate with less emissions than Vito. A final investment decision for the Sparta project (Shell interest 51%) was announced in December 2023, with production due to begin in 2028. Shell will use the experience of the Vito and Whale projects to enhance the design and energy efficiency capabilities of Sparta. We are reducing the carbon intensity of new projects elsewhere. Timi in Malaysia (Shell interest 75%) is our first wellhead platform to be powered by a solar and wind hybrid power system. This unmanned platform, which delivered its first gas in August 2023, is around 60% lighter than a conventional tender-assisted drilling wellhead platform, helping to reduce the emissions needed to develop the project. Reducing routine flaring We are working to reduce routine flaring, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change. Our target is to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations by 2025 [A]. This commitment challenges us to move faster than the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative. In 2023, around 10% of our greenhouse gas emissions from flaring occurred at facilities where there was no infrastructure to capture the gas, which is similar to the 2022 figure. Overall flaring decreased to 2.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 from 3 million tonnes of CO2e in 2022. Subject to the completion of the sale of SPDC. In Norway, Shell is the operator of the Ormen Lange gas field (Shell interest 17.8%). This is an underwater facility connected to Nyhamna, an onshore processing and export plant. The Ormen Lange is powered by renewable hydroelectricity provided by the Norwegian grid. This same source of renewable hydroelectricity provides around 93% of the energy needed for Nyhamna. We are installing further underwater compression units to increase gas recovery from the Ormen Lange field, which will also be powered by the same renewable hydroelectricity. Within our Upstream portfolio we have made divestments, including the sale of our interest in the Malampaya gas field in the Philippines in 2022 and our Permian business in the USA in 2021. These sales were strategic moves, which also resulted in reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses: offering more low-carbon solutions We are reducing emissions associated with our refineries by transforming them into energy and chemicals parks. This transformation is under way at Norco in the USA, Scotford in Canada, Pernis in the Netherlands and Rheinland in Germany. In January 2024, we took a final investment decision to convert the hydrocracker of the Wesseling site at the Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland into a production unit for Group III base oils to produce high-quality engine and transmission oils. The repurposing of this refinery is a significant step towards serving our growing lubricant customer base with premium base oils, delivering more value with less emissions. The Wesseling site will stop processing crude oil into petrol,jet fuel and diesel by 2025. When it starts operations in the second half of this decade, the production unit will be highly electrified and is expected to cut Shell's Scope 1 and 2 emissions by around 620,000 tonnes a year. This is the latest development in the transformation of Rheinland, which includes investments in a 10-megawatt electrolyser to produce renewable hydrogen and a biomethane liquefaction plant. BiofuelsWe are developing biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas (RNG) to help our customers decarbonise without having to change their cars, trucks, planes or ships. Shell is one of the world's largest traders and blenders of biofuels, meeting around 6% of global demand. In 2023, around 9.7 billion litres of biofuels went into our petrol and diesel worldwide, compared with 9.5 billion litres in 2022. Raízen, our joint venture in Brazil (Shell interest 44%), is one of the world's biggest bioethanol producers, delivering some of the lowest carbon intensity biofuels available today. The majority of the ethanol and cellulosic ethanol produced by Raízen is sold unblended to international customers in markets such as Europe, Japan and the USA. It is used in the transport, pharmaceutical and manufacturing industries, among others. Raízen produced around 3.12 billion litres of ethanol in 2023, up from around 3 billion in 2022. Raízen's Costa Pinto plant produced 30 million litres of second-generation ethanol made from inedible agricultural waste in 2023, up from 26 million in 2022. In 2023, the joint venture also commissioned the first of eight advanced biofuel plants which it aims to build in Brazil. In February 2023, we completed the nearly $2 billion acquisition of Nature Energy, making us one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas (RNG) in Europe. RNG, produced by turning organic material such as agricultural waste into renewable energy, is a low-carbon fuel that can power trucks and ships. With our partners, Nature Energy owns and operates 13 biogas plants in Denmark and one plant in the Netherlands. The biofuels plant at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands is expected to be one of Europe's biggest once operational in the latter half of the decade. It is expected to be capable of producing 820,000 tonnes of biofuels from waste each year. This facility will have the capacity to produce enough renewable diesel to avoid 2.8 million tonnes of carbon emissions a year. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could account for more than half of the plant's biofuels capacity, with the rest being renewable diesel. Shell can adjust this mix to meet changing customer demand. SAF currently accounts for less than 0.1% of global aviation fuel. Shell's investment will help increase SAF production, which is vital if aviation is to cut carbon emissions. To support our biofuel production capacity, we are also investing in new feedstocks for biofuels. In 2022, Shell acquired waste recycling company EcoOils which produces advanced biofuels feedstock at its facilities in Malaysia and Indonesia. This will enable the production and supply of low-carbon fuels like SAF to customers. We also invested in agroforestry company Investancia Group (Shell interest 30%) in 2022. Together, Shell and Investancia are using degraded cattle land in Paraguay to plant pongamia oil trees to grow sustainable feedstock to make biofuels. Lower-carbon race fuel for Scuderia Ferrari Shell has developed a race fuel containing 10% of second-generation bioethanol for Scuderia Ferrari to use in its Formula 1 racing cars. We use digital simulation to predict the combustion behaviour and performance of each fuel blend to significantly reduce the development time, and maximise performance and efficiency. The team is now working on a 100% sustainable race fuel, which includes several different sustainable fuel components, to meet requirements for the 2026 Formula 1 season. Electric vehicle chargingShell is well positioned to become a profitable leader in public charging for electric vehicles, meeting the growing demand from drivers who need to charge on the go. At the end of 2023, we had around 54,000 public charge points for electric vehicles at Shell forecourts, on streets and at locations such as supermarkets. This was up from 27,000 in 2022. We expect to have around 70,000 public charge points by 2025 and around 200,000 by 2030. Shell Recharge, our public charging network, currently operates in around 33 countries. We opened our largest electric vehicle charging station in the world in China, the world's largest market for EVs, in September 2023. The 258 fast-charging points at the Shell Recharge Shenzhen Airport EV Station serve thousands of drivers every day. The charging points are partially powered by rooftop solar panels with the capacity to generate 300,000 kilowatt hours of renewable electricity a year. The charging station, a joint venture between Shell and Chinese electric car manufacture BYD (Shell share 80%), has a utilisation rate of two-and-a-half-times the local average. China is one of the most important growth markets for our Mobility business. In March 2023, we completed the acquisition of Volta Inc. in the USA. We now operate one of the largest public electric vehicle charging networks in the country, with more than 3,000 charge points across 31 states and more than 3,400 additional charge points in development. Integrated power positionsOur power business brings together our expertise in generation, trading and marketing. We are making selective investments in renewable generation, batteries and other grid-flexibility technologies, to provide low-carbon solutions to our commercial and industrial customers, and to decarbonise our own operations. We aim to profitably deliver more renewable power solutions, by growing our portfolio in select markets such as Australia, Europe, India and the USA. At the end of 2023, we had around 2.5 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity in operation, 4.1 GW under development and around 40 GW of potential capacity in our pipeline globally, including utility-scale solar and integrated wind-to-hydrogen projects. In 2023, Shell sold around 279 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, which is more than enough to meet the annual needs of Australia. In the USA, the solar, wind and battery company Savion, which we acquired in 2021, has started to develop new solar plants. Once operational, they will generate around 500 megawatts (MW) of renewable power. We are also investing in growing our renewable energy capacity elsewhere. In 2022, we acquired Sprng Energy in India and in 2023 we acquired Isemaren in Spain. We are also developing our own positions, such as our Pottendijk and Koegorspolder solar farms in the Netherlands. In 2023 in the Netherlands, the Hollandse Kust Noord offshore wind farm (Shell interest 79.9%), which has a generating capacity of 759 MW, became operational. Hollandse Kust Noord will eventually produce the equivalent of almost 3% of electricity demand in the Netherlands. Ecowende (Shell interest 60%), our joint venture with Eneco, announced plans to develop a 760 MW wind farm nearby called Hollandse Kust West. We are also developing utility-scale battery storage systems in select markets. In March 2023, we entered into a partnership to deliver a battery storage system in Australia. Shell will have access to 100% of the battery system's offtake over a 20-year period. Completion of the project is expected in late 2024. HydrogenWe continue to invest in the production of hydrogen, looking for ways to expand the technology and reduce costs so that it becomes an affordable and available low-carbon option for the future. To deliver the full low-carbon potential of hydrogen, we continue to learn about where emissions, including methane, can occur during production and use. We are also identifying opportunities to address them in collaboration with others. We see a role for hydrogen as a feedstock, for example to make synthetic fuels, and as an energy carrier across industry and transport. At the end of 2022, we started to build Holland Hydrogen 1 in the Netherlands, which will be one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe when it becomes operational in the second half of the decade. The 200 MW electrolyser will be powered by renewable energy from the Hollandse Kust (noord) offshore wind farm. Holland Hydrogen 1 will help to decarbonise the production of our petrol, diesel and aviation fuel at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam. In the longer term, the plant could also supply hydrogen to help reduce emissions in transport and industry. In Oman, we acquired a 35% interest in Green Energy Oman, which will produce hydrogen from seawater, powered by up to 25 GW of solar and wind energy. Shell is the lead operating partner. The project is expected to be operational by the early part of the next decade and aims to produce around 1.8 million tonnes of hydrogen a year at full capacity. As a founding member of the H2 Accelerate consortium, Shell continues to work with partners to enable the use of hydrogen to decarbonise long-haul road transport across Europe. The consortium is trying to develop a programme to make hydrogen a commercially viable fuel for the trucking sector. Carbon capture and storage (CCS)Shell continues to work with governments, customers and partners to unlock the potential of CCS to reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives. CCS technologies are necessary to meet the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. However, in many countries CCS lacks a clear business model. To address this challenge, Shell advocates for policy mechanisms and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of commercially viable CCS projects. By the end of 2023, the Quest CCS facility at the Scotford upgrader in Canada (Shell interest 10%) had captured and safely stored more than 8.8 million tonnes of CO2 since it began operating in 2015. We are exploring the possibility of increasing CCS capacity at Quest, initially by 750,000 tonnes a year. Our Northern Lights CCS project (Shell interest 33.3%) in Norway signed contracts in 2023 to transport and safely store 1.2 million tonnes of CO2 a year. The CO2 will be shipped from two of Ørsted's biomass power plants in Denmark and a Yara ammonia and fertiliser plant in the Netherlands. It will then be stored 2,600 metres below the seabed in the North Sea. In Australia, the Gorgon CCS project (Shell interest 25%, operated by Chevron) reported it had stored more than 9 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent by the end of 2023. In addition to these significant emission reductions, Chevron has confirmed it had acquired and surrendered carbon credits to address historical injection shortfalls. The project started operating in 2019 and is the largest CCS operation in the world. Construction of Porthos, Europe's largest CCS facility, will begin at the port of Rotterdam in 2024. Shell will be the biggest customer, supplying 1 million tonnes of CO2 a year. The captured CO2 will be transported to empty gas fields under the North Sea around 20 kilometres off the Dutch coast. This will reduce the Netherlands' annual CO2 emissions by around 2% for 15 years from 2026. In 2023, Shell and Esso were jointly awarded three licences in the UK's first-ever carbon storage licensing round. The joint venture (Shell interest 50%) will evaluate three sites in the North Sea for the potential storage of CO2 captured and transported from industrial facilities in the UK. Also in 2023, Shell's CANSOLV® carbon capture technology won a bid for deployment at a CCS plant in Abu Dhabi, UAE. The plant will capture and permanently store 1.5 million tonnes of CO2 a year. Direct air capture Shell's research programmes have been developing technology to directly remove carbon from the atmosphere for several years. In 2023, we took the decision to build a direct air capture (DAC) demonstration unit at our technology research centre in Houston, Texas, USA. The aim of the project, which has a targeted start-up date of 2025, is to prove the viability of Shell's solid sorbent technology. The unit is being developed by a diverse team of Shell scientists, engineers and technical experts across the globe. Integrated energy hubs As part of our approach to the energy transition, we are developing integrated energy hubs to reduce our own emissions and those of the products we sell. At our Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands, for example, we are integrating biofuels, hydrogen and CCS into our existing facilities. We have started to build Holland Hydrogen 1 which will help to decarbonise fuel production at the nearby energy and chemicals park once operational. The hydrogen plant will be powered by renewable energy from the Hollandse Kust (noord) offshore wind farm. Some of the emissions from the energy hub will be captured and stored under the North Sea by two CCS projects once they are in operation. These are Porthos, where we are the biggest customer, and Aramis, a joint venture. As the market develops, we will seek opportunities for future projects and use our customer relationships to meet increasing demand for low-carbon solutions.

They may be used by Shell and its customers to compensate emissions in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate. We are clear that carbon credits need to have a robust carbon benefit and deliver a positive impact on ecosystems and communities. We work closely with local partners to ensure that the carbon credits projects we invest in are of a high quality. We select projects that are certified under credible and independent carbon credit standards. These include the Verified Carbon Standard, Gold Standard and the American Carbon Registry. We do this to ensure that the carbon credits are real and verifiable, and that issues such as permanence, additionality and leakage have been adequately considered. We also help develop and buy carbon credits generated by other nature-based projects and by technologies. We carefully source and screen the credits we purchase and retire from the market. In 2023, Shell's net carbon intensity (NCI) accounted for 20 million carbon credits, of which 4 million were linked to the sale of energy products. Of the 20 million tonnes of carbon credit retirements included in Shell's NCI metric for 2023, 85% were certified by Verra, 9% by the American Carbon registry, 6% by Gold Standard, and less than 1% via Australian Carbon Credit Units. Tracking SAF with blockchain We are using new technologies to power our Upstream and Downstream assets, improve our trading and supply operations, and deliver compelling new materials and molecules. Avelia, a business model developed in partnership with Accenture and American Express Global Business Travel, uses blockchain to help our customers securely and transparently track emissions reductions and the environmental attributes of the sustainable aviation fuel they acquire, tracing it from production through to delivery into aviation fuelling networks. Technology and innovationBuilt on more than 125 years of technological innovation, our company's future performance depends on the successful development, demonstration and commercial deployment of new technologies and new products. In 2023, research and development expenditure on projects that contributed to decarbonisation was around $628 million, up from around $440 million in 2022. The 2023 figure represents around 49% of our total expenditure on research and development, up from around 41% in 2022.

Our technology and innovation portfolio helps to deliver Shell's strategy by: Achieving more value with less emissions across our core businesses today. For example, the Just Add Water System, developed by Shell, uses a software system to reduce fuel costs for marine vessels and the GHG emissions they emit.Creating the low-carbon products and solutions of tomorrow, such as our CANSOLV® carbon capture technology which will be deployed on the world's largest CCS plant in Abu Dhabi.Exploring the transformative technologies of the future, such as renewable hydrogen, direct air capture, and heat and power storage solutions. The technologies and business models we are developing will shape the products and services we offer our customers in the transport and industry sectors. At our Zhuhai plant in China, which produces lubricants and greases, we have introduced a thermal energy storage system. This system replaces diesel fuel with renewable electricity to generate the process steam required for manufacturing lubricants. The storage system will optimise steam production and is expected to reduce the use of diesel by 300 tonnes and CO2 emissions by more than 900 tonnes a year. By demonstrating the benefits of this type of system on a Shell facility, we are in a position to encourage and support the decarbonisation of our customers. We invest in the latest energy technologies through our partnerships with start-ups and leading academic institutions. For example, we are working with Imperial College London in the UK to develop new technologies, with a particular focus on electric vehicles, lubricants, energy storage, CCS, and materials. Powering industry through investments Shell Ventures invests in start-ups and bigger companies that seek to electrify energy systems, decarbonise transport, gain data-based insights and provide innovative customer solutions. In 2023, we invested in a German company called Kraftblock, which has created energy storage systems to help the industry sector switch from fossil fuels to renewable energies. The technology also allows customers to recycle waste heat. Shell Ventures is a partner with Norwegian company Corvus Energy, a leading supplier of safe, innovative and reliable energy storage solutions for the maritime industry. The company's battery storage systems replace diesel and bunkering oil, thereby reducing emissions. The storage systems are used on vessels in Shell's operations in the Gulf of Mexico. Climate policy engagement Comprehensive, coherent and consistent policies are a crucial part of the journey to net zero. With the right policy and regulatory conditions, we can profitably increase our investments through the energy transition. We advocate robust policies, legislation and regulations in areas where we can best support the decarbonisation of our customers and reduce our own emissions. Our advocacy, directly to governments, and indirectly through industry associations and coalitions, is a key part of our strategy. Shell engages with governments, regulators and policymakers in different ways to help shape policy, legislation and regulation. Our public policy positions serve as a framework for our advocacy with governments, international organisations, industry associations, and other stakeholders, globally, regionally and within countries. In using the positions, we recognise that the pace of the energy transition will vary around the world. In the table below, we show how our advocacy focuses on four key areas which we believe are critical to the energy transition and will support Shell's strategy. Policy and advocacy Advocacy Themes: A Achieving net-zero emissions Cross-sector policies that support the achievement of national net-zero ambitions through comprehensive policy frameworks and carbon pricing, and which seek to ensure a just transition B Supplying the secure energy the world needsPolicies that support energy security, such as clear and predictable regulatory frameworks that enable the production of hydrocarbons with lower emissions C Driving changes in demandPolicies that support changes in customer demand in transport and industry, such as vehicle standards, mandates for sustainable aviation fuel, and demand for low-carbon products D Growing low-carbon solutionsPolicies that encourage the development of low-carbon solutions, including incentives for biofuels, flexibility in feedstock choices, and effective regulatory frameworks for hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS) Sector Policy Positions Advocacy Theme Cross cutting themes Translate targets into net-zero policy frameworks to achieve national net-zero emissions goals A Put a price on direct carbon emissions, integrate credits into carbon markets and support international cooperation A Regulatory frameworks that enable the production of hydrocarbons with lower emissions and the responsible management of end-of-project liabilities B Aim for near-zero methane emissions and an end to routine flaring as soon as possible and no later than 2030 B Recognise the role of gas in facilitating the energy transition and in securing stable and flexible energy supplies B Maintain liberalised power markets, enable uptake of power purchase agreements, and accelerate permitting and grid connections D Drive demand for low-carbon fuels through mandates and fuel standards, and allow flexibility in feedstock choice while meeting strong sustainability standards D Transport Road transport Establish policy frameworks for road transport that support the widespread adoption of low-emission vehicles and support investment in infrastructure through simplified and faster permitting and grid connections C Aviation Incentivise production of sustainable aviation fuel and set mandates to drive demand C Marine Establish a global carbon intensity standard for marine fuels to drive lower-carbon fuel uptake C Industry and services Encourage low-carbon energy use in industry through mandates and low-carbon product demand, and support investment in infrastructure networks and industrial hubs C Support production and demand for low-carbon hydrogen and accelerate infrastructure planning and investment D Carbon abatement and removal Recognise the role of carbon credits and ensure quality and integrity through standards and frameworks A Provide incentives for CCS, ensure efficient permitting and licensing of CCS infrastructure, and create regulatory frameworks that support storage and international transport and trading of CO2 D Read more about our policy positions on Shell.com/advocacy-and-political-activity Advocacy in action Advocating policies that encourage demand for and incentivise investment in low-carbon solutions is a key part of our engagement with governments and regulators. In the USA, for example, we advocate permits for projects to be granted faster and with fewer hurdles. Delays, caused in part by prolonged litigation, negatively impact the delivery of projects. We believe reform of the permit system will help to deliver new projects relating to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. To achieve this reform, we have constructively engaged in legislative negotiations in the House of Representatives and Senate to advance bipartisan legislative solutions. In the EU, Shell is advocating policies to enable commercial investments in the energy transition, notably the creation of demand for low-carbon solutions. We supported the Fit for 55 package, including binding targets for the use of renewable hydrogen and advanced biofuels. We supported policies to accelerate the electrification of road transport and frameworks that help the business case for carbon abatement and removal. In Brazil, we advocate the establishment of a national emissions trading system (ETS), which is a form of carbon pricing. We believe this would incentivise decarbonisation at the lowest cost, and support the long-term development of a global carbon market. The ETS is awaiting a final review by the Federal Senate, after which it is expected to be written into law. In the Asia-Pacific region, Shell is working with local and national governments to develop policy and regulatory frameworks for CCS. The creation of cross-border CCS hubs in the region could benefit multiple industries across the region. In 2024, Shell and ExxonMobil were selected to work with the Singapore government as lead developers for a cross-border CCS project that could store at least 2.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year by 2030.

Targets, ambitions and performance Our target is to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 It includes net-zero emissions from our operations, as well as net-zero emissions from the end-use of all the energy products we sell. In the short and medium term, we have set climate targets for emissions that we are able to control, namely our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, methane emissions, and flaring. We have also set climate targets and ambitions for emissions that are outside our control. These include our ambition to reduce the Scope 3, Category 11 customer emissions from the use of our oil products, and our target to reduce the net carbon intensity of all the energy products we sell. Targets and ambitions Net-zero emissions by 2050 (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) Emissions from our own operations (Scope 1 and 2) TargetHalving Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 [A] under operational control (2016 reference year) TargetEliminating routine flaring from Upstream operations by 2025 [B] TargetMaintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030 Emissions from the products we sell (Scope 3) TargetUpdated Net carbon intensity (NCI) Introducing a range of 15-20% for our target to reduce NCI by 2030 (2016 reference year) AmbitionNew Oil products ambition Reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030, Scope 3 Category 11 [C] (2021 reference year) On a net basis.Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC.Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021. Reducing our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions In October 2021, we set a target to halve the emissions from our operations (Scope 1), plus the energy we buy to run them (Scope 2), by 2030 compared with 2016 levels on a net basis. To decarbonise our operations, we are focusing on: making portfolio changes such as acquisitions and investments in new, low-carbon projects. We are also decommissioning plants, divesting assets, and reducing our production through the natural decline of existing oil and gas fields;improving the energy efficiency of our operations;transforming our remaining integrated refineries intolow-carbon energy and chemicals parks, which involves decommissioning plants;using more renewable electricity to power our operations; anddeveloping carbon capture and storage (CCS) for our facilities. If required, we may choose to use high-quality carbon credits to offset any remaining emissions from our operations, in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce, and compensate. The chart below shows our progress since 2016 in reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions and gives an indication of how we expect to achieve our target in 2030. The actions we will take to achieve our target will depend on the evolution of our asset portfolio and the continued development of technologies that reduce carbon emissions. We expect that on a net portfolio basis, new investments across our portfolio will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions between 2024 and 2030, but this increase will be outweighed by planned divestments and natural decline. Our investments in producing low-carbon energy such as biofuels will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, while reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell. Subsequent reductions in our emissions are reflected in the mechanisms outlined below and reflect an expected path to meeting our target in 2030. Working to reduce our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissionsScope 1 and 2 emissions in million tonnes per annum [A], [B] Scope 1 Scope 2 Target 2016 72 11 2020 63 8 2021 60 8 2022 51 7 2023 50 7 Portfolio changes -1.4 Efficiency improvements -3.33 Energy and chemicals park transformation -0.58 Use of renewable power -1.73 Carbon capture and storage -6.3 Carbon credits [C] -1.6 2030 41 The 2016 baseline was not recalculated in 2023. The 2016 baseline may be recalculated in future years if an acquisition or a divestment has an impact of more than 10% on the total Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Operational control boundary.Including nature-based solutions. Our direct GHG emissions (Scope 1, operational control boundary) decreased from 51 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2022 to 50 million tonnes CO2e in 2023, driven by several factors including: divestments in 2022 (e.g. Deer Park and Mobile refinery, Tunisia Miskar concession, offshore Baram Delta Operations (BDO) PSC and Block SK307 PSC in the Philippines) and handover of operations in OML 11 in Nigeria in 2022; unplanned downtime (e.g. Deer Park Chemicals); reduced flaring from assets including Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo); reduction activities and purchase of renewable electricity. These decreases were partly offset by Shell Polymers Monaca having more units online in 2023 and higher emissions from our Pearl gas-to-liquids plant and our Prelude floating liquefied natural gas facility with increased production. Our Annual Report and Accounts 2023 provides more details of how we reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Methane emissionsMethane emissions include those from unintentional leaks, venting and incomplete combustion, for example in flares and turbines. Our target to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% continued to be met in 2023. Shell's overall methane emissions intensity was at 0.05% for facilities with marketed gas and 0.001% for facilities without marketed gas. We believe our methane emissions are quantified according to industry best practice. This target covers all Shell-operated oil and gas assets in our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses. By the end of 2023, we reduced our total methane emissions by 70% since 2016. In 2023, Shell's total methane emissions were 41 thousand tonnes compared with 40 thousand tonnes in 2022. The increase was due to venting (for example, the maintenance of our Prelude asset and operational issues in assets operated by Sarawak Shell Berhad) and an increase in reported emissions from integrated gas assets in Canada resulting from the adoption of enhanced source level measurements in line with OGMP reporting requirements.

LNG and GTL assets), defined as the total volume of methane emissions in normal cubic metre (Nm3) per total volume of gas available for sale in Nm3. Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that do not market their gas (e.g. where gas is reinjected) defined as the total mass of methane emissions in tonnes per total mass of oil and condensate available for sale in tonnes.Total methane emissions for all assets under Shell operational control including Integrated Gas and Upstream and Downstream and Renewables Energy Solutions assets, quantified according to industry best practice. Routine flaringWe are working to reduce flaring, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change. Routine flaring of gas occurs during normal oil production when it is not possible to use the gas or reinject it into the well. In 2021, we brought forward our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations to 2025 [A] from 2030. This accelerates our commitment of 2015 to end routine flaring as a signatory to the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative. Total routine flaring from our upstream oil and gas assets remained relatively stable in 2023 compared with 2022 at 0.1 million tonnes, having reduced from 1.1 million tonnes in 2016. Around 50% of total routine and non-routine flaring in our Integrated Gas and Upstream facilities in 2023 occurred in assets operated by the SPDC and Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo). On January 16, 2024, Shell reached an agreement to sell SPDC to a consortium of five companies, subject to approvals by the Federal Government of Nigeria and other conditions. Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC. Reducing net carbon intensityWe have set targets to reduce the net carbon intensity (NCI) of the energy products we sell by 9-12% by 2024, 9-13% by 2025, 15-20% by 2030, and 100% by 2050. The intended use of the NCI metric is to track progress in reducing the overall carbon intensity of the energy products sold by Shell. Net carbon intensity measures emissions associated with each unit of energy we sell, compared with a 2016 baseline. It reflects changes in sales of oil and gas products, and changes in sales of low and zero-carbon products- such as biofuels, hydrogen and renewable electricity. Unlike Scope 1 and 2 emissions, reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by both Shell and our customers, with the support of governments and policymakers to create the right conditions for change. Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a strategic shift in our power business. We plan to build our integrated power business, including renewable power, in places such as Australia, Europe, India and the USA. We have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe because we do not believe that is where our strengths lie. In line with our shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we are concentrating on select markets and segments. One example is our focus on commercial customers more than retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect growth in total power sales to 2030 will be lower than previously planned. This has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against our previous target of a 20% reduction. Acknowledging uncertainty in the pace of change in the energy transition, we have also chosen to retire our 2035 target of a 45% reduction in net carbon intensity. The biggest driver for reducing our net carbon intensity is increasing the sales of and demand for low-carbon energy. The chart on the next page illustrates how changes in the volume of products and services we sell could result in net carbon intensity reductions through to 2030. The change in our sales of these products and services will also reflect the development and adoption of new technologies and infrastructure, and the adoption of public policies designed to encourage the energy transition. In 2023, Shell's NCI was 74 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule of energy (gCO2e/MJ), a 2.6% decrease from the previous year and a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016, the base year. The decrease in Shell's NCI in 2023 was mainly achieved through a reduction in the average intensity of power sold and the use of carbon credits. The power intensity reduction was driven mainly by progress in grid decarbonisation in key markets such as the USA and Europe, and partly by increased sales of renewable power, including the retirement of Renewable Energy Certificates. Working to reduce our net carbon intensity (NCI)NCI in gCO2e/MJ [A] Actual Target 2016 79 2021 77 2022 76 2023 74 Hydrocarbon sales [B] -1.1 Power sales [C] -7.4 Grow power sales Low-carbon fuels sales [D] -0.8 Grow biofuels, develop hydrogen Carbon capture and storage [E] 0.4 Develop Carbon capture and storage Carbon credits [F] -0.6 High-quality carbon credits 2030 -15-20% Grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule.Hydrocarbon sales reflect the effect of lower sales of oil products, and higher sales of natural gas. Emissions associated with gas are lower than those of oil products. Power sales show the expected growth of our integrated power business and increasing sales of renewable power. Sales of low-carbon fuels reflect higher sales of biofuels and hydrogen, which are low- and zero-carbon products. CCS reduces carbon emissions by capturing them at source. Carbon credits such as nature-based solutions can be used to offset remaining carbon emissions, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and industries including cement and steel. We undertake external verification of our GHG emissions annually. Our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from assets and activities under our operational control and emissions associated with the use of our energy products (Scope 3) included in our NCI have been verified to a level of limited assurance. Ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products We have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11). That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. [A] This level of ambition is in line with the European Union's climate goals in the transport sector, among the most progressive in the world. Achieving this ambition will mean reducing sales of oil products, such as petrol and diesel, as we support customers as they move to electric mobility and lower-carbon fuels, including natural gas, LNG and biofuels. [A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards..

Shell supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, which is to limit the rise in global average temperature this century to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. There is no established standard for aligning an energy supplier's decarbonisation targets and ambitions with the 1.5°C temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. For this reason, we have defined our net carbon intensity target using 1.5°C scenarios developed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6). We start with the complete set of 1.5°C scenarios [A] and then exclude scenarios which are too reliant on carbon removals or use of bioenergy before removing outliers. We then calculate an emissions intensity for each scenario which is comparable to our own net carbon intensity. Finally, we produce a 1.5°C pathway based on the reductions in emissions intensity over time. We have chosen to use a range instead of any individual scenario to better reflect the uncertainty of the energy transition. These are the AR6 scenarios which have a greater than 50% likelihood of limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot (C1) or of returning warming to 1.5°C after a high overshoot (C2). Overshoot describes how much the global temperature in a scenario exceeds 1.5°C before returning. We believe that using this pathway to set our targets demonstrates that they are aligned with the more ambitious 1.5°C goal of the Paris Agreement. This is illustrated in the chart below.

To achieve net zero, we will reduce emissions from our own operations, change the mix of the energy products we sell and grow new carbon removal and abatement businesses. At the same time, we will work to help advance the critical factors required for the world to achieve net zero. Critical factors on the path to net zeroThe scale of the energy transition requires fundamental change in both supply and demand. It will take supportive government policies, advances in technology and investments by companies across all parts of the economy to achieve this. We advocate policies, legislation and regulations in areas where we can best support the decarbonisation of our customers, reduce our own emissions and help accelerate the energy transition. To help stimulate demand, we are investing in scaling up low-carbon solutions so that they become an affordable choice for our customers. Through partnerships with start-ups and leading academic institutions, we are also helping to develop the technologies of the future that will be critical to achieving net zero such as direct air capture, renewable hydrogen and heat and power storage solutions. Multi-energy businessThere remains significant uncertainty around the shape of the future energy system. As a result, we are developing a multi-energy portfolio that has the flexibility to respond to uncertainty, and that will allow us to remain a successful business and achieve net-zero emissions. By 2050, we expect that low-carbon products and solutions will have grown to become a material part of our portfolio. These solutions will be in the form of sustainable biofuels as well as liquid synthetic products, such as synthetic kerosene for aviation, that will be created through new technologies. At the same time, we will have focused our oil and gas businesses on projects with higher margins and lower carbon emissions, while pairing these projects with carbon capture and storage to further reduce emissions. In addition to our energy sales, a core part of our future business will be helping customers to decarbonise in the sectors where we have competitive advantages, including by capturing carbon and storing it, or by using the carbon to produce low-carbon products such as hydrogen. While the journey to net zero will include significant challenges, it also presents many opportunities. Through the actions we are taking today, we are positioning Shell to deliver more value with less emissions as we transform into a net-zero emissions energy business.

It also needs to be a just transition, which means a fairer distribution of the costs and benefits of the world's transition to a net-zero emissions energy system. Shell aims to contribute to a just and inclusive transition by making a positive economic and social impact on communities, workers and customers. Closing the energy access gapToday, around 675 million people do not have access to electricity and 2.3 billion lack access to clean cooking facilities, according to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Shell has pledged $200 million as part of a broader initiative to help people get access to energy in the near and medium term. The initiative aims to help millions of people in underserved communities in sub-Saharan Africa, India and South-east Asia get access to electricity and improved cooking conditions. Skills for the futureAs more jobs are created in renewable energy, it is important to provide workers with the opportunity to learn new skills. This requires robust dialogue and collaboration between governments, businesses and the workforce. We are aiming to help 15,000 people in the UK get jobs with a focus on the energy transition by 2035. Shell, together with its partners, is supporting the creation of two energy transition skills hubs in Scotland and one in Wales. The facilities, which are expected to open in 2024 and 2025, aim to provide people with skills for the future, such as in wind turbine maintenance and heat pump installation. In 2023, around 6,900 Shell employees – up from around 4,000 in 2022 – completed courses linked to the energy transition, including hydrogen production, carbon capture and storage, and greenhouse gas and energy management. We use our existing structures to expand social dialogue with employees, employee representative bodies, relevant local government agencies and communities to address the social aspects of the energy transition and to advance human rights and labour rights. Equal opportunitiesEquality of opportunity for groups that have been traditionally under-represented in energy is an important element of a just transition. Shell has set an ambition to become one of the most diverse and inclusive organisations in the world. This is embedded in our company strategy and applies to all parts of our business. We currently prioritise four areas: gender, race and ethnicity, LGBT+ and disability inclusion and enablement. CommunitiesAt our Pottendijk wind and solar power park in the Netherlands, which opened in 2023, we are sharing the proceeds from the renewable energy we generate. Over the next 16 years we expect to pay around $2 million into a community fund, which the municipality of Emmen will use as the community sees best. In Nigeria, Shell-funded investment company All On has agreed to invest $11 million in 25 mini-grid projects across the country. The company plans to supply affordable solar energy to communities that need it the most. Human rights, governments and industryRespecting human rights is an essential element of a just transition. Shell is committed to respecting human rights, as set out in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Read more about our approach at shell.com/justtransition Climate governance Our governance framework is designed to effectively deliver on the energy transition ambitions and targets of our Powering Progress strategy, which seeks to deliver more value with less emissions. The Board reviews our energy transition strategy periodically and oversees its implementation and delivery. In 2023, the Board considered climate-related matters throughout the year, including the assessment of climate-related risks and the effectiveness of corresponding risk management activities. The Board also challenged and endorsed business plans, including consideration of major capital expenditures, acquisitions and divestments. Our remuneration policies are designed to challenge and support the Executive Committee (EC) to reduce net carbon emissions, while generating shareholder value. Energy transition targets were part of the 2023 annual bonus scorecard (15% weighting), applicable to the majority of Shell's employees, as well as the 2023 Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards for senior executives (25% weighting) and the 2023 Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards for other employees (12.5% weighting), both vesting in 2026. Carbon management framework (CMF) We employ several processes across our organisation to ensure that management teams can effectively monitor and manage climate-related matters, including the delivery of Group carbon targets. These processes are supported by a combination of carbon management standards in projects, business growth forums where portfolio decisions are made, and capability development programmes. To drive delivery of carbon targets in the 2023 operating plan cycle, our net carbon intensity targets were translated into net absolute emissions budgets for each business. This enabled trade-offs within those budgets between emitting carbon and generating shareholder value. We also use carbon metrics (profitability per unit of carbon emitted) in decision-making when comparing different growth opportunities against each other. For the 2024 LTIP and PSP awards, ""Shell's journey in the energy transition"" performance condition retains the same weightings as for 2023. The extent to which awards will vest will be based on a holistic assessment of progress towards reducing emissions from our operations and supporting our customers to reduce their emissions. This will be based on our journey to net-zero targets for our own operations of: Halving Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 under operational control on a net basis (2016 baseline); Eliminating routine flaring from upstream operations by 2025 [A]; andMaintaining methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieving near-zero methane emissions by 2030. It will also be based on progress in developments that support the energy transition to 2030 and beyond, such as the development of our power business (including renewables), lower-carbon LNG, biofuels, electric vehicle charging, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS). Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC. We will take into account progress towards achieving a 15-20% reduction in NCI by 2030 (2016 baseline) and a 15-20% reduction in customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 2030 (2021 baseline) [A]. We will also take into account Shell’s wider performance in accelerating the energy transition, for example by demonstrating leadership and advocacy in standard setting, alongside any other factors that are considered material. In 2024, we have adjusted the energy transition measure in our annual scorecard in light of our energy transition strategy update. By doing this, we continued to align to Shell’s strategic objective of becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, supporting a balanced energy transition by responsibly delivering the oil and gas people need today, while helping to build the clean energy system of the future. The metric ""Shell's journey in the energy transition"" in the annual bonus scorecard represents: LNG volumes – equity liquefaction;Reducing operational emissions – operational actions to reduce emissions in support of our target to achieve a 50% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emission by 2030, on a net basis; andSupporting customer decarbonisation – electric vehicle charge point roll-out. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes CO2e in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021. For further details see ""Governance of climate-related risks and opportunities"" in our Annual Report and Accounts 2023. Energy transition and advisory votes Shell offered its first Energy Transition Strategy for submission to a shareholder advisory vote at the 2021 Annual General Meeting. The vote offered shareholders an opportunity to engage with and support Shell's energy transition plans. Shell was one of the first companies in the world to introduce such a vote. In 2022 and 2023, Shell also offered an advisory vote on its progress in putting its energy transition plans into action in the previous year. Following engagements with institutional investors, we found that expectations around issues such as the inclusion of an absolute Scope 3 target influenced the voting decisions of many investors, rather than the progress report itself. As a result, going forward, the energy transition progress report will be part of the Annual Report and Accounts without an advisory vote, while the Energy Transition Strategy (this publication) will be updated and offered for an advisory vote at least every three years. Climate litigation Climate litigation Environmental activists continue to bring litigation against governments and companies for the effects of climate change on individuals and communities around the world. In the Netherlands, Shell is appealing a decision from the District Court of The Hague ordering us to reduce worldwide aggregate carbon emissions across Scope 1, 2 and 3 by net 45% by 2030, compared with 2019 levels. The order states that reductions in Scope 2 and 3 emissions should be on a ""significant best efforts basis"". We are appealing the decision because we do not believe this is the right solution for the energy transition. By focusing on one company, and only on the supply of energy rather than the demand for it, we believe the ruling is ineffective and even counterproductive in addressing climate change. It is not clear how Shell can be ordered to reduce the emissions it does not control from customers, who are not under a similar legal obligation to reduce their emissions. The court is also asking Shell to reduce emissions significantly faster than the EU, which has one of the most ambitious pathways in the world. Shell believes that by working together, with effective government policies, the world can help shift consumer demand to low-carbon products and develop the infrastructure and technology needed for the energy transition, while maintaining a secure and affordable supply of energy. Shell's appeal will be heard by the Dutch Court of Appeal in April 2024. As we wait for the outcome of the appeal, Shell is taking active steps to comply with the ruling. Climate standards and benchmarks Climate initiatives and benchmarks play a role in supporting Shell's efforts in the energy transition. They promote an ongoing dialogue between interested parties and highlight areas of progress against externally established criteria. Doing business in a clear, open way is a commitment we work hard to keep, and we promote transparency where possible throughout our industry. We continue to learn as we work to provide relevant information to key stakeholders groups. In doing so we work with a number of stakeholders including regulators, auditors, investors and non-governmental organisations. Our strategy and progress in the energy transition, as well as our efforts to increase transparency, are recognised across environmental, social and governance (ESG) frameworks. Over the years, our performance scores have improved consistently, as evidenced by the assessment done by various external parties, including the most recent analysis from the Carbon Tracker Initiative [A] which highlights Shell’s good practices and key improvements in the financial related climate disclosures. ESG rating agencies [B] 2020 2021 2022 2023 MSCI A AA AA AA Sustainalytics 36.8 H 35.1 H 34.7 H 33.7 H ISS C C+ C+ C+ ISSThe ISS ESG net zero alignment model evaluates whether companies have a credible decarbonisation strategy, including interim greenhouse gas emissions targets and substantiated commitments to achieving net zero by 2050. Shell is one of eight companies in the oil and gas sector that received a net zero overall alignment status of ""aligning"" in 2023. Flying Blind: In a Holding Pattern, Carbon Tracker Initiative, February 2024MSCI: A score of AA and AAA indicates the company is leading its industry in managing the most significant ESG risks and opportunities. Sustainalytics: A lower score indicates a lower risk of experiencing material financial impacts from ESG factors. ISS: Companies are rated on a 12-point scale from A+ (best) to D-(worst). Climate InitiativesTransition Pathway InitiativeThe Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) is a global, asset-owner led initiative which assesses companies' preparedness for the transition to a low-carbon economy. TPI assess a companies' performance and progress in the energy transition against internationally agreed benchmark. TPI's assessment is divided into two parts: management quality and carbon performance. Management quality describes a company’s carbon management practices and governance, with a higher score indicating better performance. Carbon performance compares a company’s emissions pathway against different climate scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement. The carbon performance scores indicate whether a company's targets and plans are aligned in the short-term (2025), medium term (2035), and long-term (2050). In terms of management quality, in 2023, we received the highest score of four (strategic assessment) for the management of our greenhouse gas emissions, and of risks and opportunities related to the low-carbon transition. This exceeds the average score of 3.2 across all assessed companies in the oil and gas sector (90) In relation to carbon performance, although Shell's goal of becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains unchanged, TPI no longer considers this target to be aligned with its 1.5°C benchmark. This is the result of TPI's approach to accounting for customer mitigation actions. Climate Action 100+Climate Action 100+ is an investor-led initiative that drives corporate action on climate change, representing investors with assets of around $68 trillion. Its net zero company benchmark assesses companies against three high-level goals set by investors: emissions reduction, governance, and climate-related disclosures. It tracks business alignment with a net-zero emissions future and the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C. The disclosure framework evaluates the adequacy of corporate disclosure in relation to key actions companies can take to align with the goals of the Paris Agreement, and is assessed by the Transition Pathway Initiative. The latest results for Shell are shown below, based on publicly disclosed information as of May 29, 2023. Disclosure framework 2022 2023 Yes, meets all criteria 5 2 Partial, meets some criteria 3 7 No, does not meet any criteria 1 1 We are disappointed to see that our ratings have deteriorated in some areas in the latest assessment, which is largely due to annual updates to the methodology used. We have a strong governance and commitment to transparency so that investors can continue to assess our climate strategy and compare our progress with that of other companies. We will continue our engagement with CA100+ and TPI with the aim of ensuring that our current targets and disclosures are reflected in their benchmark and hope we can continue to improve the outcome in their assessment. Task Force on Climate-related Financial DisclosuresSince 2017, Shell has supported the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The TCFD is a global initiative to get companies across all sectors to assess climate-related risks and opportunities. It recommends disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information aligned to its four core elements: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. Our climate-related financial disclosures are consistent with all the TCFD's Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures. Please refer to our Annual Report and Accounts 2023 for more details. Shell's disclosures related to recommendations by the TCFD are set out in the ""Our journey to achieving net zero"" section of the Annual Report.

All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management's current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management's expectations, beliefs, estimates, forecasts, projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as ""aim"", ""ambition"", ""anticipate"", ""believe"", ""could"", ""estimate"", ""expect"", ""goals"", ""intend"", ""may"", ""milestones"", ""objectives"", ""outlook"", ""plan"", ""probably"", ""project"", ""risks"", ""schedule"", ""seek"", ""should"", ""target"", ""will"" and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this report, including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell's products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets, and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative, judicial, fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks, including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities, delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics, such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak, regional conflicts, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and a significant cybersecurity breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions.

All forward-looking statements contained in this report are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc's Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023 (available at shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html and sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this report and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this report, March 14, 2024. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or other information. In light of these risks, results could differ materially from those stated, implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this report. Shell's net carbon intensityAlso, in this report we may refer to Shell's ""net carbon intensity"", which includes Shell's carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers' carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers' carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell's ""net carbon intensity"" is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries. Shell's net-zero emissions targetShell's operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Net Carbon Intensity (NCI) targets over the next ten years. However, Shell's operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target, as this target is currently outside our planning period.In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell's operating plans to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target. Forward-looking non-GAAP measuresThis report may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as [cash capital expenditure] and [divestments]. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc's consolidated financial statements. The contents of websites referred to in this report do not form part of this report. We may have used certain terms, such as resources, in this report that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Form 20-F, File No 1-32575, available on the SEC website sec.gov. Additional informationAs used in this Report, ""accountable"" is intended to mean: required or expected to justify actions or decisions. The accountable person does not necessarily implement the action or decision (implementation is usually carried out by the person who is Responsible) but must organise the implementation and verify that the action has been carried out as required. This includes obtaining requisite assurance from Shell companies that the framework is operating effectively. ""Responsible"" is intended to mean: required or expected to implement actions or decisions. Each Shell company and Shell-operated venture is responsible for its operational performance and compliance with the Shell General Business Principles, Code of Conduct, Statement on Risk Management and Risk Manual, and Standards and Manuals. This includes responsibility for the operationalisation and implementation of Shell Group strategies and policies. CO2 compensation does not imply that there is no environmental impact from the production and use of the product as associated emissions remain in the atmosphere. CO2 compensation is not a substitute for switching to lower emission energy solutions or reducing the use of fossil fuels. Shell businesses focus first on emissions that can be avoided or reduced and only then, compensate the remaining emissions. ""carbon neutral"" or ""CO2 compensated"" indicates that Shell will engage in a transaction where an amount of CO2 equivalent to the value of the remaining CO2e emissions associated with the raw material extraction, transport, production, distribution and usage /end-of-life (if Lubricants or other non-energy product) of the product are compensated through the purchase and retirement of carbon credits generated from CO2 compensation projects. Although these carbon credits have been generated in accordance with international carbon standards, the compensation may not be exact. CO2e( CO2 equivalent) refers to CO2, CH4, N2O.

The underwriters have an option to purchase additional shares. CEO to purchase 14,814 shares at the public offering price. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the secondary offering of 11,373,801 shares by Apache Midstream LLC, a subsidiary of Apache Corporation, is a significant liquidity event that merits attention. At a price of $33.75 per share, the offering represents a substantial capitalization event for the Selling Stockholder. It is noteworthy that Kinetik Holdings Inc. will not receive any proceeds from this transaction, which implies that the company's capital structure and operating funds remain unaffected. However, investors should consider the potential dilutive effect of the additional 1,706,070 shares that may be purchased by the underwriters within the 30-day option period.Furthermore, the CEO's decision to purchase 14,814 shares at the public offering price could be interpreted as a signal of confidence in the company's future prospects. This action may influence investor sentiment and potentially affect the stock's performance in the short term. The involvement of prominent financial institutions as book-running managers and co-managers indicates a high level of interest and confidence in the offering, which could have positive implications for the stock's liquidity and future price stability. Market Research Analyst Examining the market implications, the secondary offering by Kinetik Holdings Inc. is indicative of Apache Midstream's strategic financial management, potentially aimed at reallocating capital within its portfolio or realizing gains from its investment in Kinetik. This move may signal to the market Apache's assessment of Kinetik's valuation or a shift in Apache's investment strategy.For Kinetik, the offering could have various market implications. While the company's equity base is expanding, the sale does not directly benefit Kinetik's financial position since the proceeds do not go to the company. Market response to such offerings can be mixed, as existing shareholders may be concerned about the dilution of their shares, while potential investors might see an opportunity to invest in the company at a set price. The CEO's share purchase can be seen as a commitment to the company's performance and may mitigate some dilution concerns. Legal Expert Legally, the secondary offering is conducted under a registration statement that became effective upon filing, which suggests compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations. The preliminary prospectus supplement provides essential details about the offering and must be scrutinized for legal accuracy and completeness. It is essential for potential investors to review these documents thoroughly to understand the terms of the offering and the risks involved.The legal framework governing such transactions is designed to protect investors by ensuring transparency and the provision of all material information. The role of the underwriters is also critical as they are responsible for the distribution of shares and must adhere to both regulatory requirements and due diligence processes to ensure the success of the offering. 03/14/2024 - 12:39 AM HOUSTON & MIDLAND, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Kinetik Holdings Inc.

This collaboration not only enhances the supply chain resilience by localizing production but also aligns with the growing demand for renewable energy infrastructure. The creation of a facility capable of producing critical steel components for solar trackers domestically is expected to shorten lead times and reduce logistical costs, potentially improving Nextracker's market position in Australia.Furthermore, the investment in local manufacturing is likely to have a ripple effect on the economy, creating jobs and supporting the government's clean energy initiatives. The production capacity of up to 50,000 tonnes of torque tubes indicates a significant scale, which could cater to multiple large-scale solar projects. The commitment to sustainability and the transition to renewable energy sources is also a positive signal to stakeholders and may enhance the corporate image of the companies involved. Environmental Economist From an economic perspective, the establishment of the manufacturing facility for solar tracker components represents a forward-thinking approach to energy production and consumption. By focusing on reducing the carbon footprint through local manufacturing, the initiative supports Australia's transition to a low-carbon economy. This move can be seen as a proactive response to climate change, which is increasingly becoming a factor in investment decisions and consumer preferences.Additionally, the investment in renewable energy technology manufacturing could lead to long-term cost savings for the solar energy industry, as well as for end-users, by reducing dependency on imported materials. This aligns with the broader economic trend towards sustainable development and may provide a competitive edge as global markets increasingly favor environmentally responsible products and practices. Financial Analyst The announcement has direct implications for the financial performance of the companies involved. For BlueScope Steel, the investment in the facility represents a strategic diversification into the renewable energy sector, which could open new revenue streams and provide a hedge against the volatility of traditional steel markets. For Nextracker, the ability to deliver high-quality products faster to its customers in Australia could translate into increased sales and market share, as evidenced by Rystad's data indicating Nextracker's leadership in the Australian solar tracker system market.The financial impact on BlueScope Steel's stock (ASX:BSL) and Nextracker's stock (Nasdaq: NXT) will depend on the operational efficiency of the new facility, the uptake of solar energy projects in Australia and the companies' ability to capitalize on the growing renewable energy market. The strategic nature of this investment suggests a positive outlook for both companies, provided they can maintain quality and meet the anticipated demand from the renewable energy sector. 03/13/2024 - 10:00 PM The first project scheduled to receive delivery of Australian made steel components from the facility is ACCIONA Energia’s 480MWp Aldoga Solar Farm to be built near Gladstone BRISBANE, Australia--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Nextracker (Nasdaq: NXT), a global market leader of solar tracker and software solutions, and Orrcon Steel, a leading Australian manufacturer of tube and pipe, and distributor of steel products and wholly owned business of BlueScope Steel (ASX:BSL), announced an agreement today to manufacture and deliver Australian made critical components for Nextracker’s smart solar tracker used on distributed generation and utility-scale solar farms.

Announces Pricing of $3.85 Million Private Placement Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Solidion Technology, Inc. announces a private placement to raise $3.85 million through the issuance of 5,133,332 units and pre-funded units. The net proceeds will be used for general working capital and administrative purposes. The private placement is expected to close on March 14, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The capital raise by Solidion Technology, Inc. through a private placement is significant as it indicates the company's need for additional working capital and its strategy for growth. The amount of $3.85 million, while not substantial for large corporations, can be quite impactful for a smaller company like Solidion. The use of proceeds for general working capital and administrative purposes suggests that the company might be looking to scale operations or invest in research and development activities that are not specified in detail. This move could be a response to the competitive environment in the advanced battery technology sector, which is rapidly evolving and requires continuous investment.From a financial perspective, the issuance of units and pre-funded units with warrants attached provides investors with the potential for future equity at a predetermined price. The structure of this deal, particularly the low exercise price of the warrants, could dilute existing shareholders but also reflects the company's current valuation and the risk appetite of the investors. The involvement of a reputable placement agent like EF Hutton could add credibility to the offering and possibly attract institutional investors looking for exposure in the tech sector, particularly in sustainable and advanced energy solutions. Legal Expert The securities being offered by Solidion have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, which is a common practice in private placements targeting accredited investors. This exemption allows the company to raise capital more quickly than through a public offering, though it limits the pool of potential investors. The commitment to file one or more registration statements for the resale of the shares indicates a future transition to public tradability of these securities, which is an important consideration for investors regarding liquidity.It's also noteworthy that the company has engaged two law firms for the private placement, which underscores the complexity and importance of the transaction. Benesch Friedlander Coplan & Aronoff LLP and Loeb & Loeb LLP's involvement in this transaction ensures adherence to regulatory requirements and the structuring of the securities in a manner that is compliant with the law. Market Research Analyst The advanced battery technology market is a high-growth area, driven by the increasing demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy storage solutions. Solidion's capital raise could signal a strategic move to capitalize on market trends and position itself competitively. The company's performance and ability to utilize the raised funds effectively will be critical in determining their market position in the future.Investors may view this capital infusion as a positive development, provided Solidion can translate the additional resources into revenue-generating projects or technological advancements. However, the potential dilutive effect of the warrants and the reliance on future stockholder approval for the warrants' exercise could introduce volatility to the stock's performance. Monitoring the company's subsequent regulatory filings and performance metrics will be essential in assessing the impact of this capital raise on its market valuation and growth trajectory. 03/13/2024 - 09:08 PM DALLAS, TEXAS, March 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Solidion Technology, Inc., (the “Company,” ""Solidion,” “we,” “our” or “us”), an advanced battery technology solutions provider, today announced that it has entered into a securities purchase agreement with institutional investors to raise approximately $3.85 million in aggregate cash proceeds, before deducting fees to the placement agent and other offering expenses payable by the Company. The closing of the private placement is expected to occur on March 14, 2024, subject to the satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions set forth in the securities purchase agreement. In connection with the private placement, the Company will issue an aggregate of 5,133,332 units and pre-funded units. The pre-funded units will be sold at the same purchase price as the units, less the pre-funded warrant exercise price of $0.0001. Each unit and pre-funded unit will consist of one share of common stock (or pre-funded warrant), two common warrants each exercisable for one share of common stock at an exercise price of $0.75 per share and one common warrant at an exercise price of $0.0001 to purchase such amount of shares of common stock as will be determined on the Reset Date (as defined in the Series B common warrant). The common warrants will be exercisable upon issuance and will have a term of 5.5 years from the stockholder approval date. The number of securities issued under the units is subject to adjustment as described in more detail in the Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed in connection with the private placement. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the private placement primarily for general working capital and administrative purposes.

These new services from JetBlue will mean greater choice and value for our passengers and the Dublin Airport looks forward to working with JetBlue tonight ensure they are a flying success,” said Gary McLean, Managing Director, Dublin Airport. “We are delighted that JetBlue has chosen to initiate new nonstop services to Ireland. The introduction of the new routes from New York and Boston to Dublin is exciting news for tourism to the island of Ireland. We look forward to working closely with JetBlue to maximize the promotion of these services. Direct, convenient, and competitive access is critical to tourism,” said Alice Mansergh, Tourism Ireland CEO. “Tourism Ireland is committed to working with airline partners like JetBlue and other key partners to drive demand for these new routes, and, through our multi-faceted campaigns, to communicate to consumers the ease and convenience of traveling from the East Coast to Ireland and the great experiences and warm welcome that awaits.” With this new destination, JetBlue is once again disrupting transatlantic service with an elevated experience specially designed for its Airbus A321neo with Mint aircraft. The airline’s Mint premium experience offers customers fully lie-flat private suites with a sliding door and a custom-designed seat cushion developed by innovative mattress company Tuft & Needle. In addition to countless intuitive design touches, every customer will feel at home in the air with the newly launched Mint amenity kits.

Asep aims to address antibiotic failure by developing antimicrobial peptides using AI, showing promising results. Positive None. Negative None. 03/13/2024 - 08:11 PM VANCOUVER, BC, March 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - In a recent presentation to the US Biophysical Society in Philadelphia1, Asep Medical Holdings Inc. (""Asep Inc."" or the ""Company"") (CSE: ASEP) (OTCQB: SEPSF) (FSE: JJ8) CEO Dr. Bob Hancock announced how the ground-breaking use of artificial intelligence (AI) has allowed the development of new and improved treatments for biofilm infections. Biofilms are communities of bacteria that infect surfaces and cause 65% of all infections. They are very hard to treat, highly resistant to all antibiotics and no FDA-approved treatment for biofilms has been developed. Asep Medical's peptides have very potent activity against biofilms and thus have the potential to replace current sub-optimal treatments, including physical removal and combinations of antibiotics. Neural network artificial intelligence (AI) methods were applied to predict improved peptides based on the company's extensive stock of proprietary peptides and, in company-sponsored studies, have been shown to enable the prediction of improved peptides with substantially higher activity against biofilms2. This has allowed the company to enhance both activity and ability to suppress inflammation (the primary pathology of biofilm infections) and to explore the diverse markets impacted by biofilms, which cost global health care an estimated $368 billion annually3. These markets include oral health (dental) care4, wounds5 and chronic rhinosinusitis6, all addressed by Asep peptides that show excellent activity in model infections. Asep's first-generation product will be an oral irrigant/rinse for preventing biofilm infections in the oral cavity, which can lead to infections and erosion of teeth and dental implants. Another use for AI technology (LASSO regression) is in the development of the SepsetER blood-based gene expression test that is preparing to enter 510(k) regulatory approval studies in the USA. This test was developed at the University of British Columbia (UBC) under the guidance of Prof. Robert E. W. Hancock and analyzes the dysfunctional immune responses involved in sepsis7. Artificial intelligence8,9 was used to identify the minimum set of genes involved in a process termed cellular reprogramming (one of the types of immune dysfunction in sepsis), and it was shown that the expression of just 6 genes can accurately predict whether a patient will acquire sepsis and associated multi-organ failure. ""We have harnessed AI to diagnose sepsis. Sepsis is a severe disease responsible for one in five deaths worldwide1 and essentially all deaths from pandemic microbes like COVID-19,"" says Dr. Hancock, Chair and CEO of Asep Inc. ""It is critical to identify sepsis as early as possible due to the 7.6% increased risk of death10 for every hour of delay in diagnosis and initiation of appropriate treatment. No conventional assay exists that accurately predicts sepsis onset in the first hours after a patient enters the hospital. Asep scientists have found that SepsetER can predict whether a patient will subsequently acquire sepsis in 9 out of 10 patients in the ICU and 7 of 10 patients in the emergency department, based on analysis of company and published data"". AI was also used to simplify the extreme complexity7 of sepsis, which has limited treatments to date. In clinical studies of patients from 4 countries/4 continents published by the Lancet Journal EBioMedicine8 and the Nature Journal Scientific Reports9, LASSO regression AI methods were applied. Five groupings (endotypes) of patients were identified as showing major differences in the underlying immune defects in each group8. These endotypes could be assessed using simple gene assays that were 89-97% accurate8. ""Deciphering the underlying immune defects of sepsis patients is key to devising precision treatments tailored to the specific type of sepsis in patients,"" stated Asep CSO Dr. Evan Haney, ""This will form the basis of a second test in development."" OVERCOMING ANTIBIOTIC FAILUREThe failure of antibiotics11 due to delayed diagnosis of sepsis, the high prevalence of recalcitrant biofilm infections and increased antibiotic resistance, compounded by declining antibiotic discovery, are among society's most pressing health issues. As described above, Dr. Hancock and his team have applied AI to discover a host of antimicrobial peptides (strings of a dozen or so amino acids), representing a promising new class of antibiotics. Asep Inc. has adapted these AI methods to address antibiotic failure associated with biofilms (a multi-cellular growth state of bacteria adaptively resistant to conventional antibiotics)12,13. Dr. Hancock's team used peptide array technology to prepare large random peptide libraries created using the amino acid composition of the most active peptides. The resultant data was used with an AI technique called artificial neural networks to develop quantitative in-silico models of antibiotic activity2,12. Random tests proved remarkably effective in predicting the activity of 100,000 virtual peptides. The best peptides, representing the top quartile of predicted activities, were effective against a broad array of multidrug-resistant ""Superbugs"" with activities that were equal to or better than four highly used conventional antibiotics, more effective than the most advanced clinical candidate antimicrobial peptide, and protective against Staphylococcus aureus infections in animal models. Similar methods were used to derive excellent antibiofilm peptides. Asep is preparing to take the best of these peptides to the clinic. ""We use AI daily as a valuable tool in the battle against antibiotic failure to solve problems that have defied conventional methods. While others are trying to figure out how AI can be best used, we are already using it with amazing success in diagnostics and therapeutics. Asep Inc. is dedicated to leveraging AI's power to improve human health,"" said Dr. Evan Haney, Chief Scientific Officer of Asep. ABOUT ASEP MEDICAL HOLDINGS INC.Asep Medical Holdings Inc. (asepmedical.com) is dedicated to addressing the global issue of antibiotic failure by developing novel solutions for significant unmet medical needs in human medicine. The Company is a consolidation of three existing private companies, all with technology in advanced development — Sepset Biosciences Inc. (proprietary diagnostic tools to enable the early and timely identification of sepsis), ABT Innovations Inc. (broad-spectrum therapeutic agents to address multi-drug resistant biofilm infections), and SafeCoat Medical Inc. (an antimicrobial peptide, anti-fouling medical device coating technology). Sepset Biosciences Inc. (sepset.ca) is developing a diagnostic technology that involves a patient gene expression signature that predicts the development of severe sepsis, one of the significant diseases leading to antibiotic failure, since antibiotics are the primary treatment for sepsis. Sepsis was responsible for nearly 20% of all deaths on the planet in 2017 and essentially all deaths due to COVID-19 and other pandemics. The SepsetER test is a blood-based gene expression assay that is straightforward to implement, and results are obtained in about an hour after taking a blood sample in the emergency room or intensive care unit. This proprietary diagnostic technology differs from current diagnostic tests in enabling the diagnosis of severe sepsis within 60 minutes of initiating the test. Bacterial culture, the gold standard, provides a diagnosis after ~15 hours but can be as long as three days. Asep Inc. believes its test will enable physicians to make critical early decisions regarding appropriate therapies and thus reduce overall morbidity and mortality due to sepsis. ABT Innovations Inc.'s (abtinnovations.ca) peptide technology covers a broad range of therapeutic applications, including bacterial biofilm infections (medical device infections, chronic infections, lung, bladder, wound, dental, skin, ear-nose and throat, sinusitis, orthopaedic, etc.), anti-inflammatories, anti-infective immune-modulators and vaccine adjuvants. The company is in the pre-clinical development phase with promising data. SafeCoat Medical Inc.'s (safecoatmedical.com) technology incorporates self-assembling biocompatible polymers that can be combined with conjugated antimicrobial peptides and applied to virtually any surface as stable antimicrobial and/or anti-fouling coatings. Of particular interest is the application of this versatile antimicrobial coating to various medical devices and implants that often become contaminated with biofilm infections. SafeCoat is optimizing methods to manufacture and apply these anti-bacterial coatings to a host of surfaces and can tailor the composition of the coating and associated peptide sequences for any desired application.

TD Cowen and Stifel are the joint book-running managers for the offering. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The pricing of Ichor Holdings' public offering at $37.50 per share represents a strategic move to strengthen the company's balance sheet. By repaying outstanding debt, the company is likely aiming to reduce interest expenses and improve its financial leverage ratio. This can be seen as a positive signal to investors that management is focused on maintaining a healthy capital structure. The option for underwriters to purchase additional shares could also provide a cushion for the company, potentially reducing the risk of stock price volatility post-offering. However, the dilutive effect on existing shareholders cannot be ignored, as the increase in share count will spread the company's earnings over a larger base, potentially impacting earnings per share (EPS). Market Research Analyst The semiconductor industry is known for its cyclical nature and capital-intensive operations. Ichor Holdings' decision to potentially allocate funds for capital expenditures and strategic acquisitions indicates an aggressive growth strategy. Given the industry's rapid technological advancements, staying competitive often requires continuous investment in R&D and modernizing equipment. Investors should assess the company's past capital allocation efficiency and how these investments could translate into market share gains or entry into new markets. The timing of the offering, market conditions and the company's performance relative to its peers would also be critical factors in evaluating the potential impact on the company's stock performance. Legal Expert From a legal perspective, the offering's reliance on an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 suggests a level of preparedness and strategic planning. Shelf registrations allow for the quick capitalization on favorable market conditions, which can be advantageous for the issuer.

Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent announcement by Coinbase regarding the pricing of $1.1 billion in Convertible Senior Notes due 2030 marks a significant financing event for the company. The decision to increase the offering from $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion, with an additional option for initial purchasers to buy up to $165.0 million more to cover over-allotments, reflects strong demand and potentially positive market sentiment towards Coinbase's financial health and future prospects. The use of proceeds to manage existing debt obligations, such as the repayment or repurchase of outstanding notes due in 2026, 2028 and 2031, illustrates a proactive approach to capital structure management. This could be seen as a strategic move to improve the company's debt maturity profile and reduce interest expenses, as the new notes have a lower interest rate compared to some of the existing notes.Investors should consider the impact of these convertible notes on potential dilution of existing shares, although the capped call transactions are designed to mitigate this effect to some extent. The initial conversion price represents a 32.5% premium over the recent share price, which may be attractive to investors if they are bullish on the company's stock performance. Market Research Analyst Convertible notes are a hybrid financial instrument offering both debt and equity features, which can be appealing to investors seeking both fixed income and potential upside in the company's equity. The low interest rate of 0.25% per year on the notes indicates investor confidence in Coinbase's creditworthiness and future profitability. The capped call transactions, which are intended to reduce potential equity dilution and cash payment obligations upon conversion, are noteworthy as they reflect Coinbase's efforts to manage its share price volatility and protect against excessive dilution. The initial cap price of approximately $503.46 per share is double the last reported sale price of Coinbase's Class A common stock, suggesting an optimistic outlook on the company's value growth.The market's reaction to these transactions, particularly the potential share price impact from the option counterparties' hedging activities, should be monitored closely. The derivative transactions and secondary market activities by these counterparties could influence Coinbase's stock price, affecting not only the conversion attractiveness but also investor perception of the company's market stability. Legal Expert It is important to note the regulatory framework within which this offering is taking place. The notes are being offered pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, which allows for the sale of securities to qualified institutional buyers without the need for a public offering. This private offering nature limits the pool of potential investors but also simplifies the regulatory compliance requirements for Coinbase.Furthermore, the fact that the notes and any shares of Class A common stock potentially issuable upon conversion have not been registered under the Securities Act highlights the importance of adhering to exemptions from registration requirements. Investors need to be aware that the resale of these securities may be restricted, which could affect their liquidity and marketability.Lastly, the redemption features and the fundamental change repurchase rights provide Coinbase with flexibility in managing its debt while giving investors protection against significant corporate events that could adversely affect the value of their investment. 03/13/2024 - 08:03 PM Remote-First-Company/SANTA FE, N.M.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Coinbase Global, Inc. (“Coinbase”) (Nasdaq: COIN) today announced the pricing of $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2030 (the “notes”) in a private offering (the “offering”) to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The aggregate principal amount of the offering was increased from the previously announced offering size of $1.0 billion. Coinbase also granted the initial purchasers of the notes a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $165.0 million principal amount of notes, solely to cover over-allotments. The sale of the notes to the initial purchasers is expected to settle on March 18, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions, and is expected to result in approximately $1.08 billion (or approximately $1.24 billion if the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes in full) in net proceeds to Coinbase after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by Coinbase. Coinbase intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to repay at maturity, or repurchase or redeem prior to maturity, from time to time and subject to market conditions, its outstanding 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026, 3.375% Senior Notes due 2028, and 3.625% Senior Notes due 2031 and for other general corporate purposes, which may include working capital and capital expenditures, and to pay the cost of the capped call transactions. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, Coinbase expects to use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of such additional notes to enter into additional capped call transactions. Coinbase may also use a portion of the net proceeds to make investments in and acquisitions of other companies, products or technologies that Coinbase may identify from time to time. The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of Coinbase. The notes will bear interest of 0.25% per year payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on October 1, 2024. The notes will mature on April 1, 2030, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Coinbase may not redeem the notes prior to April 1, 2027. Coinbase may redeem all or any portion of the notes (subject to certain limitations), at its option, on or after April 1, 2027 and on or before the 20th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, if the last reported sale price of Coinbase’s Class A common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price then in effect on (1) each of at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date Coinbase sends the related redemption notice; and (2) the trading day immediately before the date Coinbase sends such notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. No sinking fund is provided for the notes, which means that Coinbase is not required to redeem or retire the notes periodically. Subject to a limited exception, holders of the notes will have the right to require Coinbase to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the notes) at a purchase price of 100% of their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. The notes will be convertible at an initial conversion rate of 2.9981 shares of Coinbase’s Class A common stock, per $1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $333.54 per share of Class A common stock, which represents a conversion premium of approximately 32.5% to the last reported sale price of $251.73 per share of Coinbase’s Class A common stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on March 13, 2024). Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding October 1, 2029, the notes will be convertible at the option of the noteholders only upon the satisfaction of specified conditions and during certain periods. On or after October 1, 2029 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day preceding the maturity date, the notes will be convertible at the option of the noteholders at any time regardless of these conditions. Conversions of the notes will be settled in cash, shares of Coinbase’s Class A common stock, or a combination thereof, at Coinbase’s election. In connection with the pricing of the notes, Coinbase entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates and/or other financial institutions (the “option counterparties”). The capped call transactions cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of Coinbase’s Class A common stock that will initially underlie the notes. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to Coinbase’s Class A common stock upon any conversion of the notes and/or offset any potential cash payments Coinbase is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. The cap price of the capped call transactions is initially approximately $503.46 per share, which represents a premium of 100% over the last reported sale price of Coinbase’s Class A common stock of $251.73 per share on March 13, 2024, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the capped call transactions. Coinbase has been advised that, in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates expect to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Coinbase’s Class A common stock and/or purchase shares of Coinbase’s Class A common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Coinbase’s Class A common stock or the notes at that time. In addition, Coinbase has been advised that the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to Coinbase’s Class A common stock and/or purchasing or selling Coinbase’s Class A common stock or other securities of Coinbase in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and from time to time prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so during the relevant valuation period under the capped call transactions or following any early conversion of the notes, any repurchase of the notes by Coinbase on any fundamental change repurchase date, any redemption date or any other date on which the notes are retired by Coinbase, in each case if Coinbase exercises its option to terminate the relevant portion of the capped call transactions). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of Coinbase’s Class A common stock or the notes, which could affect the ability of noteholders to convert the notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the notes, it could affect the number of shares of Class A common stock, if any, and value of the consideration that noteholders will receive upon conversion of the notes. The notes were only offered and sold to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act by means of a private offering memorandum. Neither the notes nor the shares of Coinbase’s Class A common stock potentially issuable upon conversion of the notes, if any, have been, or will be, registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States, except pursuant to an applicable exemption from such registration requirements. This announcement is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any of the notes or any shares of Class A common stock potentially issuable upon conversion of the notes and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation, or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale is unlawful.

Shareholders face uncertainty regarding the stock's value, trading, and market development. Positive None. Negative The delisting from the NYSE due to a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing poses significant risks for shareholders, including uncertainty about the stock's value and trading on the OTC market. Financial Analyst The transition of BowFlex Inc. from the NYSE to the OTC market is a significant financial event, indicating a substantial shift in the company's market standing. The assignment of a new stock symbol, 'BFXXQ', typically indicates a company in distress and in this case, it follows the initiation of Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. Investors should be aware that such a move often leads to a decrease in liquidity and visibility of the stock, potentially leading to greater volatility and reduced investor confidence.Furthermore, the company's statement about the lack of obligation to maintain a market in the common stock is a clear signal of risk to stockholders. The uncertainty surrounding the ultimate effect of the bankruptcy proceedings on the stock's value is a critical consideration. In some cases, common stockholders may end up with little to no return on their investment post-bankruptcy, depending on the company's ability to restructure its debts and the priority of claims. Market Research Analyst Moving to the OTC market often results in reduced regulatory requirements and lower costs for the company but also comes with a decrease in the stock's prominence among investors. The OTC market is less regulated than major exchanges, which can lead to less stringent reporting standards and investor scrutiny. This could impact the company's ability to raise capital in the future.It's also important to note that the lack of broker quotes and an established market can deter investment, as it implies a lack of interest and support from financial institutions. This can further affect the company's stock price and trading volume. Stakeholders should closely monitor the market response to BowFlex's OTC listing to gauge the market's perception of the company's financial health and future prospects. Legal Expert Chapter 11 proceedings allow a company to reorganize and attempt to become profitable again while temporarily holding off creditors. However, the implications for common stockholders are often negative, as they are last in line during asset liquidation, behind secured creditors, bondholders and preferred stockholders. The statement from BowFlex highlights the lack of assurance regarding the trading of its common stock, which is a legal disclosure meant to temper stockholder expectations.Investors should understand that during bankruptcy, common stock can become highly speculative. The company's warning about the potential inability of stockholders to sell or transfer their stock is a legal precaution to mitigate future disputes and manage investor expectations. This serves as a reminder of the inherent risks associated with investing in stocks, especially those undergoing financial restructuring. 03/13/2024 - 08:34 PM VANCOUVER, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BowFlex Inc. (“BowFlex” or “the Company”) announced that its Common Stock has been assigned the symbol “BFXXQ” with respect to quotations on the over-the-counter (OTC) market, following its delisting from the New York Stock Exchange.

The Company will not receive proceeds from the sale, with the Offering expected to close on March 15, 2024. Goldman Sachs & Morgan Stanley are the joint book-running managers for the Offering. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The secondary public offering of REV Group, Inc.'s shares by American Industrial Partners represents a notable event for current and potential investors. The offering price of $18.00 per share provides a benchmark for the market's valuation of the company's stock. Investors will be closely monitoring the stock's performance relative to this price point post-offering to gauge market sentiment and the effectiveness of the underwriters' pricing strategy.It's also important to consider the implications of the company not receiving any proceeds from this offering. This detail suggests that the transaction is aimed at providing liquidity to the Selling Stockholders rather than raising capital for the company's operational needs or growth initiatives. This could be interpreted as a signal that the major shareholders are looking to diversify their investments or realize gains, rather than a reflection on the company's future prospects. Market Research Analyst From a market dynamics perspective, the large block of shares being sold can impact the stock's liquidity and may lead to increased volatility around the time of the offering's closure. The involvement of reputable financial institutions such as Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Morgan Stanley as joint book-running managers could potentially reassure investors about the procedural integrity of the offering.Furthermore, the use of an effective shelf registration statement expedites the process of offering securities, allowing the company to act quickly in response to market conditions. Investors might view this as a sign of strategic financial management, although it does not directly affect the company's operations or capital structure, as the proceeds do not benefit REV Group directly. Legal Expert Compliance with SEC regulations is a critical aspect of any public offering. The fact that the offering is being conducted pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 indicates that REV Group has met the necessary legal requirements to make this offering available to the public. This includes the preparation of a prospectus supplement and the accompanying base prospectus, which must be filed with the SEC and made available to potential investors.The disclaimer at the end of the announcement serves as a reminder of the legal boundaries within which such offerings are conducted. It highlights that the securities cannot be sold in jurisdictions where it would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of those states or jurisdictions, ensuring that the offering adheres to the legal standards set forth by regulatory authorities. 03/13/2024 - 08:20 PM MILWAUKEE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- REV Group, Inc.

The spinoff aims to create two independent, publicly traded companies, with the process expected to be completed late this year. Nicole A. Kivisto, CEO of MDU Resources, highlights the rebranding as a strategic move to enhance shareholder value and enable focused growth opportunities. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The rebranding of MDU Resources Group's construction services business to Everus Construction Group marks a strategic move in anticipation of its spinoff into a separate publicly traded entity. This decision is likely to have a significant impact on the company's market positioning and investor perception. From a market research perspective, a rebranding effort can be a powerful tool to establish a new identity and differentiate the business from its parent company. It also signifies the intention to create a focused brand strategy that could potentially attract a new investor base.For existing shareholders, the spinoff promises an opportunity to benefit from the value unlocked by separating the construction services into a distinct entity. Historically, spinoffs have allowed individual businesses to pursue more targeted growth strategies, which can lead to improved operational efficiency and financial performance. However, the success of such a move depends on the market's reception to the new brand and the standalone company's ability to capitalize on growth opportunities. Financial Analyst The announcement of a tax-free spinoff by MDU Resources Group is a critical event that will likely impact the financial dynamics of the company. The separation into two independent entities can lead to a reevaluation of the stock as the market assesses the individual value propositions of MDU Resources and Everus Construction Group. Investors will be closely monitoring the financials of both companies post-spinoff to assess their performance and growth prospects.Financially, spinoffs can result in a more efficient allocation of capital and may lead to an increase in shareholder value. However, there are also risks involved, such as potential integration challenges and the costs associated with establishing Everus as a standalone entity. The market will be looking for clarity on the financial health of Everus Construction Group, including its balance sheet strength, revenue streams and profitability metrics. Legal Expert The legal process of spinning off a business unit into a separate publicly traded company involves complex regulatory compliance and due diligence to ensure a smooth transition. The tax-free nature of the spinoff suggests that it is structured to be beneficial to shareholders from a tax perspective. This is often achieved through a structure that meets specific Internal Revenue Service (IRS) guidelines to qualify as a tax-free reorganization.Legal experts will be scrutinizing the transaction to ensure that it adheres to all regulatory requirements, including securities laws and exchange listing standards. Additionally, the rebranding to Everus Construction Group must be carefully managed to avoid any trademark or intellectual property issues, which could impact the timeline of the spinoff or result in unforeseen costs. 03/13/2024 - 04:20 PM BISMARCK, N.D., March 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- MDU Resources Group, Inc.

Lexeo Therapeutics Announces Closing of Oversubscribed $95.0 Million Equity Financing,2024-03-13T20:22:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Lexeo Therapeutics, Inc. extends its financial runway until 2027 through a private placement led by Braidwell LP and Adage Capital Partners LP, raising approximately $95.0 million.

The company sold 6,278,905 shares of its common stock at $15.13 per share. The funds will support ongoing clinical programs, working capital, and general corporate purposes, ensuring financial stability for the next few years. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The completion of a private placement by Lexeo Therapeutics, Inc. signals a robust vote of confidence from institutional investors, which is a positive indicator for the company's financial health and future prospects. The infusion of approximately $95 million into the company's coffers is substantial, particularly for a clinical-stage biotech firm. This capital injection is likely to extend Lexeo's operational runway, which is crucial for supporting ongoing clinical programs and sustaining general corporate functions without the immediate pressure of fundraising.Investors and analysts would be keen to understand how this funding aligns with Lexeo's projected cash burn rate, especially since the company has stated that the proceeds are expected to fund operations into 2027. The share price of $15.13 in this transaction could serve as a reference point for market valuation, although the private nature of the placement means that it might not fully reflect public trading dynamics. Additionally, the participation of high-profile investment firms such as RA Capital Management and Surveyor Capital suggests strong market support and could potentially lead to a reassessment of the company's risk profile. Legal Expert The legal framework surrounding this transaction involves the Securities Act of 1933, which governs the issuance and sale of securities in the United States. Lexeo's use of a private placement exempts it from the Act's registration requirements, enabling a quicker and potentially less costly capital raise. However, the inclusion of a registration rights agreement indicates that Lexeo has agreed to file a Resale Registration Statement with the SEC, which will facilitate the resale of shares by investors, thereby enhancing the liquidity of these privately placed shares.It's important to note that the private placement adheres to Nasdaq's Minimum Price rule, ensuring that the sale price is not too discounted from the market price, which protects current shareholders from excessive dilution. The legal stipulations that the common stock sold in the private placement cannot be offered or sold without registration or an exemption are standard, but they also underline the importance of regulatory compliance in such financial transactions. Medical Research Analyst From a research and development perspective, the capital raised is pivotal for Lexeo as it focuses on genetically defined cardiovascular diseases and APOE4-associated Alzheimer’s disease. These are areas with significant unmet medical needs and advancements could have profound implications for patient care. The funding is expected to support the advancement of ongoing clinical stage programs, which are critical milestones that can influence the company's valuation and future funding needs.Given the complexity and high costs associated with clinical trials, especially in the genetic medicine space, the financial cushion provided by this funding could be a determinant in Lexeo's ability to maintain momentum in its clinical trials without compromising on the scope or scale. The involvement of investors with a background in healthcare, such as Novo Holdings A/S, can also be indicative of a strategic interest in Lexeo's research areas, potentially offering not just capital but also expertise and networking opportunities within the biotech industry. 03/13/2024 - 04:22 PM Lexeo extends runway into 2027 with private placement co-led by Braidwell LP and Adage Capital Partners LP with participation from new and existing investors including RA Capital Management, Surveyor Capital (a Citadel company), Eventide Asset Management, Novo Holdings A/S, Invus, Laurion Capital Management, Longitude Capital, Omega Funds and Woodline Partners LPNEW YORK, March 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lexeo Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: LXEO), a clinical stage genetic medicine company dedicated to pioneering treatments for genetically defined cardiovascular diseases and APOE4-associated Alzheimer’s disease, today announced the closing of its previously announced private placement. The financing was co-led by Braidwell LP and Adage Capital Partners LP with participation from new and existing investors including RA Capital Management, Surveyor Capital (a Citadel company), Eventide Asset Management, Novo Holdings A/S, Invus, Laurion Capital Management, Longitude Capital, Omega Funds and Woodline Partners LP for total gross proceeds of approximately $95.0 million. Lexeo sold 6,278,905 shares of its common stock (“Common Stock”) in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), at a sale price equal to $15.13 per share. J.P. Morgan and Leerink Partners acted as co-lead placement agents for the transaction. Stifel also acted as co-placement agent. Lexeo intends to use net proceeds from the financing to fund advancement of ongoing clinical stage programs, and for working capital and general corporate purposes. The proceeds from this financing, combined with current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, are expected to fund operating and capital expenditures into 2027. The common stock sold in the private placement has not been registered under the Securities Act, or any state or other applicable jurisdiction’s securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state or other jurisdictions’ securities laws. In connection with the private placement, Lexeo and the investors entered into a registration rights agreement pursuant to which Lexeo will file a registration statement (the “Resale Registration Statement”) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) registering the resale of the shares sold in the private placement. Any offering of the shares sold in the private placement under the Resale Registration Statement will only be made by means of a prospectus. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the Company’s Common Stock, nor shall there be any offer, solicitation, or sale of the Company’s Common Stock in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful. The private placement was conducted in accordance with applicable Nasdaq rules and was priced to satisfy the “Minimum Price” requirement (as defined in the Nasdaq rules).

Winnebago Industries Board of Directors Approves Quarterly Cash Dividend,2024-03-13T20:30:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Winnebago Industries (WGO) declares a quarterly cash dividend of $0.31 per share, marking the 39th consecutive quarter of dividend payments.","Winnebago Industries Board of Directors Approves Quarterly Cash Dividend Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags management dividends Rhea-AI Summary Winnebago Industries (WGO) declares a quarterly cash dividend of $0.31 per share, marking the 39th consecutive quarter of dividend payments. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Winnebago Industries' announcement of its 39th consecutive quarterly dividend payment represents a strong signal of financial stability and shareholder commitment. This consistency suggests that the company has a reliable cash flow, which is essential for maintaining dividend payments. Investors often view a steady dividend as an indicator of a company's financial health and management's confidence in its future earnings.However, the dividend yield, calculated by annualizing the dividend and dividing it by the stock price, is a critical metric for comparing the attractiveness of Winnebago's dividends to those of other companies in the market. The current yield should be compared against sector averages and historical yields of Winnebago to assess if the dividend strategy aligns with shareholder expectations and industry norms.Long-term investors might see the consistent dividend as a reason to hold the stock, whereas potential investors could be attracted by the income-generating potential of the shares. Yet, it's important to consider the payout ratio, which indicates what portion of net income is being paid out as dividends. An excessively high payout ratio could signal that the company is not reinvesting enough into its business for growth, which might be concerning for future stock performance. Market Research Analyst The outdoor lifestyle market, in which Winnebago operates, has been subject to fluctuations due to economic cycles, consumer trends and external factors such as fuel prices and travel habits. Winnebago's ability to maintain a quarterly dividend for nearly a decade suggests that the company has navigated these challenges successfully. This could be attributed to a diversified product portfolio, effective cost management and a strong market position.However, the market will be looking at how Winnebago's dividend policy correlates with its capital expenditure plans, especially in an industry that is rapidly evolving with the introduction of electric and eco-friendly products. Investors may seek insights into whether the company is balancing its short-term shareholder returns with long-term strategic investments.Furthermore, the announcement comes at a strategic time when investors are evaluating companies based on their resilience in the face of potential economic headwinds. The consistency in dividend payments may contribute positively to investor sentiment, but it's crucial to analyze this move in the context of the company's overall financial strategy and market performance. 03/13/2024 - 04:30 PM Winnebago Industries has paid a quarterly dividend for 39 consecutive quartersEDEN PRAIRIE, Minn., March 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Winnebago Industries, Inc.

We design, manufacture, market, and distribute MRI-compatible medical devices, accessories, disposables, and related services. We are the only provider of a non-magnetic intravenous (“IV”) infusion pump system designed to be safe during MRI procedures. We were the first to develop an infusion delivery system that eliminates many dangers and problems during MRI procedures.

Our patented MRidium® MRI-compatible IV infusion pump system has a non-magnetic ultrasonic motor, uniquely designed non-ferrous parts, and other unique features to deliver anesthesia safely and predictably and other IV fluids during various MRI procedures. Our pump solution provides a seamless approach that enables accurate, safe, and dependable fluid delivery before, during, and after an MRI scan, which is essential to critically ill patients who cannot be removed from their vital medications and children and infants who must generally be sedated to remain immobile during an MRI scan.

(NYMT) declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share on its common stock for the quarter ending March 31, 2024. The Board also announced cash dividends on its preferred stocks. The dividends will be payable on April 25, 2024, to common stockholders of record as of March 25, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a regular quarterly cash dividend by New York Mortgage Trust represents a commitment to shareholder returns, signaling confidence in the company's earnings stability. The specified dividend of $0.20 per share on common stock is a critical figure for investors, as it influences the dividend yield, a key metric used to evaluate the attractiveness of a stock for income-focused portfolios.Furthermore, the declaration of dividends on the Series D, E, F and G Preferred Stocks, with varying rates, showcases the company's capital structure strategy. Preferred stock dividends are often seen as a hybrid between debt and equity, providing a fixed-income like payout while still being part of the equity capital. The different rates reflect the hierarchy of payment and risk associated with each series.Investors may also interpret these declarations as a signal of the company's financial health. Companies that consistently pay dividends are often perceived as more stable and less volatile, which can be particularly appealing during uncertain economic conditions. However, it is essential to analyze the payout ratio to ensure that the dividends are sustainable and not compromising the firm's long-term growth potential. Market Research Analyst The real estate investment trust (REIT) sector, where New York Mortgage Trust operates, is sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Dividend announcements from REITs are scrutinized in the context of current interest rate trends and housing market dynamics. The consistency of dividend payments can be a barometer for the REIT's operational performance, especially when considering the fixed-income nature of Series D, E, F and G Preferred Stocks.Analysts and investors often use these dividends as a measure of a REIT's ability to generate cash flow from its operations, particularly from mortgage holdings and interest income. It is pertinent to assess the impact of these dividends on the company's cash reserves and borrowing costs, as REITs typically leverage to finance property acquisitions and operations.Given the competitive landscape of the mortgage investment market, the announced dividends could also reflect the company's position relative to its peers. A comparison of dividend yields and growth rates with other REITs can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the company's performance and prospects. Economist From an economic perspective, the dividend announcement by New York Mortgage Trust must be contextualized within the broader macroeconomic environment. Dividends are often seen as a distribution of profits back to shareholders and their sustainability is closely tied to economic factors such as interest rates, inflation and housing market trends.As a REIT, New York Mortgage Trust's ability to maintain and potentially increase dividends over time is influenced by the health of the housing market and the cost of borrowing. For instance, rising interest rates can increase borrowing costs for REITs, which may pressure their margins and ability to maintain dividend levels. Conversely, a stable or declining rate environment can be beneficial for mortgage REITs.Investors looking at the long-term implications of this dividend announcement should consider the Federal Reserve's monetary policy trajectory, housing market indicators and inflationary pressures, as these will play a significant role in the company's operational efficiency and profitability. 03/13/2024 - 04:16 PM NEW YORK, March 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- New York Mortgage Trust, Inc.

The company's strategy focuses on sustainable revenue growth and operational efficiency. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results by Enzo Biochem, Inc. indicate a robust year-over-year revenue growth of 14% in their Life Science division, a notable achievement considering the competitive nature of the biotech industry. The 25% increase in U.S. revenue underscores a strong domestic market presence, particularly in the burgeoning drug development and cell and gene therapy segments. This growth trajectory is commendable, as it reflects the company's strategic alignment with high-growth market areas.The gross margin expansion from 39% to 49% is particularly impressive, highlighting improved operational efficiency and successful cost containment measures, such as workforce reductions. A 1,000 basis point improvement is significant and suggests a substantial enhancement in profitability. Investors should note the positive impact of such margin improvements on the company's bottom line, as evidenced by the reported net income of $1.1 million for the Life Science division, up from $0.2 million in the previous year.The reduction in net loss from continuing operations and the overall net loss, along with an improved current ratio of 3.2, paints a picture of a company that is not only growing its top line but also strengthening its financial health. However, the decrease in cash and cash equivalents by $23.1 million due to the paydown of liabilities warrants attention, as it may affect the company’s liquidity in the short term. Despite this, the company's strategy of market focus and operational conservatism seems to be paying off, as evidenced by the consecutive quarters of revenue growth. Market Research Analyst Enzo Biochem's strategic focus on high-growth market segments like drug development and cell and gene therapy is well-timed, given the increasing investment and innovation in these areas. By positioning itself in these niches, Enzo is capitalizing on industry trends that are driving demand for specialized life science products. The company's emphasis on quality customer service, supported by a stable global infrastructure, is a competitive advantage that can lead to customer retention and potentially attract new business.The company's operational progress, as highlighted by the CEO, suggests a successful execution of their business strategy. The reported financials provide evidence of Enzo's ability to not only increase revenue but also to translate that into actual profit, a key determinant of a company's value to investors. As Enzo continues to execute its strategy, stakeholders should monitor the company's ability to maintain these margins and growth rates in a dynamic and competitive market. Biotech Industry Analyst The biotechnology sector is known for its high research and development costs, which often result in long periods before profitability is achieved. Enzo Biochem's improvement in gross margins by 1,000 basis points is therefore an exceptional development, indicating that the company is progressing well beyond industry norms in terms of cost management and operational efficiency.The focus on drug development and cell and gene therapy is strategic, as these are areas with significant barriers to entry due to the scientific complexity and regulatory requirements involved. Enzo's success in these segments suggests a high level of technical expertise and the ability to navigate the regulatory landscape effectively. The improved profitability in the Life Science division, despite the traditionally high costs associated with these market segments, is a testament to the company's strategic planning and execution.However, the reported decrease in cash reserves may raise questions about the sustainability of the current growth rate. It is crucial for Enzo to balance its investment in growth with the management of its cash flow to ensure long-term viability. The reduction in cash reserves could be a strategic move to optimize the balance sheet post the clinical lab asset sale, but it is essential to observe how this will affect the company's ability to fund future growth initiatives. 03/13/2024 - 04:26 PM FARMINGDALE, N.Y., March 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Enzo Biochem, Inc. (NYSE: ENZ) (“Enzo” or the “Company”) today announced financial results for the second quarter ended January 31, 2024. Second Quarter Highlights The Company's Life Science division's second-quarter revenue of $8.5 million improved year-over-year by 14%. During the 2024 period, we experienced a 25% revenue increase in the United States, driven by increased product demand in the drug development and cell and gene therapy market segments. Revenue for the six months ended January 31, 2024 of $16.4 million improved 12% compared to the same period in the prior year.The Life Science division's second-quarter gross margin was 49%, which improved by 1,000 basis points year-over-year from 39%, and was also a sequential 500 basis point improvement from 44%. The six-month YTD margin was 47% which was also a 1,000 basis point improvement compared to the prior year. This favorable result was driven by the reported revenue increase, mix of products sold, and ongoing cost containment initiatives, including, but not limited to, a workforce reduction for continuing operations.The Life Science division reported second-quarter net income of $1.1 million, compared to net income of $0.2 million in the prior year period. The net loss in the Corporate & Other segment decreased year-over-year by $1.2 million. Enzo ended the second quarter with aggregate cash and cash equivalents of $60.2 million, a reduction of $23.1 million from July 31, 2023, primarily due to the significant paydown of accounts payable and accrued liabilities post the clinical lab asset sale. The Company’s current ratio was 3.2 as of January 31, 2024.Net loss from continuing operations for Q2 FY24 was $0.9 million or ($0.02) per common share, compared to a net loss in the prior year’s second quarter of $2.9 million or ($0.06) per common share.Net loss, representing the results of continuing and discontinued operations for Q2 FY24, was $3.1 million, or ($0.06) per common share, compared to a net loss in the prior year’s second quarter of $11.3 million, or ($0.23) per common share. The weighted average basic common shares outstanding as of January 31, 2024, was 50.5 million. “Enzo’s strategy is to deliver sustainable, profitable revenue growth through market focus, technical strength, and operational conservatism. We are pleased to report a third consecutive quarter with double-digit revenue growth in the life science division, and I am proud of the team's hard work resulting in higher gross margin and improved profitability in the second quarter within our Life Science division,” said Kara Cannon, Enzo’s Chief Executive Officer. These achievements were driven by aligning our products in high-growth market segments made up of our drug development customers, while relying on our existing, stable global infrastructure to provide comprehensive, quality customer service.

The company's solid balance sheet allowed for strategic investments and shareholder value enhancement. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results of Profire Energy, Inc. show remarkable year-over-year growth in revenue, net income and EBITDA, indicating a strong financial performance for the fiscal year 2023. The company's ability to increase revenue by 27% while expanding gross margin from 47.1% to 52.5% suggests effective cost management and operational efficiency. Moreover, the repurchase of shares and the maintenance of a debt-free balance sheet are indicators of a robust financial strategy and shareholder value creation.From a valuation perspective, the increase in net income from $3.9 million to $10.8 million and the earnings per share (EPS) growth from $0.08 to $0.22, are particularly significant for investors. These metrics often serve as key determinants of a company's stock price. The one-time tax benefit and strategic tax planning have also contributed positively to the bottom line, although investors should consider the sustainability of earnings without such non-recurring adjustments.Long-term implications include the potential for continued shareholder returns through share repurchases and dividends, assuming the company maintains its profitability and cash reserves. The company's debt-free status and cash holdings provide a cushion against market volatility and strategic flexibility for future investments or acquisitions. Market Research Analyst Profire Energy's diversification strategy, which now contributes over 13% of total revenue, showcases the company's adaptability and potential for market expansion. The increase in customer demand and the successful introduction of new products beyond the traditional oil and gas markets are pivotal for future growth.The global demand for hydrocarbons and the catch-up in capital expenditures post-pandemic have likely fueled the company's revenue growth. However, it's critical to monitor the sustainability of this demand, especially in light of potential shifts towards renewable energy sources and the impact of environmental regulations on the hydrocarbon industry.Investors should also note the company's focus on enhancing the efficiency, safety and reliability of industrial combustion appliances, which aligns with industry trends towards operational excellence and safety. This focus, coupled with the company's financial results, positions Profire Energy favorably in the market. Energy Sector Analyst Profire Energy's performance within the industrial combustion appliance sector is noteworthy, given the typically cyclical nature of the energy industry. The company's record revenue and net income amidst challenging economic conditions underscore its resilience and the critical nature of its products and services.The increase in gross margin reflects not only improved pricing power but also suggests that Profire Energy may have a competitive advantage in its market niche. The company's strategy to leverage its cash flow for share repurchases demonstrates confidence in its future prospects and a commitment to delivering shareholder value.Looking ahead, Profire Energy's anticipation of attracting new users for its applications beyond the oil and gas markets could signal diversification into adjacent markets or industries, potentially mitigating risks associated with the volatility of the energy sector. 03/13/2024 - 04:30 PM Company Reports Record Full-Year Revenue, Net Income and EBITDALINDON, Utah, March 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Profire Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ: PFIE), a technology company (the ""Company"") that provides solutions which enhance the efficiency, safety, and reliability of industrial combustion appliances, today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and full fiscal year ending December 31, 2023. A conference call will be held on Thursday, March 14, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss the results. Full-year Fiscal 2023 Summary Revenue of $58.2 million, a 27% increase from prior yearGross profit of $30.5 million or 52.5% of total revenuesNet income of $10.8 million or $0.22 per diluted shareGenerated EBITDA of $13.2 millionRepurchased 1.2 million shares of stock for $2 millionCash and liquid investments of $20 million and remained debt-free Fourth Quarter Summary Revenue of $14.4 million, compared to $14 million in the prior year quarterGross profit of $7.8 million, a 19% increase compared to 4Q22Gross margin of 54.3%, a 730 basis point increase from prior yearNet income of $3.3 million, or $0.07 per diluted shareGenerated EBITDA of $3.1 million “2023 was a record year for Profire, recording our highest annual revenue, net income, and EBITDA in company history,” said Ryan Oviatt, Co-Chief Executive Officer and CFO of Profire Energy. “We expanded our full-year gross margin and used a portion of our operating cash flow to repurchase 1.2 million of our outstanding shares. Our solid balance sheet provides great flexibility for us to simultaneously invest in our business, repurchase shares when the market presents the opportunity and pursue other investment opportunities that will enhance our future, with the ongoing focus of delivering long-term value for our shareholders.” Full Year 2023 Financial Results Total revenues for the year equaled $58.2 million, versus $45.9 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by improved customer demand and progress in the Company's revenue diversification efforts. Gross profit was $30.5 million compared to $21.7 million last year. Gross margin was 52.5% of total revenues, compared to 47.1% of revenues in the prior year. The increase was driven by better fixed cost leverage as a result of the higher revenue base. Total operating expenses were $18.7 million, or 32% of revenue versus $16.5 million, or 36% of revenue in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to inflationary pressures on employee costs and increased business activity that drives variable costs, however the decrease as a percent of revenue reflects the Company’s ability to manage its cost structure while still increasing business activity. Compared with last year, operating expenses for G&A increased 16%, R&D decreased 13% and depreciation decreased 8%. Net income was $10.8 million or $0.22 per diluted share, compared to $3.9 million or $0.08 per diluted share last year. This year’s results include a one-time $828,000, or two cent per diluted share benefit generated from a reduction adjustment to deferred tax expense based on a detailed review of our deferred tax balances. Over the past two years, Profire implemented several tax planning strategies that have had a significant benefit on the Company’ s financial performance and results of operations. These include filing for and receiving the employee retention credit through the CARES act, the strategic use of several years of net operating losses in Profire’s Canadian subsidiary and the deferred tax true-up noted above. The impact of these tax planning strategies in 2023 caused operating expenses to be lower by $760,000, reduced income tax expenses, and an increase to net income of $1.9 million or four cents per diluted share. However, even when removing these non-recuring adjustments, 2023 remains the Company’s best year from an operating income, net income, and earnings per share perspective. Cash and liquid investments totaled $20.0 million on December 31, 2023 compared to $16.0 million at the end of 2022, and the Company continues to operate debt-free. Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Total revenues for the period equaled $14.4 million, compared to $14.8 million in the third quarter of 2023 and $14.0 million in the prior-year quarter. Gross profit was $7.8 million, compared to $7.5 million in the third quarter of 2023 and $6.6 million in the prior-year quarter. Gross margin was 54% of revenues, compared to 50.4% of revenues in the prior quarter and 47.0% of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022. The sequential and year-over-year increase in gross profit and gross margin is due to pricing incentives and better fixed cost coverage. Total operating expenses were $5.0 million, compared to $4.9 million in the third quarter of 2023 and $4.3 million in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year increase is related to the inflationary pressures on our business as well as increased business activity that impacts variable costs. Compared with the same quarter last year, operating expenses for G&A increased by 18%, R&D increased 15% and depreciation decreased by 1%. Net income was $3.3 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, compared to net income of $2.0 million or $0.04 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2023 and $1.8 million or $0.04 per diluted share in the same quarter last year. This quarter’s results include the $828,000 or $0.02 per diluted share benefit related to the deferred tax adjustment noted earlier. “Our record performance in 2023 was driven through a combination of continued demand for our legacy products and increased traction across our diversification strategy, which now represents more than 13% percent of our total revenue, compared to less than one percent in 2021,” stated Cameron Tidball, Co-CEO of Profire Energy. “Demand for hydrocarbons remains strong globally and we continue to benefit from operators playing catch-up on capital expenditures that had been deferred since the pandemic. We also expect to attract new users for our applications beyond the oil and gas markets during the year. Overall, we remain confident about our prospects for 2024 and beyond.” Conference Call Profire Energy Executives will host the call, followed by a question-and-answer period.Date: Thursday, March 14, 2024Time: 8:30 a.m. ET (6:30 a.m. MT)Toll-free dial-in number: 1-855-327-6837International dial-in number: 1-631-891-4304The conference call will be webcast live and available for replay via this link: https://viavid.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1653741&tp_key=d0612fee82The webcast replay will be available for one year.

Net investment income was $34.8 million. The company continued its share repurchase program, totaling $4.4 million in 2023. A quarterly distribution of $0.69 per share was announced for Q1 2024. Positive Total investment income increased by 9.6% year-over-year to $76.3 million. Net investment income reached $34.8 million in 2023. The company repurchased shares worth $4.4 million during the year. A quarterly distribution of $0.69 per share was declared for Q1 2024. Core investment income, excluding purchase price accounting, saw a 16.1% increase to $74.5 million in 2023. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in total investment income and net investment income (NII) for Portman Ridge Finance Corporation reflects a robust financial performance, particularly in a challenging market environment. The 9.6% year-over-year growth in investment income and a significant 16.1% increase in core investment income, excluding purchase price accounting adjustments, suggest effective asset management and a potentially favorable credit environment. The uptick in NII per share from $3.00 to $3.66 indicates enhanced profitability on a per-share basis, which is a positive signal for investors.The company's share repurchase program, with $4.4 million spent on buybacks, appears to be a strategic move to leverage the perceived undervaluation of its shares. This action is accretive to net asset value (NAV) per share, which is beneficial for remaining shareholders as it increases their stake in the company's earnings and assets. However, it is important to assess whether these repurchases are the best use of capital, especially when considering alternative investment opportunities or debt reduction.NAV is a critical metric for investment companies as it reflects the net value of their assets. A slight increase in NAV per share, despite a marginal decrease in total NAV, indicates a stable asset valuation which is reassuring. However, the year-over-year decrease in total NAV from $232.1 million to $213.5 million warrants further investigation to understand the underlying factors contributing to this decline. Market Research Analyst Portman Ridge's diversified investment portfolio, which spans 27 industries and 100 entities, demonstrates a strategy aimed at mitigating industry-specific risks. The weighted average contractual interest rate of approximately 12.5% on the Debt Securities Portfolio is a critical figure, reflecting the income-generating capability of the portfolio. Investors should consider this in the context of the current interest rate environment and credit market conditions.The company's asset coverage ratio of 165% and the decrease in net leverage from 1.49x to 1.19x are indicative of a relatively conservative capital structure, which could be appealing to risk-averse investors. This reduction in leverage may also suggest that the company is prioritizing balance sheet strength over aggressive growth, which can be a prudent approach in uncertain market conditions.The announcement of a quarterly distribution increase to $0.69 per share for the first quarter of 2024, albeit a modest one, signals confidence in the company's ability to generate and sustain cash flows. This could be interpreted as a positive sign for income-focused investors. Legal Expert The transition of Chief Financial Officer (CFO) roles, with the resignation of Jason Roos and the appointment of Brandon Satoren, is a routine corporate event that typically does not raise immediate legal concerns, especially since no disagreements were reported. However, it's important to monitor the new CFO's influence on financial strategies and reporting, as these changes can affect investor perceptions and the company's compliance with financial regulations.From a legal standpoint, the company's disclosure of non-accruals on debt investments and the fair value of investments provides transparency, which is crucial for investor trust and aligns with regulatory requirements for financial reporting. The decrease in non-accruals as a percentage of the investment portfolio at fair value from 1.6% to 1.3% suggests an improvement in the credit quality of the portfolio, which could reduce potential legal and financial risks associated with non-performing assets. 03/13/2024 - 04:24 PM Reports Strong Year-Over-Year Performance with Total Investment Income of $76.3 Million, an Increase of 9.6% and Net Investment Income of $34.8 Million Continued Share Repurchase Program for a Total of $4.4 Million During Full Year 2023 Announces Quarterly Distribution of $0.69 Per Share in the First Quarter of 2024 NEW YORK, March 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Portman Ridge Finance Corporation (Nasdaq: PTMN) (the “Company” or “Portman Ridge”) announced today its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023.

This compares to NAV of $214.8 million ($22.65 per share) for the third quarter of 2023.

Management Commentary Ted Goldthorpe, Chief Executive Officer of Portman Ridge, stated, “We are pleased to announce another strong year of financial performance for Portman Ridge, as we saw a 9.6% increase in total investment income and a 16.1% increase in core investment income as compared to the previous year. These milestones are a testament to the continued positive momentum we are seeing across our platform, despite operating under difficult market conditions. Additionally, we believe that our stock remained undervalued throughout the year, thus, during 2023 we repurchased shares for an aggregate of $4.4 million, which had an accretive effect to the company’s net asset value per share, reinforcing our commitment to shareholder value. On March 11, 2024, our board of directors authorized a renewed stock repurchase program of up to $10 million for an approximately one-year period. As a result of our strong financial performance during the year, the board of directors was able to approve a dividend of $0.69 per share for the first quarter of 2024, an increase of $0.01 per share as compared to the first quarter of 2023. As we step forward into 2024, we believe we have a robust pipeline, and are favorably positioned to take advantage of new investment opportunities that arise, while continuing to be highly selective in our investment and capital deployment process. We remain confident in our strategy and believe it will allow us to continue to deliver strong results and returns for our shareholders.” Selected Financial Highlights for Full Year 2023 Total investment income for the year ended 2023 was $76.3 million, of which $63.5 million was attributable to interest income from the Debt Securities Portfolio.

This balance was comprised of $92.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility, $125.7 million of 2018-2 Secured Notes due 2029, and $108.0 million of 4.875% Notes due 2026.

This compares to unrestricted cash of $14.9 million and restricted cash of $18.8 million as of September 30, 2023, and unrestricted cash of $5.1 million and restricted cash of $28.0 million as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $23 million of available borrowing capacity under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility, and no remaining borrowing capacity under the 2018-2 Secured Notes. Interest Rate Risk The Company’s investment income is affected by fluctuations in various interest rates, including SOFR and prime rates. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 89.7% of our Debt Securities Portfolio at par value were either floating rate with a spread to an interest rate index such as SOFR or the PRIME rate. 77.4% of these floating rate loans contain SOFR floors ranging between 0.50% and 2.50%. We generally expect that future portfolio investments will predominately be floating rate investments. In periods of rising or lowering interest rates, the cost of the portion of debt associated with the 4.875% Notes Due 2026 would remain the same, given that this debt is at a fixed rate, while the interest rate on borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility would fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Generally, the Company would expect that an increase in the base rate index for floating rate investment assets would increase gross investment income and a decrease in the base rate index for such assets would decrease gross investment income (in either case, such increase/decrease may be limited by interest rate floors/minimums for certain investment assets).

(“GARS”) and Harvest Capital Credit Corporation (“HCAP”) mergers. Portman Ridge believes presenting core investment income and the related per share amount is useful and appropriate supplemental disclosure for analyzing its financial performance due to the unique circumstance giving rise to the purchase accounting adjustment. However, core investment income is a non-U.S. GAAP measure and should not be considered as a replacement for total investment income and other earnings measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Instead, core investment income should be reviewed only in connection with such U.S. GAAP measures in analyzing Portman Ridge’s financial performance.2 Net leverage is calculated as the ratio between (A) debt, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs, less available cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash and (B) NAV. Portman Ridge believes presenting a net leverage ratio is useful and appropriate supplemental disclosure because it reflects the Company’s financial condition net of $71.6 million and $33.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash for the quarters ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. However, the net leverage ratio is a non-U.S. GAAP measure and should not be considered as a replacement for the regulatory asset coverage ratio and other similar information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Instead, the net leverage ratio should be reviewed only in connection with such U.S. GAAP measures in analyzing Portman Ridge’s financial condition.

The agreement ends all legal proceedings, releases liability for past patent infringement, and licenses patents to each other. Resellers and end users are also released from infringement claims. Impinj's CEO emphasizes the importance of safeguarding their patents and promoting innovation. Positive None. Negative None. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the settlement of patent disputes between Impinj, Inc. and NXP Semiconductors carries significant implications. Firstly, the termination of all pending legal proceedings reduces the immediate legal expenses and potential liabilities for both companies. Secondly, the mutual licensing agreement suggests that both parties recognize the validity and value of each other's intellectual property, which can foster a more collaborative industry environment. The release of liability for past patent infringement can also be seen as a strategic move to avoid the unpredictability of jury verdicts and the high costs associated with prolonged litigation.Moreover, the licensing deal provides a steady stream of revenue for Impinj in the form of an annual license fee. This could enhance the company's financial stability and predictability of earnings. It's important to note that such agreements can set industry standards for technology usage and patent valuations. The fact that Impinj has prevailed in multiple trials prior to this settlement might indicate a strong patent portfolio, which could deter future litigation and strengthen its market position. Financial Analyst Analyzing the financial impact, the one-time payment received by Impinj as part of the settlement likely represents a positive cash infusion that could be reflected in the company's short-term financial reporting. This inflow, along with the annual license fee, will contribute to the company's revenue stream, potentially improving its profit margins and earnings per share. Investors often view such settlements favorably, as they eliminate uncertainty and provide financial benefits.However, it's crucial to evaluate how these financial gains compare to the potential revenue that could have been generated through continued litigation victories. Additionally, the market will be watching how Impinj plans to reinvest the settlement funds into further innovation or debt reduction. The market reaction to this news will be a key indicator of how investors are valuing the settlement terms and the future prospects of the company's patent portfolio. Market Research Analyst The settlement between Impinj and NXP Semiconductors has broader implications for the RAIN RFID and Internet of Things (IoT) sectors. The resolution of this dispute may encourage other industry players to seek similar agreements, which could accelerate the consolidation of patent portfolios and standardize technology platforms. Such standardization can lead to increased adoption of RAIN RFID technology, as end users benefit from reduced risk of infringement litigation.Furthermore, the explicit mention of resellers and end users being released from infringement claims for past sales or use of UHF RFID products could improve market sentiment towards both companies' products. This aspect of the settlement may increase market penetration and customer loyalty, as it reduces the legal risk for the supply chain and end users involved with these technologies. Therefore, the settlement could have a positive impact on the overall growth trajectory of the RAIN RFID market. 03/13/2024 - 04:22 PM Company receives one-time payment and annual license fee SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Impinj, Inc. (NASDAQ: PI), a leading RAIN RFID provider and Internet of Things pioneer, today announced a successful settlement of its patent disputes with NXP Semiconductors N.V. As outlined in an 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today, the agreement terminates all pending legal proceedings, releases each party from liability for past patent infringement, and licenses each party’s patents to the other. It also releases resellers and end users from infringement claims for the sale or use of the parties’ UHF RFID products before the date of the agreement.

Fitch affirmed the Company's ratings, including the 'BBB' Issuer Default Rating, citing improved leverage and a diversified portfolio. The revision acknowledges KRG's advantageous positioning in key markets like Texas, Florida, New York City, Washington, D.C., and Seattle, with potential for further positive rating changes in the coming months. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The revision of Kite Realty Group Trust's rating outlook by Fitch Ratings from 'Stable' to 'Positive' is a significant indicator of the company's financial health and future performance. This upgrade suggests that KRG has made strides in improving its financial leverage, which refers to the degree to which a company uses borrowed money to fund its operations and growth. A lower leverage ratio can indicate a stronger balance sheet and lower risk for creditors and investors.For stakeholders, this could imply a more favorable borrowing environment and potentially lower interest costs for KRG. Additionally, the affirmation of the 'BBB' Issuer Default Rating, which is investment grade, can enhance investor confidence and could lead to a lower cost of capital. In the short term, this news may result in a positive reaction in the stock market, reflecting the anticipated improvements in KRG's financial stability. Over the long term, maintaining or improving upon the 'Positive' outlook could lead to an actual upgrade in the company's credit rating, which would further solidify its financial reputation and potentially attract more investment. Market Research Analyst The mention of KRG's diversified portfolio capitalizing on favorable demographic trends in Texas and Florida, as well as strategic markets like New York City, Washington, D.C. and Seattle, highlights the company's strategic positioning. KRG appears to be well-placed to benefit from population growth and economic development in these regions, which can lead to increased demand for real estate and higher rental income.For investors, the geographical diversification and the focus on areas with strong asset liquidity could mean a more resilient and stable revenue stream. This is particularly pertinent given the cyclical nature of real estate markets. The ability to leverage assets in strategic gateway markets also suggests KRG has high-quality assets that could be used to secure financing or be sold at a premium if necessary, providing financial flexibility. Over time, the company's strategic asset allocation could yield substantial returns, provided they continue to manage their portfolio effectively in line with market trends. Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) Analyst Fitch's outlook revision for KRG also underscores the importance of portfolio quality and management strategy in the REIT sector. KRG's ability to leverage its portfolio in strategic markets is a testament to its asset management capabilities. Adjusted Base Rent (ABR) is an important metric in the REIT industry, reflecting the potential income generated from tenants and KRG's significant ABR contribution from growth markets in Texas and Florida (37% of ABR) indicates a robust income stream.Investors should consider the implications of this positive outlook on KRG's dividend payouts, as REITs are required to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders. A stronger financial position could lead to increased dividends or reinvestment into the portfolio for further growth. It is also important to monitor how KRG manages its debt profile and capital expenditures to maintain or improve its credit rating, as these factors will be critical in sustaining the positive momentum identified by Fitch. 03/13/2024 - 04:30 PM INDIANAPOLIS, March 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kite Realty Group Trust (NYSE: KRG) announced today that Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”) revised its rating outlook for KRG to ‘Positive’ from ‘Stable’ and affirmed the Company’s ratings, including the ‘BBB’ Issuer Default Rating. In its public announcement on the matter, Fitch noted the revision reflects significantly improved leverage and acknowledged KRG’s diversified portfolio “affords KRG the opportunity to take advantage of favorable demographic trends in Texas and Florida (37% of ABR), while also benefitting from the strong asset liquidity and leveragability of select strategic gateway markets such as New York City, Washington, D.C., and Seattle” and noted “if the Company is able to maintain this path, there could be positive rating momentum over the next 12 to 24 months.” About Kite Realty Group Trust Kite Realty Group Trust (NYSE: KRG) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) headquartered in Indianapolis, IN that is one of the largest publicly traded owners and operators of open-air shopping centers and mixed-use assets.

The notes will bear interest and mature on March 15, 2031. The company plans to use the proceeds to acquire additional bitcoin and for general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by MicroStrategy to offer $500 million in convertible senior notes is a significant financial move, indicative of the company's strategic efforts to raise capital. The use of convertible notes is a dual-edged strategy. On one hand, it provides the company with immediate capital infusion without diluting current shareholders' equity, assuming the notes remain unconverted. On the other hand, it could lead to future dilution if the notes are converted into equity. The potential additional offering of $75 million suggests a buffer for higher than anticipated demand, which can be interpreted as a positive signal to the market regarding investor confidence. Investors and analysts should closely monitor the interest rate and conversion rate terms upon pricing, as these will affect the attractiveness of the notes and the potential impact on the company's stock. The intended use of proceeds to acquire additional bitcoin is a reaffirmation of MicroStrategy's ongoing investment strategy in cryptocurrency, which introduces a layer of risk given bitcoin's volatility. This could have a significant impact on the company's balance sheet and future financial stability. Market Research Analyst MicroStrategy's decision to raise funds through convertible notes is also reflective of the broader market's appetite for such financial instruments. It leverages the current low interest rate environment, which makes debt financing an attractive option for corporations. However, the reliance on qualified institutional buyers indicates a targeted fundraising approach, limiting the pool of potential investors but possibly ensuring a more stable investment base. Furthermore, the stipulation that the notes are unsecured and senior obligations is crucial. It means that in the event of a default, note holders would be prioritized over other debt, but without collateral backing the notes, the risk is inherently higher. This could affect the pricing of the notes, as investors will demand a higher yield for the increased risk. The redemption features provide flexibility to MicroStrategy, allowing it to manage potential dilution and financial obligations based on its operational needs and market conditions. Cryptocurrency Expert The earmarking of proceeds for bitcoin acquisition is a continuation of MicroStrategy's aggressive cryptocurrency strategy, positioning the company as a de facto investment vehicle for bitcoin. This move will likely resonate with investors who are bullish on cryptocurrencies but prefer exposure through a publicly traded company. However, it's essential to recognize the inherent risks associated with such a strategy, as the volatility of bitcoin can significantly influence the company's asset value and investor sentiment. Given the recent fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market, MicroStrategy’s strategy could be seen as a high-risk maneuver that further entrenches the company’s performance with the whims of the cryptocurrency market. The long-term implications of such an investment focus warrant careful consideration, as it could either greatly enhance the company's value or expose it to substantial financial risk. 03/13/2024 - 04:20 PM TYSONS CORNER, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- MicroStrategy® Incorporated (Nasdaq: MSTR) (“MicroStrategy”) today announced that it intends to offer, subject to market conditions and other factors, $500 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2031 (the “notes”) in a private offering to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). MicroStrategy also expects to grant to the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase, within a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the date on which the notes are first issued, up to an additional $75 million aggregate principal amount of the notes. The offering is subject to market and other conditions, and there can be no assurance as to whether, when or on what terms the offering may be completed. The notes will be unsecured, senior obligations of MicroStrategy and will bear interest payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2024. The notes will mature on March 15, 2031, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms. Subject to certain conditions, on or after March 22, 2028, MicroStrategy may redeem for cash all or any portion of the notes. If MicroStrategy redeems fewer than all the outstanding notes, at least $75 million aggregate principal amount of notes must be outstanding and not subject to redemption as of the relevant redemption notice date. Holders of the notes will have the right to require MicroStrategy to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their notes on September 15, 2028. The notes will be convertible into cash, shares of MicroStrategy’s class A common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of MicroStrategy’s class A common stock, at MicroStrategy’s election. Prior to September 15, 2030, the notes will be convertible only upon the occurrence of certain events and during certain periods, and thereafter, at any time until the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. The interest rate, initial conversion rate, and other terms of the notes will be determined at the time of pricing of the offering. MicroStrategy expects that the reference price used to calculate the initial conversion price for the notes will be the U.S. composite volume weighted average price of MicroStrategy’s class A common stock from 9:30 AM through 4:00 PM EDT on the date of pricing. MicroStrategy intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to acquire additional bitcoin and for general corporate purposes. The notes will be offered and sold to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act.

The company discussed its strategy to accelerate growth and drive shareholder returns during its 2024 Investor Day. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst World Kinect Corporation's emphasis on achieving a 30% adjusted operating margin and projecting a significant adjusted EBITDA range for 2026 indicates a strategic focus on operational efficiency and profitability. The targeted adjusted EBITDA of $480 – $520 million is ambitious, considering the company's current financials and would require a substantial increase in operational efficiency. Investors should closely monitor the company's quarterly reports for evidence of progress toward these goals, as well as any changes in market conditions that may impact the ability to achieve these targets.The announcement of targeting aggregate Free Cash Flow generation of $900 million to $1.2 billion over the next five years is a strong indicator of financial health and operational efficiency. The commitment to allocate approximately 40% to buybacks and dividends is a clear signal to the market of confidence in the company's cash-generating ability and a shareholder-friendly capital allocation policy. However, investors should consider the balance between returning capital to shareholders and reinvesting in the business for sustainable long-term growth. Market Research Analyst In the context of World Kinect's business segments, the company's strategy to expand its suite of energy-management solutions and increase the availability of renewable energy and lower-carbon fuels is timely and aligns with global trends towards sustainability and energy efficiency. The energy sector is undergoing a significant transformation and World Kinect's strategic positioning could enable it to capture new market opportunities. However, the success of this strategy hinges on the company's ability to effectively compete with established players and innovate in a rapidly evolving industry.The introduction of a new logo and the rebranding efforts reflect a broader strategic shift towards sustainability. While branding changes do not typically have a direct impact on financial performance, they can enhance the company's public image and position it more favorably in the eyes of consumers and investors who prioritize corporate responsibility and sustainability. Energy Sector Analyst The focus on driving efficiencies in the core distribution platform is crucial for World Kinect, given the competitive nature of the energy distribution market. Efficiency gains can lead to cost reductions and improved margins, which are essential for maintaining competitiveness. The energy sector's volatility, especially in the context of geopolitical tensions and environmental concerns, requires companies like World Kinect to be agile and forward-thinking in their operational strategies.World Kinect's pursuit of profitable growth in the renewable energy and lower-carbon fuels space is indicative of the sector's shift toward clean energy solutions. The company's ability to successfully integrate these offerings could be a key differentiator and drive long-term growth, but it also poses risks associated with regulatory changes, technological advancements and market acceptance of new energy solutions. 03/13/2024 - 04:15 PM Focused on achieving a 30% adjusted operating margin and full-year adjusted EBITDA of $480 – 520 million by 2026. Targeting aggregate Free Cash Flow generation of $900 million to $1.2 billion over the next five years, with approximately 40% allocated to buybacks and dividends.

Kasbar, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “I am confident our clear strategy will drive greater value for our shareholders.” Financial Outlook The Company remains focused on driving greater operating efficiencies with a target of achieving a 30% adjusted operating margin by 2026. Increased operating efficiencies and profitable growth are expected to contribute to annual adjusted EBITDA of $480 – 520 million by 2026. The Company expects to generate between $900 million and $1.2 billion of total Free Cash Flow over the next five years, with approximately 40% of such amount expected to be allocated to buybacks and dividends. “With a focus on generating improved shareholder returns, today we announced an updated financial outlook for increased operating efficiencies, profitability, and free cash flow,” stated Ira M. Birns, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. “We believe the achievement of these efficiency improvements, coupled with profitable growth, will enhance our ability to provide sustainable returns to shareholders.” New Logo The Company also debuted a new logo today, which better-reflects the Company’s strategic focus on its core operating model and growing sustainability solutions.

Our non-GAAP financial measures exclude acquisition and divestiture related expenses, restructuring charges, impairments, gains or losses on the extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on sale of businesses, integration costs associated with our acquisitions, and non-operating legal settlements, primarily because we do not believe they are reflective of our core operating results. Adjusted Operating Margin is computed by dividing Adjusted income from operations by Adjusted gross profit. Adjusted income from operations is defined as income from operations excluding the impact of acquisition and divestiture related expenses, restructuring charges, impairments and integration costs. Adjusted gross profit is defined as gross profit excluding the impact of costs associated with our November 2023 Finnish bid error. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) excluding the impact of interest, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization, in addition to acquisition and divestiture related expenses, restructuring charges, impairments, gains or losses on sale of businesses, integration costs and non-operating legal settlements. Free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities less total capital expenditures. Our guidance for these non-GAAP metrics depends on future levels of revenues, expenses, interest expense and other metrics which are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide a reconciliation between projected adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow and the most comparable GAAP metrics and related ratios without unreasonable effort.

This marks the 124th dividend increase since 1994, with an annualized dividend amount of $3.084 per share. The company's commitment to providing a dependable monthly dividend that grows over time is evident in its 106th consecutive quarter of dividend increases and 645th consecutive monthly dividend. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The marginal increase in Realty Income's monthly dividend, from $0.2565 to $0.2570 per share, reflects a conservative approach to capital distribution. While the increment is minimal, it upholds the company's reputation as a reliable dividend-paying entity. This strategy could be perceived as a signal of financial stability and a commitment to returning value to shareholders, potentially attracting income-focused investors.From a financial analysis standpoint, the annualized dividend amount's slight rise from $3.078 to $3.084 per share may not significantly affect the company's stock price in the short-term. However, the consistency in dividend growth, marking the 124th increase, underpins investor confidence and could contribute to stock resilience during market volatility. The commitment to a dependable dividend could also be a factor in the stock's risk profile, possibly lowering the perceived risk among conservative investors. Market Research Analyst Realty Income's dividend increase aligns with its long-standing branding as 'The Monthly Dividend Company', reinforcing its market position among real estate investment trusts (REITs) that prioritize regular income distributions. This incremental dividend increase strategy may not be aggressive, but it serves to differentiate Realty Income from other players in the market that may offer less frequent or less predictable dividends.Considering the broader market context, where investors may be wary of economic uncertainties or interest rate hikes, Realty Income's announcement could be seen as a move to maintain investor loyalty and attract those seeking stable, income-generating investments. The company's historical performance, with 645 consecutive monthly dividends, is likely to be highlighted in marketing efforts to strengthen its appeal to a specific investor demographic. Economist The decision to increase dividends, even marginally, can be reflective of broader economic conditions. In a low-interest-rate environment, companies like Realty Income might capitalize on cheaper borrowing costs to finance distributions. Conversely, in a rising interest rate scenario, such a move could indicate strong operational cash flows and a robust financial position that allows the company to maintain or increase dividends without overly leveraging.Long-term implications of consistent dividend increases can have a stabilizing effect on the company's stock, particularly during economic downturns when investors might seek refuge in assets that provide regular income. The company's ability to sustain its dividend policy through various economic cycles could be indicative of its resilience and strategic financial management. 03/13/2024 - 04:15 PM SAN DIEGO, March 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Realty Income Corporation (Realty Income, NYSE: O), The Monthly Dividend Company®, today announced it has declared an increase in the company's common stock monthly cash dividend to $0.2570 per share from $0.2565 per share.

Located just outside Griffith Park, JA Finance Park hosts more than 15,000 visitors including students and volunteers each year. Drawing inspiration from SoCalGas' H2 Innovation Experience ([H2]IE) in Downey, Calif., SoCalGas' storefront provides practical experiences in personal finance, sustainability and career exploration in STEM fields. The utility has collaborated with the organization for over 23 years and has contributed more than $300,000 to help foster leadership skills in the next generation. ""This educational space is more than just an exhibit; it's a foundation for empowering young minds with practical life skills and a deeper understanding of energy efficiency,"" said Paul Goldstein, Vice President of Gas Transmission and Storage at SoCalGas and JASoCal Board Member. ""SoCalGas employee volunteers help bring real-world financial and energy-efficient scenarios to life for students through a hands-on approach, nurturing future leaders by equipping them with vital skills. We're committed to inspiring a new generation to lead in sustainable energy through education and practical experiences."" The storefront features mock scenarios that enhance students' abilities to budget, manage expenses and make informed financial decisions. The space also emphasizes the importance of energy use in financial planning, teaching students about the benefits of energy-efficient practices and SoCalGas' customer assistance programs. By understanding how energy efficiency leads to savings, they gain practical insights into maintaining affordable living costs. Additional resources focus on advancements in energy technology with displays, like smart thermostats and energy-efficient appliances, designed to inspire interest in STEM careers. ""We're honored to continue our partnership with SoCalGas and thrilled to unveil their updated storefront at JA Finance Park,"" said Dr. Les McCabe, President & CEO of JASoCal. ""The storefronts are crucial to the immersive experience for students who are learning essential financial skills, like bill paying, but just as importantly, having a modern storefront that addresses the future of renewable energy and reflects energy-saving innovations in a home, will empower thousands of students each year to make responsible financial and environmental choices."" The storefront was remodeled to mirror the design of SoCalGas' [H2]IE, a clean hydrogen microgrid demonstration project that draws power from solar panels during the day and converts excess renewable energy into clean hydrogen to power the home at night. The [H2]IE could power up to 100 homes and highlights how microgrid technology can produce power locally and help create more sustainable communities. The project has been named a World-Changing Idea by Fast Company and was also awarded the U.S. Green Building Council of L.A.'s Sustainable Innovation Award.

Proceeds to be used to pay down term loans. Expecting a definitive arrangement by early 2025.,"Trinseo Announces Commencement of Sale Process for Interest in Americas Styrenics Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Trinseo initiates sale process for its 50% ownership in Americas Styrenics LLC as part of its transformation strategy. Proceeds to be used to pay down term loans. Expecting a definitive arrangement by early 2025. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Trinseo to commence a sale process for its 50% ownership in Americas Styrenics LLC represents a strategic realignment of the company's portfolio. The sale is in line with Trinseo's transformation strategy to divest from its styrenics businesses and focus on specialty materials and sustainable solutions. This move can be interpreted by investors as a commitment to streamline operations and concentrate on higher-margin businesses.Financially, the proceeds from such a divestiture are earmarked for debt reduction, specifically the $1.077 billion term loans maturing in 2028. This could potentially improve the company's balance sheet and credit profile, reducing interest expenses and possibly leading to a more favorable debt-to-equity ratio. Investors would be interested in the impact this sale could have on Trinseo's financial leverage and liquidity, as well as any potential changes to future earnings and cash flows. Market Research Analyst The divestiture of Trinseo's stake in AmSty could signal a shift in the competitive landscape of the styrenics market in the Americas. AmSty, being a joint venture established with Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, holds a significant position in the production and distribution of styrenic polymers. Stakeholders, including competitors, suppliers and customers, should consider the implications of a new ownership structure on market dynamics.Market analysts would assess the potential buyers for such an asset, which could include industry peers or private equity firms. The exit of Trinseo from this joint venture might also prompt other players in the industry to reevaluate their strategic positions and could lead to further consolidation or divestitures within the sector. Legal Expert Trinseo's initiation of an ownership exit provision highlights the contractual mechanisms that are often built into joint venture agreements. Such provisions are designed to facilitate an orderly transition of ownership under predefined conditions. Legal experts would scrutinize the terms of the exit mechanism to understand any obligations, rights and potential legal implications for both Trinseo and Chevron Phillips Chemical Company.It is also critical to consider regulatory aspects, as the sale of significant assets like this may be subject to antitrust and other regulatory approvals. The timeline for a definitive arrangement, expected no later than early 2025, suggests a complex legal process that would involve due diligence, negotiation of terms and compliance with regulatory requirements. 03/13/2024 - 04:15 PM WAYNE, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Trinseo (“Trinseo” or “the Company”) (NYSE: TSE), a specialty material solutions provider, today announced that it has commenced a sale process for its 50% ownership in Americas Styrenics LLC (“AmSty”), a joint venture with Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP. As part of its transformation strategy, the Company had previously announced its intent to divest its styrenics businesses (the “Styrenics Businesses”) with a focus on selectively marketing individual assets or regional businesses. AmSty was established in 2008 and is part of Trinseo’s regional Styrenics Businesses operating in the Americas. Trinseo has initiated an ownership exit provision of the AmSty joint venture agreement which includes a structured mechanism that is expected to ultimately lead to a sale of Trinseo’s ownership interest in AmSty. Any proceeds from the sale are expected to be used to pay down a portion of the recently issued $1.077 billion of term loans maturing in 2028. Frank Bozich, President and Chief Executive Officer of Trinseo, said “The sale of our ownership in AmSty is a logical step in our transformation as a specialty materials and sustainable solutions provider. By executing the contractual ownership exit provision, we have a clear pathway to divest our interest in the joint venture. We expect the exit process to lead to a definitive arrangement no later than early 2025.” About Trinseo Trinseo (NYSE: TSE), a specialty material solutions provider, partners with companies to bring ideas to life in an imaginative, smart, and sustainably focused manner by combining its premier expertise, forward-looking innovations, and best-in-class materials to unlock value for companies and consumers.

The net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, with BofA Securities as the lead book-running manager for the offering. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Cadre Holdings, Inc.'s public offering is a strategic move that has the potential to affect the company's capital structure and liquidity. The issuance of 2,200,000 shares by the company suggests a drive to raise capital for general corporate purposes, which could include expansion, debt reduction, or other investments. It is important to analyze the earnings per share (EPS) dilution that may result from the increased number of shares outstanding. Additionally, the participation of a significant shareholder, Kanders SAF, LLC, in selling 1,275,000 shares could be indicative of the shareholder's view on the company's valuation or a need for liquidity.Investors should consider the company's current financial health and future prospects when evaluating the potential impact of this offering. The underwriters' option to purchase an additional 521,250 shares could further dilute current shareholders but also provides a buffer for the company to raise additional funds if there is enough investor demand. The role of BofA Securities as the lead book-running manager is also a critical factor, as their reputation and distribution capabilities can significantly influence the offering's success. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the timing and size of the offering are crucial. The safety equipment industry has been experiencing growth, driven by increasing safety regulations and heightened awareness of workplace hazards. Cadre Holdings, Inc.'s position as a global leader in this sector could make the offering attractive to investors seeking exposure to this market. However, market conditions, investor sentiment and industry trends must be favorable to ensure a successful capital raise.It is also pertinent to observe the market response to the offering, as it can reflect the investment community's confidence in the company's growth strategy and governance, especially considering the involvement of the CEO in the selling shareholder entity. The market's reception to the offering will provide insights into the perceived value of Cadre Holdings, Inc. and could influence the stock's performance in the short term. Legal Expert The legal aspects of the public offering, such as the registration statement on Form S-3 and the preliminary prospectus supplement, are key documents that provide investors with detailed information about the company's financials, risks and the specifics of the offering. The fact that these documents have been declared effective by the SEC is a crucial step in the process, ensuring regulatory compliance and transparency.Investors should note that the offering is subject to securities laws and the disclaimer regarding the sale of securities not constituting an offer in states or jurisdictions where it would be unlawful is a standard legal precaution.

Altria plans to sell 35 million ABI ordinary shares, representing approximately 10% ownership. The proceeds will be used for additional share repurchases of Altria's common stock.","Altria Announces Intent to Sell a Portion of its Investment in Anheuser-Busch InBev Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Altria Group, Inc. announced its intent to sell a portion of its investment in Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NA through a global secondary offering. Altria plans to sell 35 million ABI ordinary shares, representing approximately 10% ownership. The proceeds will be used for additional share repurchases of Altria's common stock. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Altria's decision to divest a portion of its stake in Anheuser-Busch InBev represents a strategic reallocation of assets that is likely to have a material impact on both companies' liquidity and market capitalization. The sale of 35 million shares, coupled with the additional option for underwriters to purchase up to 5.25 million shares, could lead to a dilution of existing shareholders' equity in ABI. However, the concurrent $200 million share repurchase by ABI may partially offset this dilution.From a financial perspective, the transaction's timing and structure suggest Altria is capitalizing on market conditions to optimize its investment returns. The 180-day lockup period implies a short-term commitment to ABI, stabilizing the market's response to the sale. Investors should monitor Altria's share price following the announcement, as the intended use of proceeds for share repurchases may signal confidence in the company's intrinsic value and a potential increase in earnings per share. Market Research Analyst The secondary offering of ABI shares by Altria could indicate a broader strategy to focus on core operations by divesting non-core assets. This move may be well-received by investors who prefer companies with a more focused business model. Furthermore, the transaction reveals Altria's assessment of ABI's market performance and its own capital allocation strategy. The market's response to such a large offering will provide insights into investor sentiment towards both Altria and the beverage industry.It is noteworthy that Altria's CEO highlighted the historical returns of the ABI investment, emphasizing the long-term value creation from this asset. This statement, combined with the ongoing confidence in ABI's management and brand strength, suggests a nuanced divestiture rather than a complete exit, which might reassure stakeholders about the fundamental health of ABI. Corporate Strategy Expert Altria's partial divestment from ABI aligns with a strategic shift that many corporations undertake to optimize their asset portfolio. The use of proceeds for share repurchases reflects a strategic choice to invest in the company's own stock, potentially indicating a belief that Altria's shares are undervalued. This could be a strategic move to enhance shareholder value in the short term.Additionally, the lockup agreement with the lead underwriter suggests a calculated approach to ensure stability in Altria's stock post-transaction. Stakeholders should consider the long-term implications of this divestiture, as it may signal a shift in Altria's investment strategy, focusing more on its core tobacco business and less on diversification through holdings in other industries. 03/13/2024 - 04:15 PM RICHMOND, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Altria Group, Inc. (Altria) (NYSE: MO) today announced its intent to sell a portion of its investment in Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NA (ABI) (NYSE: BUD) (Euronext: ABI) (MEXBOL: ANB) (JSE: ANH) through a global secondary offering (offering) comprised of a public offering of ABI ordinary shares represented by American depositary shares (ADS) in the United States, a public offering of ABI ordinary shares in the United States, a concurrent private placement of ABI ordinary shares in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom and an offering of ABI ordinary shares, including ABI ordinary shares represented by ADSs, in other countries outside the United States. In addition, ABI has agreed to repurchase $200 million of ordinary shares directly from Altria, concurrently with, and conditional on, completion of the offering. Altria currently holds approximately 197 million shares of ABI, representing approximately 10% ownership. Altria, as the selling shareholder, is offering 35 million of ABI’s ordinary shares. In connection with the offering, Altria expects to grant the underwriters an option to purchase up to 5.25 million additional ABI shares owned by Altria, exercisable within 30 days following the pricing of the offering. In addition, we have agreed to a 180-day lockup with the lead underwriter for our remaining ABI shares. We expect to use the proceeds for additional share repurchases of our common stock. Future share repurchases remain subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors (Board). “As good stewards of shareholder capital, we consistently review options to unlock the value of our ABI investment, and we believe this is an opportunistic transaction that realizes a portion of the substantial return on our long-term investment,” said Billy Gifford, Altria’s Chief Executive Officer. “Over the decades of our ownership, the beer investment has provided significant income and cash returns and supported our strong balance sheet. Our continued investment reflects ongoing confidence in ABI’s long-term strategies, premium global brands and experienced management team.” The offering and the partial sale of our investment in ABI have been approved by our Board. ABI has filed a registration statement (including a prospectus) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the offering to which this release relates.

The distribution reflects the Partnership's intent to distribute a portion of its 2023 gains on Vantage JV Equity Investments. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP of a distribution to its Beneficial Unit Certificate (BUC) holders is a significant event for investors and analysts monitoring the real estate investment sector. The distribution includes both a regular quarterly cash dividend and a supplemental distribution payable in additional BUCs, reflecting the company's performance and strategic financial management. Investors typically view such distributions as a positive signal of a company's profitability and financial health. The supplemental distribution, particularly, indicates that the company has realized gains from its Vantage JV Equity Investments, which suggests a successful investment strategy.The decision to pay the supplemental distribution in BUCs rather than cash is noteworthy. This approach allows the company to retain capital, which could be indicative of future investment plans or a desire to maintain a strong balance sheet. This strategy is non-dilutive to current BUC holders, meaning it does not reduce their ownership percentage. From a financial analysis perspective, this could be seen as a strategic move to balance rewarding investors and preserving capital for growth, which could be a positive sign for the company's long-term prospects.However, the market's reaction to such distributions can vary. While some investors might appreciate the additional shares and the implied confidence of the management in the company's future, others might prefer cash distributions. The trade-off between immediate liquidity and potential future growth is a key consideration for investors. The impact on the stock price will depend on how the market interprets this strategy in the context of current market conditions and the company's overall financial health. Market Research Analyst The declaration of both cash and supplemental distributions by Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP can influence market perceptions of the company's sector, specifically the real estate investment trusts (REITs) and housing investment entities. The real estate market is sensitive to interest rates, economic cycles and regulatory changes and such distributions could be interpreted as a sign of robustness within this sector. The distribution ratio, based on the closing price of the BUCs, indicates management's confidence in the value of their holdings and their commitment to delivering shareholder value.It is also essential to understand the broader market implications of such a distribution. The issuance of additional BUCs increases the number of shares outstanding, which could potentially dilute earnings per share in the future. However, the non-dilutive nature of this supplemental distribution suggests a careful calibration to avoid this outcome. This balance reflects a nuanced approach to capital management that could be reassuring to investors who are wary of dilution.Market trends in the REIT sector often mirror the overall economic environment and the payment structure of the distribution could signal management's outlook on the real estate market. If the supplemental distribution is seen as a way to invest in future growth, it could be indicative of a favorable view of the market's potential. Conversely, if the market interprets the retention of capital as caution due to potential downturns, it could affect the sector's sentiment. Legal Expert The legal implications of the distribution of additional BUCs by Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP are also worth considering. The structure of the distribution must comply with securities regulations, ensuring that the issuance of new BUCs is conducted in a manner that is fair to all shareholders and does not mislead investors about the value of their holdings. The company's disclosure about the distribution ratio and the treatment of fractional BUCs suggests transparency and adherence to regulatory requirements.Additionally, the distribution strategy must align with the company's partnership agreement and any other governing documents. The role of Greystone Manager in determining the distributions based on a disciplined evaluation of the Partnership’s operating results and financial condition demonstrates a governance structure that takes into account various stakeholders' interests. This adherence to a disciplined evaluation process is crucial in maintaining investor trust and ensuring that distributions are made in the best interests of the BUC holders and the Partnership.It is important for legal compliance that the non-issuance of fractional BUCs and the decision to pay cash in lieu is handled according to the agreed-upon terms of the BUC and is communicated clearly to avoid any potential disputes. This also reflects a commitment to equitable treatment of investors, which is fundamental in maintaining corporate integrity and investor relations. 03/13/2024 - 04:15 PM OMAHA, Neb., March 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On March 13, 2024, Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP (NYSE: GHI) (the “Partnership”) announced that the Board of Managers of Greystone AF Manager LLC (“Greystone Manager”) declared a distribution to the Partnership’s Beneficial Unit Certificate (“BUC”) holders of $0.44 per BUC. The distribution consists of a regular quarterly cash distribution of $0.37 per BUC plus a supplemental distribution payable in the form of additional BUCs equal in value to $0.07 per BUC. The supplemental distribution will be paid at a ratio of 0.00417 BUCs for each issued and outstanding BUC as of the record date, which represents an amount per BUC based on the closing price of the BUCs on the New York Stock Exchange on March 12, 2024 of $16.79 per BUC. No fractional BUCs will be issued in connection with the supplemental BUCs distribution, as all fractional BUCs resulting from the distribution will receive cash for such fraction based on the market value of the BUCs on the record date. The Partnership expects to issue an aggregate of approximately 96,000 BUCs for the supplemental BUCs distribution. The cash distribution and supplemental distribution will be paid on April 30, 2024 to all BUC holders of record as of the close of trading on March 28, 2024. The BUCs will trade ex-distribution as of March 27, 2024. The supplemental distribution reflects the Partnership’s continuing intent to distribute a portion of the Partnership’s 2023 gains on the sale of its Vantage JV Equity Investments. The payment of the supplemental distribution in the form of BUCs allows the Partnership to retain additional capital to fund future investment opportunities at a low cost and is non-dilutive to current BUC holders. “We are pleased to announce the first quarter 2024 distribution of cash and additional BUCs consistent with the Board’s previously stated intent,” said Kenneth C. Rogozinski, Chief Executive Officer of the Partnership. “We remain focused on executing our investment strategy to continue generating returns for distribution to our unitholders.” Greystone Manager is the general partner of America First Capital Associates Limited Partnership Two, the Partnership’s general partner. Distributions to the Partnership’s BUC holders, including regular and any supplemental distributions, are determined by Greystone Manager based on a disciplined evaluation of the Partnership’s current and anticipated operating results, financial condition and other factors it deems relevant. Greystone Manager continually evaluates the factors that go into BUC holder distribution decisions, consistent with the long-term best interests of the BUC holders and the Partnership.

Financial Analyst The substantial year-over-year growth in Ocean Power Technologies, Inc.'s pipeline, from approximately $14 million to $77 million, indicates a robust expansion in business prospects, particularly in the defense and security sector. This is a critical metric as it reflects future revenue potential and the company's ability to secure contracts. The reported increase in gross margin rate from 18.5% in Q323 to 45.4% in Q324 demonstrates improved profitability per unit of revenue, which is significant for investor confidence. The pivot from research and development to commercial activities can be seen as a strategic move to enhance revenue streams and achieve profitability, which is a key consideration for stakeholders assessing the company's long-term viability. Market Research Analyst The reported growth in revenues, driven by sales of WAM-V autonomous vehicles and strategic consulting services, suggests that Ocean Power Technologies is diversifying its product offerings and successfully penetrating new markets. The mention of increased activity in Latin America indicates geographical expansion, which could lead to further revenue diversification and reduced market risk. The focus on maritime domain awareness and the integration of cutting-edge technologies like Satellite communication and AT&T 5G technology in their PowerBuoy® systems positions the company at the forefront of innovation in marine technology, potentially opening up new market opportunities. Legal Expert The legal expenses incurred by Ocean Power Technologies in defending against Paragon Technologies' actions are non-recurring, yet they have impacted the company's financials significantly, contributing to a net loss increase. The successful defense against these legal challenges is important for maintaining corporate governance and shareholder rights. However, investors should be aware of the potential for such disputes to distract from core business activities and incur substantial costs, impacting short-term financial performance. 03/13/2024 - 04:15 PM Continued Growth in Pipeline, Revenue, and Gross Profit ReportedMONROE TOWNSHIP, N.J., March 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ocean Power Technologies, Inc. (""OPT"" or ""the Company"") (NYSE American: OPTT), today announced financial results for its fiscal third quarter ended January 31, 2024 (“Q324”), including year over year revenue, gross profit, and pipeline growth. Financial Highlights from the third quarter: The Company’s pipeline at January 31, 2024 (“Q324”) was approximately $77 million, representing a 5.5x year-over-year increase over the pipeline of approximately $14 million at January 31, 2023. The Company's pipeline continues to grow, reflecting a significant increase in defense and security activity as well as an expansion of commercial opportunities.The gross margin rate was 45.4% and 18.5%, for the quarters ended Q324 and Q323, respectively. The gross margin rate was 49.7% and 21.1%, for the nine months ended January 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively.In December 2023, the Company received a letter subcontract for up to $6.5 million from a U.S. based prime contractor for multiple maritime domain awareness buoys advancing its commitment to national security and intelligence. This collaboration between OPT and the prime contractor will focus on providing multidomain marine solutions in support of U.S. government agencies. OPT believes that its PowerBuoy’s® will play a pivotal role in enhancing surveillance capabilities above and below the waterline, contributing significantly to maritime domain awareness initiatives.In conjunction with the Company's path to profitability, in November 2023, OPT announced that it has substantially completed its research and development phase and is primarily focused on commercial activities. This pivot to commercial activities has enabled a reduction and reallocation of headcount and a material reduction in third-party expenditures. As a result, the majority of the Company's employees are now dedicated to customer delivery. Recent Operational and Other Highlights: In February 2024, the Company received funding from the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, for the deployment of a PowerBuoy® in Monterey Bay, California. The PowerBuoy®, integrating OPT's Maritime Domain Awareness System (MDAS) along with cutting-edge Satellite communication and AT&T 5G technology, will demonstrate its persistent surveillance and communications capacities in a maritime environment.In February 2024, the Company received multiple orders for fully integrated WAM-V Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) totaling over $1.25 million. These recent commercial orders come from clients in Latin America, highlighting the wide-ranging capabilities and applications of the WAM-V USVs.In January 2024, the Company was awarded approximately $1.2 million under the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA) 2023 Technology Business Tax Certificate Transfer Program, commonly known as the Net Operating Loss (NOL) Program. This program enables technology and life sciences businesses in New Jersey to sell a percentage of their New Jersey net operating losses and unused research and development (R&D) tax credits to unrelated profitable corporations for cash. OPT takes part in the NJEDA NOL program annually and this funding represents a significant resource as the Company continues to make progress on its previously announced path to profitability. Payment was received by the Company in March 2024. Management Commentary – Philipp Stratmann, OPT's President and Chief Executive Officer “We continue to make progress on our path towards profitability as evidenced by the continued growth in our pipeline, revenues, and gross margin. Our efforts to increase our backlog and revenues in the defense and national security industry are paying off. Our recent contract wins with large government prime contractors enable us to provide autonomous vehicles and renewable energy buoys to various U.S. Government Agencies. In addition to these contract wins, we continue to deliver for our commercial customers, especially in the fields of autonomous survey operations, enabling them to lower costs and carbon emissions. Our geographic footprint continues to expand and we are seeing significant opportunities for growth in Latin America. The substantial cessation of our R&D efforts earlier in this quarter, is starting to lead to a reduction in payroll and engineering related expenditures, and the refocusing of the team towards execution is supporting our stated revenue growth. We continue to explore opportunities that will accelerate shareholder value generation as we execute our stated strategy, including cost optimization, accelerated revenue growth, partnerships, or other mechanisms. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS – Q324 Income Statement: Revenues for Q324 were $1.8 million, compared to $0.7 million in Q323. Revenues for the nine months ended January 31, 2024, were $4.0 million, compared to $1.8 million for the nine months ended January 31, 2023. This growth was driven by sales of WAM-V autonomous vehicles, revenue from our previously announced contract with the Department of Energy (“DOE”) and strategic consulting services.Gross profit for Q324 was $0.8 million, as compared to a gross profit of $0.1 million in Q323. Gross profit for the nine months ended January 31, 2024, was $2.0 million, as compared to a gross profit of $0.4 million for the nine months ended January 31, 2023. The improvement in gross margin has been driven by the Autonomous Vehicles business, primarily through an increase in our higher margin WAM-V leasing business, and our strategic consulting services.Operating expenses were $8.6 million in Q324, materially in-line with the second quarter of fiscal 2024 from and up from $6.8 million in Q323. Operating expenses were $24.6 million for the nine months ended January 31, 2024, up from $19.5 million for the nine months ended January 31, 2023. The Company has incurred one-time, non-recurring expenses of approximately $3.2 million year to date for fiscal 2024 to defend against the actions of Paragon Technologies, Inc. (“Paragon”) to attain control of the Company without following applicable legal requirements. Among other things, Paragon initiated extensive litigation against the Company in Delaware, challenging the Company’s position that Paragon must adhere to such requirements, and the Court ruled against Paragon. In addition, Paragon subsequently attempted to prevent the Company from achieving the necessary quorum to hold its Annual Meeting of Stockholders that resulted in further significant costs to the Company.Net loss was $6.5 million for the Q324, as compared to a net loss of $6.1 million for the Q323. Net loss was $20.8 million for the nine months ended January 31, 2024, compared to a net loss of $16.8 million for the nine months ended January 31, 2023. The year over year increases in net loss were primarily driven by the Paragon expenses noted above. Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Combined cash, restricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of January 31, 2024, was $9.3 million, compared to $41.1 million at January 31, 2023.Bank debt remained at $0 as of January 31, 2024.Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended Q324 was $24.7 million, compared to $16.1 million for the same period in the prior year. This reflects the net loss noted above, payment of the earnout related to our autonomous vehicles business as a result of this business exceeding our expectations, investment in inventory to satisfy growing backlog, payment of employment bonuses that were accrued during fiscal year 2023 and incurrence of Paragon related expenses as noted above.

Non-GAAP Measures: PipelinePipeline is not a term recognized under United States generally accepted accounting principles; however, it is a common measurement used in our industry. Our methodology for determining pipeline may not be comparable to the methodologies used by other companies. Pipeline is a representation of the journey potential customers take from the moment they become aware of our products and service to the moment they become a paying customer. The sales pipeline is divided into a series of phases, each representing a different milestone in the customer journey. It is a tool we use to track sales progress, identify potential roadblocks, and make data-driven decisions to improve our sales performance. Revenue estimates derived from our pipeline can be subject to change due to project accelerations, cancellations or delays due to various factors. These factors can also cause revenue amounts to be realized in periods and at levels different than originally projected.

Our profit margins increased nearly 200 basis points as well, driven by more proprietary product sales and consumable product sales as a percent of total sales. Lastly, we ended 2023 with $65.0 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and with no debt, positioning us well to continue to execute on our strategic initiatives in 2024.” Mr. Lampert continued, “2023 was a year of strategic execution and resilience for GrowGen, and we continue into 2024 laser-focused on positioning the business for long-term, profitable growth. One key pillar for growth is continuing to enhance our brand portfolio, including launching new products and increasing sales in our higher margin proprietary brands. We are also expanding into the home gardening market with The Harvest Company, which we launched earlier this year. We believe GrowGen’s expertise in advanced cultivation technologies and sustainable practices developed within the cannabis industry will allow us to succeed in this new market, where consumers are seeking home gardening products to grow healthy, organic, and sustainable microgreens, fruits, and vegetables. Lastly, we remain focused on creating and sustaining operational efficiencies to position ourselves to capitalize on market opportunities as they arise, and I believe they will arise sooner than later as the legislative landscape around cannabis continues to become more favorable.” Reporting Segments Update During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company realigned its operating and reportable segments to correspond with changes to its operating model, management structure, and internal reporting, and to better align with how the Chief Executive Officer makes operating decisions, allocates resources, and assesses performance. Accordingly, the Company identified two operating segments, each its own reportable segment, based on its major lines of business: the Cultivation and Gardening segment; and the Storage Solutions segment. Fourth Quarter 2023 Consolidated Results Net revenues decreased $5.0 million, or 9%, to $49.5 million for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to $54.5 million for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022. The decline was driven primarily by a 3.6% decrease in same-store sales. Net revenues for same-store sale locations open for the same period in 2022 and 2023 were $35.6 million in the fourth quarter 2023, compared to $37.0 million in the fourth quarter 2022. Gross profit was $11.6 million for the fourth quarter 2023, an increase of $2.1 million, compared to gross profit of $9.6 million for the fourth quarter 2022. Gross profit margin was 23.5% for the fourth quarter 2023, compared to 17.6% for the fourth quarter 2022, an increase of 600 basis points, primarily due to improvements in product mix and corresponding margin performance. GAAP net loss was $27.3 million in the fourth quarter 2023, a decrease of $12.3 million, compared to a net loss of $15.0 million in the fourth quarter 2022. Net loss was $0.44 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2023, compared to a net loss of $0.25 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2022. The decrease in GAAP net loss was primarily due to a $15.7 million non-cash impairment recorded in the fourth quarter 2023 of goodwill and intangible assets related to prior acquisitions. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA(1) was a loss of $3.7 million in the fourth quarter 2023, compared to a loss of $10.2 million in the fourth quarter 2022. The increase to Adjusted EBITDA(1) was primarily driven by improvements in gross profit and reductions in operating and corporate expenses relating to our strategic cost rationalization. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of December 31, 2023 were $65.0 million. Full Year 2023 Consolidated Results Net revenues decreased $52.3 million, or 18.8%, to $225.9 million for the full year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $278.2 million for the full year ended December 31, 2022. The decline was driven primarily by a 19.3% decrease in same-store sales. Gross profit was $61.3 million for the full year 2023, a decrease of $9.0 million, compared to gross profit of $70.3 million for the full year 2022. Gross profit margin was 27.1% for the full year 2023, compared to 25.3% for the full year 2022, an improvement of 180 basis points. The improvement to gross margin on a percentage basis was primarily due to stronger penetration of private label as a percent of sales. GAAP net loss was $46.5 million for the full year 2023, a decrease of $117.3 million, compared to net loss of $163.7 million for the full year 2022. Net loss was $0.76 per diluted share for the full year 2023, compared to net loss of $2.69 per diluted share for the full year 2022. The improvement in net income was primarily attributable to 186 basis point improvement in gross margin percent, $13.6 million in annualized expense reductions, along with $112.2 million dollar reduction in impairment related charges. To offset, revenue decreased by $52.3 million. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA(1) was a loss of $5.6 million for the full year 2023, compared to a loss of $16.7 million for the full year 2022. The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA(1) was primarily driven by improvements in the operating and corporate expense structure compared to the prior year. Geographic Footprint The Company’s geographic footprint for its Cultivation and Gardening segment spans approximately 942,000 square feet of retail and warehouse space across 18 states. During 2023, the Company acquired or opened 5 new locations and expanded its physical retail presence into 2 new states. The Company also reduced redundancies in cost structure by closing and consolidating 14 retail locations in 2023, where we were generally able to serve the same customer base through a single location. To date in 2024, the Company further closed and consolidated 3 additional stores and may consider additional store consolidations in the future. First Quarter and Full Year 2024 Outlook(2) Full year 2024 net revenues in the range of $205 million to $215 million Full year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA(1) from a $2 million loss to a $3 million profit First quarter 2024 net revenues in the range of $45 million to $48 million with Adjusted EBITDA(1) between a loss of $1 million and $3 million. Exploring Strategic Opportunities for MMI The Company also announced today that it is exploring strategic opportunities for its benching, racking, and storage solutions business, MMI, which was acquired by the Company in late 2021 and currently constitutes the Company’s Storage Solutions segment. Mr. Lampert commented, “MMI has continued to exceed our expectations, with full year 2024 revenue of $31.4 million and $8.9 million in operating profit, reflecting the tremendous strength and potential of this business. We believe MMI is now in a place where it makes sense to consider strategic opportunities for the business, and we recently engaged Lake Street Capital Markets to advise us in this process. While we are happy having MMI within our portfolio, we also believe that the right strategic opportunity for MMI would better position GrowGen to build upon its achievements and capitalize on additional opportunities within its core Cultivation and Gardening business.” Footnotes (1) Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization as adjusted for certain items as set forth in the reconciliation table of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP information and is a measure calculated and presented on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP.

GrowGeneration defines EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest income, interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, and Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted to exclude certain items such as stock-based compensation, impairment losses, restructuring and corporate rationalization costs, and other non-core or non-recurring expenses and to include income from our marketable securities as these investments are part of our operational business strategy and increase the cash available to us. We believe these non-GAAP measures, when used in conjunction with net income (loss), provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors, facilitating the evaluation of performance across reporting periods. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for internal planning and reporting purposes. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures may be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and valuation. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures address questions routinely received from analysts and investors and, in order to ensure that all investors have access to the same data, we have determined that it is appropriate to make this data available to all investors.

The company plans to repurchase up to $30 million of its common stock and appoints a new CEO. The acquisition is expected to boost revenues and EBITDA, with significant synergies and growth opportunities. Positive Acquisition of Performance Designed Products (PDP) enhances Turtle Beach's product portfolio and profitability. Expected total revenues of $390 to $410 million in the first full year post-acquisition. Anticipated cost synergies of $10 to $12 million annually and potential revenue synergies. Diversis Capital to become the largest shareholder with approximately 16% ownership. 2024 net revenues projected to be $370 to $380 million, driven by the acquisition of PDP. Pro forma combined Adjusted EBITDA estimated between $51 million and $54 million for 2024. Intention to launch a modified Dutch Auction Tender Offer to repurchase up to $30 million of common stock. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of Performance Designed Products (PDP) by Turtle Beach is a strategic move that broadens the company's product offerings and is expected to enhance its market position in the gaming accessories sector. The gaming industry is experiencing robust growth and the demand for gaming accessories is rising in tandem. By acquiring a leading provider of gaming controllers, Turtle Beach not only diversifies its portfolio but also taps into the complementary product lines that could lead to cross-selling opportunities.Furthermore, the expected financial synergies, such as cost reductions and revenue enhancements, are significant. The anticipated $10 to $12 million in annual run-rate cost synergies could improve the combined company's margin profile. Moreover, the acquisition's accretive nature suggests that it will be beneficial to shareholders from a financial metrics standpoint, particularly in terms of earnings per share and return on investment.However, while the acquisition is projected to be immediately accretive, it is also important to monitor the integration process closely. Mergers and acquisitions can sometimes lead to unforeseen challenges, including cultural integration, systems harmonization and customer retention. The success of the acquisition will largely depend on how effectively Turtle Beach can integrate PDP's operations and realize the projected synergies. Financial Analyst The financial implications of Turtle Beach's acquisition of PDP and the subsequent modified Dutch Tender Offer are multifaceted. The enterprise value of $118 million for PDP and the transaction multiple of 4.7x post-synergy Adjusted EBITDA are particularly noteworthy. Compared to industry norms, this multiple is relatively attractive, suggesting that Turtle Beach may have negotiated favorable terms. This could be indicative of a strategic move to consolidate market share without overpaying, which is often a concern in such deals.The Tender Offer, priced at a premium to the current share price, reflects management's confidence in the company's intrinsic value and future prospects. It also represents a return of capital to shareholders, which could be seen as a positive signal regarding the company's liquidity and financial health. The financing of the Tender Offer through cash on hand and borrowing capacity indicates a balanced approach to capital allocation, preserving financial flexibility for future growth initiatives.Investors should consider the impact of these initiatives on the company's leverage, particularly the pro forma prospective net debt of 0.7x. While this level of leverage appears manageable, it is essential to evaluate the company's ability to service its debt, especially in the context of the gaming industry's cyclicality and the potential for market fluctuations. Legal Expert The legal aspects of the acquisition, such as the unanimous approval by the Boards of Directors of both Turtle Beach and PDP, indicate a clear consensus on the strategic fit and potential value creation of the transaction. The involvement of reputable legal advisors and financial institutions in structuring the deal underscores its significance and the due diligence conducted.Additionally, the immediate closure of the transaction upon execution of the definitive agreements suggests that there were no regulatory hurdles or antitrust concerns that could delay the merger. This is often an area of concern in such deals and the absence of such issues could mean a smoother integration process.It is also worth noting the governance changes, with Diversis Capital becoming the largest shareholder and adding a Senior Operating Partner to the Turtle Beach Board. This could lead to shifts in strategic direction and should be monitored for potential impacts on company policy and stakeholder interests. 03/13/2024 - 04:06 PM Highly Accretive Acquisition of Performance Designed Products Expands Product Portfolio, Strengthens Profitability and Meaningfully Enhances Size of Company Establishes a Powerhouse in Hardware Gaming Accessories with Leadership Positions in Console Headsets and Controllers, Amplified by Significant Financial Synergies Announces Intent to Launch a Modified Dutch Tender Offer to Repurchase up to $30 Million in Value of Its Common Stock Between Range of $13.75 - $15.00 Per Share Pro Forma Prospective Net Debt of 0.7X at Transaction Closing Leaves Meaningful Financial Cushion to Fund Additional Growth Initiatives and Capital Return Alternatives Announces the Appointment of Cris Keirn as Chief Executive Officer Turtle Beach Board of Directors Increases to 9 Members to Include Cris Keirn and David Muscatel, Operating Partner at Diversis Capital Provides 2024 Financial Outlook and Summary for Combined Company WHITE PLAINS, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Turtle Beach Corporation (Nasdaq: HEAR) (“Turtle Beach” or the “Company”), a leading gaming accessories brand, announced today that following the Company's establishment of a Value Enhancement Committee in 2023, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) has approved comprehensive and value-creative changes to its business, capital allocation and senior leadership. In consultation with its financial and legal advisors over the past year, the Company considered a comprehensive range of strategic, operational and financial alternatives on behalf of shareholders, including a full sale of the Company, and following the completion of its review, announced the following updates: Strategic Acquisition of Performance Designed Products (“PDP”) Turtle Beach today announced the execution of definitive agreements to acquire PDP, a leading gaming accessories provider at an enterprise value for PDP of $118 million (the “Transaction”). PDP is a privately held third-party gaming accessories leader that designs and distributes aftermarket video game accessories, including controllers, headsets, power cases, and other accessories. The Transaction combines two leading gaming companies with industry-leading teams, significant product momentum and proven track records of delivering profitable growth. The Transaction substantially grows the size of Turtle Beach. Bringing PDP’s leading gaming controller category to Turtle Beach will provide additional scale and create future development opportunities. Furthermore, the Company provided the following strategic rationale: The combined company anticipates total revenues of $390 to 410 million in the first full 12 months of ownership (Q2 2024 through Q1 2025). The post-synergy Adjusted EBITDA of PDP is projected to be $22 to $28 million in the first full 12 months of ownership (Q2 2024 through Q1 2025) implying a post-synergy transaction multiple of 4.7x at the mid-point of estimated 2024 Adjusted EBITDA. Turtle Beach expects $10 to $12 million of anticipated annual run-rate cost synergies for the transaction, with upside for incremental revenue synergies, best practice sharing and further cost synergies over time. Acquiring PDP at an attractive valuation multiple relative to the trading multiples of peers implies potential significant upside in market value for the combined company. Diversis Capital, a Los Angeles-based private equity firm and PDP’s majority owner, will become the largest shareholder of Turtle Beach with approximately 16% of the pro forma basic shares outstanding prior to the expected modified Dutch Tender Offer and will add one of its Senior Operating Partners, David Muscatel, to the Turtle Beach Board. Consideration for the Transaction consists of the issuance of 3.45 million shares of Turtle Beach's common stock and approximately $79.9 million in cash. The Transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to Turtle Beach shareholders on key metrics including the Company’s growth prospects, strategic positioning with retailers and customers, and financial profile. The Board of Directors of both Turtle Beach and PDP have unanimously approved the Transaction and the Transaction was closed immediately upon the execution of the definitive agreements. Jefferies LLC acted as exclusive financial advisor and Dechert LLP acted as legal counsel to Turtle Beach and O’Melveny & Myers LLP acted as legal counsel to PDP in connection with the transaction. 2024 Summary Financial Outlook Turtle Beach is pleased with its share gains experienced during the holiday season, its ongoing cost improvement initiatives, and its 2024 product portfolio, all of which continue to highlight the meaningful, recent positive momentum on both the top and bottom-line for the Company. The acquisition of PDP adds significant financial benefits to Turtle Beach that, in conjunction with synergies realized, fundamentally transforms the financial profile of the Company. Accordingly, the Company expects 2024 net revenues to be in the range of $370 million to $380 million, with the growth driven primarily by the acquisition of PDP and the expected out-performance of the gaming markets in specific categories based on the Company’s product plans for 2024. Additionally, in light of the Company’s strong execution on its efficiency and profitability initiatives, the Company expects pro forma combined Adjusted EBITDA to be between $51 million and $54 million, which incorporates approximately 9 months of operations from PDP. In the first full four quarters of operation (Q2 2024 through Q1 2025), the combined Company expects total net sales to be in the range of $390 - $410 million and Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $60 - $65 million. Intends to Launch a Modified Dutch Auction Tender Offer within One (1) Month To drive further value for Turtle Beach shareholders, the Company announced today that it intends to launch a modified “Dutch Auction” Tender Offer (the “Tender Offer”) to purchase up to $30 million in value of its common stock (the “Common Stock”) at a price per share not less than $13.75 per share and not greater than $15.00 per share, less any applicable withholding taxes and without interest, using available cash on hand and available borrowing capacity. On March 12, 2024, the closing price of the Common Stock was $11.03 per share, setting the low-end of the Tender Offer range at a 25% premium to the most recent closing share price. The Tender Offer is anticipated to commence on or about April 10, 2024 and is expected to expire at 12 midnight, New York City time, at the end of the day on or about May 10, 2024, unless extended or terminated. A modified ""Dutch Auction"" Tender Offer allows shareholders to indicate how many shares of Common Stock and at what price within the range described above they wish to tender their shares. Based on the number of shares tendered and the prices specified by the tendering shareholders, the Company will determine the lowest per-share price that will enable it to acquire up to $30 million in value of Common Stock. The Company’s Board believes the modified “Dutch Auction” Tender Offer structure is a mechanism that affords shareholders with an opportunity to obtain liquidity with respect to all or a portion of their shares, with less potential disruption to the share price and the usual transaction costs inherent in open market purchases and sales. Executive Management and the Board of Directors of Turtle Beach do not plan on participating in the tender offer. Announcement of Chief Executive Officer The Company announced that Turtle Beach’s Board of Directors has appointed Cris Keirn as Chief Executive Officer and to the Board of Directors, effective immediately. The appointment concludes a comprehensive CEO search process, launched by the Board in the second quarter of 2023, with the mandate to appoint a highly qualified leader with extensive product innovation, operational and transformational experience, and capable of delivering strong financial and operational results to drive future growth across the business. Mr. Keirn joined Turtle Beach in 2013 and has been a key contributor in the transformation of Turtle Beach’s product portfolios, including in his role as Vice-President of Business Planning and Strategy prior to his executive role in sales. Mr. Keirn has also led sales operations, customer care and market analytics teams for the Company. Prior to joining Turtle Beach, Cris held leadership positions over a 17-year span in multiple divisions at Motorola across engineering, product management, operations, quality and customer relations. “I’m honored to work with the amazing team at Turtle Beach, now including our new colleagues from PDP, as we continue to deliver fantastic new products for gamers and value to our shareholders,” said Keirn. “Working with our industry partners, and with the combined expertise of our teams, we will drive a transformational change to the company’s scale and execution with innovation and expansion of our leadership positions across gaming accessory categories.” “After a comprehensive review of strategic actions and significant engagement by the Board of Directors, I am excited about the announcements made today that we believe will create substantial value for Turtle Beach shareholders,” said Terry Jimenez, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chairman of the Value Enhancement Committee. “Acquiring PDP, announcing a modified Dutch auction tender offer, and appointing Cris Keirn as our next CEO are significant outcomes that are a result of a thorough review of our business opportunities ahead. We are pleased to welcome the PDP team to Turtle Beach, and we look forward to benefiting from our improved financial profile, gaming product portfolio and industry-leading team. In addition, we are pleased to welcome both Cris and Dave to our Board, both of whom are excellent additions. We’re also excited to have Cris leading the business as CEO and believe his industry expertise and leadership skills are critical to advancing our strategy to drive growth across our gaming accessories businesses and generate substantial profit. Ultimately, each of these outcomes better position the Company for future success and value creation for shareholders.” Conference Call Details Turtle Beach will host a conference call today, March 13, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. ET / 2:00 p.m. PT to review the transaction, detail its fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings results and host a question-and-answer session.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to its reported results, the Company has included in this release certain financial metrics, including adjusted EBITDA, that the Securities and Exchange Commission define as “non-GAAP financial measures.” Management believes that such non-GAAP financial measures, when read in conjunction with the Company's reported results, can provide useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period-to-period comparisons of the Company's results. Non-GAAP financial measures are not an alternative to the Company’s GAAP financial results and may not be calculated in the same manner as similar measures presented by other companies. “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined by the Company as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation (non-cash), and certain non-recurring special items that we believe are not representative of core operations, as further described in Table 4 of our Full Year 2023 Earnings Release. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented because management uses non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company’s operating performance, to perform financial planning, and to determine incentive compensation. Therefore, the Company believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to, and facilitates additional analysis by, investors. The non-GAAP financial measures included herein exclude items that management does not believe reflect the Company’s core operating performance because such items are inherently unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring, or non-cash. See a reconciliation of GAAP results to Adjusted EBITDA included as Table 4 in our Full Year 2023 Earnings Release for each of the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023.

The quarterly distribution per Class A Unit is $12.00, with a special one-time distribution of $48.00. For Depositary Receipts, the quarterly distribution is $0.40, with a special one-time distribution of $1.60 per Receipt. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by New England Realty Associates Limited Partnership regarding the quarterly distribution and a special one-time distribution represents a significant capital return to investors. The quarterly distribution of $12.00 per Class A Limited Partnership Unit is a direct reflection of the company's current profitability and cash flow status. Additionally, the special one-time distribution of $48.00 per Class A Unit indicates a substantial surplus of capital or a strategic decision to return capital to investors, which could be derived from asset sales, refinancing, or other one-time financial gains.It's essential to compare the distribution amounts to historical payouts to assess the growth trajectory of the company's distributions. If the distributions have increased, this may suggest improved operational efficiency or asset performance. Conversely, if the distributions have remained static or decreased, this could potentially raise concerns about the company's future growth prospects. Investors should also consider the sustainability of these distributions, as high payouts may not always be maintainable in the long term, especially if they exceed the company's free cash flow. Market Research Analyst The impact of such distributions on the stock market typically results in increased investor interest in the company's stock, as it reflects a tangible return on investment. The market's perception of the company's financial health could be positively influenced, potentially leading to a rise in the stock price. However, it is crucial to analyze the underlying reasons for the special one-time distribution. If it is a result of divesting a valuable asset, the company's future earning potential might be affected, which could offset the short-term positive impact on the stock price.Furthermore, the ratio of the distribution to the stock's price, known as the yield, is a critical metric for income-focused investors. A high yield, especially in the context of a special one-time distribution, may attract income investors but could also signal that the market is requiring a higher return due to perceived risks associated with the investment. Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) Analyst Given that New England Realty Associates operates as a Limited Partnership, which often shares similar characteristics to Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), the distributions can be a significant factor in investment decisions. The company's ability to generate consistent rental income, manage operational costs effectively and navigate the real estate market's cyclical nature are all reflected in its distribution levels. The real estate market conditions, including occupancy rates, rental prices and property values, are critical determinants of the company's performance.Investors should also consider the tax implications of these distributions, as they may differ from dividends paid by corporations. In the case of REITs and similar entities, distributions are often taxed as ordinary income, which could affect the after-tax return for investors. The special one-time distribution might also carry different tax consequences, which should be analyzed carefully. 03/13/2024 - 04:06 PM ALLSTON, Mass., March 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- On March 28, 2024, New England Realty Associates Limited Partnership (NYSE MKT: NEN) will make its quarterly distribution to its Class A Limited Partners and holders of Depositary Receipts of record as of March 23, 2024.

The company reported strong financial performance despite a non-recurring impairment charge. Anika's President and CEO, Cheryl R. Blanchard, expressed satisfaction with the results and highlighted key milestones achieved. Negative Recorded a non-recurring, non-cash impairment charge in Q4 2023 for intangible assets associated with acquisitions. Net loss for the year was significant due to impairment charges and other associated costs. Non-Orthopedic revenue saw a decline in Q4 and full year 2023. Cash used in operations for the year was $1.8 million. Financial Analyst Anika Therapeutics' reported revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter and full year are indicators of the company's operational efficiency and market adoption of its products. The notable 11% increase in OA Pain Management annual revenues suggests a strong market presence and effective commercial strategies. However, the non-recurring, non-cash impairment charge of $62.2 million is a significant event that reflects adjustments in the valuation of acquired assets, often indicative of changes in expected future cash flows or market conditions.The projected adjusted EBITDA of $25 to $30 million for 2024, representing a substantial increase over 75% at the midpoint and an adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 15%, is a forward-looking statement that may influence investor expectations. This projection, combined with the announced cost reduction initiatives aimed at saving $10 million annually, suggests that the company is focusing on cost efficiency and profitability. However, it is essential to consider the sustainability of these measures and their potential impact on the company's growth trajectory. Market Research Analyst The increase in OA Pain Management revenue indicates a growing demand for Anika's products in this segment, which could be due to an aging population or advances in treatment options. The upward trend in Joint Preservation and Restoration revenue, with a 9% increase, also points to a broader market acceptance. Nonetheless, the decrease in Non-Orthopedic revenue by 29% suggests challenges in that sector, which may require strategic realignment.Understanding the market dynamics and competitive landscape is crucial for forecasting the company's future performance. The emphasis on regenerative and sports medicine products, as well as joint solutions, is aligned with current industry trends towards less invasive and more regenerative treatment options. The company's ability to innovate and meet market demands will be critical for its continued success. Medical Research Analyst The reported financial outcomes are reflective of Anika Therapeutics' strategic focus on early intervention orthopedics. The record annual revenues in OA Pain Management underscore the potential of the company's hyaluronic acid (HA) franchise, which is a cornerstone in managing osteoarthritis pain. The launch of new products in regenerative and sports medicine aligns with the industry's shift towards personalized and advanced therapeutic options.It is essential to evaluate the clinical impact of these new products, as their efficacy and safety profiles will play a significant role in their market penetration and, consequently, the company's financial performance. The announced cost reduction initiatives, while beneficial from a financial standpoint, should not compromise the quality of research and development, which is vital for maintaining a competitive edge in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors. 03/13/2024 - 04:05 PM Revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA1 exceeded expectations in the fourth quarter and full year OA Pain Management achieved record annual revenues of $102 million, up 11% in 2023 Announces cost reduction initiatives providing annualized savings of approximately $10 million Anika positioned to generate adjusted EBITDA1 of $25 to $30 million in 2024, up over 75% at the midpoint, representing an adjusted EBITDA1 margin of at least 15% BEDFORD, Mass., March 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Anika Therapeutics, Inc.

With the progress made in 2023, and in recognition of the slower than expected pace of growth in some of its more mature product lines, the Company has decided to further reduce its planned spending for 2024 and to reduce approximately 9% of its workforce, effective the end of the first quarter. The cost reductions, on an annualized basis, are expected to provide savings of approximately $10 million, excluding the impact of one-time costs. These actions position Anika to focus on its strengths and preserve the Company’s significant opportunities with its strong, growing and differentiated product lines and pipeline, and accelerate Anika’s pivot to profitability. Fiscal 2024 Guidance In 2024, Anika is prioritizing accelerated growth in profitability, with a focus on the products with the greatest growth opportunities and where the Company has the most differentiated right-to-win. As such, Anika expects revenue for fiscal year 2024 of $168 to $173 million, representing growth of 1% to 4% compared to 2023. Revenue ranges by product family are: OA Pain Management of $102 to $104 million, up 0% to 2%, on sustained above-market growth offset by some unfavorable order timingJoint Preservation and Restoration of $58 to $60.5 million, up 6% to 10%Non-Orthopedic of $8 to $8.5 million, down 14% to 19% The Company expects adjusted EBITDA for 2024 to be $25 to $30 million, up over 75% at the midpoint, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 15%, up over 6 points compared to 2023.

Strategic Business Update Beginning in mid-2023, Anika engaged Piper Sandler and conducted a company-wide strategic review, evaluating a wide range of strategic alternatives for the company to increase shareholder value, including a potential sale. Anika remains open to all value enhancing opportunities and regularly reviews what makes the most sense for the business.

Non-GAAP Financial Information Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, the Company’s reported financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Furthermore, the Company’s definition of non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. Because non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease the Company’s reported results of operations, Anika strongly encourages investors to review the Company’s consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. The Company presents these non-GAAP financial measures because it uses them as supplemental measures in internally assessing the Company’s operating performance, and, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, it is set as a key performance metric to determine executive compensation. The Company also recognizes that these non-GAAP measures are commonly used in determining business performance more broadly and believes that they are helpful to investors, securities analysts, and other interested parties as a measure of comparative operating performance from period to period. Adjusted Gross Margin Adjusted gross margin is defined by the Company as adjusted gross profit divided by total revenue. The Company defines adjusted gross profit as GAAP gross profit excluding amortization of certain acquired assets and non-cash product rationalization charges. Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is defined by the Company as GAAP net income (loss) excluding depreciation and amortization, interest and other income (expense), income taxes, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition related expenses, non-cash charges related to goodwill impairment, non-cash product rationalization charges and charges related to discontinuation of a software project. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EPS Adjusted net income (loss) is defined by the Company as GAAP net income excluding acquisition related expenses, inclusive of the impact of purchase accounting, on a tax effected basis, non-cash charges related to goodwill impairment, non-cash product rationalization charges and charges related to discontinuation of a software project. Adjusted diluted EPS is defined by the Company as GAAP diluted EPS excluding acquisition related expenses and the impact of purchase accounting, each on a tax-adjusted per share basis, non-cash product rationalization charges and charges related to discontinuation of a software development project. A reconciliation of adjusted gross profit to gross profit (and the associated adjusted gross margin calculation), adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) to net income (loss) and adjusted diluted EPS to diluted EPS, the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, is shown in the tables at the end of this release.

Reports Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2023 Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Fossil Group, Inc. announces financial results for Q4 and FY 2023, reporting a decrease in net sales, operating loss, and adjusted loss per share. The company also outlines strategic plans to maximize shareholder value and provides a full-year outlook for 2024. Positive Fossil Group, Inc. reported a decrease in worldwide net sales for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023, with net sales down 16% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Operating loss for the full year was $143 million compared to an operating loss of $1 million in the previous year. Adjusted operating loss for the full year was $92 million, or 6.5% of net sales, compared to adjusted operating income of $7 million in the prior year. Full year diluted loss per share was $3.00 and adjusted loss per share was $2.24, as compared to diluted loss per share of $0.85 and adjusted loss per share of $0.71 in the previous year. Cash and cash equivalents as of December 30, 2023, were $117 million. The company announced a strategic review of its current business model and capital structure, aiming to maximize shareholder value. Fossil Group expects 2024 worldwide net sales to be approximately $1.2 billion, with an adjusted operating margin expected to be in the range of -3% to -5%. Negative Net sales declined across all regions and channels for both the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 compared to the previous year. The company reported an operating loss for the full year of 2023, a significant decline from the previous year. Financial Analyst The recent financial results from Fossil Group, Inc. indicate a significant downturn in performance, with a 16% decline in net sales and a substantial increase in operating loss from $1 million to $143 million year-over-year. Such a decline in revenue and profitability can be attributed to multiple factors, including weakness in the wholesale channel, the strategic exit from the smartwatch category and store closures. These results are likely to influence investor sentiment and could impact stock price volatility in the short term.However, it's important to consider the company's liquidity position and cost-saving measures under the TAG Plan, which have resulted in $125 million of annualized cost savings. The anticipated additional operating income benefits of $100 million in 2024 and the expected positive free cash flow, bolstered by a significant tax refund, may provide some optimism for long-term recovery. The strategic review to optimize operations and strengthen the balance sheet, including potential asset monetization, could also reshape investor perspectives on the company's future viability. Market Research Analyst The retail landscape has been challenging for traditional watchmakers like Fossil, with the exit from the smartwatch category highlighting a strategic shift away from tech-integrated products. This decision reflects the intense competition from tech giants and a need to focus on core competencies. The reported sales declines across all regions and channels suggest a broader market trend of softening consumer demand, potentially exacerbated by the global economic climate.Moreover, the company's store rationalization initiatives are a response to the evolving retail environment where e-commerce continues to gain ground. The shift in strategy towards a more streamlined operation could potentially improve operating efficiency in the long run but may continue to impact sales negatively in the short term. It will be crucial to monitor consumer responses to these strategic shifts and the company's ability to adapt to market trends. Economist Fossil Group's financial results must be contextualized within the broader economic environment, which has been characterized by inflationary pressures and shifting consumer spending patterns. The increased interest expense is indicative of the rising cost of borrowing amid higher interest rates, which can strain companies with significant debt loads. The company's strategic review and potential restructuring suggest a proactive approach to navigating these economic headwinds.From a macroeconomic perspective, the retail sector's performance is often seen as a bellwether for consumer confidence and discretionary spending. Fossil's downturn may signal broader concerns about the health of the global economy. As such, stakeholders should be mindful of economic indicators and policy decisions that could further influence the operating context for Fossil and the retail industry at large. 03/13/2024 - 04:06 PM Worldwide Net Revenue and Adjusted Operating Margin in Line with GuidanceAnnounces Strategic Review to Maximize Shareholder ValueCompany Provides Full Year 2024 Outlook RICHARDSON, Texas, March 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fossil Group, Inc.

Importantly, we remain on track with our TAG Plan and expect to achieve our previously announced target of $300 million of annualized operating income benefits by the end of 2025. Additionally, we are taking deliberate actions to improve our financial performance, strengthen our balance sheet, and conduct a strategic review of our current business model and capital structure with the goal of maximizing shareholder value.” Fourth Quarter and Full Year Summary Fourth quarter worldwide net sales decreased to $421 million, down 16% on a reported basis and 17% in constant currency, with sales declines across all regions and all channels.Full year worldwide net sales decreased to $1,412 million, down 16% on both a reported and constant currency basis, with sales declines across all regions and all channels.Full year operating loss was $143 million compared to operating loss of $1 million a year ago.

Fourth Quarter 2023 Operating Results Amounts referred to as “adjusted” as well as “constant currency” are non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their closest reported GAAP measures are included at the end of this press release. Net sales totaled $421.3 million, a decrease of 15.6% on a reported basis and 16.9% in constant currency compared to $499.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. The sales decrease was largely driven by weakness in the wholesale channel, store rationalization initiatives and lower smartwatch sales, as we exit the category. Net sales, in constant currency, decreased 22% in Europe, 16% in Asia and 12% in the Americas versus the same quarter last year. Wholesale sales declined 19%, while our direct to consumer sales declined 14% on a constant currency basis. Within our direct to consumer channels, comparable retail sales declined 10%. In our major product categories, traditional watch sales declined 10% in constant currency in the fourth quarter with slight growth in the FOSSIL brand more than offset by declines in most other brands.

The year-over-year increase in gross margin primarily reflects reduced freight and inventory costs. These improvements were partially offset by unfavorable product mix, driven by our exit from the smartwatch category, and minimum licensor product royalties.Operating expenses totaled $224.5 million compared to $234.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses were 53.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to 46.9% in the prior year fourth quarter. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses, which exclude restructuring and impairment, were $207.7 million compared to $232.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, a reduction of 10.6%. The year-over-year decline in SG&A was largely driven by lower compensation costs related to initiatives in our TAG Plan. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 49.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to 46.5% in the prior year fourth quarter, largely driven by deleveraging on lower sales.Operating loss was $24.0 million compared to income of $1.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Operating margin was (5.7)% in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to 0.3% in the prior year fourth quarter.

Adjusted net loss for the quarter was $16.0 million with adjusted loss per diluted share of $0.30 compared to adjusted net loss of $7.0 million with adjusted loss per diluted share of $0.14 in the prior year period. During the fourth quarter of 2023, currencies favorably affected loss per diluted share by approximately $0.01.Cash flow from operating activities was $49 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $104 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Full Year 2023 Operating Results Net sales totaled $1.4 billion, a decrease of 16.0% on a reported basis and 15.9% in constant currency compared to $1.7 billion in fiscal year 2022. The sales decrease was largely driven by weakness in the wholesale channel. Declines in smartwatch sales and our store rationalization initiatives comprised approximately 5 points of our annual sales decline. Net sales, in constant currency, decreased in all regions with Europe decreasing 21%, Americas 14% and Asia 10% versus the prior year. Global sales into wholesale channels declined 21% in constant currency, while sales into our direct to consumer channels decreased 7%.

Net sales in leathers and jewelry decreased 11% and 15%, respectively, in constant currency. From a brand perspective, MICHAEL KORS, FOSSIL and EMPORIO ARMANI sales declined. Gross profit totaled $679.6 million compared to $830.7 million in fiscal year 2022. Gross margin decreased 130 basis points to 48.1% versus 49.4% a year ago. The gross margin decrease primarily reflects increased promotions and licensor minimum royalty costs and unfavorable currency and product mix impact, driven by our exit from the smartwatch category. These costs were partially offset by reduced freight expense.Operating expenses totaled $822.6 million compared to $832.2 million in 2022. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses were 58.2% compared to 49.5% in fiscal year 2022. SG&A expenses, which exclude restructuring and impairment, were $777.2 million compared to $823.7 million in fiscal year 2022, a reduction of 5.6% driven by lower operating costs, primarily from initiatives in our TAG Plan. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 55.0% compared to 49.0% in fiscal year 2022, mainly driven by deleveraging on lower sales.Operating income (loss) was a loss of $143.0 million compared to a loss of $1.5 million in fiscal year 2022. Operating margin was (10.1)% for fiscal year 2023 compared to (0.1)% in the prior year. Adjusted operating loss totaled $(92.0) million compared to income of $7.0 million in fiscal year 2022. Adjusted operating margin was (6.5)% for fiscal year 2023 compared to 0.4% in the prior year.

Other income (expense) was income of $8.7 million, compared to expense of $1.4 million in fiscal year 2022. Income (loss) before income taxes was a loss of $156.1 million compared to loss of $22.1 million in the prior year.Adjusted EBITDA was $(62.6) million, or (4.4)% of net sales in fiscal year 2023 and $36.1 million, or 2.1% of net sales in the prior year.Net loss totaled $157.0 million with loss per diluted share of $3.00, which compares to net loss of $44.2 million and loss per diluted share of $0.85 in the prior year period. Adjusted net loss was $116.9 million with adjusted loss per diluted share of $2.24 compared to adjusted net loss of $36.6 million with adjusted loss per diluted share of $0.71 in the prior year period. During the fiscal year 2023, currencies unfavorably affected loss per diluted share by approximately $0.10.Cash used in operations was $59 million compared to $111 million used in the prior year. Balance Sheet Summary As of December 30, 2023, the Company had total liquidity of $181 million, including $117.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and $64.0 million of availability under its revolving credit facility. Inventories at year-end totaled $252.8 million, a decrease of 32.8% versus a year ago. Total debt as of December 30, 2023 was $207.5 million. TAG Plan Update The Company remains on track with its TAG Plan, which was announced in March 2023 and is designed to reduce operating expenses, improve operating margins and advance the Company’s commitment to profitable growth. The TAG Plan generated annualized operating income benefits of approximately $125 million in 2023 and is expected to generate additional annualized operating income benefits of at least $100 million in 2024. Restructuring costs associated with our TAG Plan are estimated to be $35 million in fiscal year 2024 compared to $49 million in fiscal year 2023. Strategic Business Review The Company today announced a strategic review of its current business model and capital structure. This includes efforts to optimize its business model through additional changes to its operations, as well as further structural cost reductions, which are under consideration. The Company anticipates this effort will expand on its current TAG Plan and could include additional debt and equity financing options, including monetization of various assets to strengthen its balance sheet. The Company has retained Evercore to act as its financial advisor. Outlook The Company expects 2024 worldwide net sales to be approximately $1.2 billion, reflecting approximately $100 million of negative impact related to the exit of its smartwatch business, the closure of stores and prevailing currency rates, as well as expected category, consumer and channel softness. Fiscal year adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the range of -3% to -5%. The Company expects to generate positive free cash flow, inclusive of an anticipated tax refund of approximately $56 million, which is expected to be received in the second quarter of 2024.

The study's inability to show a significant reduction in androstenedione (A4) levels could cast doubts on the future revenue potential of tildacerfont for treating adult classic Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH). This setback may influence investor sentiment and could potentially lead to a reevaluation of the company's market valuation, especially considering the high R&D expenses reported for the year. However, the positive preliminary data from the pediatric CAHptain-205 study suggests a potential for recovery if further studies yield favorable results. The company's strategic decision to implement cost reduction measures, including a workforce reduction and termination of the CAHmelia-203 clinical trial, may improve financial stability in the short-term by extending the cash runway through the end of 2025. Medical Research Analyst The clinical implications of the CAHmelia-203 trial are significant for Spruce Biosciences. The failure to achieve the primary efficacy endpoint in a trial targeting severe hyperandrogenemia in adult patients with classic CAH is a setback for the company's drug development pipeline. However, the safety profile of tildacerfont remains a positive takeaway. The pediatric CAHptain-205 study showing a 73% efficacy endpoint achievement rate is promising and supports further investigation. The pharmacokinetic differences observed between children and adults could be pivotal in tailoring future dosing regimens. While these results do not guarantee regulatory approval, they do provide a basis for continued research and potential future trials. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the success of tildacerfont in pediatric patients could open a niche market segment for Spruce Biosciences, considering the unmet medical need in rare endocrine disorders like classic CAH. Pediatric indications often benefit from regulatory incentives such as extended market exclusivity, which could partially offset the impact of the adult trial's failure. The collaboration revenue from Kaken Pharmaceutical indicates a strategic move to penetrate the Japanese market, diversifying the company's revenue streams and potentially mitigating risks associated with reliance on a single product or market. The upcoming topline results from the CAHmelia-204 study and further dose-ranging data in the fourth quarter of 2024 will be pivotal in shaping the long-term commercial prospects of tildacerfont. 03/13/2024 - 04:08 PM CAHmelia-203 Study of Tildacerfont in Adult Classic Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) with Severe Hyperandrogenemia Did Not Meet Primary Efficacy Endpoint Positive Data from CAHptain-205 Study of Tildacerfont in Pediatric Classic CAH Supports Further Dose-Ranging Across Additional Dosing Cohorts Topline Results from CAHmelia-204 Study of Tildacerfont in Adult Classic CAH Evaluating Glucocorticoid (GC) Reduction Anticipated in Third Quarter of 2024 Resource Prioritization and Cost Reductions Extend Cash Runway Through End of 2025 Conference Call Today at 4:30 p.m. ET SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Spruce Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: SPRB), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing novel therapies for rare endocrine disorders with significant unmet medical need, today reported financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023 and provided corporate updates. “We are grateful to all the patients, families, study team and investigators who supported the CAHmelia-203 clinical trial,” said Javier Szwarcberg, M.D., M.P.H., Chief Executive Officer, Spruce Biosciences. “CAHmelia-203 is the first study of its kind to address a difficult-to-treat CAH patient population with severe and more refractory hyperandrogenemia, which is often attributed to challenging real-life compliance with daily GCs. We garnered important data from this study which will inform ongoing development of tildacerfont in adult classic CAH.” Dr. Szwarcberg added, “Looking ahead to the third quarter of 2024, we are eager to report topline results from CAHmelia-204, which is focused on assessing GC reduction, a potentially registrational endpoint, in a different population of adult CAH patients with relatively controlled A4 levels and historically better adherence to GC therapy. Assuming positive results from CAHmelia-204 and CAHptain-205, we plan to meet with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and comparable foreign regulatory authorities in early 2025 to outline the design of a registrational clinical program in adult and pediatric classic CAH. Finally, we have made the difficult but necessary decision to streamline our operations and implement cost reduction measures, which has extended our cash runway through the end of 2025. I want to thank all of our employees, including those departing Spruce, for their dedication to advancing our mission of bringing forward novel therapies for CAH and other rare endocrine disorders.” Recent Corporate Updates CAHmelia-203 Study of Tildacerfont in Adult Classic Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) with Severe Hyperandrogenemia Did Not Meet Primary Efficacy Endpoint. CAHmelia-203 enrolled 96 subjects with a mean baseline androstenedione (A4) level of 1,151 ng/dL, which is more than five times above the upper limit of normal (ULN). The clinical trial did not achieve the primary efficacy endpoint of the assessment of dose-response for the change in A4 from baseline to week 12. 200mg QD of tildacerfont demonstrated a placebo-adjusted reduction from baseline in A4 of -2.6% with a non-significant p-value at week 12. Compliance with study medication and glucocorticoid (GC) was low with only 50% of patients reporting 80% or greater compliance, resulting in lower-than-expected tildacerfont exposure. Tildacerfont was generally safe and well tolerated at all doses, with no treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs). Most adverse events were reported as mild to moderate. Positive Data from CAHptain-205 Study of Tildacerfont in Pediatric Classic CAH Supports Further Dose-Ranging Across Additional Dosing Cohorts. CAHptain-205 enrolled 30 children between two and 17 years of age with a mean baseline GC dose of 14 mg/m2/day and mean baseline A4 level of 372 ng/dL. The study characterized the safety and pharmacokinetic profiles of tildacerfont, as well as changes in androgen levels over 12 weeks of treatment, and the ability to reduce daily GC dose upon A4 normalization. Tildacerfont was generally safe and well tolerated at all dose ranges with no treatment-related SAEs reported. Preliminary pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that tildacerfont is cleared more rapidly in children than in adult CAH patients. 73% of all patients (22 of 30 patients) met the efficacy endpoint of A4 or GC reduction from baseline at 12 weeks of treatment with tildacerfont. 70% of patients with elevated baseline A4 values (16 of 23 patients) demonstrated an A4 reduction at week 4. Anticipated Upcoming Milestones Topline results from the CAHmelia-204 clinical trial in adult classic CAH patients on supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids with normal or near normal levels of A4 in the third quarter of 2024 Topline results from additional dose-ranging in the Phase 2 CAHptain clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2024 End of Phase 2 (EOP2) meeting with the U.S. FDA in the first quarter of 2025 Full Year 2023 Financial Results Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023 were $96.3 million. The company currently has over $81 million in cash and cash equivalents. Resource prioritization and cost reductions, including termination of the CAHmelia-203 clinical trial and a reduction in force of approximately 21%, extend cash runway through the end of 2025, including beyond anticipated topline results from CAHmelia-204 and additional dose-ranging data from CAHptain-205. Collaboration Revenue: Collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $10.1 million compared to nil in 2022, reflecting the partial recognition of the $15.0 million upfront payment received from Kaken Pharmaceutical (“Kaken”) in connection with the company’s strategic collaboration with Kaken to develop and commercialize tildacerfont for the treatment of classic CAH in Japan. Research and Development (R&D) Expenses: R&D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $49.4 million compared to $35.2 million in 2022. The overall increase in R&D expenses was primarily related to progressing clinical development of tildacerfont in adult classic CAH, pediatric classic CAH and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). General and Administrative (G&A) Expenses: G&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $12.7 million compared to $12.1 million in 2022. Total Operating Expenses: Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $62.1 million compared to $47.3 million in 2022. Non-cash stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $4.6 million compared to $3.6 million in 2022. Net Loss: Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $47.9 million compared to $46.2 million in 2022.

(ANY) reports strong financial results for fiscal year 2023, with a significant increase in Bitcoin mining operations. The company increased its operating hashrate by 409% year-over-year, mined 667 Bitcoin, and achieved a revenue increase of $15.8 million to $21.9 million. Sphere 3D streamlined operations, reduced debt, and liquidated non-strategic investments. The company aims for positive cash flows and plans for the Bitcoin halving in 2024. Positive Significant increase in operating hashrate and Bitcoin mined year-over-year. Revenue increased by $15.8 million to $21.9 million in 2023. Streamlined operations by reducing SG&A, selling non-core businesses, and paying off debt. Achieved a net loss of $23.4 million in fiscal year 2023, compared to $192.8 million in 2022. Corporate developments include terminating agreements, selling assets, and entering settlement agreements. Received Core Scientific equity as part of a settlement agreement. Negative Net loss available to common shareholders in fiscal year 2023. Operating costs and expenses totaled $51.9 million in 2023. Decrease in revenues from the service and product segment. Financial Analyst The financial results of Sphere 3D Corp. reflect a significant operational improvement in the fiscal year 2023, with an increase in revenue driven by enhanced digital mining operations. The strategic divestment of non-core businesses and the repayment of all debt indicate a focus on core competencies and balance sheet strength. The increased operating hashrate is a positive indicator for future revenue potential, especially in light of the recent uptick in Bitcoin prices.However, the reported net loss and the increase in certain operational expenses, such as legal and insurance costs, suggest ongoing challenges in managing costs. The termination of the Master Services Agreement with Gryphon Digital Mining and the subsequent gain from the deconsolidation of MEOA are strategic moves that could improve gross margins and reduce complexity within the company's operational structure.The settlement with Core Scientific and the acquisition of its equity as part of Core Scientific's emergence from bankruptcy is an opportunity for Sphere 3D to potentially benefit from the recovery of the digital mining sector. However, this also introduces a new risk profile associated with the performance of Core Scientific's stock. Market Research Analyst The cryptocurrency mining industry is highly volatile and Sphere 3D's operational results must be contextualized within the broader market dynamics. The anticipated Bitcoin halving event in 2024 is expected to impact miners' profitability, as rewards for mining new blocks will decrease. Sphere 3D's proactive measures to increase operational efficiency and streamline its business model ahead of this event demonstrate strategic foresight.The company's ability to increase its hashrate significantly while also improving its gross margin is indicative of competitive advancements in its mining capabilities. This positions Sphere 3D favorably within the industry, provided that Bitcoin's price remains stable or increases, which is a significant external factor affecting the company's performance.Investors should monitor the market's reaction to these financial results, as well as the performance of Core Scientific's equity, which now constitutes a strategic asset for Sphere 3D. The company's future financial health will likely be influenced by the performance of this investment and the overall health of the cryptocurrency market. Economist The financial outcomes reported by Sphere 3D Corp. offer insights into the economic forces shaping the Bitcoin mining industry. The substantial reduction in net loss year-over-year indicates an improved cost structure, but the business continues to operate at a loss. This highlights the high fixed costs and capital-intensive nature of the cryptocurrency mining sector.The divestiture of non-core segments and the focus on digital mining operations suggest a strategic pivot towards a more concentrated business model. This could yield economic efficiencies and allow for better allocation of capital towards high-growth areas. Nevertheless, the inherent risks associated with Bitcoin's price volatility and regulatory uncertainties remain pivotal economic factors that can affect Sphere 3D's performance.From an economic standpoint, the upcoming Bitcoin halving could lead to a reduction in supply, potentially driving up the price if demand remains constant or increases. Sphere 3D's preparation for this event, coupled with its current operational scale, may position it to capitalize on potential market shifts. However, the long-term sustainability of the business model hinges on the company's ability to adapt to price fluctuations and maintain operational efficiency. 03/13/2024 - 04:10 PM Stamford, Connecticut--(Newsfile Corp. - March 13, 2024) - Sphere 3D Corp.

Financial Analyst A secondary public offering, such as the one announced by REV Group, Inc., involves existing shareholders selling their shares to the public. This event can influence the company's stock price due to changes in supply and demand dynamics. The market often interprets large shareholders selling as a signal about the company's future prospects, which can lead to increased volatility in the stock price. Investors should monitor the offering price relative to the current market price, as a significant discount could suggest the sellers' urgency or a negative outlook on the stock's future performance. Market Research Analyst With American Industrial Partners Capital Fund IV, LP and its parallel fund as the selling shareholders, the market will assess the impact of their exit on REV Group's governance and strategic direction. The funds' divestiture could alter the shareholder base and potentially attract different types of investors. Market participants will also evaluate the role of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Morgan Stanley, given their influence in pricing and stabilizing the offering. Their reputation and the fixed price offering strategy could affect investor confidence and the success of the transaction. Legal Expert The offering's legality hinges on compliance with the SEC regulations, as indicated by REV Group's use of an effective shelf registration statement. This legal framework allows the company to issue securities to the public with more efficiency and flexibility over a three-year period. However, the disclaimer in the press release is a standard precautionary statement to mitigate legal risk, emphasizing that the offering is contingent on market conditions and regulatory compliance, including the registration and qualification under the applicable securities laws. 03/13/2024 - 04:10 PM MILWAUKEE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- REV Group, Inc.

Financial outlook for fiscal 2025 is positive, with revenue expected between $1.555 billion to $1.560 billion and ARR in the range of $1.725 billion to $1.730 billion. Negative None. Financial Analyst UiPath's reported record quarterly revenue of $405 million, marking a 31% increase year-over-year and an ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) of $1.464 billion with a 22% year-over-year growth, are strong indicators of the company's robust financial health and market demand for its automation and AI services. The first quarter of GAAP profitability for UiPath as a public company is particularly noteworthy, reflecting operational efficiency and effective cost management. The dollar-based net retention rate of 119% suggests a high level of customer satisfaction and the potential for continued revenue growth from existing customers.The non-GAAP gross margin of 89% compared to the GAAP gross margin of 87% indicates that the company has managed to maintain high profitability margins, even when excluding certain non-cash expenses like stock-based compensation. This is a positive sign for investors as it demonstrates the company's pricing power and operational leverage. Moreover, the significant cash flow from operations, reaching $146 million and the strong balance sheet with $1.9 billion in cash and marketable securities, provide the company with substantial resources to invest in growth opportunities and weather potential market downturns. Market Research Analyst UiPath's strategic investments, such as the expansion of its product offerings with Autopilot™ for Studio and Test Suite and the partnership with Google Cloud, position the company to capitalize on the growing demand for enterprise automation and AI solutions. The introduction of Generative AI Connectors and the expansion of UiPath Integration Service are likely to enhance the company's competitive edge by making its platform more accessible and valuable to developers.The U.S. Department of Defense agreement worth up to $95 million through UiPath partner FedResults is a significant development. It not only provides a stable revenue stream but also validates the company's solutions in high-security environments. UiPath's expanded partnership with Deloitte's Smart Finance for Growth Companies is another strategic move that could lead to deeper market penetration, particularly in the finance sector, by offering tailored automation solutions. Economist UiPath's financial outlook for fiscal year 2025, with expected revenue in the range of $1.555 billion to $1.560 billion and ARR between $1.725 billion to $1.730 billion, reflects confidence in the company's growth trajectory. However, the projected non-GAAP operating income of approximately $295 million indicates that the company plans to continue investing heavily in growth, which may affect short-term profitability but could potentially yield long-term gains in market share and technological leadership.The company's mention of typical seasonal patterns in its guidance suggests a nuanced understanding of its sales cycles, which is crucial for stakeholders when evaluating the company's future performance. The inability to provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP operating income guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measure due to variability and complexity highlights the difficulties in predicting certain financial outcomes, which investors should consider when assessing the company's future prospects. 03/13/2024 - 04:10 PM Fourth Quarter Highlights Record quarterly revenue of $405 million increases 31 percent year-over-year ARR of $1.464 billion increases 22 percent year-over-year Achieves first quarter of GAAP profitability as a public company Cash flow from operations and non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow reach $146 million NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- UiPath, Inc. (NYSE: PATH), a leading enterprise automation and AI software company, today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2024 ended January 31, 2024. “We delivered a strong close to the fiscal year with fourth quarter ARR growing 22 percent year-over-year to $1.464 billion, underscoring the meaningful outcomes our Business Automation Platform delivers for our customers,” said Rob Enslin, UiPath Chief Executive Officer. “The combination of UiPath’s AI and automation is the strategic change enabler for our customers that makes any digital transformation easier and faster, while empowering customers to innovate, adapt more quickly, and grow.” Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Financial Highlights Revenue of $405 million increased 31 percent year-over-year. ARR of $1.464 billion increased 22 percent year-over-year. Net new ARR of $86 million. Dollar based net retention rate of 119 percent. GAAP gross margin was 87 percent. Non-GAAP gross margin was 89 percent. GAAP operating income was $15 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $111 million. Net cash flow from operations was $146 million. Non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow was $146 million. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $1.9 billion as of January 31, 2024. Full Year Fiscal 2024 Financial Highlights Revenue of $1.308 billion increased 24 percent year-over-year. Net new ARR of $260 million. GAAP gross margin was 85 percent. Non-GAAP gross margin was 87 percent. GAAP operating loss was $(165) million. Non-GAAP operating income was $233 million. Net cash flow from operations was $299 million. Non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow was $309 million. “The team executed well in the fourth quarter and I am particularly pleased with our significant year-over-year increase in operating margins, including our first quarter of GAAP profitability as a public company, and record cash flow,” said Ashim Gupta, UiPath Chief Financial Officer. “Looking ahead to fiscal year 2025, this afternoon’s guidance reflects typical seasonal patterns in the business as well as our plans to strategically invest to further expand our market leadership while continuing to drive operating leverage.” Financial Outlook For the first quarter fiscal 2025, UiPath expects: Revenue in the range of $330 million to $335 million ARR in the range of $1.508 billion to $1.513 billion as of April 30, 2024 Non-GAAP operating income of approximately $55 million For the fiscal full year 2025, UiPath expects: Revenue in the range of $1.555 billion to $1.560 billion ARR in the range of $1.725 billion to $1.730 billion as of January 31, 2025 Non-GAAP operating income of approximately $295 million Reconciliation of non-GAAP operating income guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability, complexity and low visibility with respect to the charges excluded from this non-GAAP measure; in particular, the effects of stock-based compensation expense specific to equity compensation awards that are directly impacted by unpredictable fluctuations in our stock price. We expect the variability of the above charges to have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on our future GAAP financial results.

Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Key Performance Metric Annualized Renewal Run-rate (ARR) is a key performance metric we use in managing our business because it illustrates our ability to acquire new subscription customers and to maintain and expand our relationships with existing subscription customers. We define ARR as annualized invoiced amounts per solution SKU from subscription licenses and maintenance and support obligations assuming no increases or reductions in customers’ subscriptions. ARR does not include the costs we may incur to obtain such subscription licenses or provide such maintenance and support, and does not reflect any actual or anticipated reductions in invoiced value due to contract non-renewals or service cancellations other than for certain reserves, for example those for credit losses or disputed amounts. ARR does not include invoiced amounts associated with perpetual licenses or professional services. ARR is not a forecast of future revenue, which can be impacted by contract start and end dates and duration. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as ARR is an operating metric and is not intended to replace these items. Dollar-based net retention rate represents the rate of net expansion of our ARR from existing customers over the preceding 12 months. We calculate dollar-based net retention rate as of a period end by starting with ARR from the cohort of all customers as of 12 months prior to such period end (Prior Period ARR). We then calculate the ARR from these same customers as of the current period end (Current Period ARR). Current Period ARR includes any expansion and is net of any contraction or attrition over the preceding 12 months but does not include ARR from new customers in the current period. We then divide total Current Period ARR by total Prior Period ARR to arrive at dollar-based net retention rate. Dollar-based net retention rate may fluctuate based on the customers that qualify to be included in the cohort used for calculation and may not reflect our actual performance. Investors should not place undue reliance on ARR or dollar-based net retention rate as an indicator of future or expected results. Our presentation of these metrics may differ from similarly titled metrics presented by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Non-GAAP financial measures are financial measures that are derived from the consolidated financial statements, but that are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). This earnings press release includes financial measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the SEC, including non-GAAP cost of licenses, non-GAAP cost of subscription services, non-GAAP cost of professional services and other, non-GAAP gross profit and margin, non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses, non-GAAP research and development expenses, non-GAAP general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating income and margin, and non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude: stock-based compensation expense; amortization of acquired intangibles; employer payroll tax expense related to employee equity transactions; restructuring costs; charitable donation of Class A common stock; and in the case of non-GAAP net income, estimated tax adjustments associated with the add-back items, as applicable. Additionally, this earnings release presents non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow, which is calculated by adjusting GAAP operating cash flows for the impact of purchases of property and equipment, cash paid for employer payroll taxes related to employee equity transactions, net payments/receipts of employee tax withholdings on stock option exercises, and cash paid for restructuring costs. UiPath uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes they are useful to investors, by excluding the effects of special items that do not reflect the ordinary earnings of our operations, and as a supplement to GAAP measures. UiPath believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing its financial results with other companies in UiPath’s industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. Investors should consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, our financial performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Further, our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies. The information below provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this earnings press release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. We encourage investors to consider our GAAP results alongside our supplemental non-GAAP measures, and to review the reconciliation between GAAP results and non-GAAP measures that is included at the end of this earnings press release. This earnings press release and any future releases containing such non-GAAP reconciliations can also be found on the Investor Relations page of UiPath’s website at https://ir.uipath.com/.

Financial Analyst The reported growth in annual revenue and annualized recurring revenue (ARR) by SentinelOne is a strong indicator of the company's financial health and its ability to attract and retain customers. A 38% increase in revenue and a 39% increase in ARR year-over-year is a significant achievement, particularly in the competitive cybersecurity market. The growth in customers contributing more than $100,000 in ARR suggests that SentinelOne is successfully scaling its operations and appealing to larger enterprise clients. The dollar-based net retention rate of approximately 115% indicates that existing customers are increasing their spending, which is a positive signal for future revenue stability.Improvements in both GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins, as well as operating margins, reflect better cost management and efficiency gains. However, the company is still operating at a loss, with a GAAP operating margin of (61)% for the fiscal year. This is not uncommon for growth-stage tech companies investing heavily in expansion. The forward-looking guidance suggests an intent to narrow operating losses, which could signal a strategic shift towards profitability. Investors should monitor the company's progress towards these targets, as achieving them could have a positive impact on the stock's performance. Market Research Analyst The cybersecurity sector is experiencing rapid growth due to increasing digital threats and the adoption of cloud technologies. SentinelOne's strong revenue growth and expansion of its customer base are indicative of the company's competitive positioning in the market. The Singularity Platform's scale and breadth, as mentioned by the CFO, are likely contributing factors to the company's success in capturing market share. The emphasis on enterprise-wide visibility and autonomous cybersecurity reflects industry trends towards integrated, AI-driven security solutions.Considering the market dynamics, SentinelOne's focus on innovation and security leadership is essential for maintaining its growth trajectory. The company's financial outlook for fiscal year 2025 suggests confidence in continued growth and an improvement in profitability metrics. As enterprises increasingly prioritize cybersecurity, SentinelOne's growth prospects appear robust. However, competition remains fierce and maintaining industry-leading growth will require constant innovation and effective execution of business strategies. Economist The fiscal results of SentinelOne can be seen as a microcosm of larger economic trends, particularly in the technology and cybersecurity sectors. The substantial revenue increase and improved margins are reflective of the high demand for cybersecurity solutions in an era of digital transformation. SentinelOne's performance also suggests that the company has effectively leveraged economies of scale and potentially benefited from network effects as its platform expands.The projected guidance for future margins indicates that SentinelOne is moving towards a sustainable financial model, which is critical for long-term shareholder value. The broader economic context, including potential headwinds such as regulatory changes, shifts in technology spending and macroeconomic factors, will play a role in the company's ability to meet its guidance. Investors would do well to consider these external factors alongside the company's operational performance when evaluating its financial outlook. 03/13/2024 - 04:10 PM Revenue increased 38% year-over-year ARR up 39% year-over-year MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- SentinelOne, Inc.

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which statements involve risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to statements regarding our future growth, execution, competitive position, and future financial and operating performance, including our financial outlook for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and our full fiscal year 2025, including non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating margin; progress towards our long-term profitability targets; and general market trends. The words “believe,” “may,” “will,” “potentially,” “estimate,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “could,” “would,” “project,” “target,” “plan,” “expect,” or the negative of these terms and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. However, not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. There are a significant number of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from statements made in this press release, including but not limited to: our limited operating history; our history of losses; intense competition in the market we compete in; fluctuations in our operating results; actual or perceived network or security incidents against us; our ability to successfully integrate any acquisitions and strategic investments; actual or perceived defects, errors or vulnerabilities in our platform; risks associated with managing our rapid growth; general global market, political, economic, and business conditions, including those related to declining global macroeconomic conditions, interest rate volatility, supply chain disruptions and inflation, actual or perceive instability in the banking sector, potential uncertainty with respect to the federal debt ceiling and budget and potential government shutdowns related thereto, and geopolitical uncertainty, including the effects of the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine and the judicial reform in Israel; our ability to attract new and retain existing customers, or renew and expand our relationships with them; the ability of our platform to effectively interoperate within our customers' IT infrastructure; disruptions or other business interruptions that affect the availability of our platform including cybersecurity incidents; the failure to timely develop and achieve market acceptance of new products and subscriptions as well as existing products, subscriptions and support offerings; rapidly evolving technological developments in the market for security products and subscription and support offerings; length of sales cycles; and risks of securities class action litigation. Additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results are included under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” set forth in our filings and reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K, subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings and reports that we may file from time to time with the SEC, copies of which are available on our website at investors.sentinelone.com and on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. You should not rely on these forward-looking statements, as actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements as a result of such risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information and estimates available to us as of the date hereof, and were based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections as well as the beliefs and assumptions of management. We do not assume any obligation to update the forward-looking statements provided to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date of this press release or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unexpected events, except as required by law. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions, or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe the following non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance. We use the following non-GAAP financial information to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, with the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. In addition, the utility of free cash flow as a measure of our liquidity is limited as it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for a given period. Reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP are contained below. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. As presented in the “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Information” table below, each of the non-GAAP financial measures excludes one or more of the following items: Stock-based compensation expense Stock-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is dependent on market forces that are often beyond our control. As a result, management excludes this item from our internal operating forecasts and models. Management believes that non-GAAP measures adjusted for stock-based compensation expense provide investors with a basis to measure our core performance against the performance of other companies without the variability created by stock-based compensation as a result of the variety of equity awards used by other companies and the varying methodologies and assumptions used. Employer payroll tax on employee stock transactions Employer payroll tax expenses related to employee stock transactions are tied to the vesting or exercise of underlying equity awards and the price of our common stock at the time of vesting, which varies in amount from period to period and is dependent on market forces that are often beyond our control. As a result, management excludes this item from our internal operating forecasts and models. Management believes that non-GAAP measures adjusted for employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions provide investors with a basis to measure our core performance against the performance of other companies without the variability created by employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions as a result of the stock price at the time of employee exercise. Amortization of acquired intangible assets Amortization of acquired intangible asset expense is tied to the intangible assets that were acquired in conjunction with acquisitions, which results in non‑cash expenses that may not otherwise have been incurred. Management believes excluding the expense associated with intangible assets from non-GAAP measures allows for a more accurate assessment of our ongoing operations and provides investors with a better comparison of period-over-period operating results. Acquisition-related compensation costs Acquisition-related compensation costs include cash-based compensation expenses resulting from the employment retention of certain employees established in accordance with the terms of the acquisition of Attivo Networks, Inc. in May 2022 (the Attivo acquisition). Acquisition-related cash-based compensation costs have been excluded as they were specifically negotiated as part of the Attivo acquisition in order to retain such employees and relate to cash compensation that was made either in lieu of stock-based compensation or where the grant of stock-based compensation awards was not practicable. In most cases, these acquisition-related compensation costs are not factored into management's evaluation of potential acquisitions or our performance after completion of acquisitions, because they are not related to our core operating performance. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges can vary significantly based on the size and timing of acquisitions and the maturities of the businesses being acquired. Excluding acquisition-related compensation costs from non-GAAP measures provides investors with a basis to compare our results against those of other companies without the variability caused by purchase accounting. Restructuring charges Restructuring charges primarily relate to severance payments, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, impairment charges related to excess facilities and inventory write-offs. These restructuring charges are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because they are the result of discrete events that are not considered core-operating activities. We believe that it is appropriate to exclude restructuring charges from non-GAAP financial measures because it enables the comparison of period-over-period operating results from continuing operations. Gains and losses on strategic investments Gains and losses on strategic investments relate to the subsequent changes in the recorded value of our strategic investments. These gains and losses are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because they are the result of discrete events that are not considered core-operating activities. We believe that it is appropriate to exclude gains and losses from strategic investments from non-GAAP financial measures because it enables the comparison of period-over-period net income (loss). Income tax benefit We believe that excluding the tax benefit associated with the partial reversal of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 provides our senior management as well as other users of our financial statements with a valuable perspective on the performance and health of the business. This partial reversal relates to the realization of our deferred tax assets used to offset deferred tax liabilities recorded in the Attivo acquisition. This one-time benefit is not indicative of current or future operations and expenses. Non-GAAP Cost of Revenue, Non-GAAP Gross Profit, Non-GAAP Gross Margin, Non-GAAP Loss from Operations, Non-GAAP Operating Margin, Non-GAAP Net Loss and Non-GAAP Net Loss Per Share We define these non-GAAP financial measures as their respective GAAP measures, excluding the expenses referenced above. We use these non-GAAP financial measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. Free Cash Flow We define free cash flow as cash used in operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software costs. We believe free cash flow is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides our management, board of directors, and investors with information about our future ability to generate or use cash to enhance the strength of our balance sheet and further invest in our business and pursue potential strategic initiatives. Key Business Metrics We monitor the following key metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions. Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR) We believe that ARR is a key operating metric to measure our business because it is driven by our ability to acquire new subscription and consumption and usage-based customers and to maintain and expand our relationship with existing customers. ARR represents the annualized revenue run rate of our subscription and consumption and usage-based agreements at the end of a reporting period, assuming contracts are renewed on their existing terms for customers that are under contracts with us. ARR is not a forecast of future revenue, which can be impacted by contract start and end dates, usage, renewal rates, and other contractual terms. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, we adjusted our historical ARR. The adjustment to ARR did not impact historical total bookings or revenue. Further information relating to this adjustment can be found in “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Key Business Metrics” in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on June 1, 2023. Customers with ARR of $100,000 or More We believe that our ability to increase the number of customers with ARR of $100,000 or more is an indicator of our market penetration and strategic demand for our platform. We define a customer as an entity that has an active subscription for access to our platform. We count Managed Service Providers, Managed Security Service Providers, Managed Detection & Response firms, and Original Equipment Manufacturers, who may purchase our products on behalf of multiple companies, as a single customer. We do not count our reseller or distributor channel partners as customers. Based on the adjustments to ARR described above, customers with ARR of $100,000 or more for the prior periods in fiscal year 2023 have been adjusted accordingly. Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate (NRR) We believe that our ability to retain and expand the revenue generated from our existing customers is an indicator of the long-term value of our customer relationships and our potential future business opportunities. Dollar-based net retention rate measures the percentage change in our ARR derived from our customer base at a point in time. To calculate these metrics, we first determine Prior Period ARR, which is ARR from the population of our customers as of 12 months prior to the end of a particular reporting period. We calculate Net Retention ARR as the total ARR at the end of a particular reporting period from the set of customers that is used to determine Prior Period ARR. Net Retention ARR includes any expansion, and is net of contraction and attrition associated with that set of customers. NRR is the quotient obtained by dividing Net Retention ARR by Prior Period ARR. Source: SentinelOne NYSE: S Category: Investors SENTINELONE, INC.

Boxlight Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results,2024-03-13T20:06:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Boxlight Corporation reports financial results for Q4 and full year 2023, showing a decrease in revenue, gross profit, and net loss. New leadership and corporate restructuring aim to improve profitability and sales efficiency.","Boxlight Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Boxlight Corporation reports financial results for Q4 and full year 2023, showing a decrease in revenue, gross profit, and net loss. New leadership and corporate restructuring aim to improve profitability and sales efficiency. Positive Revenue for Q4'23 decreased by 9.3% to $38.8 million compared to the prior year quarter. Gross profit margin in Q4'23 decreased to 31.7% due to non-recurring charges. Net loss for Q4'23 was $17.7 million, inclusive of $12.0 million impairment charges. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $3.7 million to ($1.1) million in Q4'23. Q4'23 sales orders slightly decreased by 3% to $38.3 million. Boxlight ended Q4'23 with $17.3 million in cash, $54.1 million in working capital, and $16.8 million in stockholders' equity. FY'23 total revenues were $176.7 million, a 20.3% decrease from FY'22. Gross profit margin for FY'23 was 35.8% compared to 29.2% for FY'22. Net loss for FY'23 was $39.2 million compared to $3.7 million for FY'22. Boxlight had $17.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, $54.1 million in working capital, and $40.2 million in debt at the end of 2023. Negative Revenue decrease in Q4'23 and FY'23 due to lower sales volume. Gross profit margin decrease in Q4'23 due to one-time charges. Net loss increase in Q4'23 and FY'23, including impairment charges. Adjusted EBITDA loss in Q4'23 compared to prior year. Increase in operating expenses for Q4'23 and FY'23. Decrease in comprehensive income for Q4'23 compared to prior year. Financial Analyst The reported financial performance of Boxlight Corporation, reflected by a 9.3% decrease in quarterly revenue and a 20.3% decrease in annual revenue, indicates a contraction in the company's business operations. The gross profit margin contraction by 190 basis points in Q4'23 and the substantial net loss, including non-recurring impairment charges, suggest a challenging operational environment. The net loss per share increase from $0.25 to $1.87 year-over-year for the quarter is a significant deterioration in profitability. This performance could potentially affect investor sentiment and the company's stock price negatively in the short term. However, the liquidity position with $17.3 million in cash and a strong working capital figure provides some cushion. The forward-looking statements for Q1 2024, projecting revenue at $34 million and adjusted EBITDA at ($3.0) million, offer transparency but also indicate continued challenges ahead. The management's focus on operational efficiency and strategic realignment could be pivotal in determining the long-term recovery trajectory of the company. Market Research Analyst The interactive technology solutions sector is highly competitive and Boxlight's performance must be contextualized within broader market trends. The decline in sales orders and gross profit margin suggests that Boxlight may be facing intense competition or a shift in market demand. The company's strategic decision to open a Central European Hub Showroom in the UK could be an attempt to strengthen its market presence in Europe and mitigate regional sales volatility. Furthermore, the management's commentary on substantial changes to align with evolving market dynamics and the initial positive feedback from stakeholders may signal a potential turnaround. However, investors would likely monitor the effectiveness of these strategic initiatives closely before adjusting their valuation models. Economist Boxlight's financial results and the impact of foreign currency translation reflect macroeconomic factors, including currency volatility. The constant-currency revenue decrease of 12% and 21% for the quarter and year, respectively, indicates that the company's performance was not solely influenced by exchange rate fluctuations but also by underlying operational issues. The global economic outlook and exchange rate trends will continue to be critical in assessing Boxlight's international business segments. The company's ability to manage costs in the face of non-recurring charges and impairment losses will be crucial in maintaining financial stability. The debt level of $40.2 million also warrants attention, as it could affect the company's financial flexibility and ability to invest in growth opportunities amid changing economic conditions. 03/13/2024 - 04:06 PM New Leadership, Board Corporate Restructuring, Positions Boxlight for Improved Profitability and Sales Efficiency DULUTH, Ga.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Boxlight Corporation (Nasdaq: BOXL) (“Boxlight” or the “Company”), a leading provider of interactive technology solutions, today announced the Company’s financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Financial and Operational Highlights: Revenue was $38.8 million for the quarter, a decrease of 9.3% from the prior year quarter Gross profit margin in Q4'23 decreased by 190 basis points to 31.7% due to non-recurring charges Net loss was $17.7 million, inclusive of non-recurring impairment charges of $12.0 million, compared to net loss of $2.0 million in the prior year quarter Net loss per basic and diluted common share was $1.87, compared to $0.25 net loss per basic and diluted common share in the prior year quarter Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $3.7 million to ($1.1) million from the prior year quarter Ended the quarter with $17.3 million in Cash, $54.1 million in Working Capital and $16.8 million in Stockholders’ Equity Expect Q1 2024 Revenue and adjusted EBITDA at $34 million and ($3.0) million, respectively Q4'23 Sales orders slightly decreased 3% to $38.3 million Announced the opening of our Central European Hub Showroom in the UK Management Commentary “My first few weeks have confirmed my perception that Boxlight is comprised of high-quality assets, exceptional technology, and talented, committed employees,” commented Dale Strang, Boxlight Chief Executive Officer. “With that said, our customers’ needs, as well as the overall dynamics of our market are evolving, and strategically aligning to those changes requires that we make substantial changes to our business. My goal is to empower our team, eliminate duplicative efforts and focus our commercial messages, with the goal of quickly establishing a sustainable platform for profitable growth.” Mr. Strang continued, “This reset is already under way, and we’ve made immediate progress in the clarity in our go-to-market initiatives and a streamlined senior team focused on the evolving needs of our customers. The initial improvements, and the positive reaction from employees, customers, and other stakeholders, gives me significant optimism that we are on the right path.” Financial Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 (Q4'23) vs. Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 (Q4'22) Total revenues were $38.8 million as compared to $42.8 million for Q4'22, resulting in a 9.3% decrease. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to lower sales volume across all markets. Gross profit for Q4'23 was $12.3 million as compared to $14.4 million for Q4'22, resulting in a decrease of 14.5%. Gross profit margin decreased to 31.7% for Q4'23 compared to 33.6% for Q4'22. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily related to one-time charges and adjustments during Q4'23 that did not occur in Q4'22. Total Q4'23 operating expenses were $28.9 million, as compared to $15.2 million for Q4'22. Excluding impairment charges, total Q4'23 operating expenses were $16.9 million and represented an 11.2% increase over Q4'22. The increase in operating expenses is primarily attributable to employee-related expenses to support the Company's growth in certain markets. Net loss, inclusive of the $12.0 million impairment charges increased $15.7 million to $17.7 million for Q4'23 and was a result of the changes noted above. Net loss attributable to common shareholders was $18.0 million in Q4'23 compared to $2.3 million in Q4'22, after deducting fixed dividends paid to Series B preferred shareholders of $0.3 million in both years. Total Q4'23 comprehensive loss was $14.9 million compared to $4.8 million income for Q4'22. The change reflects the effect of foreign currency translation adjustments on consolidation, with the net effect of a $2.8 million income in Q4'23 and a $6.8 million income for Q4'22. Basic and diluted EPS for Q4'23 was ($1.87) compared to ($0.25) for Q4'22. EBITDA loss for Q4'23 was $14.6 million, as compared to EBITDA of $2.5 million for Q4'22. Adjusted EBITDA loss for Q4'23 was $1.1 million, as compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $2.6 million for Q4'22. Adjustments to EBITDA included stock-based compensation expense, impairment of goodwill, gains/losses recognized upon the settlement of certain debt instruments, gains/losses from the remeasurement of derivative liabilities, and the effects of purchase accounting adjustments in connection with prior period acquisitions. Financial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2023 (FY'23) vs. the Year Ended December 31, 2022 (FY'22) Total revenues for FY'23 were $176.7 million as compared to $221.8 million for FY'22, resulting in a 20.3% decrease. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to lower sales volume across all markets. FY'23 gross profit was $63.3 million, or 35.8% gross profit margin, as compared to $64.9 million or 29.2% gross profit margin, for FY'22. Total operating expenses for FY'23 were $89.6 million (inclusive of the $25.2 million impairment charges) as compared to $61.8 million for FY'22. Excluding impairment charges, operating expenses for FY'23 was $64.4 million, resulting in a $2.6 million or 4.2% increase. The year-over-year increase is primarily related to personnel-related expenses to support the Company's growth in certain markets. There were no impairment charges during FY'22. Net loss for FY'23 was $39.2 million, compared to $3.7 million for FY'22. Net loss attributable to common shareholders was $40.4 million and $5.0 million for FY'23 and FY'22, respectively, after deducting fixed dividends paid to Series B preferred shareholders of $1.3 million in both years. Basic and diluted EPS for FY'23 was ($4.28) per basic and diluted share, compared to ($0.58) per basic and diluted share for FY'22. EBITDA loss for FY'23 was $17.6 million, as compared to $15.4 million EBITDA for FY'22. Adjusted EBITDA for FY'23 was $12.6 million, as compared to $18.9 million for FY'22. Balance Sheet At December 31, 2023, Boxlight had $17.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, $54.1 million in working capital, and $40.2 million in debt, net of debt issuance costs.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures To provide investors with additional insight and allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the information used by management in its financial and decision-making surrounding pro forma operations, we supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a basis consistent with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, with EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures of earnings. EBITDA represents net income before income tax expense (benefit), interest expense, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus stock-based compensation, impairment of goodwill, the change in fair value of derivative liabilities, purchase accounting impact of inventory markup, fair value adjustments to deferred revenue, non-cash gains and losses associated with debt settlement. Our management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as financial measures to evaluate the profitability and efficiency of our business model. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to assess the strength of the underlying operations of our business. These adjustments, and the non-GAAP financial measures that are derived from them, provide supplemental information to analyze our operations between periods and over time. We find this especially useful when reviewing pro forma results of operations, which include large non-cash amortizations of intangible assets from acquisitions and stock-based compensation. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We report our operating results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have disclosed in the table below the results on a constant currency basis to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our results without regard to the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. The term foreign currency exchange rates refers to the exchange rates we use to translate our operating results into U.S. Dollars for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar. Because we are a global company, the foreign currency exchange rates used for translation may have a significant effect on our reported results. In general, our reported financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. Dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. Dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which we conduct our business. References to our operating results on a constant-currency basis mean our operating results without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We believe disclosure of constant-currency results is helpful to investors because it facilitates period-to-period comparisons of our results by increasing the transparency of our underlying performance by excluding the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. However, constant-currency results are non-U.S. GAAP financial measures and are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Constant-currency results have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP, are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles, and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Constant-currency results have limitations in their usefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. Discussion of the Effect of Constant Currency on Financial Condition We calculate constant-currency amounts by translating local currency amounts in the current period at actual foreign exchange rates for the prior year period. Our constant-currency results do not eliminate the transaction currency impact of purchases and sales of products in a currency other than the functional currency.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a quarterly common share dividend by Chatham Lodging Trust is a tangible return on investment for shareholders and reflects the company's current financial health and management's confidence in its cash flow stability. The dividend yield, calculated by dividing the annual dividend payments by the share price, is a key metric for investors. In this case, a $0.07 per common share dividend implies a potential yield that investors will compare against industry benchmarks and alternative investment opportunities.Moreover, dividends are often seen as a signal to the market. A stable or increasing dividend can attract income-focused investors and potentially support the share price. Conversely, if the dividend is lower than previous payouts or industry averages, it might raise concerns about the company's future earnings potential or financial management strategies. REIT Analyst For a lodging real estate investment trust (REIT) like Chatham Lodging Trust, the ability to pay dividends is closely tied to its funds from operations (FFO), a key REIT metric that adds depreciation and amortization to earnings. FFO provides a clearer picture of the trust's performance and its ability to generate cash flow from its operations, which is critical for maintaining and growing dividends. The dividend announcement may also reflect the trust's asset performance, including occupancy rates, average daily rates (ADR) and revenue per available room (RevPAR), all of which are vital indicators of a lodging REIT's financial health.Investors and analysts will assess the sustainability of the dividends in the context of the REIT's operational efficiency, capital expenditure requirements and the broader economic environment that influences travel and hospitality demand. Market Research Analyst The timing and consistency of dividend payments can also be indicative of the company's market positioning and competitive landscape. The lodging sector faces unique challenges and opportunities, such as seasonal demand fluctuations, changing traveler preferences and the impact of alternative lodging options like short-term rentals. A consistent dividend may suggest that Chatham Lodging Trust is effectively navigating these market forces and maintaining a competitive edge.Furthermore, the announcement's impact on the stock market will depend on how the dividend aligns with investor expectations and the current yield environment. If the declared dividend meets or exceeds market expectations, it can lead to positive investor sentiment and potentially a favorable reaction in the stock market. Conversely, if the dividend falls short of expectations, it may result in negative sentiment and stock price pressure. 03/13/2024 - 04:10 PM WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Chatham Lodging Trust (NYSE: CLDT), a lodging real estate investment trust (REIT) that invests in upscale, extended-stay hotels and premium-branded, select-service hotels and owns 38 hotels, today announced that its board of trustees declared a quarterly common share dividend of $0.07 per common share, as well as a quarterly preferred share dividend of $0.41406 per preferred share, payable on April 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of March 28, 2024.

The company's strategic shift towards the ODR business is driving higher margins and stronger performance. Positive Consolidated revenue increased by 3.9% to $516.4 million in 2023.

Investment in rental equipment for indoor climate control to support customers' mission-critical operations. Future goal to have ODR revenue between 60% and 70% of consolidated revenue in 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in Owner Direct Relationships (ODR) Segment Revenue by 22.8% in Q4 and 21.1% for the full year indicates a strategic shift in Limbach Holdings' business model towards higher-margin projects. This shift has resulted in ODR accounting for a significant portion of the company's revenue and gross profit, underscoring its importance to the overall financial health of the company. The focus on ODR has contributed to an impressive 175% growth in full-year diluted EPS and a 62.2% increase in Cash Flow from Operating Activities, signaling strong operational performance and financial discipline.However, the slight decrease in consolidated revenue by 0.6% in Q4 due to a more selective approach to project selection in the General Contractor Relationship (GCR) business could raise questions about the company's growth trajectory. Investors may scrutinize whether the benefits of higher margins will consistently outweigh the potential risks associated with reduced revenue diversity. Moreover, the commitment to a revenue goal of 60-70% from ODR for 2024 sets clear expectations for the company's strategic direction but also presents execution risks that will be closely monitored. Market Research Analyst Limbach's investment of approximately $4 million in rental equipment for indoor climate control represents an expansion into a complementary service area that could open up new revenue streams and enhance customer retention. The company's anticipation of a return on this investment in the second half of 2024 suggests confidence in the market demand for such services. This move could potentially diversify Limbach's offerings and reduce reliance on traditional project-based revenue.It is important to note that the building systems solutions market is highly competitive and Limbach's success will depend on its ability to differentiate itself and effectively market its expanded service offerings. The company's strategy to become a one-stop shop for building system solutions may resonate well with customers looking for comprehensive services, which could lead to increased market share if executed effectively. Economist The reported consolidated gross margin increase to 23.3% for the quarter and 23.1% for the year is a positive indicator of improved operational efficiency and cost management. This is particularly relevant in the context of the broader economic environment, where businesses across various sectors are facing pressure from rising costs and supply chain challenges.The company's disciplined approach to project selection, focusing on smaller contracts with shorter durations, may also be a strategic response to economic uncertainties, allowing for greater agility and potentially reducing exposure to market volatility. However, it is critical to analyze how these strategies align with macroeconomic trends and whether they can sustain profitability in the event of an economic downturn. 03/13/2024 - 04:11 PM Owner Direct Relationships (“ODR”) Segment Revenue up 22.8% Year-over-Year for Q4 and 21.1% for the Year ODR Segment Accounted for 55.1% of Revenue and 71.1% of Consolidated Gross Profit for the Quarter Consolidated Gross Margin Increased to 23.3% for the Quarter and 23.1% for the Year Year-end Cash and Cash Equivalents of $59.8 million WARRENDALE, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Limbach Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: LMB) (“Limbach” or the “Company”) today announced its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023. 2023 Fourth Quarter Financial Overview Compared to 2022 Fourth Quarter Consolidated revenue of $142.7 million, a decrease of 0.6% from $143.5 million as the Company continued to take a disciplined approach to select smaller, higher margin projects. Gross profit of $33.3 million, an increase of 14.0% from $29.2 million. Net income of $5.2 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, compared to net income of $3.8 million, or $0.35 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA of $12.6 million, up 8.8% from $11.6 million. Net cash provided by operating activities of $13.9 million compared to $12.4 million. 2023 Overview Compared to 2022 Consolidated revenue of $516.4 million, an increase of 3.9% from $496.8 million. Gross profit of $119.3 million, an increase of 27.3% from $93.7 million. Net income of $20.8 million, or $1.76 per diluted share, compared to $6.8 million, or $0.64 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA of $46.8 million, up 47.3% from $31.8 million. Net cash provided by operating activities of $57.4 million compared to $35.4 million. Management Comments “In 2023, we made tremendous progress executing our strategy to become a pure-play provider of buildings systems solutions. We continued to grow our ODR business as an indispensable partner helping our customers provide mission critical services to maintain uninterrupted operations in their facilities. This strategic shift in customer mix is driving higher margin opportunities and creating a stronger, more resilient Limbach,” said Michael McCann, Limbach’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “I am pleased to report that our team’s focus on accelerating the shift to the ODR business drove expanded margins and delivered Adjusted EBITDA above our guidance for the full year. We grew full-year diluted EPS 175% and Cash Flow from Operating Activities by 62.2%. Furthermore, our full-year ODR revenue increased 21.1% over the previous year. ODR revenue for the quarter was 55.1% of consolidated revenue, exceeding our annual goal of 50%. Our 2024 annual goal for ODR revenue is between 60% and 70% of consolidated revenue. “While our primary focus is on ODR, we are also implementing changes in our General Contractor Relationship (“GCR”) business. We are taking a more selective approach to the projects we pursue by focusing on smaller contracts with shorter durations. In the fourth quarter, our consolidated revenue was by design slightly lower because of this action but going forward, this should provide greater flexibility and drive higher overall returns. “We are evolving our service offerings to better support our customers as a one-stop shop for building system solutions. For example, in 2024 we have already invested approximately $4 million in rental equipment for indoor climate control. This provides our customers with an immediate solution to support their mission-critical operations during emergencies or planned downtimes. As we deploy this new rental solution into the market, we anticipate seeing a return on this investment in the second half of 2024. “We are still in the early stages of our transformation to an even higher quality, more predictable business, and we are confident our strategy is working. Our team will continue our disciplined approach to projects, and we are excited about expanding our customer relationships and service offerings. We also plan to leverage our strong balance sheet to make strategic investments. We believe this strategy will continue delivering value to our customers and higher returns for our shareholders in 2024 and beyond.” The following are results for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022: Consolidated revenue was $142.7 million, a decrease of 0.6% from $143.5 million. ODR segment revenue of $78.6 million increased by $14.6 million, or 22.8%, while GCR segment revenue of $64.1 million was down $15.4 million, or 19.4%. The increase in ODR segment revenue primarily was due to the Company's continued focus on the accelerated growth of its ODR business. The decrease in GCR segment revenue primarily was due to the Company’s continued focus on improving project execution and profitability by pursuing GCR opportunities that were smaller in size and shorter in duration. Gross margin increased to 23.3%, up from 20.4%. On a dollar basis, total gross profit was $33.3 million, compared to $29.2 million. ODR gross profit increased $6.4 million, or 36.8%, due to the combination of an increase in revenue and higher margins of 30.1% versus 27.0% driven by contract mix. GCR gross profit decreased $2.3 million, or 19.1%, as a result of lower revenue. GCR gross margin was flat at 15.0%. This mix shift is a key element of the Company’s strategy to increase profitability by taking a disciplined approach to select smaller, higher margin projects that mitigate the risk and volatility associated with larger, lower margin projects. SG&A expense increased approximately $3.2 million, to $25.0 million, compared to $21.8 million. The increase in SG&A primarily was due to a $2.0 million increase associated with payroll and incentive related expenses, a $0.8 million increase in stock compensation expense, a $1.2 million increase associated with costs incurred by the entities acquired in the ACME and Industrial Air transactions and $0.6 million related to an increase in professional fees, partially offset by a $1.6 million decrease related to certain legal accruals. As a percent of revenue, SG&A expense was 17.5%, up from 15.2%. Interest expense was $0.4 million compared to $0.6 million, which was the result of a lower overall outstanding debt balance period-over-period. Interest income was $0.6 million during the current quarter. This increase was due to the Company's investment strategy in overnight repurchase agreements, U.S. Treasury Bills, and money market funds during 2023. Net income was $5.2 million as compared to $3.8 million. Diluted earnings per share was $0.44 as compared to $0.35. Adjusted EBITDA was $12.6 million as compared to $11.6 million, an increase of 8.8%. Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $13.9 million as compared to $12.4 million. The following are results for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022: Consolidated revenue was $516.4 million, an increase of 3.9% from $496.8 million. ODR segment revenue of $262.0 million increased by $45.6 million, or 21.1%, while GCR segment revenue of $254.4 million decreased by $26.0 million, or 9.3%. The increase in ODR segment revenue primarily was due to the Company's continued focus on accelerating growth of its ODR business. In addition, ODR segment revenue increased by approximately $8.1 million due to the ACME and Industrial Air transactions. The decrease in GCR segment revenue primarily was due to the Company’s continued focus on improving project execution and profitability by pursuing GCR opportunities that are smaller in size (based on contract value) and shorter in duration. Gross margin increased to 23.1%, up from 18.9%. On a dollar basis, total gross profit was $119.3 million, compared to $93.7 million. ODR gross profit increased $21.0 million, or 38.0%, due to the combination of an increase in revenue and higher margins driven by contract mix. GCR gross profit increased $4.6 million, or 11.9%, primarily due to higher margins despite lower revenue. SG&A expense increased approximately $9.5 million, to $87.4 million, compared to $77.9 million. The increase in SG&A primarily was due to a $6.8 million increase associated with payroll and incentive related expenses, a $2.2 million increase in stock compensation expense, a $1.5 million increase in costs incurred by the entities acquired in the ACME and Industrial Air transactions, $1.0 million related to CEO transition costs and $0.8 million related to acquisition-related costs, partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in rent related expenses and a $1.5 million decrease related to certain legal accruals. As a percent of revenue, SG&A expense was 16.9%, up from 15.7%. Interest expense was $2.0 million compared to $2.1 million, reflecting a lower overall outstanding debt balance period-over-period, partly offset by a full-year of interest expense recognized on our financing lease liability arrangement. Interest income was $1.2 million, which was driven by the Company's investments in overnight repurchase agreements, U.S. Treasury Bills, and money market funds. Net income for the year was $20.8 million as compared to $6.8 million. Diluted earnings per share was $1.76 as compared to $0.64. Adjusted EBITDA was $46.8 million as compared to $31.8 million, an increase of 47.3%. Net cash provided by operating activities was $57.4 million as compared to $35.4 million. Balance Sheet At December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents was $59.8 million. Current assets were $217.0 million and current liabilities were $145.1 million at December 31, 2023, representing a current ratio of 1.50x compared to 1.42x at December 31, 2022. Working capital was $71.9 million at December 31, 2023, an increase of $4.9 million from December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2023, we had $10.0 million borrowings outstanding on our revolving credit facility and $4.1 million for standby letters of credit.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures In assessing the performance of our business, management utilizes a variety of financial and performance measures. The key measure is Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, and taxes, as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of, when applicable, other non-cash items or expenses that are unusual or non-recurring that we believe do not reflect our core operating results. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is meaningful to our investors to enhance their understanding of our financial performance for the current period and our ability to generate cash flows from operations that are available for taxes, capital expenditures and debt service. We understand that Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a measure of financial performance and to compare our performance with the performance of other companies that report Adjusted EBITDA. Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, however, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. When assessing our operating performance, investors and others should not consider this data in isolation or as a substitute for net income calculated in accordance with GAAP. Further, the results presented by Adjusted EBITDA cannot be achieved without incurring the costs that the measure excludes. A reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA, the most comparable GAAP measure, is provided below. We refer to our estimated revenue on uncompleted contracts, including the amount of revenue on contracts for which work has not begun, less the revenue we have recognized under such contracts, as “backlog.” Backlog includes unexercised contract options.

(NN) reported financial results for Q4 and full year 2023, with revenue at $1.2 million and $3.9 million respectively. The company acquired additional 900 MHz spectrum licenses, bringing total spectrum assets to 3.5 billion MHz-PoPs. Mariam Sorond became the new CEO, aiming to enhance PNT technology. Financially, operating loss was $19.9 million and net loss was $16.4 million in Q4 2023. The company had $81.9 million in cash as of December 31, 2023. Positive None. Negative None. Telecommunications Analyst The acquisition of additional spectrum licenses by NextNav is a strategic move that could significantly bolster its positioning in the telecommunications sector. Spectrum is a finite resource and is crucial for the delivery of wireless services. The additional 4 MHz in the lower 900 MHz band, increasing NextNav's total to 3.5 billion MHz-PoPs, enhances the company's capacity to provide robust and reliable services. This could potentially lead to new contracts and partnerships, particularly given the increasing demand for enhanced PNT and 3D geolocation services in both public and private sectors.However, the financial commitment of up to $50 million for the additional spectrum needs to be weighed against the company's current financial position. With a reported net loss of $71.7 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and an operating loss of $63.5 million, there is pressure on NextNav to monetize this investment efficiently to reassure investors and improve its financial health. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the reported increase in revenue is a positive indicator, although it's important to note that the revenue growth is modest when compared to the operating and net losses. The reported operating loss and net loss in the recent financial results suggest that NextNav is still in a growth phase where it is investing heavily in its technology and market expansion. This is further evidenced by the significant expenses related to stock-based compensation and payroll, which are typical for companies aiming to attract and retain talent in competitive tech sectors.Investors should consider the company's long-term strategy and the potential market for its services when evaluating the impact of these financial results. The cash position of $81.9 million provides some runway, but given the substantial losses, NextNav will need to demonstrate a clear path to profitability or continued growth in revenue to maintain investor confidence. Market Research Analyst NextNav's focus on next generation PNT technology and its optimized use of the 900 MHz spectrum could position the company as an innovator in a niche market. The telecommunications industry is rapidly evolving, with an increasing focus on applications that require precise location and timing data, such as autonomous vehicles, IoT devices and smart city infrastructure. NextNav's expanded spectrum assets could give it a competitive edge in these markets.However, the market will also be looking at how effectively NextNav can leverage its new CEO's experience and the strategic insights of its newly appointed board member to navigate the competitive landscape. The ability to convert technical capabilities into marketable solutions that address real-world problems will be key to NextNav's success and its impact on the stock market. 03/13/2024 - 04:05 PM Announced Transaction to Acquire Additional 900 MHz Spectrum Licenses Mariam Sorond Joins as NextNav CEO MCLEAN, Va., March 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NextNav Inc.

In line with this strategy, we recently signed an exciting agreement to acquire additional spectrum licenses covering 4 MHz in the lower 900 MHz band. Following close, this significant transaction will bring NextNav’s combined spectrum assets, including its existing 8MHz of contiguous 900 MHz spectrum, to a total of 3.5 billion MHz-PoPs of low band spectrum. PNT powered by low-band spectrum with optimized use is a unique and powerful opportunity to help to address many of the challenges faced by both the public and private sectors, including national security and public safety. As we move forward, we are taking a fresh look at our entire offering and considering how best to take full advantage of our valuable spectrum assets to drive growth and long-term shareholder value.” Recent Operational Highlights Acquires Additional 900 MHz Spectrum Licenses: On March 11, 2024, NextNav announced it had signed an agreement to acquire spectrum licenses covering an additional 4 MHz in the lower 900 MHz band for a total purchase price of up to $50 million.

(PSTX) receives Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for P-BCMA-ALLO1 therapy for multiple myeloma treatment. The company is collaborating with Roche for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Positive early safety and efficacy data were shared at the ASH Annual Meeting.

Positive Poseida Therapeutics receives Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for P-BCMA-ALLO1 therapy for multiple myeloma treatment. Collaboration with Roche for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Positive early safety and efficacy data shared at the ASH Annual Meeting. Phase 1 trial of P-BCMA-ALLO1 demonstrates promising results in terms of safety, efficacy, and cell persistence at tumor sites. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The FDA's Orphan Drug Designation for P-BCMA-ALLO1, a BCMA-targeted allogeneic CAR-T therapy, represents a significant stride in the treatment of multiple myeloma, a hematologic cancer. This designation is typically granted to therapies that show promise for conditions with limited treatment options, thereby acknowledging the potential of P-BCMA-ALLO1 to address the unmet needs in this patient population. The therapy's TSCM-rich composition could signify a longer-lasting immune response, as TSCM cells are known for their self-renewal and multipotency, which are crucial for sustained antitumor activity. The preliminary data suggesting that P-BCMA-ALLO1 can traffic to bone marrow and differentiate into effector T cells without the need for bridging chemotherapy is particularly promising. This could reduce treatment-related morbidity and streamline the therapy process for patients. However, the long-term efficacy and safety profile will need to be closely monitored in ongoing and future clinical trials to validate these early findings. Medical Research Analyst The orphan drug status not only highlights the therapeutic potential of P-BCMA-ALLO1 but also offers Poseida Therapeutics various development and financial incentives, including tax credits and user-fee exemptions. These benefits can accelerate the development timeline and reduce costs for Poseida, which is critical for a clinical-stage company. Furthermore, the potential seven-year market exclusivity upon FDA approval could provide a substantial competitive advantage in the multiple myeloma market, assuming the therapy's clinical success.Investors should note the importance of the upcoming AACR meeting presentation, as data on patients refractory to initial BCMA targeting therapy could provide insights into the therapy's efficacy in a more resistant patient subset. Positive results may boost investor confidence and could be a catalyst for the company's stock performance. Market Research Analyst The market for multiple myeloma treatments is evolving, with increasing emphasis on personalized and targeted therapies. Allogeneic CAR-T therapies like P-BCMA-ALLO1 are particularly noteworthy as they represent a shift towards 'off-the-shelf' treatments, potentially reducing manufacturing times and costs compared to patient-specific autologous CAR-T therapies. This could lead to broader market access and increased adoption rates if clinical efficacy is proven.However, the competitive landscape includes other companies developing BCMA-targeted therapies, which means Poseida's market share will depend on the clinical differentiation of P-BCMA-ALLO1. The partnership with Roche could be instrumental in navigating commercialization challenges, leveraging Roche's established infrastructure and expertise in oncology. 03/13/2024 - 04:05 PM Data Describing Activity of P-BCMA-ALLO1 in BCMA-Experienced Patients to be Presented at Upcoming AACR Meeting SAN DIEGO, March 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Poseida Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: PSTX), a clinical-stage cell and gene therapy company advancing a new class of treatments for patients with cancer and rare diseases, today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of multiple myeloma to P-BCMA-ALLO1, a novel BCMA-targeted allogeneic, T stem cell memory (TSCM)-rich chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T therapy candidate. The Company is investigating P-BCMA-ALLO1 in partnership with Roche for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). ""The Orphan Drug Designation for P-BCMA-ALLO1 underscores the high unmet medical need for a rapid and accessible off-the-shelf allogeneic CAR-T therapy for patients with multiple myeloma,"" said Kristin Yarema, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. ""This designation further validates our belief that TSCM-rich allogeneic CAR-T therapies may potentially offer the optimal combination of clinical results, on-demand availability, and high-volume production, while supporting broader access to CAR-T therapies. We look forward to continuing our work on the Phase 1 study of P-BCMA-ALLO1 and plan to share further clinical updates in 2024."" The Company is currently evaluating P-BCMA-ALLO1 in a Phase 1 clinical trial and recently shared positive early safety and preliminary efficacy data at the 65th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition in December 2023. Data highlighted at the meeting showed that P-BCMA-ALLO1 was a well-tolerated off-the-shelf therapy with a favorable emerging safety profile, delivered to 100% of patients in the intent-to-treat population with no use of bridging chemotherapy or other anti-myeloma bridging therapies. Preliminary data presented at ASH also showed allogeneic TSCM-rich CAR-T cells trafficking to bone marrow, differentiating to cell-killing effector T cells and persisting at least 6 weeks after treatment, which support the hypothesis of cell persistence at tumor-relevant sites. The Company will present data on a subset of recently enrolled patients refractory to initial BCMA targeting therapy in a poster presentation at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting in San Diego on April 8, 2024, 9:00 AM to 12:30 PM PT. Subject to coordination with Roche, the Company plans to provide an additional clinical update on the P-BCMA-ALLO1 program at a scientific meeting in the second half of 2024. The FDA's Orphan Drug Designation program provides orphan status to drugs or biologics intended for the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. Sponsors of medicines that are granted Orphan Drug Designation are entitled to certain incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical trials, prescription drug user-fee exemptions, and potential seven-year marketing exclusivity upon FDA approval. About P-BCMA-ALLO1 P-BCMA-ALLO1 is an allogeneic CAR-T product candidate licensed to Roche targeting B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. This allogeneic program includes a VH-based binder that targets BCMA and clinical data presented at ASH in December 2023 support the Company's belief that TSCM-rich allogeneic CAR-Ts have the potential to offer effective, safe, and reliable treatment addressing unmet needs in multiple myeloma.

The company plans to review strategic options for MMI. Positive Exceeded full-year revenue guidance with $225.9 million in net revenue.

Reviewing strategic opportunities for MMI, focusing on benching, racking, and storage solutions. Negative Net revenues decreased by approximately 18.8% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA(1) showed a loss of $5.6 million for the full year 2023. Same-store sales decreased by 3.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023. Financial Analyst The reported full year net revenue of $225.9 million surpassing guidance and a net loss of $46.5 million present a mixed financial health for GrowGeneration Corp. The revenue beat indicates resilience in their business model despite a notable 18.8% year-over-year decline. The gross profit margin improvement by 180 basis points suggests effective cost management and a strategic shift towards higher-margin proprietary products. However, investors should consider the significant net loss, which, although improved from the previous year, still reflects challenges in achieving profitability.Furthermore, the reduction in operating expenses by $13.6 million and the lack of debt on the balance sheet are positive indicators of financial prudence. The company’s cash position of $65.0 million provides a cushion for future strategic initiatives. However, the forecast for 2024 with revenues expected to decline further could be a concern, indicating either a conservative outlook or underlying market challenges. Market Research Analyst The decline in same-store sales by 19.3% is a critical metric indicating the company's organic growth challenges within existing locations. This metric, often used to gauge a retailer's health, suggests that GrowGeneration is facing competitive pressures or market saturation. The strategic decision to close and consolidate 14 retail locations aligns with efforts to optimize the operational footprint and may improve efficiency but also highlights the need to recalibrate market presence.The company's pivot towards the home gardening market with The Harvest Company could signal an attempt to diversify revenue streams and reduce reliance on the cannabis sector's legislative volatility. This diversification could potentially open new customer segments and revenue channels, but it also requires careful navigation of consumer preferences and market dynamics. Legal Expert The strategic review of MMI, the storage solutions business, suggests a focus on core competencies and potential divestiture to streamline operations. Engaging Lake Street Capital Markets indicates seriousness in exploring strategic opportunities, which could result in a sale or spin-off. The success of MMI, with $31.4 million in revenue and $8.9 million in operating profit, demonstrates its viability as a stand-alone entity or as an attractive acquisition target.However, any transaction would be subject to regulatory approvals and market conditions. The outcome of this strategic exploration could have significant implications for GrowGeneration's capital allocation and focus on its Cultivation and Gardening segment. Stakeholders should monitor this process closely as it could impact the company's strategic direction and financial position. 03/13/2024 - 04:05 PM Full Year Net Revenue of $225.9 million, Beating Guidance Full Year Net Loss of $46.5 million and Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA(1) Loss of $5.6 million, In Line with Guidance 2024 Outlook Calls for Revenue from $205 million to $215 million and Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA(1) from a Loss of $2 million to a Profit of $3 million Company to Review Strategic Opportunities for MMI DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- GrowGeneration Corp.

Our profit margins increased nearly 200 basis points as well, driven by more proprietary product sales and consumable product sales as a percent of total sales. Lastly, we ended 2023 with $65.0 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and with no debt, positioning us well to continue to execute on our strategic initiatives in 2024.” Mr. Lampert continued, “2023 was a year of strategic execution and resilience for GrowGen, and we continue into 2024 laser-focused on positioning the business for long-term, profitable growth. One key pillar for growth is continuing to enhance our brand portfolio, including launching new products and increasing sales in our higher margin proprietary brands. We are also expanding into the home gardening market with The Harvest Company, which we launched earlier this year. We believe GrowGen’s expertise in advanced cultivation technologies and sustainable practices developed within the cannabis industry will allow us to succeed in this new market, where consumers are seeking home gardening products to grow healthy, organic, and sustainable microgreens, fruits, and vegetables. Lastly, we remain focused on creating and sustaining operational efficiencies to position ourselves to capitalize on market opportunities as they arise, and I believe they will arise sooner than later as the legislative landscape around cannabis continues to become more favorable.” Reporting Segments Update During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company realigned its operating and reportable segments to correspond with changes to its operating model, management structure, and internal reporting, and to better align with how the Chief Executive Officer makes operating decisions, allocates resources, and assesses performance. Accordingly, the Company identified two operating segments, each its own reportable segment, based on its major lines of business: the Cultivation and Gardening segment; and the Storage Solutions segment. Fourth Quarter 2023 Consolidated Results Net revenues decreased $5.0 million, or 9%, to $49.5 million for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to $54.5 million for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022. The decline was driven primarily by a 3.6% decrease in same-store sales. Net revenues for same-store sale locations open for the same period in 2022 and 2023 were $35.6 million in the fourth quarter 2023, compared to $37.0 million in the fourth quarter 2022. Gross profit was $11.6 million for the fourth quarter 2023, an increase of $2.1 million, compared to gross profit of $9.6 million for the fourth quarter 2022. Gross profit margin was 23.5% for the fourth quarter 2023, compared to 17.6% for the fourth quarter 2022, an increase of 600 basis points, primarily due to improvements in product mix and corresponding margin performance. GAAP net loss was $27.3 million in the fourth quarter 2023, a decrease of $12.3 million, compared to a net loss of $15.0 million in the fourth quarter 2022. Net loss was $0.44 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2023, compared to a net loss of $0.25 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2022. The decrease in GAAP net loss was primarily due to a $15.7 million non-cash impairment recorded in the fourth quarter 2023 of goodwill and intangible assets related to prior acquisitions. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA(1) was a loss of $3.7 million in the fourth quarter 2023, compared to a loss of $10.2 million in the fourth quarter 2022. The increase to Adjusted EBITDA(1) was primarily driven by improvements in gross profit and reductions in operating and corporate expenses relating to our strategic cost rationalization. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of December 31, 2023 were $65.0 million. Full Year 2023 Consolidated Results Net revenues decreased $52.3 million, or 18.8%, to $225.9 million for the full year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $278.2 million for the full year ended December 31, 2022. The decline was driven primarily by a 19.3% decrease in same-store sales. Gross profit was $61.3 million for the full year 2023, a decrease of $9.0 million, compared to gross profit of $70.3 million for the full year 2022. Gross profit margin was 27.1% for the full year 2023, compared to 25.3% for the full year 2022, an improvement of 180 basis points. The improvement to gross margin on a percentage basis was primarily due to stronger penetration of private label as a percent of sales. GAAP net loss was $46.5 million for the full year 2023, a decrease of $117.3 million, compared to net loss of $163.7 million for the full year 2022. Net loss was $0.76 per diluted share for the full year 2023, compared to net loss of $2.69 per diluted share for the full year 2022. The improvement in net income was primarily attributable to 186 basis point improvement in gross margin percent, $13.6 million in annualized expense reductions, along with $112.2 million dollar reduction in impairment related charges. To offset, revenue decreased by $52.3 million. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA(1) was a loss of $5.6 million for the full year 2023, compared to a loss of $16.7 million for the full year 2022. The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA(1) was primarily driven by improvements in the operating and corporate expense structure compared to the prior year. Geographic Footprint The Company’s geographic footprint for its Cultivation and Gardening segment spans approximately 942,000 square feet of retail and warehouse space across 18 states. During 2023, the Company acquired or opened 5 new locations and expanded its physical retail presence into 2 new states. The Company also reduced redundancies in cost structure by closing and consolidating 14 retail locations in 2023, where we were generally able to serve the same customer base through a single location. To date in 2024, the Company further closed and consolidated 3 additional stores and may consider additional store consolidations in the future. First Quarter and Full Year 2024 Outlook(2) Full year 2024 net revenues in the range of $205 million to $215 million Full year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA(1) from a $2 million loss to a $3 million profit First quarter 2024 net revenues in the range of $45 million to $48 million with Adjusted EBITDA(1) between a $2 million loss and breakeven Exploring Strategic Opportunities for MMI The Company also announced today that it is exploring strategic opportunities for its benching, racking, and storage solutions business, MMI, which was acquired by the Company in late 2021 and currently constitutes the Company’s Storage Solutions segment. Mr. Lampert commented, “MMI has continued to exceed our expectations, with full year 2024 revenue of $31.4 million and $8.9 million in operating profit, reflecting the tremendous strength and potential of this business. We believe MMI is now in a place where it makes sense to consider strategic opportunities for the business, and we recently engaged Lake Street Capital Markets to advise us in this process. While we are happy having MMI within our portfolio, we also believe that the right strategic opportunity for MMI would better position GrowGen to build upon its achievements and capitalize on additional opportunities within its core Cultivation and Gardening business.” Footnotes (1) Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization as adjusted for certain items as set forth in the reconciliation table of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP information and is a measure calculated and presented on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP.

GrowGeneration defines EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest income, interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, and Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted to exclude certain items such as stock-based compensation, impairment losses, restructuring and corporate rationalization costs, and other non-core or non-recurring expenses and to include income from our marketable securities as these investments are part of our operational business strategy and increase the cash available to us. We believe these non-GAAP measures, when used in conjunction with net income (loss), provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors, facilitating the evaluation of performance across reporting periods. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for internal planning and reporting purposes. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures may be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and valuation. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures address questions routinely received from analysts and investors and, in order to ensure that all investors have access to the same data, we have determined that it is appropriate to make this data available to all investors.

The Business Combination is set to be approved at the Extraordinary General Meeting on March 25, 2024, with Pubco's shares expected to trade on NYSE under 'LPA'. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst An upcoming business combination between a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) and a prominent industrial and logistics real estate firm in Latin America is noteworthy for stakeholders and investors. The involvement of TWOA and LLP in this transaction suggests a strategic expansion, potentially increasing market share and diversifying revenue streams in a region ripe for growth in industrial real estate.The anticipated listing of the new entity, Pubco, under the ticker symbol 'LPA' on the New York Stock Exchange, signifies a critical juncture that could affect investor confidence and market dynamics. The transition from private to public ownership will likely introduce new capital and governance structures, which could lead to increased scrutiny and expectations from shareholders.Furthermore, the role of BTG Pactual as a financial advisor and placement agent is a strong endorsement, given their established reputation in financial markets. This could enhance investor perception of the deal's credibility and the future company's financial stability. Financial Analyst The declaration by the SEC regarding the effectiveness of the Registration Statement is a crucial step towards the completion of the Business Combination. This regulatory milestone enables the parties to proceed with shareholder voting, which is a significant hurdle in the SPAC process. The successful merger could lead to an infusion of funds and resources, which, if managed effectively, could result in enhanced operational capabilities and long-term shareholder value.Investors should closely monitor the outcome of the Extraordinary General Meeting, as the approval of the Business Combination will pave the way for the listing of Pubco's ordinary shares. The share price post-listing will be an immediate indicator of market reception to the deal. Long-term performance will depend on Pubco's ability to leverage the combined assets and expertise to capitalize on market opportunities in the industrial and logistics sector. Legal Expert The transition from a private to a public entity involves complex legal considerations, including compliance with SEC regulations and corporate governance standards. The effectiveness of the Registration Statement indicates that Pubco has met the necessary legal criteria to move forward. Post-merger, Pubco will need to adhere to heightened transparency and reporting requirements, which can impact operational practices and investor relations.Shareholders' votes at the Extraordinary General Meeting are not only a legal formality but also reflect the trust and support of the existing investor base. The outcome of these votes will have legal implications for the completion of the Business Combination and the subsequent operations of the new public entity. 03/13/2024 - 07:17 PM LLP Sets Special Meeting DateZEPHYR COVE, Nev. and SAN JOSÉ, Costa Rica, March 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- two (NYSE: TWOA) (“TWOA”), a special purpose acquisition company, and LatAm Logistic Properties, S.A.

Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking information with respect to the Business Combination, which may not be included in future public filings or investor guidance. Certain statements in this press release may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements about future events or LLP’s, TWOA’s or Pubco’s future financial or operating performance. For example, statements regarding the benefits of the Business Combination, and the anticipated timing of the completion of the Business Combination are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “pro forma,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “might,” “plan,” “possible,” “project,” “strive,” “budget,” “forecast,” “expect,” “intend,” “will,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “predict,” “potential” or “continue,” or the negatives of these terms or variations of them or similar terminology. These forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future results of LLP, Pubco and TWOA are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industry in which LLP operates, as well as the beliefs and assumptions of LLP’s management. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors beyond LLP’s, Pubco’s or TWOA’s control that are difficult to predict because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. They are neither statements of historical fact nor promises or guarantees of future performance. Therefore, LLP’s and Pubco’s actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements and LLP, Pubco and TWOA therefore caution against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based upon estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by LLP and its management, TWOA and its management, and Pubco and its management, as the case may be, are inherently uncertain and are inherently subject to risks variability and contingencies, many of which are beyond LLP’s, TWOA’s or Pubco’s control. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to: (i) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of any definitive agreements with respect to the Business Combination (the “Business Combination Agreement”); (ii) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against LLP, TWOA, Pubco or others following the announcement of the Business Combination and any definitive agreements with respect thereto; (iii) the inability to complete the Business Combination due to the failure to obtain consents and approvals of the shareholders of TWOA, to obtain financing to complete the Business Combination or to satisfy other conditions to closing, or delays in obtaining, adverse conditions contained in, or the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals required to complete the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement; (iv) changes to the proposed structure of the Business Combination that may be required or appropriate as a result of applicable laws or regulations or as a condition to obtaining regulatory approval of the Business Combination; (v) LLP’s and Pubco’s ability to manage growth; (vi) the ability to meet stock exchange listing standards in connection with, and following, the consummation of the Business Combination; (vii) the risk that the Business Combination disrupts current plans and operations of LLP as a result of the announcement and consummation of the Business Combination; (viii) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the Business Combination, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of Pubco or LLP to grow and manage growth profitably, maintain key relationships and retain its management and key employees; (ix) costs related to the Business Combination; (x) changes in applicable laws, regulations, political and economic developments; (xi) the possibility that LLP or Pubco may be adversely affected by other economic, business and/or competitive factors; (xii) LLP’s estimates of expenses and profitability; and (xiii) other risks and uncertainties set forth in the filings by TWOA or Pubco with the SEC. There may be additional risks that neither LLP nor TWOA presently know or that LLP and TWOA currently believe are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of LLP, TWOA or Pubco speak only as of the date they are made. None of LLP, Pubco or TWOA undertakes any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect any changes in their respective expectations with regard thereto or any changes in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. Nothing in this press release should be regarded as a representation by any person that the forward-looking statements set forth herein will be achieved or that any of the contemplated results of such forward-looking statements will be achieved.

Cemex's EBITDA grew 25% in 2023, with Free Cash Flow doubling.","Standard & Poor’s Upgrades Cemex to Investment Grade Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Standard & Poor's upgrades Cemex's credit rating to Investment Grade (BBB-) due to strong financial performance and deleveraging strategy. Cemex's EBITDA grew 25% in 2023, with Free Cash Flow doubling. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The upgrade of Cemex's long-term issuer credit rating to Investment Grade (BBB-) by Standard & Poor's is a significant indicator of the company's improved financial health and market trust. This upgrade typically leads to lower borrowing costs for the company, as it is now deemed a lower credit risk by lenders. Investors may view this as a positive signal, potentially leading to a more favorable investment environment for Cemex's securities. The company's strong performance, as evidenced by a 25% growth in EBITDA and a doubling of Free Cash Flow after maintenance capital expenditures, suggests that operational efficiencies and a robust deleveraging strategy are in place. The improved national scale issue-level rating further solidifies Cemex's financial standing within the Mexican market, which could attract more domestic investment and enhance its competitive position. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the S&P upgrade reflects broader industry trends where construction and building materials companies are recovering and growing post-pandemic. Cemex's performance, particularly its EBITDA growth and Free Cash Flow increase, indicates a strong demand for its products and a successful adaptation to market conditions. The company's strategic decisions and capital allocation have evidently paid off, leading to this rating upgrade. This development could set a precedent for similar companies in the sector, potentially influencing investor sentiment towards the industry as a whole. It's also a sign that Cemex's medium-term strategy aligns well with market expectations and investor confidence, which could have a ripple effect on the sector's stock performance. Economist The elevation of Cemex's credit rating to Investment Grade status has macroeconomic implications. It is an indicator of economic stability and growth within the construction sector, which is a significant component of GDP in many countries. For emerging markets like Mexico, such positive developments in key companies can enhance the country's investment profile on a global scale. It also reflects well on the overall business climate, suggesting that corporations are able to successfully navigate economic challenges and implement effective financial strategies. Over time, this could lead to increased foreign direct investment, job creation and a healthier economy, benefiting a broader range of stakeholders beyond just the investors and the company itself. 03/13/2024 - 07:03 PM MONTERREY, Mexico--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Rating agency Standard & Poor’s (S&P) announced today that it has upgraded Cemex’s long-term global scale issuer credit rating to Investment Grade (BBB-) due to its strong financial and operating performance, deleveraging strategy, and flexible capital allocation. “Achieving an investment-grade credit rating from S&P is a very important milestone for Cemex,” said Fernando A. González, CEO of Cemex. “While we had record results last year, this rating is recognition of successful execution against our medium-term strategy and consistent financial performance over several years.” In 2023, Cemex’s EBITDA grew 25%, while Free Cash Flow after maintenance capex more than doubled. S&P also upgraded Cemex’s national scale issue-level rating (Mexico) scale to mxAA+ from mxAA.

Positive None. Negative None. 03/13/2024 - 05:42 PM PACIFIC GROVE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- California American Water is pleased to announce that its Eardley-Forest Lake Transmission Main Replacement Project has been awarded a 2024 Award of Merit by the American Public Works Association (APWA) Monterey Bay Chapter. The award recognizes the critical emergency repairs completed in 2023 following a major rainstorm that caused a large tree to fall and damage a 30-inch transmission main in the Monterey service area. This vital pipeline supplies water to the Monterey Peninsula, and the damage necessitated a coordinated response from the company’s engineering and operations teams. To reduce the possibility of future tree incidents, California American Water designed the project so that the replacement section of pipeline would be underground and outside of a sensitive waterway. “Our team responded quickly and efficiently to the critical main break,” said David Pezzini, Engineering Project Manager for California American Water. “We understand the importance of dependable water service for our customers, and we are committed to taking the necessary steps to help ensure safe, reliable water service for our customers and the well-being of the environment.” The repair project involved the replacement and realignment of the damaged section of the transmission main and was completed in November 2023 for an investment of $2.3 million. California American Water partnered with Monterey Peninsula Engineering and Blair, Church & Flynn Consulting Engineers to successfully make repairs while maintaining water service for approximately 100,000 Monterey peninsula customers and businesses. “We are honored to receive this recognition from the APWA Monterey Bay Chapter,” said Pezzini. “This project exemplifies our commitment to investing where it matters, whether that’s during emergencies or while planning for the future.” For a complete list of the 2024 APWA Monterey Bay Chapter Award winners, click here.

Aims to return over $25 million of Free Cash Flow to shareholders. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results reported by VAALCO Energy, Inc. reflect a significant positive performance, with a net income of $60.4 million and a net cash from operating activities of $223.6 million for the full year of 2023. This indicates a robust financial health and effective operational management. The record Adjusted EBITDAX of $280.4 million and Free Cash Flow of $119.7 million are particularly noteworthy, as they represent the company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and exploration expenses, which are critical indicators of a company's operating profitability. The decision to return $50.3 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks demonstrates confidence in the company's financial stability and a commitment to shareholder value. The capital investment of over $70 million in Egypt and Canada, coupled with the company's debt-free status, suggests strategic use of capital for growth while maintaining financial prudence. Looking ahead, the all-cash acquisition of Svenska Petroleum Exploration AB is a strategic move that is expected to be accretive to shareholder value. This term 'accretive' is often used to describe a transaction expected to increase the acquiring company's earnings per share (EPS). The acquisition is poised to expand VAALCO's portfolio and enhance its ability to generate sustainable cash flow, which is a positive signal for investors. However, the commitment to return over $25 million of Free Cash Flow to shareholders in 2024 may raise questions about the balance between rewarding shareholders and reinvesting in further growth opportunities. Market Research Analyst The oil and gas sector is highly volatile, with companies like VAALCO Energy, Inc. navigating fluctuating prices and geopolitical factors. VAALCO's reported 83% year-over-year production increase and the growth of year-end SEC proved reserves by 3% indicate successful operational execution and resource management. These metrics are essential for investors as they signal the company's ability to sustain and increase production, which is a critical driver of revenue in the energy sector. The strategic acquisition of Svenska Petroleum Exploration AB represents a significant expansion into new markets, with the acquired company currently producing approximately 4,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This acquisition aligns with industry trends where companies seek to bolster their portfolios through strategic mergers and acquisitions, which can provide access to new reserves and diversify production risks. The impact of this acquisition on the company's production and reserves will be a key factor to watch, as it could significantly influence VAALCO's market position and stock performance. Energy Sector Analyst VAALCO Energy, Inc.'s operational success in 2023, including the substantial production increase and reserves growth, is commendable within the energy sector. The company's bank debt-free status is a rarity in an industry often characterized by high leverage due to capital-intensive operations. This positions VAALCO favorably in terms of financial flexibility and resilience against market downturns. The acquisition of Svenska Petroleum Exploration AB is a strategic move that introduces geographical diversification, which can mitigate region-specific risks such as regulatory changes or political instability. This diversification is a strategic advantage as it can lead to more stable cash flows. Investors will be interested in the integration of this acquisition and its contribution to VAALCO's overall production efficiency and cost structure. The company's focus on organic and inorganic growth opportunities, as well as the emphasis on maximizing value for shareholders, suggests a forward-looking strategy that could bolster its competitive edge in the energy sector. 03/13/2024 - 05:44 PM VAALCO Reports Record Financial Results and Shareholder Returns Following Year of ExpansionHOUSTON, March 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- VAALCO Energy, Inc.

Reserves estimates were prepared in accordance with the definitions and guidelines set forth in the 2018 Petroleum Resources Management Systems approved by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. George Maxwell, VAALCO’s Chief Executive Officer commented, “In 2023, we delivered record financial results, successfully integrated a major acquisition and continued to return a meaningful amount of value to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Sales and production volumes nearly doubled, we grew our cash position at year-end by nearly $84 million and we generated record Adjusted EBITDAX of $280 million. This allowed us to fully fund, with cash on hand, the return of over $50 million to shareholders through our dividend and buyback programs and over $70 million in a capital program focused on Egypt and Canada, all while remaining bank debt free which demonstrates the strong financial position of the Company today. Our 2023 proved reserves saw 3% growth year-over-year, despite a year of record production across our asset portfolio and significant decreases in SEC pricing. We were able to more than replace our 2023 production through strong positive revisions that more than offset production and reserve reductions due to lower SEC pricing.” “In early 2024, we announced our intent to utilize a portion of this strong cash position to add to our diversified portfolio of high performing assets in line with our strategic vision. With our all-cash deal to buy Svenska, which provides us with a new country entry and strong production and reserves from a proven producing asset as well as a significant organic upside opportunity, we are enhancing VAALCO's ability to generate sustainable cash flow and continue to return cash to our shareholders for many years to come. The acquisition is expected to close in Q2 2024 and is highly accretive on key metrics to our shareholder base and provides another strong asset to support future growth."" “Our ability to execute on our strategic vision has led to unprecedented growth in production, reserves and cash flow, all while extending our runway for future opportunities. We are in the strongest position in VAALCO’s history and are entering 2024 with more reserves, production and future potential. We are adding to that position through the Svenska acquisition, and we remain focused on prioritizing our organic and inorganic growth opportunities as we continue to build a balanced business of scale that is capable of maximizing value for our shareholders. We are excited about the future and believe that 2024 could be another record-breaking year for VAALCO.” Operational Update Egypt In Egypt, VAALCO continued to use the EDC-64 rig in the Eastern Desert drilling campaign. The Company continued drilling the EA-55 development well in the fourth quarter which was the last well of the 2023 campaign. Through operational efficiencies, VAALCO drilled an average of two wells per month with the EDC-64 rig, nearly twice as fast as in 2022 and, VAALCO drilled 18 wells in 2023, while also completing the Arta-77Hz well at the beginning of 2023. The 2023 firm and contingent work program was drilled faster and cheaper compared to budget, adding to its economic returns.

Both wells were drilled and completed safely and cost effectively without incident. The wells were tied in and equipped in April and early May with overall cycle times that were significantly less than historical cycle times. The wells began flowing in May and naturally flowed through June. In early July, the pump and rods were run on both wells. The production rates from both wells exceeded expectations, and the Company is monitoring their long-term performance while evaluating future drilling campaigns, with the intent of moving exclusively to 2.5 mile and 3-mile laterals to improve economics. This resulted in record production levels reported for Canada in 2023. A summary of the Canada drilling campaign's impact during 2023 is presented below: VAALCO Canada 2023 WellsWellSpud dateNet Pay (ft)Penetrated Pay ZonesCompletion ZonePerforation Interval (ft)IP-30 Rate (BOPD)100/12-121/28/202314,430Upper Bioturbated Cardium118 Stg x 15T Hydraulic Fracture Treatmentn/a444 BOPD ; 500 BOEPD102/16-302/22/20237,870Upper Bioturbated Cardium55 Stg x 15T Hydraulic Fracture Treatmentn/a374 BOPD ; 426 BOEPD Gabon VAALCO completed its 2021/2022 drilling campaign in the fourth quarter of 2022. The Company is currently evaluating locations and planning for its next drilling campaign. Gabon production performance in the year ended December 31, 2023 has been strong and ahead of plan driven by improved operational uptime at Etame. The cost savings from the new Floating, Storage and Offloading vessel (""FSO"") have been captured, as planned, but are being offset by increased marine costs as a consequence of inflationary (marine vessel supply rates, transportation, and contractors) and industry supply chain pressures as well as higher diesel costs due to the feed gas line being suspended due to a leak. The gas line was successfully fixed in October 2023 and the FSO is now utilizing gas rather than diesel. Year-End 2023 Reserves VAALCO’s SEC proved reserves at December 31, 2023 increased by 3% to 28.6 MMBOE from 27.9 MMBOE at year-end 2022. Year-end 2023 reserves included 22.5 MMBOE in proved developed reserves and 6.2 MMBOE in proved undeveloped reserves. The Company’s SEC reserves were engineered by its third-party independent reserve consultant, Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., (“NSAI”) who has provided annual independent estimates of VAALCO’s year-end SEC reserves for over 15 years and evaluates VAALCO's Gabonese and Egyptian reserves, and GLJ Ltd. (""GLJ""), who evaluates VAALCO's Canadian reserves. In 2023, the Company added 5.6 MMBOE due to positive revisions and 1.9 MMBOE of SEC proved reserves through extensions and additions, primarily in Canada with additional PUD locations. These additions were partially offset by 6.8 MMBOE of full year 2023 production. VAALCO had a reserve replacement ratio of 110% compared to the 6.8 MMBOE of production in 2023. The standardized measure of VAALCO’s SEC proved reserves, utilizing SEC pricing decreased to $341.9 million at December 31, 2023 from $624.5 million at December 31, 2022. This was primarily driven by a decrease in year over year SEC prices which was utilized for the calculation and can be found in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K disclosure, which is expected to be filed with the SEC by March 15, 2024. MMBoe Proved SEC Reserves at December 31, 2022 27.9 2023 Production (6.8)Revisions of Previous Estimates 5.6 Extensions and Additions 1.9 Proved SEC Reserves at December 31, 2023 28.6 At year-end 2023, NSAI provided the 2P WI CPR estimates of proven and probable reserves which were prepared in accordance with the definitions and guidelines set forth in the 2018 Petroleum Resources Management Systems approved by the Society of Petroleum Engineers as of December 31, 2023 using VAALCO’s management assumptions for future commodity pricing and costs shown below under “Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures - 2P WI CPR Reserves”. The 2P WI CPR reserves attributable to VAALCO’s ownership are reported on a WI basis prior to deductions for government royalties. Management's year-end 2023 2P WI CPR estimate of reserves is 77.3 MMBOE to VAALCO’s WI, an increase of 1% from 76.4 MMBO at December 31, 2022. The present value discounted at 10% (""PV-10"") of VAALCO’s 2P WI CPR reserves at year-end 2023, utilizing management timing assumptions and escalated pricing and cost assumptions, is $630.9 million, down 34% from $814.8 million at December 31, 2022. The PV-10 decrease is driven primarily by pricing and cost inflation. See “Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below concerning 2P WI CPR reserves and 2P PV-10. Financial Update –Fourth Quarter of 2023 Reported net income of $44.0 million ($0.41 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter of 2023 which was up significantly compared with net income of $6.1 million ($0.06 per diluted share) in the third quarter of 2023 and $17.8 million ($0.17 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase in earnings compared to the third quarter of 2023 is mainly due to increased sales revenue due to increased volumes and improved realized pricing due to geographic sales mix, lower credit losses due to reversal of credit loss allowances on the settlement of debts in Gabon and decreased depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”) expense partially offset by higher income tax expense on the increased operating profit. Similarly, the increase in earnings compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 is primarily due to higher sales revenue due to increased volumes, lower credit losses due to reversal of credit loss allowances and decreased DD&A expense partially offset by higher income tax expense. Adjusted EBITDAX totaled $95.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, a 34% increase from $71.4 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher revenues driven by higher sales and improved realized commodity pricing. The increase in fourth quarter 2023 Adjusted EBITDAX to $95.9 million compared with $49.8 million generated in the same period in 2022, is primarily due to increased revenue as a result of the TransGlobe transaction and lower credit losses due to reversal of a credit loss allowance.

Q4 2023 sales were at the top end of VAALCO's guidance. Q4 2023 realized pricing (net of royalties) was up 17% compared to Q3 2023 and up 5% compared to Q4 2022.

The increase in Q4 2023 expense compared to Q3 2023 was driven primarily by higher costs related to higher sales volumes. The increase in Q4 2023 compared to the Q4 2022 was primarily driven by increased expense associated with higher sales and costs associated with the TransGlobe combination as well as higher costs associated with boats, diesel and other direct operating costs. VAALCO has seen inflationary and industry supply chain pressure on personnel and contractor costs. There was no offshore workover expense in Q4 2023 or Q3 2023. There was a 100% decrease in offshore workover expense in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022. Q4 2023 production expense per BOE, excluding offshore workover costs, remained low at $23.27 per BOE which was 5% higher than Q3 2023 and down 22% compared to Q4 2022 due to higher sales, lower costs in Etame associated with the FSO conversion and lower per BOE costs from the Egyptian and Canadian assets. DD&A expense for the Q4 2023, was $20.3 million which was lower than $32.5 million in Q3 2023 and lower than $26.3 million in Q4 2022. The decrease in Q4 2023 DD&A expense, compared to Q3 2023 and to Q4 2022 is due to year-end depletion adjustments, primarily in Egypt, that were made in Q4 upon the completion of the 2023 competent persons report. Q4 2023 included a $0.7 million expense related to an appraisal well in Egypt that was abandoned during Q4 2023 and subsequently expensed to Exploration Expense. General and administrative (“G&A”) expense, excluding stock-based compensation, increased to $6.1 million in Q4 2023 from $5.2 million in Q3 2023 and a negative $0.3 million in Q4 2022. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to higher professional service fees, salaries and wages, and accounting and legal fees. The Company incurred one-time reorganization costs in 2023 as it integrated the TransGlobe assets and eliminated duplicate administrative costs. Q4 2023 G&A was within the Company’s guidance. The Company has made meaningful reductions to absolute G&A costs when compared with the combined TransGlobe and VAALCO combined G&A costs for 2022. Non-cash stock-based compensation expense was $0.9 million for Q4 2023 compared to Q3 2023 of $1.0 million and Q4 2022 of negative $0.1 million. Other income (expense), net, was an expense of $0.8 million for Q4 2023, compared to an income of $2.5 million during Q4 2022 and an income of $0.2 million for Q3 2023. Other income (expense), net, normally consists of foreign currency gains and losses. For Q4 2022, included in other (expense) income was a $10.8 million bargain purchase gain on the TransGlobe acquisition offset by $7.0 million of transaction costs associated with the business combination with TransGlobe. For the full year ended December 31, 2022, acquisition transaction costs were $14.6 million. Q4 2023 income tax expense was an expense of $37.6 million and is comprised of current tax expense of $41.1 million and deferred tax benefit of $3.5 million. Q3 2023 income tax expense was an expense of $25.8 million. This was comprised of $26.8 million of current tax expense and a deferred tax benefit of $0.9 million. Q4 2022 income tax expense was an expense of $7.0 million. This was comprised of $5.3 million of deferred tax expense and a current tax expense of $1.7 million. For all periods, VAALCO’s overall effective tax rate was impacted by non-deductible items associated with derivative losses and corporate expenses. Foreign income taxes for Gabon are settled by the government taking their oil in-kind. Financial Update – Full Year 2023 The Company reported net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 of $60.4 million, which compares to $51.9 million for the same period of 2022. The increase in net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily due to increased sales volumes partially offset by higher production costs, higher DD&A and lower oil prices. Both production and sales volumes for full year 2023 were up 83% to 6.8 MMBOE compared to 3.7 MMBOE production for the prior year. The increase was driven by production from the TransGlobe assets, as well as new wells from the 2021/2022 drilling campaign in Gabon. Crude oil sales are a function of the number and size of crude oil liftings in each quarter and do not always coincide with volumes produced in any given period. The average realized crude oil price for the twelve months of 2023 was $65.83 per barrel, representing a decrease of 30% from $94.77 realized in the twelve months of 2022. This decrease in crude oil price reflects the softening in commodity pricing over the past year, as well as the incorporation of the TransGlobe assets which include Canadian and Egyptian crude, natural gas, and NGLs that have lower realized pricing than Gabon.

These expenditures were primarily related to costs associated with the development drilling programs in Egypt and Canada. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, VAALCO had an unrestricted cash balance of $121.0 million. VAALCO also has an undrawn reserve based lending (""RBL"") facility with $43.75 million of availability to further enhance the Company’s liquidity position. The RBL facility is in its amortization phase. Working capital at December 31, 2023 was $100.7 million compared with $38.0 million at December 31, 2022, while Adjusted Working Capital(3) at December 31, 2023 totaled $113.8 million. VAALCO continues to work with the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation on both collections and offsets. In addition, with the completion of drilling in Canada and Egypt, VAALCO expects to see a reduction in its outstanding Accounts Payable and Accruals. Cash Dividend Policy and Share Buyback Authorization VAALCO paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.0625 per share of common stock for the fourth quarter of 2023 on December 21, 2023. VAALCO increased its quarterly per share dividend amount in 2023 and paid out a total $0.25 per share or approximately $27 million in dividends to its shareholders in 2023. On February 26, 2024, the Company announced its next quarterly cash dividend of $0.0625 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2024 ($0.25 annualized), to be paid on March 28, 2024 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 8, 2024. Future declarations of quarterly dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to approval by the VAALCO Board of Directors. The Company's share buyback program provides for an aggregate purchase of currently outstanding common stock up to $30 million. Payment for shares repurchased under the program will be funded using the Company's cash on hand and cash flow from operations. The actual timing, number and value of shares repurchased under the share buyback program will depend on a number of factors, including constraints specified in any Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, price, general business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. Under such a trading plan, the Company’s third-party broker, subject to SEC regulations regarding certain price, market, volume and timing constraints, has authority to purchase the Company’s common stock in accordance with the terms of the plan. The share buyback program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares in any period, and may be expanded, extended, modified or discontinued at any time. In 2023, VAALCO repurchased $23.6 million in shares. Svenska Acquisition VAALCO expects to acquire 100% of the share capital of Svenska from Petroswede AB (“Petroswede” or the “Seller”) in the acquisition with an effective date of October 1, 2023. Gross consideration for the Acquisition is $66.5 million, subject to customary closing adjustments, with the net cash payment to be made by VAALCO on closing expected to be approximately $30 to $40 million depending on a number of factors including the timing of closing. The Acquisition is subject to a number of customary closing conditions, including regulatory and government approvals. Svenska’s primary license interest is a 27.39% non-operated working interest (30.43% paying interest) in the CI-40 license, which includes the producing Baobab field, located in deepwater offshore Cote d’Ivoire. The field is operated by Canadian Natural Resources Limited, which holds a 57.61% working interest in the project, with the national oil company, Petroci Holding, owning the remaining 15% working interest (10% of which is carried by the other license partners). The CI-40 license has an initial term through mid-2028 with the contractual option to extend the license term by 10 years to 2038, subject to certain conditions. Current production from the Baobab field is approximately 4,500 WI BOEPD, with 1P WI CPR reserves at the Effective Date of 13.0 MMBOE (99% oil), and 2P WI CPR reserves of 21.7 MMBOE (97% oil). These reserve figures reflect currently sanctioned development activities; however, CI-40 has a significant growth runway with incremental development potential on the Baobab field, as well as the nearby Kossipo field, expected to provide a material uplift to the reserve and production volumes, supporting long-term production of the asset into the late 2030s. Cumulative gross production from the field has been approximately 150 MMBOE, a portion of the estimated over one billion barrels of oil equivalent volumes initially in place. CI-40 has a long history of production and significantly de-risked reservoirs. With almost 20 years of production to date, the FPSO is planned to come off station at the start of 2025 for planned maintenance and upgrade work to allow the FPSO to continue to produce through the end of the expected extended field license in 2038. The scope of work for the FPSO upgrade is currently being finalized. Production on Baobab is expected to re-start in 2026 following the FPSO work program. In addition, a fully appraised development drilling program is expected to start in 2026, targeting the significant incremental probable reserve base on the field. VAALCO sees reduced geological risk relating to this drilling program and the joint venture partners have already commenced the ordering of certain long-lead drilling items. Further future drilling phases have not yet been sanctioned, but there is significant incremental potential in both the Baobab field itself, as well as the nearby Kossipo development, which has also been appraised by two wells drilled in 2002 and 2019. In addition to the CI-40 license in Cote d’Ivoire, Svenska currently owns a 21.05% working interest in the early stage Uge discovery in the OML 145 concession in Nigeria alongside partners ExxonMobil (21.05%), Chevron (21.05%), Oando (21.05%) and NPDC (15.80%). There are minimal commitments on this license interest and no drilling or development is currently planned. Hedging The Company continued to proactively hedge a portion of its expected future production to lock in strong cash flow generation to assist in funding its capital and shareholder returns programs.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Management uses Adjusted Net Income to evaluate operating and financial performance and believes the measure is useful to investors because it eliminates the impact of certain non-cash and/or other items that management does not consider to be indicative of the Company’s performance from period to period. Management also believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors to evaluate and compare the Company’s operating and financial performance across periods, as well as facilitating comparisons to others in the Company’s industry. Adjusted Net Income is a non-GAAP financial measure and as used herein represents net income before discontinued operations, impairment of proved crude oil and natural gas properties, deferred income tax expense, unrealized commodity derivative loss, gain on the Sasol Acquisition and non-cash and other items. Adjusted EBITDAX is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by VAALCO’s management and by external users of the Company’s financial statements, such as industry analysts, lenders, rating agencies, investors and others who follow the industry, as an indicator of the Company’s ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt. Adjusted EBITDAX is a non-GAAP financial measure and as used herein represents net income before discontinued operations, interest income net, income tax expense, depletion, depreciation and amortization, exploration expense, impairment of proved crude oil and natural gas properties, non-cash and other items including stock compensation expense, gain on the Sasol Acquisition and unrealized commodity derivative loss. Management uses Adjusted Working Capital as a transition tool to assess the working capital position of the Company’s continuing operations excluding leasing obligations because it eliminates the impact of discontinued operations as well as the impact of lease liabilities. Under the lease accounting standards, lease liabilities related to assets used in joint operations include both the Company’s share of expenditures as well as the share of lease expenditures which its non-operator joint venture owners’ will be obligated to pay under joint operating agreements. Adjusted Working Capital is a non-GAAP financial measure and as used herein represents working capital excluding working capital attributable to discontinued operations and current liabilities associated with lease obligations. Management uses Free Cash Flow to evaluate financial performance and to determine the total amount of cash over a specified period available to be used in connection with returning cash to shareholders, and believes the measure is useful to investors because it provides the total amount of net cash available for returning cash to shareholders by adding cash generated from operating activities, subtracting amounts used in financing and investing activities, and adding back amounts used for dividend payments and stock repurchases. Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and as used herein represents net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and adds the amounts paid under dividend distributions and share repurchases over a specified period. Free Cash Flow has significant limitations, including that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary purposes and should not be used as a substitute for cash flow measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Free Cash Flow should not be considered as a substitute for cashflows from operating activities before discontinued operations or any other liquidity measure presented in accordance with GAAP. Free Cash Flow may vary among other companies. Therefore, the Company’s Free Cash Flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted Net Income have significant limitations, including that they do not reflect the Company’s cash requirements for capital expenditures, contractual commitments, working capital or debt service. Adjusted EBITDAX, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Working Capital and Free Cash Flow should not be considered as substitutes for net income (loss), operating income (loss), cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted Net Income exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income (loss) and operating income (loss) and these measures may vary among other companies. Therefore, the Company’s Adjusted EBITDAX, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Working Capital and Free Cash Flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. PV-10 Value and Probable Reserves PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents the period-end present value of estimated future cash inflows from VAALCO’s reserves, less future development and production costs, discounted at 10% per annum to reflect timing of future cash flows. PV-10 values for 2P WI CPR reserves have been calculated using VAALCO’s management assumptions for timing, escalated crude oil price and cost in the case of 2P WI CPR reserves. PV-10 generally differs from standardized measure, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, because it generally does not include the effects of income taxes; however, VAALCO’s PV-10 does include the effect of income taxes. PV-10 is a widely used measure within the industry and is commonly used by securities analysts, banks and credit rating agencies to evaluate the estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves on a comparative basis across companies or specific properties. VAALCO’s PV-10 includes the effect of income taxes. Neither PV-10 nor the standardized measure purports to represent the fair value of the Company’s crude oil and natural gas reserves. VAALCO has provided summations of its PV-10 for its proved and probable reserves on a 2P WI CPR basis in this press release. The SEC strictly prohibits companies from aggregating proved, probable and possible reserves in filings with the SEC due to the different levels of certainty associated with each reserve category. GAAP does not provide a measure of estimated future net cash flows for reserves other than proved reserves and accordingly it is not practicable to reconcile the PV-10 value of 2P WI CPR reserves to a GAAP measure, such as the standardized measure. Investors should be cautioned that estimates of PV-10 of probable reserves, as well as the underlying volumetric estimates, are inherently more uncertain of being recovered and realized than comparable measures for proved reserves. Further, because estimates of probable reserve volumes have not been adjusted for risk due to this uncertainty of recovery, their summation may be of limited use. Nonetheless, VAALCO believes that PV-10 estimates for probable reserves present useful information for investors about the future net cash flows of its reserves in the absence of a comparable GAAP measure such as standardized measure. 2P WI CPR Reserves 2P WI CPR reserves represent proved plus probable estimates as reported by NSAI and GLJ and prepared in accordance with the definitions and guidelines set forth in the 2018 Petroleum Resources Management Systems approved by the Society of Petroleum Engineers as of December 31, 2021 using escalated crude oil price and cost assumptions made by VAALCO’s management. The SEC definitions of proved and probable reserves are different from the definitions contained in the 2018 Petroleum Resources Management Systems approved by the Society of Petroleum Engineers as of December 31, 2021. As a result, 2P WI CPR reserves may not be comparable to United States standards. The SEC requires United States oil and gas reporting companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved reserves after the deduction of royalties and production due to others but permits the optional disclosure of probable and possible reserves in accordance with SEC definitions. 2P WI CPR reserves and the PV-10 value for 2P WI CPR reserves, as calculated herein, may differ from the SEC definitions of proved and probable reserves because: ● Pricing for SEC is the average closing price on the first trading day of each month for the prior year which is then held flat in the future, while the 2P WI CPR pricing is based on management pricing assumptions for future Brent oil pricing for 2023 of $80.00 and $70.00 in 2024, escalated 2% per year thereafter and for Equatorial Guinea, given the expectation of first oil beginning in 2026, Brent oil pricing of $74.27 was assumed for 2026, escalated 2% per year thereafter;● Lease operating expenses are not escalated in the SEC case, while for the 2P WI CPR reserves case they are escalated at 2% annually beginning on January 1, 2023. For the 2P WI CPR reserves for Svenska, such reserves may differ from the SEC definitions of proved and probable reserves because: Pricing for SEC is the average closing price on the first trading day of each month for the prior year which is then held flat in the future, while the 1P and 2P WI CPR pricing is based on pricing assumptions for future Brent oil pricing for 2023 of $84.5 and up to 2030 the Brent Oil price follows the average of four available forecasts and assumes flat real thereafter. Oil price is escalated 2% per year; Lease operating expenses are typically not escalated under the SEC’s rules, while for the WI CPR reserves estimates, they are escalated at 2% annually beginning in 2024. Additionally, (i) the reserves estimates for Svenska were prepared by Petroleum Development Consultants Limited and prepared in accordance with the definitions and guidelines set forth in the 2018 Petroleum Resources Management Systems approved by the Society of Petroleum Engineers and (ii) are as of October 1, 2023. Management uses 2P WI CPR reserves as a measurement of operating performance because it assists management in strategic planning, budgeting and economic evaluations and in comparing the operating performance of the Company to other companies. Management believes that the presentation of 2P WI CPR reserves is useful to its international investors, particularly those that invest in companies trading on the London Stock Exchange, in order to better compare the Company’s reserve information to other London Stock Exchange-traded companies that report similar measures. VAALCO also believes that this information enhances its investors’ and securities analysts’ understanding of its business. However, 2P WI CPR reserves should not be used as a substitute for proved reserves calculated in accordance with the definitions prescribed by the SEC. In evaluating VAALCO’s business, investors should rely on the Company’s SEC proved reserves and consider 2P WI CPR reserves only supplementally. The tables below reconcile the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDAX, Adjusted Working Capital and Free Cash Flow.

Market Research Analyst The announcement of the completion of a business combination, particularly involving a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) like DHC Acquisition Corp., is a significant event that can influence market perceptions and investor confidence. The successful shareholder approval indicates a positive reception from the investors of DHC Acquisition Corp., which can be seen as a vote of confidence in the future prospects of Brand Engagement Network Inc. (BEN).From a market research perspective, the transition to a public entity provides BEN with access to capital markets, which can be instrumental in fueling its growth initiatives and technological advancements in the AI sector. The listing under the new ticker symbols 'BNAI' for common stock and 'BNAIW' for publicly traded warrants will also enhance visibility among investors and can potentially lead to increased liquidity for the shares.It is important to monitor the post-merger performance and the integration process, as these factors will be critical in determining the long-term value creation for shareholders. The AI industry is highly competitive and BEN's ability to differentiate its personalized customer engagement solutions will be essential for its market positioning. Financial Analyst The anticipated closure of the business combination and the commencement of trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market represent pivotal financial milestones for Brand Engagement Network. The ability to trade on a major exchange often comes with a reevaluation of the company's market capitalization and provides an opportunity for institutional investors to take positions in the company.Investors will be closely watching the initial trading days to gauge market sentiment and the valuation multiples applied to BEN in comparison to its peers. The financials of the merged entity will be scrutinized for synergies realized from the business combination, cost structures and revenue projections. The performance of the stock and warrants post-listing will also serve as an indicator of investor expectations regarding future growth and profitability.Additionally, the public listing could enable BEN to leverage stock-based compensation plans to attract and retain talent, which is a critical factor for success in the technology sector. However, it is crucial to consider the potential dilution effects that could arise from the conversion of warrants and any future equity offerings. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the completion of a business combination with a SPAC involves a series of regulatory compliance checks, including the approval by shareholders and adherence to securities laws. The fact that the transaction was approved at an extraordinary general meeting suggests that all legal prerequisites have been met satisfactorily, paving the way for a smooth transition to a publicly traded company.It is also noteworthy that publicly traded warrants are being offered alongside common stock. Warrants provide investors with the right to purchase additional stock at a predetermined price, which can be a strategic tool for the company to raise additional capital in the future. However, the terms of these warrants, including exercise price and expiration date, will be important details for investors to consider, as they can significantly impact the potential return on investment.Going forward, as a public company, BEN will be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny, including the requirement to file periodic financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which demands transparency and could affect the company's operational flexibility. 03/13/2024 - 05:34 PM JACKSON, Wyo. & SOUTHLAKE, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Brand Engagement Network Inc.

Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary American Lithium Corp. receives a notice of non-compliance from Nasdaq due to the minimum bid price requirement. The company has 180 days to regain compliance. The engagement with New Era Publishing Inc. has concluded, and the company has no current intention to engage them further. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The notice received by American Lithium Corp from Nasdaq regarding non-compliance with the minimum bid price requirement could have a tangible effect on investor sentiment and the company's ability to raise capital. Typically, a stock trading below the $1 threshold is seen as a 'penny stock' and may be perceived as more speculative or risky by investors. This perception can lead to increased volatility and possibly a reduced investor base, as some institutional investors have policies against investing in such stocks. The potential for delisting, if compliance is not regained, would further affect liquidity and the ability to attract new investors.However, the company's proactive stance on considering strategies to regain compliance indicates a management focus on maintaining its Nasdaq listing status. This could involve measures such as a reverse stock split or improving operational performance to bolster stock price. The company's focus on advancing its TLC and Falchani lithium projects, which are in pre-feasibility stage, suggests an underlying value that may support its efforts to meet Nasdaq's requirements. Market Research Analyst The strategic importance of lithium as a resource for the energy sector, particularly in the context of the shift towards electric vehicles and renewable energy storage, positions American Lithium Corp in a potentially high-growth industry. The company's TLC lithium project in Nevada and its development-stage projects in Peru are situated within mining-friendly jurisdictions, which is a positive factor for future project development and ease of doing business. Furthermore, the strong community support and significant expansion potential of these projects could contribute to long-term value creation.However, the market's reaction to the non-compliance notice and the company's marketing missteps with New Era Publishing could reflect on the company's governance and operational execution. The TSX Venture Exchange's rejection of the New Era engagement due to non-compliance with exchange policy could raise concerns about management oversight and adherence to regulatory requirements, potentially influencing investor confidence. Legal Expert From a legal perspective, American Lithium Corp's situation highlights the importance of adhering to stringent listing requirements set forth by stock exchanges like Nasdaq. The compliance with the minimum bid price is a regulatory mechanism to ensure that the market maintains certain standards for listed companies. Non-compliance notices serve as a warning mechanism, allowing companies time to rectify their standing and signaling to the market that regulatory oversight is in effect.The company's prior engagement with New Era Publishing and the subsequent publication of marketing materials by Raging Bull without the company's knowledge, may raise questions regarding due diligence and internal controls. It is essential for listed companies to maintain transparency and adhere to exchange policies, as failure to do so can result in reputational damage and legal scrutiny. The requirement for prior approval by the TSX Venture Exchange for future engagements is indicative of the stringent oversight necessary to maintain market integrity. 03/13/2024 - 05:30 PM VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- American Lithium Corp. (“American Lithium” or the “Company”) (TSX-V:LI | Nasdaq:AMLI | Frankfurt:5LA1) has received written notification (the “Notice”) from the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) on March 8, 2024, indicating that the Company is not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of US$1.00 per share under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) based upon the closing bid price of the Company’s common shares for the thirty consecutive business days from January 25, 2024 to March 7, 2024. The Notice has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company’s common shares on Nasdaq, and the Company’s operations are not affected by the receipt of the Notice. Under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has been provided 180 calendar days from the date of the Notice, or until September 4, 2024, to regain compliance with the minimum bid requirement, during which time the Company’s common shares will continue to trade on Nasdaq. To regain compliance the Company’s common shares must have a closing bid price of at least US$1.00 for a minimum of ten consecutive business days. If the Company does not regain compliance with the minimum bid requirement by September 4, 2024, the Company may be eligible, upon satisfaction of certain Nasdaq listing requirements, for an additional period of 180 calendar days to regain compliance. The Company will closely monitor the situation and is considering various strategies to regain compliance with the minimum bid requirement under Nasdaq's listing rules. The Notice does not have any impact on the listing of the Company's common shares on the TSX Venture Exchange. New Era Publishing Inc. The Company also confirms that its previous engagement of New Era Publishing Inc. (“New Era”) to provide marketing services to the Company, as announced by the Company on May 8, 2023, was concluded on August 31, 2023 and no further services have been provided since that date. During the course of the engagement, New Era coordinated with Raging Bull LLC (“Raging Bull”) to publish certain marketing materials pertaining to the Company without the prior knowledge of the Company. The Company has no current engagement with New Era, nor does it presently have any intention to engage New Era to provide further services to the Company. The TSX Venture Exchange has not accepted the previous engagement of New Era, as it did not comply with Exchange policy, and prior approval of the TSX Venture Exchange will be required in the event of any future engagement involving New Era, Raging Bull, its principals, and any other service providers that provide activities under TSX Venture Exchange Policy 3.4.

Cautionary Note Regarding 32 Concessions Thirty-two of the one-hundred-seventy-four concessions comprising the Falchani and Macusani Projects are currently subject to Administrative and Judicial processes in Peru to overturn resolutions issued by INGEMMET and the Mining Council of MINEM in February 2019 and July 2019, respectively, which declared title to thirty-two concessions invalid due to late receipt of the annual validity payments. On November 2, 2021, American Lithium was awarded a favorable ruling in regard to title to the concessions, but on November 26, 2021, appeals of the judicial ruling were lodged by INGEMMET and MINEM. A three-judge tribunal of Peru’s Superior Court unanimously upheld the ruling in a decision reported in November 2023. American Lithium was subsequently notified that INGEMMET and MINEM have filed petitions to the Supreme Court of Peru to assume jurisdiction in the proceedings. Given the precedent of the original ruling it is hoped that the Supreme Court will not assume jurisdiction; however, there is no assurance of the outcome at this time.

(NYSE: HUM) completes a $2.25 billion senior notes offering, consisting of 5.375 percent senior notes due 2031 and 5.750 percent senior notes due 2054. The net proceeds are expected to be around $2.226 billion for general corporate purposes, including debt repayment. The offering was managed by Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, PNC Capital Markets, and Wells Fargo Securities. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The completion of Humana Inc.'s public offering of $2.25 billion in senior notes is a significant financial event that warrants a detailed analysis from a financial perspective. The issuance of these notes, with a substantial aggregate principal amount and varying maturities, indicates the company's strategic approach to capital management. The interest rates of 5.375 percent and 5.750 percent for the 2031 and 2054 maturities, respectively, reflect the current cost of borrowing for corporations and are likely influenced by prevailing market conditions as well as the company's creditworthiness.Investors and stakeholders should note the intended use of proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of existing debt. This could potentially lead to an improved debt profile and credit ratings over time. However, the impact on the company's leverage and interest coverage ratios needs to be monitored. The involvement of high-profile financial institutions as joint book-running managers suggests a strong market interest and confidence in the offering. Overall, the capital raised could provide Humana with the financial flexibility to pursue strategic initiatives and manage liquidity needs. Debt Market Analyst From a debt market perspective, the issuance of senior notes by Humana Inc. is indicative of the company's leverage strategy and investor appetite for corporate bonds. The pricing of the notes at just below par suggests a balanced demand relative to the offered interest rates, which are competitive given the current interest rate environment. The long-term nature of the notes, with maturities extending to 2054, provides insight into investor confidence in the company's long-term stability and growth prospects.It is also important to consider the yield spread between these notes and comparable government securities, as this will affect the attractiveness of the notes to fixed-income investors. The spread reflects the market's perception of the risk associated with Humana's debt. Additionally, the use of proceeds to potentially repay existing indebtedness can be a prudent move to manage the company's cost of capital, especially if it targets high-cost debt. However, investors should be aware of the refinancing risk associated with such a large issuance, particularly in an environment where interest rates may rise. Corporate Strategist Examining the broader strategic implications of Humana Inc.'s senior notes offering, it is evident that the company is proactively managing its capital structure. The decision to issue long-term debt provides Humana with the opportunity to lock in current interest rates, which could be advantageous if rates increase in the future. The flexibility gained from this capital infusion could support acquisitions, investments in technology and expansion into new markets, which are critical for maintaining competitive advantage in the healthcare industry.Moreover, the allocation of funds for general corporate purposes, including the potential repayment of short-term borrowings, suggests a strategic move to optimize the company's balance sheet. Such financial prudence can enhance investor confidence and potentially lead to a more favorable perception of the company's stock. The strategic use of these funds will be closely watched by investors as it could have significant implications for Humana's growth trajectory and market positioning. 03/13/2024 - 05:15 PM LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Humana Inc. (the “company”) (NYSE: HUM) announced today the completion of its public offering of $2.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes. These senior notes are comprised of $1.25 billion of the company’s 5.375 percent senior notes, due 2031, at 99.940 percent of the principal amount, and $1.00 billion of the company’s 5.750 percent senior notes, due 2054, at 99.949 percent of the principal amount (collectively, the “Senior Notes Offerings”). The company expects net proceeds from the Senior Notes Offerings will be approximately $2.226 billion after deducting underwriters’ discounts and estimated offering expenses. The company intends to use the net proceeds from the Senior Notes Offerings for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of existing indebtedness, including borrowings under its commercial paper program. Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, PNC Capital Markets LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC acted as active joint book-running managers for the Senior Notes Offerings. The Senior Notes Offerings were made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement (including a base prospectus) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The Senior Notes Offerings were made by means of a prospectus and related prospectus supplement, copies of which may be obtained by calling Citigroup Global Markets Inc. toll-free at (800) 831-9146, Goldman Sachs & Co.

This news release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the securities described herein, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. Cautionary Statement This news release includes forward-looking statements regarding Humana within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in investor presentations, press releases, SEC filings, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of Humana’s executive officers, the words or phrases like “expects,” “believes,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “likely will result,” “estimates,” “projects” or variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including, among other things, information set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of the company’s SEC filings, a summary of which includes but is not limited to the following: If Humana does not design and price its products properly and competitively, if the premiums Humana receives are insufficient to cover the cost of healthcare services delivered to its members, if the company is unable to implement clinical initiatives to provide a better healthcare experience for its members, lower costs and appropriately document the risk profile of its members, or if its estimates of benefits expense are inadequate, Humana’s profitability could be materially adversely affected. Humana estimates the costs of its benefit expense payments, and designs and prices its products accordingly, using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon, among other relevant factors, claim payment patterns, medical cost inflation, and historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns. The company continually reviews estimates of future payments relating to benefit expenses for services incurred in the current and prior periods and makes necessary adjustments to its reserves, including premium deficiency reserves, where appropriate. These estimates involve extensive judgment, and have considerable inherent variability because they are extremely sensitive to changes in claim payment patterns and medical cost trends. Accordingly, Humana’s reserves may be insufficient. If Humana fails to effectively implement its operational and strategic initiatives, including its Medicare initiatives, which are of particular importance given the concentration of the company's revenues in these products, state-based contract strategy, the growth of its CenterWell business, and its integrated care delivery model, the company’s business may be materially adversely affected. In addition, there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in maintaining or improving its Star ratings in future years. If Humana, or the third-party service providers on which it relies, fails to properly maintain the integrity of its data, to strategically maintain existing or implement new information systems, to protect Humana’s proprietary rights to its systems, or to defend against cybersecurity attacks, contain such attacks when they occur, or prevent other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches that disrupt the company’s operations or in the unintentional dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information, the company’s business may be materially adversely affected. Humana is involved in various legal actions, or disputes that could lead to legal actions (such as, among other things, provider contract disputes and qui tam litigation brought by individuals on behalf of the government), governmental and internal investigations, and routine internal review of business processes any of which, if resolved unfavorably to the company, could result in substantial monetary damages or changes in its business practices. Increased litigation and negative publicity could also increase the company’s cost of doing business. As a government contractor, Humana is exposed to risks that may materially adversely affect its business or its willingness or ability to participate in government healthcare programs including, among other things, loss of material government contracts; governmental audits and investigations; potential inadequacy of government determined payment rates; potential restrictions on profitability, including by comparison of profitability of the company’s Medicare Advantage business to non-Medicare Advantage business; or other changes in the governmental programs in which Humana participates. Changes to the risk adjustment model utilized by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) to adjust premiums paid to Medicare Advantage plans or retrospective recovery by CMS of previously paid premiums as a result of the final rule related to the risk adjustment data validation audit methodology published by CMS on January 30, 2023 (Final RADV Rule), which Humana believes fails to address adequately the statutory requirement of actuarial equivalence and violates the Administrative Procedure Act due to its failure to include a “Fee for Service Adjuster”, could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operating results, financial position and cash flows. Humana’s business activities are subject to substantial government regulation. New laws or regulations, or legislative, judicial, or regulatory changes in existing laws or regulations or their manner of application could increase the company's cost of doing business and have a material adverse effect on Humana’s results of operations (including restricting revenue, enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments, restricting the company’s ability to expand into new markets, increasing the company’s medical and operating costs by, among other things, requiring a minimum benefit ratio on insured products, lowering the company’s Medicare payment rates and increasing the company’s expenses associated with a non-deductible health insurance industry fee and other assessments); the company’s financial position (including the company’s ability to maintain the value of its goodwill); and the company’s cash flows. Humana’s failure to manage acquisitions, divestitures and other significant transactions successfully may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. If Humana fails to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to its members, the company’s business may be adversely affected. Humana faces significant competition in attracting and retaining talented employees. Further, managing succession for, and retention of, key executives is critical to the company’s success, and its failure to do so could adversely affect the company’s businesses, operating results and/or future performance. Humana’s pharmacy business is highly competitive and subjects it to regulations and supply chain risks in addition to those the company faces with its core health benefits businesses. Changes in the prescription drug industry pricing benchmarks may adversely affect Humana’s financial performance.

(NYSE: BBW) introduces a new quarterly dividend program with an initial cash dividend of $0.20 per share. The dividend will be paid on April 11, 2024, to stockholders of record as of March 28, 2024. The company plans to pay dividends quarterly, reflecting confidence in future prospects. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The initiation of a quarterly dividend by Build-A-Bear Workshop, Inc. signifies a pivotal shift in the company's capital allocation strategy. Such a move is often interpreted by the market as a signal of matured and stable cash flows, indicating that the company has reached a point where it can predictably generate excess capital. This decision to return capital to shareholders in the form of dividends is a testament to the company's financial health and management's confidence in its ongoing operations and future prospects.From a valuation standpoint, the announcement of a $0.20 per share dividend can have implications for the company's stock price. Dividend Discount Models, which are used to estimate the value of a company based on its future dividends, will now incorporate this new information, potentially affecting the intrinsic value calculations made by investors. Additionally, the dividend yield, calculated as the annual dividends per share divided by the stock price, will become a new factor for income-focused investors when evaluating the attractiveness of Build-A-Bear Workshop's stock. Market Research Analyst Introducing a dividend can have a broader impact on the company's shareholder base. Typically, a dividend-paying company attracts a different investor profile compared to growth-oriented companies that do not pay dividends. Income-seeking investors, such as retirees or conservative investment funds, may now find Build-A-Bear Workshop's shares more appealing. This could lead to a change in the stock's trading dynamics and potentially increase its stability during market volatility. It is essential to monitor how this change affects the company's stock liquidity and volatility in the upcoming quarters.Moreover, the market's reaction to such announcements can serve as a barometer for investor sentiment towards the company's governance and strategic direction. If the dividend is well received, it might suggest that the market approves of the company's capital distribution policy and its ability to sustain such payouts. Conversely, if the market reacts negatively, it could indicate concerns over the sustainability of the dividend or the opportunity cost of not reinvesting the capital back into the business for growth. Corporate Governance Expert The declaration of a quarterly dividend by Build-A-Bear Workshop also sheds light on the company's governance practices. Dividend policy is a direct reflection of the board's strategic priorities and their commitment to shareholder returns. It suggests a balanced approach to capital management, where the company is not solely focused on reinvesting all its earnings back into the business or on aggressive expansion but is also considering shareholder wealth maximization.It is important to assess how this dividend policy aligns with the company's long-term strategic plan. If the dividend payments are well-covered by free cash flow and do not impede the company's ability to invest in future growth opportunities, it can be seen as a positive governance practice. However, if future investments are compromised or debt levels increase to sustain the dividend, it could raise red flags about the sustainability of such a policy. The market will closely observe these factors to gauge the prudence of the board's decision in the context of the company's long-term strategy. 03/13/2024 - 05:15 PM ST. LOUIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Build-A-Bear Workshop, Inc. (NYSE: BBW) announced today that its Board of Directors approved a new quarterly dividend program to evolve its strategic use of capital. The Board of Directors declared an initial quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share. The dividend will be paid on April 11, 2024, to all stockholders of record as of March 28, 2024. The Company intends to pay dividends quarterly in the future, subject to market conditions and approval by the Board of Directors. “We are pleased to be able to provide a direct return to our stockholders with the initiation of a quarterly regular dividend that together with our previously authorized stock repurchase plan shows the continued confidence that the Board has in the company’s future and our commitment to regularly return capital to stockholders. Our strong cash flow and capital structure provide the flexibility for us to return capital to our stockholders through share repurchases and regular dividend payments while maintaining the ability to invest for profitable growth and execute our strategic plan,” said Craig Leavitt, Non-Executive Chairman of the Board.

(OTCQX:TGEN), a leading manufacturer of clean energy products, reported revenues of $5.9 million and a net loss of $1.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 compared to revenues of $4.5 million, and a net loss of $1.4 million in 2022. The increase in net loss was primarily driven by an increase in bad debt reserves for installation projects from 2017 an increase in reserves for obsolete inventory. Our Adjusted EBITDA loss narrowed to $527 thousand for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 compared to $1.1 million in 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2023 revenues were $25.1 million and the net loss was $4.5 million compared to revenues of $25.0 million, and net loss of $2.4 million for the same period in 2022. For the year the Adjusted EBITDA loss was $2.6 million in 2023 and $1.7 million in 2022. ""During the 4th quarter we had positive cash flow from operations and a recovery in gross margin for our Services segment. We continue to execute on our strategy of increasing recurring cash flow from Energy and Services to cover our fixed costs. This will allow us to be cash flow positive while we secure profitable large dollar value projects. Unlike in the past where our sales were predominantly small cogeneration projects for residential buildings in New York City, we are now seeing the market shift to multiple unit chiller and cogeneration projects nationwide. We recently received a 6 unit (3 hybrid chillers and 3 Inverde cogeneration units) as well as a 12 unit cogeneration order. We are now focused on securing additional multiple unit product orders that we expect will result in sustained profitability and growth. In fact, we are specified on large chiller projects for some iconic facilities that are on track to close later this year. We are also receiving significant interest from customers who are limited in electrical capacity or facing sharp increases in peak electricity charges. We expect customer pain point to increase as electrification efforts place higher pressure on the ability of utilities to supply sufficient power. As a result, our proprietary software and utility demand response capabilities will give us a competitive advantage in securing new product orders and increased Services revenue. Although we showed a significant net loss in Q4, this was driven by a $1 million increase in bad debt expense associated with old installation project receivables and obsolete inventory. We also performed much needed work on replacing engines in the Services fleet and site improvement work within our energy fleet. These costs and the obsolete inventory reserve drove down gross profit margins but are an essential investment to improve unit runtime going forward. We have $1 million remaining on our credit line which will help us execute our factory move later this quarter, and our present cash position of $1.1 million,"" commented Abinand Rangesh, Tecogen's Chief Executive Officer.

Adjusted EBITDA(1) was negative $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to negative $1.7 million for the comparable period in 2022. (Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income or loss attributable to Tecogen, adjusted for interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, unrealized gain or loss on equity securities, goodwill impairment charges, inventory writedowns, bad debt provision and other non-cash non-recurring charges or gains including abandonment of intangible assets and the extinguishment of debt. See the table following the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for a reconciliation from net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA, as well as important disclosures about the company's use of Adjusted EBITDA).

The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA allows investors to view its performance in a manner similar to the methods used by management and provides additional insight into its operating results. Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated through the application of GAAP. Accordingly, it should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measure of net income and, therefore, should not be used in isolation of, but in conjunction with, the GAAP measure. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.

The ratings reflect strong balance sheet strength, operating performance, and risk-adjusted capitalization. Aetna Health & Life Group has reported underwriting and net income exceeding $2 billion in each of the past five years. The group's return on revenues exceeds 5% and return on equity exceeds 20%. Aetna's Medicare Advantage and Medicaid managed care markets have experienced significant membership growth. Aetna remains competitive and continues to gain enrollment in other segments. AM Best recognizes the inherent execution risk within the acquisitions of Signify Health Inc. and Oak Street Health Inc. There may be pressure from additional business expansion related to acquisitions in the near term. Negative The financial leverage at CVS Health has increased modestly at year-end 2023. Goodwill-to-shareholders equity exceeded 110% at year-end 2023. There is negative impact from CVS Health's elevated financial leverage and goodwill on Aetna Health & Life Group. The resumption of redeterminations following the end of the public health emergency may lead to declines in Medicaid membership in 2023 and the first half of 2024. Insurance Industry Analyst The affirmation of the Financial Strength Rating (FSR) and Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings (Long-Term ICRs) for Aetna Life Insurance Company (ALIC) and its related entities by AM Best indicates a stable and positive outlook for these companies within the insurance market. The stable outlook suggests that the companies are expected to maintain their financial strength and creditworthiness in the medium term, while the positive outlook on the Long-Term ICRs points to a potential upgrade if the companies continue to demonstrate financial resilience and strong performance.The balance sheet strength, characterized by a 'very strong' assessment, is underpinned by steady capital growth and a conservative investment approach, with a reduction in holdings in riskier asset classes. This prudent financial management is particularly relevant to stakeholders, as it suggests a lower risk of volatility in the companies' financial standing. The strong operating performance, with underwriting and net income exceeding $2 billion in the past five years, reflects efficient business operations and effective cost management, which are essential for long-term profitability and competitiveness.The moderate reinsurance leverage and the unique reinsurance arrangements differentiate Aetna from its peers and may provide a strategic advantage in managing underwriting risk. The lack of debt held by Aetna Life & Health Group is a positive indicator of financial stability and reduces financial risk for the company. Healthcare Market Analyst The growth in membership across commercial, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid managed care product lines has been a key driver of premium growth for Aetna Health & Life Group. The expected continuation of growth in commercial and Medicare Advantage segments aligns with the broader trend in the healthcare industry towards managed care and value-based arrangements, which have been gaining traction due to their potential to improve care quality and cost-efficiency.However, the projected decline in Medicaid membership due to the resumption of redeterminations post-public health emergency could impact premium revenues. This anticipated change underscores the importance of market adaptability and the need for healthcare insurers to navigate regulatory environments effectively. Furthermore, the acquisitions of Signify Health Inc. and Oak Street Health Inc. by CVS Health, Aetna's parent company, reflect a strategic expansion into home health care and value-based primary care, which are growing segments in the healthcare market. These acquisitions, while offering potential growth opportunities, also carry execution risks that must be managed to ensure they contribute positively to the company's overall performance. Financial Risk Analyst The elevated financial leverage and goodwill of CVS Health, Aetna's ultimate parent, present potential risks that could impact the financial stability of the group. While the financial leverage has decreased since the acquisition of Aetna, the recent modest increase due to further acquisitions is a point of attention for stakeholders. The high goodwill-to-shareholders equity ratio, exceeding 110% at year-end 2023, indicates a significant amount of intangible assets, which can be a concern if not managed properly. Goodwill impairment could lead to volatility in earnings and affect investor confidence.The positive outlook on Aetna's Long-Term ICRs, however, suggests that AM Best anticipates the group's risk-adjusted capitalization will remain at the strongest level, which may mitigate some of the concerns related to financial leverage and goodwill. Stakeholders should monitor the integration of the new acquisitions and the management's ability to realize synergies and maintain strong capitalization levels. 03/13/2024 - 05:03 PM OLDWICK, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AM Best has affirmed the Financial Strength Rating (FSR) of A (Excellent) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings (Long-Term ICRs) of “a” (Excellent) of Aetna Life Insurance Company (ALIC) (Hartford, CT) and the other members of Aetna Health & Life Group, which are operating entities of Aetna Inc. (Aetna) and wholly owned subsidiaries of CVS Health Corporation (CVS Health) [NYSE: CVS]. The outlook of the FSR is stable, while the outlook of the Long-Term ICR is positive. (Please see below for a detailed listing of the companies.) Concurrently, AM Best has affirmed the FSR of A (Excellent) and the Long-Term ICR of “a” (Excellent) of Allina Health and Aetna Insurance Company (Allina Health) (St. Louis Park, MN). Allina Health is a joint venture with subsidiaries of Aetna Inc. The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable. In addition, AM Best has affirmed the FSR of A (Excellent) and the Long-Term ICRs of “a” (Excellent) of Texas Health + Aetna Health Insurance Company, as well as Texas Health + Aetna Health Plan Inc. Both companies are domiciled in Arlington, TX, and collectively are referred to as Texas Health Aetna. The outlook of these ratings is stable. At the same time, AM Best has withdrawn the ratings of Texas Health Aetna as the companies have requested to no longer participate in AM Best’s interactive rating process. The ratings of Aetna Health & Life Group reflect its balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its strong operating performance, favorable business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management (ERM). The positive outlook on the Long-Term ICR for Aetna Health & Life Group reflects the group’s risk-adjusted capitalization, which remains at the strongest level, as measured by its Best Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR). Capital and surplus has grown steadily despite large annual dividend payments in each of the past five years. The growth in absolute capital is reflected in the group's five-year compound annual growth rate of 7.6%. The risk profile of the investment portfolio has improved over time, as there has been a reduction in the holdings in several asset classes over the past few years, including commercial mortgages and equities, as well as the allocation to Class 2 and below investment grade bonds. Additionally, the balance sheet strength is supported by adequate liquidity measures, which are strengthened by access to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston at the lead entity, ALIC. Aetna Life & Health Group has moderate reinsurance leverage and its reinsurance arrangements differentiates Aetna from its health insurance peers. In addition to traditional reinsurance with highly rated carriers, Aetna Health & Life Group maintains a quota share reinsurance agreement with Health Re Inc. and subsequent excess of loss protection by Vitality Re entities. Furthermore, the group exhibits good quality of capital and currently does not hold any debt. Over the past few years, favorable development in net premium has been driven by membership growth in the commercial, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid managed care product lines. While premium growth is expected to continue for commercial and Medicare Advantage over the near term, it will be offset partially by declines in Medicaid membership in 2023 and the first half of 2024 due to the resumption of redeterminations following the end of the public health emergency. Premium growth has impacted operating earnings trends positively over the past few years. Aetna Health & Life Group has reported underwriting and net income exceeding $2 billion in each of the past five years with return on revenues at or exceeding 5% and return on equity exceeding 20%. The group reported an increase in underwriting income through year-end 2022; however, it noted an increase in claims driven by increased utilization in its Medicare Advantage segment, a trend that began in 2023, and is expected to continue into 2024. Moreover, investment income has been steady over the past five years and is expected to improve in 2023 and 2024 due to the interest rate environment. Investment income has meaningfully contributed to net earnings. Aetna is one of the leading players in the managed care markets offering products throughout the United States. While Aetna’s Medicare Advantage and Medicaid managed care markets have experienced significant membership growth over the past few years, Aetna remains competitive and continues to gain enrollment in other segments. The ratings of Aetna Health & Life Group reflect the negative impact from its ultimate parent, CVS Health, which has elevated financial leverage and goodwill that is not expected to change materially in the near to medium term. While the financial leverage at CVS Health has declined substantially since the acquisition of Aetna, financial leverage increased modestly at year-end 2023, driven by the acquisitions of Signify Health Inc. and Oak Street Health Inc. Signify Health adds in-home health care to the CVS Health organization, while Oak Street Health is a leading multi-payer, value-based primary care company. Goodwill-to-shareholders equity increased over the prior year and exceeded 110% at year-end 2023. While the acquisitions of Oak Street and Signify Health are part of the organization’s health care services strategy, AM Best recognizes the inherent execution risk within these transactions. Over the near term, there may be pressure from additional business expansion related to acquisitions. The ratings of Allina Health reflect its balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as adequate, as well as its marginal operating performance, limited business profile and appropriate ERM. In 2022, Allina Health marked its first year of underwriting gains since inception. However, the company continues to report net losses as underwriting gains were not sufficient to offset the amortization of intangible assets. In recent years, premium growth has trended favorably in Medicare Advantage products, while commercial products have increased modestly. The ratings of Texas Health Aetna reflect its balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as strong, as well as its adequate operating performance, limited business profile and appropriate ERM.

Positive Successful closure of the MacKellar Group acquisition. Record combined revenue of $403.4 million for the fourth quarter.

Net debt increased to $720.9 million at December 31, 2023, from debt-funded acquisitions and spending. General and administrative expenses increased due to one-time costs related to the MacKellar acquisition. Financial Analyst The acquisition of the MacKellar Group by North American Construction Group Ltd. (NACG) represents a significant strategic move, indicating a strong push towards geographical diversification and increased market presence in Australia. The acquisition, valued at $369.7 million net of cash acquired, coupled with growth capital spending of $35.9 million, is noteworthy as it was fully funded through senior and vendor-provided debt. This financing approach may raise concerns regarding the company's leverage and its ability to service this debt, especially given the increase in net debt to $720.9 million at year-end 2023.The reported record revenues of $403.4 million for the quarter, which include three months of operations from MacKellar, suggest that the acquisition is already contributing significantly to the top line. However, investors should be cautious about the impact of integration costs and the sustainability of MacKellar's gross profit margin of 23.7% in the quarter. The reported increase in general and administrative expenses, including one-time acquisition costs and the uptick in interest expense due to higher debt levels are factors that could affect net income in the short term.It is also important to consider the company's liquidity position, which appears robust with total available capital liquidity of $292.6 million. This liquidity, together with the strong free cash flow of $110.6 million for the quarter, may provide some reassurance to investors regarding the company's financial health and its ability to manage its increased debt load. The forward-looking statements projecting key measures for 2024, including a significant rise in adjusted EBITDA to $430 - $470 million, suggest management's confidence in the company's growth trajectory. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, NACG's aggressive expansion into the Australian market through the MacKellar acquisition could be seen as a strategic move to capitalize on the region's construction and mining sectors. This diversification could protect the company against regional downturns in North America and provide access to new revenue streams. However, the success of this expansion will depend on NACG's ability to integrate MacKellar's operations seamlessly and realize the anticipated synergies.Investors should also note the company's focus on operational excellence and the restructuring initiative within the Nuna Group of Companies, which is expected to enhance project execution and potentially improve margins. The emphasis on safety, execution and operational excellence are positive indicators of the company's commitment to sustainable growth. Moreover, the strategic focus on diversification and sustainability aligns with broader industry trends, which could enhance the company's competitive position and appeal to socially conscious investors.Given the cyclical nature of the construction and mining industries, the company's performance will be influenced by commodity prices, economic conditions and competition. As such, while the current outlook appears positive, investors should monitor these external factors closely as they can significantly impact the company's financial performance. Legal Expert It is crucial to examine the implications of NACG's financial strategy from a legal and regulatory standpoint. The financing of the MacKellar acquisition through debt raises questions about compliance with debt covenants and the company's long-term financial stability. Investors should be aware of the terms of the credit facility agreement and any potential risks associated with the company's increased leverage. The change in presentation of finance lease obligations within the consolidated balance sheets, now included in long-term debt, should also be scrutinized to ensure transparency and adherence to US GAAP principles.Furthermore, with the upcoming adoption of new FASB standards, such as ASU 2023-05 and ASU 2023-07, NACG will need to assess and potentially adjust its accounting practices. This could lead to changes in how joint venture formations and segment reporting are handled in the future, impacting the presentation of financial statements and the disclosures provided to investors. 03/13/2024 - 05:05 PM ACHESON, Alberta, March 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- North American Construction Group Ltd. (""NACG"") (TSX:NOA/NYSE:NOA) today announced results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. Unless otherwise indicated, figures are expressed in Canadian dollars with comparisons to prior periods ended December 31, 2022. Fourth Quarter 2023 Highlights: Closure of the MacKellar Group (""MacKellar"") acquisition on October 1, 2023, a seamless change in control, and three months of strong equipment utilization provided a full quarter of operating results in Australia, and a step change in geographic diversification.The allocated purchase price of MacKellar was $369.7 million, net of cash acquired, along with growth capital spending of $35.9 million incurred in the quarter was fully funded with senior and vendor-provided debt and establishes a strong platform for opportunities in Australia.Combined revenue of $403.4 million is a company quarterly record based on the transformative acquisition of MacKellar. Revenue of $326.3 million, compared to $233.4 million in the same period last year, includes this step-change increase along with steady and consistent operations in the Fort McMurray region.Our net share of revenue from equity consolidated joint ventures was $77.1 million, compared to $86.7 million in the same period last year. Quarter-over-quarter increases at the Fargo-Moorhead project were offset by the successful 2023 Q3 completion of the construction project at the gold mine in Northern Ontario.Adjusted EBITDA of $101.1 million, also a company record, and EBITDA margin of 25.1% compared to the prior period metrics of $85.9 million and 26.8%, respectively. Margins were impacted by project losses posted by the Nuna Group of Companies; restructuring efforts are well underway to resolve temporary challenges.Cash flows generated from operating activities of $160.9 million in the quarter, compared to $78.1 million in the prior year quarter, resulting from higher earnings and changes in working capital balances when comparing to the same period in the prior year.Free cash flow (""FCF"") of $110.6 million in the quarter was the result of strong revenues, steady and consistent margins, modest capital spending, and positive changes in working capital balances.Net debt was $720.9 million at December 31, 2023, an increase of $325.6 million from September 30, 2023, resulting from the debt-funded purchase price and growth spending in Australia offset by free cash flow directed to debt reduction during the quarter. NACG President and CEO, Joseph Lambert, commented: ""The acquisition of the MacKellar Group is a milestone moment for our company and I'd like to thank all the employees for the hard work that has been put in to make these first few months in Australia such a success. In both Queensland and Western Australia, we are excited by the many prospects we have in front of us and look forward to sharing best practices and in-house maintenance expertise, as well as equipment where appropriate, to facilitate these growth opportunities. As we've geographically diversified, I continue to closely monitor our various regions. In North Dakota and based on a recent trip there, construction at Fargo-Moorhead is progressing well into this most important period for the project. In northern Canada, we are undergoing a restructuring initiative within the Nuna Group of Companies which will return it to its legacy of operational excellence. In Fort McMurray, our fleet continues to operate day-in day-out as we work with our customers in their goal to achieve low-cost operations in the oil sands region. 2024 will be a busy year for us and we are looking forward to executing and delivering another record year.""

Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 Combined revenue of $403.4 million, compared to $320.1 million in the same period last year, and revenue from wholly-owned entities was $326.3 million, up from $233.4 million in the same period last year. The majority of the quarter-over-quarter increase in revenue was driven by the October 2023 acquisition of MacKellar. MacKellar generated a full quarter of revenue totaling $122.5 million. Aside from MacKellar, revenue was down over the same period in 2022 as a result of changes in timing of reclamation projects beginning later than the previous year and certain construction scopes concluding earlier in 2023, relative to the same period in 2022. Combined gross profit margin of 18.4% was up from 17.8% in the prior year. The improvement in combined gross profit in the current period was driven by the acquisition of MacKellar. MacKellar generated gross profit of 23.7% in the quarter. General and administrative expenses (excluding stock-based compensation expense) were $18.7 million, or 5.7% of revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2023, up from $6.6 million, or 2.8% of revenue in the same period last year. General and administrative expenses in the quarter include one-time costs of $5.9 million related to the acquisition of MacKellar. MacKellar's administrative cost profile is similar to the Canadian and U.S. operations. Cash related interest expense of $13.2 million represents an average cost of debt of 8.8% (compared to $7.5 million and 7.1%, respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2022). The increase in interest expense is primarily attributed to the higher balance on the Credit Facility and increases in the variable rate. Net income of $17.6 million in Q4 2023 compared to $26.1 million in the same period last year as higher gross profit was more than offset by increased interest expense, increased general and administrative expenses from the one-time acquisition costs, and lower equity earnings from our joint ventures. Free cash flow in the quarter was $110.6 million driven primarily by adjusted EBITDA of $101.1 million less sustaining capital spending of $40.8 million and cash interest paid of $13.2 million. Liquidity Including equipment financing availability and factoring in the amended Credit Facility agreement, total available capital liquidity of $292.6 million includes total liquidity of $217.9 million, $60.1 million of unused finance lease borrowing availability, and $14.6 million of unused other borrowing availability as at December 31, 2023. Liquidity is primarily provided by the terms of our $478.0 million credit facility which allows for funds availability based on a trailing twelve-month EBITDA as defined in the agreement, and is now scheduled to expire in October 2026. Business Updates Strategic Focus Areas for 2024 Safety - now on a global basis, maintain our uncompromising commitment to health and safety while elevating the standard of excellence in the field;Execution - enhance equipment availability in Canada and Australia through in-house fleet maintenance, reliability programs, technical improvements, and management systems;Operational excellence - with a specific focus on Nuna Group of Companies, put into action practical and experienced-based protocols to ensure predictable high-quality project execution;Integration - implement ERP and best practices at MacKellar, including identification of opportunities to better utilize our capital and equipment in Australia;Diversification - pursue diversification of customers and resources through strategic partnerships, industry expertise and investment in Indigenous joint ventures; andSustainability - further develop and deliver into our environmental, social, and governance targets as disclosed and committed to in our annual reporting.

Unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts discussed are in Canadian dollars.

Change in significant accounting policy - Basis of presentation During the first quarter of 2023, the Company updated the presentation of finance lease obligations within the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in long-term debt. Within the long-term debt note, finance lease obligations, financing obligations, and promissory notes have been combined as equipment financing. Finance lease obligations are the finance lease liabilities recognized in accordance with the Company's lease policy which is disclosed in our Annual Report. Financing obligations arise when the Company finances its owned equipment. There has been no change in the Company’s accounting policy for finance lease obligations or change in the recognition or measurement of the related balances now recognized within long-term debt. The change in presentation had no effect on the reported results of operations. The comparative period has been updated to reflect this presentation change.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release presents certain non-GAAP financial measures, non-GAAP ratios, and supplementary financial measures that may be useful to investors in analyzing our business performance, leverage, and liquidity. A non-GAAP financial measure is defined by relevant regulatory authorities as a numerical measure of an issuer's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flow that is not specified, defined or determined under the issuer’s GAAP and that is not presented in an issuer’s financial statements. A ""non-GAAP ratio"" is a ratio, fraction, percentage or similar expression that has a non-GAAP financial measure as one or more of its components. Non-GAAP financial measures and ratios do not have standardized meanings under GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.

(NYSE: RFL) reports financial results for Q2 fiscal 2024, showing a net income of $5.9 million and increased ownership in Day Three Labs to 79%. The company aims to enhance shareholder value through strategic investments and portfolio advancement, welcoming Dr. John Goldberg as Chief Medical Officer. Notable progress in Cyclo Therapeutics' Phase 3 trial for Niemann-Pick Disease Type C and Day Three Labs' innovative cannabis products development. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results by Rafael Holdings, Inc. for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 indicate a significant turnaround in performance, with net income from continuing operations of $5.9 million, compared to a net loss in the previous year. This shift is primarily attributed to an unrealized gain of $9.7 million from investments in Cyclo Therapeutics. The strategic decision to increase ownership in Day Three Labs to a majority interest aligns with the company's commitment to expand its portfolio and leverage its financial position.However, it is noteworthy that the company recorded a loss of $1.6 million on its initial investment in Day Three Labs. This highlights the inherent risks associated with strategic investments, especially in industries such as cannabis, which are subject to regulatory and market volatility. The reduction in research and development expenses suggests a strategic pivot or streamlining of operations, possibly indicating a focus on fewer, more promising projects or a reallocation of resources towards the newly consolidated Day Three Labs. Market Research Analyst The pharmaceutical and biotech sectors are highly competitive and subject to rapid change. Rafael Holdings' investment in Cyclo Therapeutics, particularly during its Phase 3 clinical trial for Niemann-Pick Disease Type C, suggests confidence in the potential market success of the therapy. The disease, being rare, may benefit from orphan drug status, potentially offering market exclusivity and pricing advantages. The company's increased stake in Day Three Labs, which focuses on enhancing cannabis products with pharmaceutical-grade technology, indicates an attempt to diversify and tap into the burgeoning cannabis market.Investors should consider the long-term growth potential of these strategic moves, while also acknowledging the challenges of integrating new acquisitions and the time required for clinical trials to potentially translate into marketable products. The increased general and administrative expenses, primarily due to non-cash stock-based compensation and professional fees, reflect the costs associated with these strategic endeavors and the company's expansion. Biotech Investment Analyst The financial performance of Rafael Holdings is closely tied to the success of its strategic investments, particularly in the biotech sector. The unrealized gains from Cyclo Therapeutics underscore the volatility and potential for high returns in biotech investments. The pivot towards a majority ownership in Day Three Labs represents a diversification strategy, potentially spreading risk across different segments of the healthcare and biotechnology market.While the reduction in R&D expenses might raise questions about the company's long-term innovation pipeline, it could also signal a strategic focus on bringing current assets to market. The consolidation of Day Three Labs' financial results may impact the company's balance sheet and income statement in the future, depending on the subsidiary's performance. As the cannabis market is still in a nascent and evolving regulatory environment, this investment might carry a higher risk profile, which stakeholders should monitor closely. 03/13/2024 - 05:04 PM Company remains focused on generating shareholder value by advancing portfolio and identifying attractive opportunities for strategic investments Increased ownership in Day Three Labs to a majority interest of 79% NEWARK, N.J., March 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rafael Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: RFL), today reported its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 – and the six months ended January 31, 2024. “During fiscal 2024, we will continue to focus on advancing our existing portfolio and intend to leverage our strong balance sheet with selective strategic investments in companies with the potential to generate value for our stockholders. We are extremely pleased to welcome Dr. John Goldberg to the Rafael team as our Chief Medical Officer. John is a highly respected senior executive with nearly two decades of experience in drug development. John will be an integral member of our team, as we advance our existing assets and evaluate additional opportunities for investment,” said Bill Conkling, CEO of Rafael Holdings. Bill added, “We are encouraged by the positive developments for Cyclo Therapeutics’ (Nasdaq: CYTH) Phase 3 registrational clinical trial for patients with Niemann-Pick Disease Type C and in the increasing momentum behind Day Three Labs, which reimagines existing cannabis offerings with pharmaceutical-grade technology to bring to market better, cleaner, more precise and predictable products.” Rafael Holdings, Inc. Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results As of January 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $71.7 million. For the three months ended January 31, 2024, we recorded net income from continuing operations of $5.9 million, or $0.25 per fully diluted share versus a net loss from continuing operations of $3.3 million, or $0.13 per share in the year ago period. The net income reported during the second quarter was driven by an unrealized gain of $9.7 million on our investments in Cyclo Therapeutics, offset by a loss of $1.6 million on our initial investment in Day Three Labs. During the second quarter of 2024, we increased our investment in Day Three Labs and now hold a majority interest in the company with 79% of the shares outstanding and began consolidating its financial results in the second quarter of 2024. For the three months ended January 31, 2024, research and development expenses were $0.6 million compared to $2.2 million in the year ago period. The year over year reduction is due to the, previously disclosed, winding down of early-stage programs, including at Barer Institute. For the three months ended January 31, 2024, general and administrative expenses from continuing operations were $2.6 million. For the same period in the prior year, general and administrative expenses were $2.1 million. The increase was primarily related to increases in non-cash stock-based compensation expenses and professional fees. Rafael Holdings, Inc. First Half Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results For the six months ended January 31, 2024, we recorded net income from continuing operations of $2.1 million, or $0.10 per fully diluted share versus a net loss from continuing operations of $8.5 million, or $0.36 per share in the year ago period. The net income recorded during the first half of fiscal 2024 was driven by an unrealized gain of $7.6 million on our investments in Cyclo Therapeutics, offset by a loss of $1.6 million on our initial investment in Day Three Labs. During the second quarter of 2024, we increased our investment in Day Three Labs and now hold a majority interest in the company with 79% of the shares outstanding and we began reporting consolidated its financial results in January 2024. For the six months ended January 31, 2024, research and development expenses were $1.1 million compared to $4.3 million in the year ago period. The year over year reduction is due to the winding down of early-stage programs, including at Barer Institute. For the six months ended January 31, 2024, general and administrative expenses from continuing operations were $4.6 million. For the same period in the prior year, general and administrative expenses were $5.2 million. The decrease was primarily related to a decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation and payroll expenses. About Rafael Holdings, Inc.

The company invested $62.2 million in water and wastewater infrastructure projects in 2023 to improve service quality and meet growth demands. Positive Stable revenues of $98.9 million for both 2022 and 2023. Increase in water sales revenue by $1.7 million due to rate increase and water consumption. Operating expenses increased slightly, with utility expenses rising by 5.6%. Investment of $62.2 million in water and wastewater infrastructure projects in 2023. Negative Net income decreased by $1.3 million, or 7.2%, for the year 2023 compared to 2022. Non-utility operating revenue decreased by $2.4 million, or 26.9%. Short-term debt interest increased by $0.1 million. Financial Analyst An examination of Artesian Resources Corporation's financial results reveals a mixed performance. The year-end net income decline by 7.2% alongside a decrease in diluted net income per share from $1.90 to $1.67 indicates a contraction in profitability. However, this must be contextualized within industry performance and broader economic conditions. The steady revenue, maintained at $98.9 million, suggests operational stability, but the unchanged revenue juxtaposed with rising operating expenses could signal margin compression. The increase in water sales revenue and customer base growth are positive indicators, reflecting the company's ability to expand its market share and benefit from rate increases. However, the decrease in non-utility operating revenue and the rise in operating expenses highlight challenges in cost management and the potential impact of project completion on revenue streams.Investors should note the increase in property and other taxes, which may affect future net income. The rise in depreciation and amortization expense is a natural consequence of the company's substantial capital investments in infrastructure. These investments are critical for long-term growth but can pressure short-term earnings. The increase in federal and state income tax expense, despite lower pre-tax income, warrants attention as it affects net income. Furthermore, the increase in long-term and short-term debt interest expenses reflects the company's financing strategy amidst a potentially rising interest rate environment, which could impact future interest payments and financial flexibility. Market Research Analyst Artesian Resources Corporation's strategic focus on capital improvements, as evidenced by the $62.2 million investment in water and wastewater infrastructure, positions the company in a favorable light in terms of service quality and reliability. This proactive approach, particularly the investment in PFAS treatment ahead of anticipated EPA regulations, demonstrates foresight and may provide a competitive advantage. The ability to anticipate regulatory changes and prepare accordingly is a strong indicator of management's strategic planning capabilities.The temporary rate increase and the pending rate case with the DEPSC are critical factors for future revenue projections. The outcome of the rate case will significantly influence the company's revenue stream and investment recovery. Stakeholders should monitor the DEPSC's decision closely as it will have implications for the company's financial health and stock performance. Additionally, the company's ability to grow its customer base in its franchise area suggests potential for market expansion, which could drive future revenue growth. Economist The performance of Artesian Resources Corporation must be analyzed against the backdrop of macroeconomic conditions. The company's increased expenses in payroll and benefits, as well as supply and treatment costs, reflect broader inflationary pressures that many industries are facing. The ability to pass on these costs to consumers through rate increases is a positive sign of pricing power, which is crucial in inflationary times. However, the reliance on regulatory approval for rate increases introduces an element of uncertainty into the company's revenue forecasts.Furthermore, the company's investment in infrastructure, while necessary for long-term sustainability and compliance with anticipated regulations, must be balanced against the cost of capital. The increased interest expenses due to higher debt levels could become more burdensome if interest rates continue to rise. This scenario would have implications for the company's capital structure and cost of financing future projects. The current economic environment, characterized by uncertainty around interest rates and regulatory changes, poses both challenges and opportunities for Artesian Resources Corporation. 03/13/2024 - 04:45 PM NEWARK, Del., March 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Artesian Resources Corporation (Nasdaq: ARTNA), a leading provider of water and wastewater services, and related services, on the Delmarva Peninsula, today announced earnings results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. Year End Results Net income was $16.7 million, a $1.3 million, or 7.2%, decrease compared to net income recorded during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. Diluted net income per share decreased to $1.67, compared to $1.90 for the same period in 2022. Revenues totaled $98.9 million for both the year ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively: Water sales revenue increased $1.7 million, or 2.2%, primarily related to a temporary net rate increase of 7.50% of gross water sales placed into effect on November 28, 2023, as permitted under Delaware law, until permanent rates are determined by the Delaware Public Service Commission, or DEPSC, and an increase in overall water consumption. In addition, fixed fee revenue increased as a result of additional customers. Other utility operating revenue increased approximately $0.7 million, or 6.0%. This increase is primarily due to an increase in wastewater revenue associated with customer growth and an increase in fee revenue related to inspection, service and finance charges. Non-utility operating revenue decreased approximately $2.4 million, or 26.9%. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in contract service revenue related to a contract for the design and construction of wastewater infrastructure now nearing completion, partially offset by an increase in Service Line Protection Plan, or SLP Plan, revenue. Operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization and income taxes, increased $0.2 million, or 0.4%. Utility operating expenses increased $2.4 million, or 5.6%, primarily the result of increases in employee benefits and payroll costs, computer system maintenance costs, and supply and treatment costs for our water and wastewater systems. These increases are partially offset by a decrease in purchased water under a new contract, effective January 2022, in which the minimum amount of water required to be purchased was reduced. Non-utility operating expenses decreased $2.4 million, or 35.4%, primarily due to a decrease in costs associated with a wastewater infrastructure design and construction contract. Property and other taxes increased $0.2 million, or 3.9%, primarily due to an increase in utility plant subject to taxation and an increase in payroll taxes, related to increased payroll related expenses. Property taxes are assessed on land, buildings and certain utility plant, which include the footage and size of pipe, hydrants and wells. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $0.7 million, or 5.7%, primarily due to continued investment in utility plant providing supply, treatment, storage and distribution of water to customers and service to our wastewater customers. Federal and state income tax expense increased $0.5 million, or 8.0%, primarily due to adjustments related to the application of state net operating loss valuation allowances and stock options exercised in 2022, partially offset by lower pre-tax income in 2023 compared to 2022. Other income increased $0.8 million, primarily due to a $0.7 million increase in allowance for funds used during construction, or AFUDC, as a result of higher long-term construction activity subject to AFUDC. Miscellaneous income increased $0.1 million primarily related to an increase in the annual patronage refund from CoBank, ACB. The primary refund calculation for both 2023 and 2022 was based on the average loan balance outstanding. Long-term debt interest increased $0.5 million, primarily related to an increase in long-term debt interest associated with the Series W First Mortgage Bond issued on April 29, 2022. Short-term debt interest increased $0.1 million, primarily related to higher interest rates. “In April 2023 we filed a request for an increase in water rates in our Delaware operations. We requested a $16.7 million increase in annual revenue, which is necessary to recover increased operating costs and significant investments made to ensure water quality and resiliency, including upgrades of our treatment equipment and facilities, new elevated water storage, replacement of aging water mains, and investments in information technology. We began charging temporary rates on November 28, 2023, as permitted by the Delaware Public Service Commission, while the full request is under examination.

Fourth Quarter Results Net income was $3.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, a $1.2 million, or 49.7%, increase compared to net income recorded during the three months ended December 31, 2022. Diluted net income per share increased to $0.34 compared to $0.24 for the same period in 2022. Revenues totaled $24.5 million, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 2.3%, compared to revenues recorded for the same period in 2022. Water sales revenue increased $1.0 million, or 5.3%, primarily related to a temporary net rate increase of 7.50% of gross water sales placed into effect on November 28, 2023, as permitted under Delaware law, until permanent rates are determined by the DEPSC, and an increase in overall water consumption. In addition, fixed fee revenue increased as a result of additional customers. Other utility operating revenue decreased approximately $0.1 million, or 3.5%, primarily due to decreased operating subsidies from developers and the timing of industrial wastewater revenue, partially offset by an increase in wastewater revenue associated with additional customers served. Non-utility operating revenue decreased approximately $1.5 million, or 46.1%, primarily due to a decrease in contract service revenue related to a contract for the design and construction of wastewater infrastructure now nearing completion, partially offset by an increase in SLP Plan revenue. Operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization and income taxes, decreased $2.3 million, or 13.9%. Utility operating expenses decreased $1.1 million, or 8.3%, primarily the result of an overall decrease in payroll and employee benefits costs and water treatment costs. Non-utility operating expenses decreased $1.3 million, or 54.8%, primarily due to a decrease in costs associated with a wastewater infrastructure design and construction contract. Property and other taxes increased $0.1 million, or 4.6%, primarily due to an increase in utility plant subject to taxation and an increase in payroll taxes, related to increased payroll related expenses.

They entered collaborations for Novel Therapies and issued guidance for 2024 with expected revenue growth of 10-13%.

Net loss for 2023 was ($13.7) million, including a tax valuation allowance of $6.0 million. Entered into a new debt facility with HSBC Bank USA. Received an assessment report from BSI in the EU regarding certification. Guidance for 2024 includes revenue growth, new collaborations, and gross margin expectations. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results and guidance issued by KORU Medical Systems, Inc. indicate a mixed performance with a slight decrease in net revenues for Q4 2023 but an overall annual increase. The reported 2% annual revenue growth, while modest, aligns with cautious optimism in the healthcare sector, often characterized by steady but slow growth. The gross margin improvements are significant, suggesting enhanced operational efficiency, which is a positive indicator for investors concerned with cost management and profitability.From a financial perspective, the company's ability to generate positive cash flow in the fourth quarter and end the year with a healthy cash balance of $11.5 million demonstrates fiscal prudence and improved liquidity. The net loss, including a non-cash valuation allowance, is concerning; however, the adjusted EBITDA being relatively stable year-over-year indicates underlying operational consistency. The new $10 million credit facility could provide strategic capital for growth, but it also increases the company's leverage, which requires careful monitoring. Market Research Analyst Within the context of the healthcare market, KORU Medical's focus on large volume subcutaneous infusion solutions (SCIg) is particularly relevant. The SCIg market is experiencing growth due to the shift towards home-based treatments and patient-centric solutions. KORU's expansion into new geographies and the FDA clearance of a new product platform suggest potential for market share gains, especially in the U.S. However, the decline in Novel Therapies net revenues by 62% year-over-year could be a point of concern for the company's diversification strategy.The guidance for 2024, which forecasts 10-13% revenue growth, appears optimistic and may reflect confidence in their Core business and the expected contribution from new collaborations. Nonetheless, the appeal against the EU's certification body's recommendation presents a risk that could potentially impact international revenue streams. Medical Device Industry Analyst From an industry standpoint, KORU Medical's focus on patient-centric infusion solutions is strategically aligned with current trends towards personalized medicine and home-based care. The improvement in gross margins suggests successful operational enhancements, such as manufacturing efficiency, which is crucial in an industry with high regulatory compliance costs. The launch of the 50mL prefill pump platform could be a significant differentiator in the competitive landscape of medical devices for infusion therapy.The collaborations in Novel Therapies are indicative of the company's commitment to innovation and could lead to future revenue streams, though the recent decline in this segment's revenues warrants close observation. Furthermore, the management's reference to Vision 2026 strategy suggests a long-term plan for sustainable growth, which is critical in a sector where product development cycles can be lengthy. 03/13/2024 - 04:05 PM MAHWAH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- KORU Medical Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: KRMD) (""KORU Medical"" or the ""Company""), a leading medical technology company focused on development, manufacturing, and commercialization of innovative and patient-centric large volume subcutaneous infusion solutions, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. The Company also issued guidance for the full year 2024. Recent Highlights Fourth quarter 2023 net revenues of $7.2 million, a 2% decrease from the prior year; Full year 2023 net revenues of $28.5 million, a 2% increase over the prior year Full year 6.7% Core business growth (U.S. and International) driven by overall SCIg market growth, share gains and expansion in new geographies Fourth quarter gross margin of 60.3%, reflecting year-over-year improvement of 470 basis points; Full year gross margin of 58.6%, reflecting year-over-year improvement of 350 basis points Positive cash flow of $0.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, ending the year with a cash balance of $11.5 million Entered 3 Novel Therapies collaborations during 2023 and announced 2 new collaborations in the first quarter of 2024 Recorded a non-cash valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of $6.0 million. Net loss for the year, which included this allowance, was ($13.7) million, or ($0.30) per share. Adjusted EBITDA was ($6.0) million, or ($0.13) per share vs. ($6.1) million or ($0.14) in the prior year. Signed a $10 million credit facility with HSBC USA to replace an expired $3.5 million revolver agreement; the credit facility will be reserved for strategic growth capital Issued full year 2024 net revenues guidance of $31.2-$32.2 million, representing 10-13% growth “I am proud of the KORU team for delivering a solid end to 2023, led by performance in our Core business. Entry into multiple geographic markets drove international sales, and in the US, we hit a key milestone with the FDA clearance and launch of the 50mL prefill pump platform, which we anticipate will be a significant growth driver in 2024. Additionally, we saw double-digit growth in our end-user specialty pharmacy sales, reflective of share gains and a growing Ig market,” said Linda Tharby, KORU Medical's President and CEO. “Within our Novel Therapies business, we recently announced collaborations for two late-stage therapies. On the operational side, we increased gross margins, were cash flow positive in the fourth quarter and finished the year with a significantly lower cash burn than the prior year. We are excited by the momentum we are carrying into 2024; we remain focused on the execution of our Vision 2026 strategy, and positioning KORU for growth, profitability and value creation for our customers and shareholders.” 2023 Fourth Quarter Financial Results Three Months Ended December 31, Change from Prior Year % of Total 2023 2022 $ % 2023 2022 Net Revenues Domestic Core $ 5,565,349 $ 5,314,836 $ 250,513 4.7 % 77.4 % 72.4 % International Core 1,315,036 1,221,540 93,496 7.7 % 18.3 % 16.6 % Novel Therapies 305,547 808,305 (502,758 ) (62.2 %) 4.3 % 11.0 % Total $ 7,185,932 $ 7,344,681 $ (158,749 ) (2.2 %) Total net revenues decreased $0.2 million, or 2.2%, for the three months ended December 31, 2023, as compared with the same period last year. Domestic Core net revenues increased by 4.7% year-over-year, driven by growth in pumps and consumables, due to competitive share gain in new accounts. International Core net revenues increased by 7.7%, driven by strong SCIg volume and growth in several OUS geographies as we continue to expand into new markets. Novel Therapies net revenues declined by 62% year-over-year, primarily driven by the completion of a large milestone for a pharmaceutical NRE agreement in 2022. Gross profit increased $0.3 million or 6.2% for the three months ended December 31, 2023, as compared with the same period last year. Gross profit stated as a percentage of net revenues increased to 60.3% for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to 55.5% in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily driven by production efficiencies from the completion of an outsourced manufacturing initiative and consolidation of our manufacturing sites. Allowing for a one-time inventory adjustment for a product discontinuation, adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 63.1%. A reconciliation of adjusted gross margin to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided at the end of this press release. Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $6.7 million, an increase of $0.1 million or 1.6%, compared to $6.6 million in the prior year period. The increase was driven primarily by the hiring of our new Chief Commercial Officer to lead our Core business growth strategy, partially offset by efficiencies in insourcing R&D. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $7.5 million, or $(0.16) per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $2.0 million, or ($0.04) per diluted share for the same period of 2022. Net loss included a tax valuation allowance of $6.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was ($1.0 million), or ($0.02) per diluted share versus ($1.6 million), or ($0.04) in the prior year. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided at the end of this press release. 2023 Full Year Financial Results Years Ended December 31, Change from Prior Year % of Total 2023 2022 $ % 2023 2022 Net Revenues Domestic Core $ 22,446,519 $ 21,205,204 $ 1,241,315 5.9 % 78.7 % 76.0 % International Core 4,596,097 4,164,714 431,383 10.4 % 16.1 % 14.9 % Novel Therapies 1,475,050 2,526,119 (1,051,069 ) (41.6 %) 5.2 % 9.1 % Total $ 28,517,666 $ 27,896,037 $ 621,629 2.2 % Total net revenues increased $0.6 million, or 2.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared with the same period last year. Domestic Core growth of 5.9% was driven by volume growth in pumps and consumables attributed to share gains. International Core growth of 10.4% was driven by increased volume across several EU markets and the entry into multiple new geographic markets. The growth in Core offset a 41.6% year-over-year decline in Novel Therapies net revenues, primarily driven by the completion of a large milestone for a pharmaceutical NRE agreement in 2022. Gross profit increased $1.3 million or 8.7% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to 58.6% compared to 55.1% from the prior year. The increase was driven by improvements in manufacturing productivity and product mix. Allowing for a one-time inventory adjustment for a product discontinuation, adjusted gross margin for the year ended 2023 was 59.6%. A reconciliation of adjusted gross margin to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided at the end of this press release. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $0.2 million, or 1.2%, during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by lower executive restructuring costs partially offset by an increase of new hires in commercial business development and medical affairs. Research and development expenses increased $0.8 million, or 15.9%, during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared with the same period last year, primarily due to compensation and expenses to support new hires focused on new product development. Net loss for the full year 2023 was $13.7 million, or $(0.30) per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $8.7 million, or $(0.19) per diluted share for the same period of 2022. Net loss included a tax valuation allowance of $6.0 million for the full year 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year was ($6.0) million, or ($0.13) per diluted share versus ($6.1) million or ($0.14) in the prior year. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided at the end of this press release. Cash and cash equivalents were $11.5 million as of December 31, 2023, reflecting positive cash flow of $0.7 million in the fourth quarter and a reduction of cash burn to $5.9 million in 2023 from $8 million in 2022. Subsequent Events The Company has entered into a $5M revolving credit facility and a $5M term loan facility with HSBC Bank USA, which replaced a $3.5M revolving credit facility with a regional bank that expired in August of 2023. This new debt facility provides KORU Medical with additional capital flexibility to support a reserve for growth and strategic opportunities. The Company has received an assessment report from its notified body in the EU, BSI, stating that, following BSI’s review of technical documentation submitted by the Company in connection with a prior audit nonconformance, a recommendation for continued certification cannot be made. The Company has filed an appeal to this determination. Management believes that the Company’s appeal will be successful in limiting the scope of the suspension to have minimal impact on the Company’s revenues, if any. Assumptions and Guidance for Full Year 2024 KORU Medical's guidance for the full year 2024 reflects numerous assumptions that could affect its business, based on the information management has as of this date. Management will discuss its outlook and several of its assumptions on its fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. KORU Medical expects: Full year 2024 net revenue between $31.2 and $32.2 million, representing growth in the range of 10% to 13% SCIg market growth of mid-to-high single digits Three new Novel Therapies collaborations Prefilled syringe market penetration of approximately 20%-25% Gross margin between 59% and 61% for the full year 2024 Geographic expansion into lower ASP markets Supply chain inflationary pricing pressure Production line start-up in Q4 for new product introduction 2024 year-end cash balance greater than $8.0 million Operating expenses of approximately $23.5- $24.0 million, exclusive of stock compensation expense Cash flow breakeven in the fourth quarter of 2024 and cash flow positive for full year 2025 Ending cash balance is exclusive of the new $10 million credit facility, which will be reserved for strategic growth capital opportunities Conference Call and Webcast Details The Company will host a live conference call and webcast to discuss these results and provide a corporate update on Wednesday, March 13, 2024, at 4:30 PM ET.

Financial Analyst The reported increase in cash flow from operations and total liquidity by Adams Resources & Energy, Inc. presents a positive signal to stakeholders regarding the company's operational efficiency and financial health. The improvement in net loss and the transition to a net cash provided by operating activities indicate a turnaround in the company's ability to generate cash through its core business activities, which is a critical factor for sustaining operations and funding future growth. The increase in liquidity, from $55.9 million to $80.3 million, strengthens the company's financial flexibility, potentially allowing it to navigate macroeconomic challenges more effectively.Moreover, the payment of dividends, despite the net loss, suggests confidence by the management in the company's long-term profitability and commitment to shareholder returns. However, the decrease in total revenue year-over-year may raise concerns about the company's market position and ability to grow sales in a competitive environment. Investors should closely monitor the company's future performance, particularly in its crude oil marketing segment, which has seen a reduction in marketed barrels per day, likely impacting revenue streams. Market Research Analyst Adams Resources & Energy's operational highlights, such as the exit from Red River operations and the sale of liquidated equipment, suggest strategic adjustments to optimize its asset portfolio. The gains from these sales have likely contributed positively to the company's cash flow. The reported decrease in marketed barrels of crude oil and transportation miles could be indicative of broader industry trends or specific operational challenges, which may have implications for the company's market share and competitive positioning.Additionally, the strategic acquisitions in the logistics and repurposing segment signal an expansion of services that could diversify revenue streams and reduce dependency on core segments. The modernization of the fleet, with a reduced average life of tractors, could lead to increased operational efficiency and potentially lower maintenance costs over time. These factors, combined with the company's solid positioning with crude oil inventory, may provide a buffer against market volatility and position Adams for recovery as anticipated in the latter half of 2024. Energy Sector Analyst The sector-specific implications of Adams Resources & Energy's financial results are noteworthy. The reduction in throughput for the Victoria Express Pipeline System and terminalling volumes year-over-year could reflect industry-wide challenges, such as fluctuating demand or price volatility in the energy sector. The company's ability to maintain a solid inventory of crude oil despite these challenges suggests a deliberate inventory management strategy that could mitigate risks associated with price swings.Furthermore, the company's anticipation of a gradual recovery in its GulfMark and Service Transport segments aligns with broader economic forecasts indicating potential stabilization or improvement in the energy market. The strategic exit from underperforming operations and the focus on maintaining liquidity are prudent steps in such an unpredictable sector. These moves could help Adams navigate short-term headwinds while positioning for long-term growth as market conditions improve. 03/13/2024 - 04:05 PM Reports Year-over-Year Increase in Cash Flow from Operations and Total Liquidity HOUSTON, March 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Adams Resources & Energy, Inc.

Adams' non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because they may not calculate such measures in the same manner as Adams does.

(VRM) reported financial results for Q4 and FY 2023, with $135.6 million cash, 4,780 Ecommerce units sold, and $4,742 Ecommerce GPPU. The company incurred net losses of $(141.3) million for Q4 and $(365.5) million for FY 2023.

Negative: Significant net losses of $(141.3) million for Q4 and $(365.5) million for FY 2023. Negative: Discontinuation of ecommerce operations leading to a reduction-in-force and wind down. Negative: Reduced financial outlook with an estimated cash range of $35.0 to $65.0 million by year-end 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results for Vroom, Inc. highlight a mix of growth in certain areas and significant challenges in others. The increase in Ecommerce units sold quarter-over-quarter indicates a successful expansion in this segment. However, the substantial net losses and negative Adjusted EBITDA figures for both the fourth quarter and the full year are concerning, suggesting operational inefficiencies or market challenges that are impacting profitability.The company's liquidation of aged inventory and write-downs due to the discontinuance of ecommerce operations reflect a strategic pivot that could be aimed at reducing losses and focusing on more profitable segments. The convertible note repurchases at a discount could be a strategic move to manage debt and potentially improve the balance sheet. However, investors should closely monitor the company's cash burn rate and liquidity position, especially given the anticipated cash and cash equivalents for year-end 2024, which signals a significant decrease from the current level. Market Research Analyst The automotive ecommerce industry is highly competitive, with several major players vying for market share. Vroom's decision to wind down its ecommerce operations may be a response to this intense competition and a strategy to optimize its business model. The growth in Ecommerce unit sales and Ecommerce gross profit per unit (GPPU) suggests that while the company was able to sell more units and increase profitability per unit, the overall strategy was not sustainable in the long term.By focusing on the remaining businesses, United Auto Credit and CarStory, Vroom is likely aiming to leverage niche markets within the used vehicle sector. This pivot could be an attempt to differentiate from competitors and focus on areas with higher margins or less direct competition. Economist The automotive sector is sensitive to economic cycles and Vroom's performance must be contextualized within the broader economic environment. The substantial net losses reported may partly reflect macroeconomic headwinds such as fluctuating consumer demand, supply chain disruptions and increased competition, which can compress margins and elevate operational costs.The reduction-in-force and other cost-cutting measures indicate a response to these economic pressures. The strategic focus on value maximization could be a prudent approach to navigating the current economic climate, especially if it leads to a leaner, more focused operation that can adapt to changing market conditions. 03/13/2024 - 04:05 PM Substantial Progress on Value Maximization Plan NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Vroom, Inc.

These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because of these limitations, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with other operating and financial performance measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA excluding non-recurring costs to address operational and customer experience issues, Adjusted EBITDA excluding securitization gain, and Adjusted EBITDA excluding securitization gain and non-recurring costs to address operational and customer experience issues are supplemental performance measures that our management uses to assess our operating performance and the operating leverage in our business. Because each of these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis, we use these measures for business planning purposes. EBITDA We calculate EBITDA as net loss before interest expense, interest income, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted to exclude severance costs, gain on debt extinguishment, severe weather-related costs, long-lived asset impairment charges, goodwill impairment charge, realignment costs, acquisition related costs, and the acceleration of non-cash stock-based compensation. Changes in fair value of financial instruments can fluctuate significantly from period to period and previously related primarily to historical finance receivables and debt which have been securitized, and acquired on February 1, 2022 from UACC. As a result of current market conditions, the financial instruments related to the 2022-2 and 2023-1 securitization transactions are recognized on balance-sheet and accounted for under the fair value option. See Note 17 — Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. As a result, the majority of our finance receivables are now carried at fair value and a significant portion of the risk of loss associated with these finance receivables have been retained by UACC. We therefore have determined we will no longer make any adjustments for such fluctuations in fair value to our Adjusted EBITDA results. We have recast the prior period presented to conform to current period presentation. We may account for future securitizations as on balance sheet transactions depending on the market conditions. Adjusted EBITDA excluding non-recurring costs to address operational and customer experience issues We calculate Adjusted EBITDA excluding non-recurring costs to address operational and customer experience issues as Adjusted EBITDA adjusted to exclude the non-recurring costs incurred to address operational and customer experience issues, including rental cars for our customers and legal settlements with customers and state DMVs. Adjusted EBITDA excluding securitization gain We calculate Adjusted EBITDA excluding securitization gain as Adjusted EBITDA adjusted to exclude the securitization gain from the sale of UACC's finance receivables, and believe that it provides a useful perspective on the underlying operating results and trends and a means to compare our period-over-period results. Adjusted EBITDA excluding securitization gain and non-recurring costs to address operational and customer experience issues We calculate Adjusted EBITDA excluding securitization gain and non-recurring costs to address operational and customer experience issues as Adjusted EBITDA adjusted to exclude the securitization gain from the sale of UACC’s finance receivables and the non-recurring costs incurred to address operational and customer experience issues.

CEO Larry Heaton is optimistic about the future despite the risk of delisting.,"Zomedica Provides NYSE American Listing Update Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Zomedica Corp. is in dialogue with NYSE American to regain compliance with listing standards after receiving a notice in 2023. The company held a Special Meeting of Shareholders but failed to effect a share consolidation action. CEO Larry Heaton is optimistic about the future despite the risk of delisting. Positive None. Negative Zomedica failed to effect an 80:1 share consolidation action at a Special Meeting of Shareholders, risking delisting if share price deteriorates further. Market Research Analyst The situation with Zomedica Corp. reflects a critical juncture for the company's relationship with the stock exchange and its investors. The inability to execute an 80:1 reverse stock split due to the lack of shareholder approval indicates a significant disconnect between the company's management and its shareholders. This failed corporate action suggests a lack of confidence in the management's strategy or a misalignment regarding the company's valuation and future prospects.From a market perspective, the ongoing dialogue with NYSE American is a positive sign, showing that the company is actively seeking solutions to maintain its listing status. However, the mention of potential delisting due to additional deterioration in share price is a red flag that may concern investors. It highlights the urgency for Zomedica to not only communicate its progress and opportunities but also to deliver tangible results that can be reflected in its financial performance and, subsequently, its stock price.Investors and potential investors should closely monitor Zomedica's future announcements and performance metrics, as these will be critical in determining the company's ability to sustain its stock price and comply with listing standards. The implications of a delisting could be severe, including reduced liquidity and access to capital markets, which would impact the company's ability to fund operations and growth initiatives. Financial Analyst The notice of non-compliance received by Zomedica from the NYSE American is a significant financial event that directly affects the company's stock market presence and investor perception. The reference to Section 1003(f)(v) indicates that the company's share price has fallen below a level acceptable to the exchange, which typically requires a minimum average share price to maintain listing.Financially, the failure to execute the reverse stock split could be interpreted as a missed opportunity to adjust the share structure and potentially stabilize the stock price. This decision, or lack thereof, may have implications for the company's market capitalization and could influence investor confidence in the company's governance and long-term viability. Moreover, the CEO's statement about highlighting the company's progress suggests a need to improve investor relations and market sentiment.Given the current situation, stakeholders should evaluate the company's operational performance, market position in the veterinary health sector and the execution of its strategic plans. These factors will play a crucial role in Zomedica's ability to regain compliance and avoid the consequences of a delisting, which could include diminished investor interest and a challenging fundraising environment. Veterinary Industry Expert Zomedica's core business in the veterinary health sector, focusing on point-of-care diagnostics and therapeutic products for animals, is a niche yet growing market. The company's performance in this sector is critical to understanding its potential for price improvement and compliance with NYSE American's listing standards.The demand for veterinary care and advanced diagnostics is on the rise, driven by increased pet ownership and a greater focus on animal health and welfare. Zomedica's ability to capitalize on these trends and effectively communicate its value proposition to the market is essential. The CEO's reference to the company's progress over the years and future opportunities indicates that Zomedica may have a solid product portfolio or pipeline that could drive growth. However, the failure to implement the reverse stock split raises questions about the company's strategic decision-making and ability to adapt to market conditions.Stakeholders, including veterinary professionals and investors interested in the animal health industry, should consider the company's technological advancements, competitive positioning and the potential impact of regulatory changes on its business model. These aspects are vital for Zomedica to maintain investor interest and achieve a stock price that reflects its intrinsic value. 03/13/2024 - 04:45 PM ANN ARBOR, MI / ACCESSWIRE / March 13, 2024 / Zomedica Corp. (NYSE American:ZOM) (""Zomedica"" or the ""Company""), a veterinary health company offering point-of-care diagnostics and therapeutic products for equine and companion animals, today announced that it is continuing dialogue with senior regulatory staff at the NYSE American regarding next steps to regaining compliance with its listing standards. Zomedica shares will remain listed on the NYSE American at this time.As announced on September 13, 2023, Zomedica received formal notice from the NYSE American that it was not in compliance with continued listing standards as set forth in Section 1003(f)(v) of the NYSE American Company Guide. According to the notice, the Company had a reasonable period of time, which was determined to be March 12, 2024, to effect a reverse stock split or otherwise demonstrate sustained price improvement.While the notice did not result in an immediate delisting of Zomedica's common shares, it did prompt the Company to announce that it would undertake certain cure measures to regain compliance.A Special Meeting of Shareholders was held on February 28, 2024, with the company unable to effect an 80:1 share consolidation corporate action by a required majority of 67.7% votes as set forth by the Company's bylaws.Larry Heaton, Chief Executive Officer of Zomedica Corp. stated, ""Following the rejection of our proposed reverse stock split, we have been in contact with the NYSE American to understand the implications for Zomedica's continued listing. The exchange has indicated that they will continue to monitor our share price and other developments and noted that additional deterioration of the share price could result in delisting. This gives us time to continue to highlight the progress the Company has made over the last several years, and the tremendous opportunities ahead, to positively impact our share price.""About ZomedicaBased in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Zomedica (NYSE American:ZOM) is a veterinary health company creating products for horses, dogs, and cats by focusing on the unmet needs of clinical veterinarians.

Positive None. Negative None. Legal Expert The initiation of legal proceedings by James River Group Holdings against Fleming Intermediate Holdings LLC for alleged non-completion of a negotiated acquisition is a significant event that could have material implications for both parties involved. From a legal perspective, the crux of the matter lies in the interpretation and enforcement of the Stock Purchase Agreement. The specific performance sought by JRG Holdings indicates a strong conviction in their legal position and the terms agreed upon.Such legal disputes can often result in protracted litigation, which may impact the operational and financial stability of the entities involved. The uncertainty surrounding the outcome could potentially affect investor sentiment, as prolonged legal battles often entail substantial legal expenses and can distract from the companies' core business operations. Stakeholders should monitor the progression of this case closely, as any ruling could set precedents for similar transactions within the industry. Financial Analyst The announcement by AM Best that the credit ratings of James River Group Holdings and its subsidiaries remain unchanged post the legal filing provides a short-term reassurance to investors and stakeholders. However, the long-term financial implications hinge on the outcome of the legal proceedings. If JRG Holdings is successful in its legal action, it could lead to a swift closure of the transaction, potentially improving the company's financial position and strategic outlook.Conversely, if the acquisition does not proceed as planned, it could result in financial strain or strategic setbacks, thereby affecting future credit ratings. Investors should consider the potential for volatility in JRG Holdings' stock price as the market reacts to updates on the legal situation and its implications for the company's financial health and growth trajectory. Market Research Analyst The dispute between JRG Holdings and Fleming is indicative of broader trends in M&A activity within the insurance industry. The resolution of this case could influence market dynamics, particularly regarding the perceived risks of deal-making with private equity-backed entities. It is essential for market participants to understand the implications of such legal actions on the stability and attractiveness of M&A deals.Furthermore, the insurance industry is closely regulated and highly sensitive to reputational risks. Any negative publicity stemming from this legal action could potentially impact the market perception of the involved parties, thereby influencing their competitive position and market share. The industry will be watching this case for insights into how legal challenges can affect not only the parties involved but also the broader M&A landscape in the insurance sector. 03/13/2024 - 04:44 PM OLDWICK, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AM Best has commented that the Credit Rating (ratings) of James River Group Holdings, Ltd.

Negative None. 03/13/2024 - 04:35 PM SACRAMENTO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Tri Counties Bank, a leading community bank in California, kicked off its 50th Anniversary Celebration today with the launch of a year-long fundraising campaign to support the California Community Colleges Student Ambassador Program. In a press event at Sacramento City College, the bank launched the campaign with a $50,000 contribution and announced it will hold a variety of fundraising events and volunteer activities in partnership with the Foundation for California Community Colleges (FoundationCCC), which oversees the program. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240313397944/en/ The Student Ambassador Program trains and empowers students as on-campus leaders in peer-to-peer outreach. Ambassadors connect fellow students to food, housing, and other basic needs resources that ease barriers to education (such as CalFresh and Crisis Text Line), provide hands-on benefit application assistance, and reduce the stigma around getting help. Through the partnership, Tri Counties Bank employees in California will be connected directly with local student ambassadors across the California Community College system. “We chose FoundationCCC as a partner for our 50th Anniversary campaign because of the positive impact the California Community Colleges and the Student Ambassador Program have on the communities we serve throughout the state,” said Rick Smith, President and CEO of Tri Counties Bank. “Tri Counties Bank believes in people, first and foremost, and we plan to continue that mission over the next fifty years.” The partnership comes at a critical time. A 2023 survey found that two-thirds of California community college students struggle with food or housing insecurity. Nearly half of California community college students are unsure of where their next meal will come from, and roughly one in four face homelessness. Each ambassador can reach approximately 1,000 students, providing crucial support to address these challenges and ease their pathway towards college and career success. “As a single parent who had to balance education with childcare responsibilities, I’ve seen first-hand how access to food and housing resources can transform lives,” said Yuriko Curiel, Student Ambassador Program Coordinator for the FoundationCCC. Once a part of the program herself, Curiel now trains future student ambassadors. Tri Counties Bank’s year-long 50th Anniversary initiative will involve multiple fundraising efforts, including encouraging donations through the Bank’s Mobile and Online Banking, and a new checking account that will benefit the FoundationCCC. Additionally, as part of the Bank’s mission to improve the financial success of its communities, Tri Counties Bank has committed to providing financial education training to student ambassadors and community college students, and will be hosting a needs drive in all bank branches, to be launched this summer to help community college students throughout the academic year. Tri Counties Bank’s 50th Anniversary Campaign will celebrate its past, present, and future with a focus on its customers, shareholders, communities and employees. As part of the campaign, the Bank encourages current and former customers to submit their favorite Tri Counties Bank moments and find a customer appreciation event taking place near them at TriCountiesBank.com/50.

The company's focus on production and sales pace, along with strategic pricing and incentives, has led to positive growth despite challenges in the housing market. Lennar has also made substantial investments in stock repurchases, dividend increases, and balance sheet fortification. Positive Net earnings per diluted share increased by 25% to $2.57 compared to the prior year quarter. New orders surged by 28% to 18,176 homes, with a dollar value increase of 21% to $7.7 billion. Deliveries saw a 23% increase to 16,798 homes, contributing to a 13% rise in total revenues to $7.3 billion. Homebuilding operating earnings reached $1.0 billion, with a gross margin on home sales of 21.8%. The company repurchased 3.4 million shares of common stock for $506 million and increased its stock repurchase program by $5.0 billion. Lennar raised its annual dividend from $1.50 per share to $2.00 per share, showcasing confidence in future performance. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported increase in net earnings per diluted share by 25% and overall net earnings by 21% for Lennar Corporation is a strong indicator of the company's profitability and operational efficiency. The growth in new orders by 28% and the subsequent increase in the dollar value of these orders by 21% suggest a robust demand for the company's homes. Additionally, the 23% increase in deliveries reflects the company's ability to meet this demand effectively. The reported backlog, with a dollar value of $7.4 billion, provides a clear visibility into future revenues, which is a positive sign for investors.From a financial standpoint, the company's strategic repurchase of shares, increase in dividend payouts and the reported strong balance sheet with $5.0 billion in cash and cash equivalents, coupled with no outstanding borrowings, demonstrate a solid financial position and a commitment to returning value to shareholders. The homebuilding debt to total capital ratio of 9.6% is particularly low for the industry, which typically sees higher leverage ratios, indicating a conservative approach to debt management that may appeal to risk-averse investors. Financial Analyst The detailed financial metrics provided, such as the gross margin on home sales of 21.8% and the net margin of 13.6%, are essential for evaluating the company's cost management and profitability. An increase in gross margin suggests that Lennar has been successful in managing construction costs and pricing strategies. The S,G&A expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales at 8.2% reflect operational efficiency and cost control.The company's capital allocation strategy, including the repurchase of $506 million of common stock and the authorization of an additional $5.0 billion stock repurchase program, indicates a bullish stance by management regarding the company's valuation. Increasing the annual dividend from $1.50 to $2.00 per share is a significant return to shareholders and may attract income-focused investors. The financial services operating earnings of $131 million provide diversification to the company's revenue streams, while the multifamily and Lennar Other operating losses are areas that require attention to improve overall profitability. Real Estate Industry Analyst Lennar's report highlights several key factors influencing the real estate market, including interest rate fluctuations, strong employment and a persistent shortage of housing supply. The company's strategic focus on matching production pace with sales pace, despite the 8% decrease in the average sales price per home delivered, implies an operational shift towards volume over price maximization. This strategy may be in response to affordability challenges in the housing market, which is a significant factor for potential homebuyers.The emphasis on a 'land light' strategy, with a reduction in years supply of owned homesites and an increase in the percentage of controlled homesites, suggests a move towards greater flexibility and reduced inventory risk. This approach can lead to improved capital efficiency and potentially higher returns on investment. The improvement in the company's return on inventory to 30.5% is a testament to the effectiveness of these operational strategies and could signal a competitive advantage in the industry. 03/13/2024 - 04:30 PM First Quarter 2024 Highlights - comparisons to the prior year quarter Net earnings per diluted share increased 25% to $2.57Net earnings increased 21% to $719 millionNew orders increased 28% to 18,176 homes; new orders dollar value increased 21% to $7.7 billionBacklog of 16,270 homes with a dollar value of $7.4 billionDeliveries increased 23% to 16,798 homesTotal revenues increased 13% to $7.3 billionHomebuilding operating earnings of $1.0 billionGross margin on home sales of 21.8%S,G&A expenses as a % of revenues from home sales of 8.2%Net margin on home sales of 13.6%Financial Services operating earnings of $131 millionMultifamily operating loss of $16 millionLennar Other operating loss of $40 millionHomebuilding cash and cash equivalents of $5.0 billionYears supply of owned homesites of 1.3 years and controlled homesites of 77%No outstanding borrowings under the Company's $2.6 billion revolving credit facilityHomebuilding debt to total capital of 9.6%Repurchased 3.4 million shares of Lennar common stock for $506 millionIncreased stock repurchase program up to an additional $5.0 billionIncreased annual dividend from $1.50 per share to $2.00 per shareMIAMI, March 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Lennar Corporation (NYSE: LEN and LEN.B), one of the nation's leading homebuilders, today reported results for its first quarter ended February 29, 2024. First quarter net earnings attributable to Lennar in 2024 were $719 million, or $2.57 per diluted share, compared to first quarter net earnings attributable to Lennar in 2023 of $597 million, or $2.06 per diluted share. Stuart Miller, Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer of Lennar, said, ""We are pleased to report another strong quarter as we remained focused on consistent production pace driving sales pace, while using pricing, incentives, marketing spend, and margin informed by dynamic pricing to enable consistent sales volume in a fluctuating interest rate environment. Although affordability continued to be tested by interest rate movements, purchasers remained responsive to increased sales incentives, resulting in a 28% increase in our new orders and a 23% increase in our deliveries year over year."" ""The macroeconomic environment remained relatively consistent throughout our first quarter, with interest rates fluctuating within a manageable range, employment remaining strong, housing supply remaining chronically short due to production deficits over a decade, and demand strength driven by strong household formation. Housing market fundamentals remained strong as demand continued to outweigh supply. These conditions remained constructive for our overall operating strategy of focusing on production and sales pace over price while growing market share."" ""Earnings were $719 million, or $2.57 per diluted share, compared to $597 million, or $2.06 per diluted share last year. We delivered 16,798 homes in our first quarter and our new orders were 18,176, up 28%, year over year. Our average sales price, net of incentives, per home delivered was $413,000 in the first quarter, down 8% from last year, and our homebuilding gross margin in the first quarter was 21.8%, up 60 basis points from last year, as a result of our careful management of incentives combined with our intense focus on reducing construction costs, while homebuilding S,G&A expenses were 8.2%, resulting in a 13.6% net margin."" ""Driven by this quarter's strong operating performance, we constructively allocated capital while we continued to strengthen and fortify our balance sheet. During the quarter, we repurchased $506 million of our common stock, ending the quarter with homebuilding debt to total capital of 9.6%, no borrowings on our $2.6 billion revolver and cash of $5.0 billion. With cash on hand exceeding our debt, and with overall liquidity of $7.6 billion, our balance sheet remains extremely strong. Against that backdrop, we remain focused on our ""land strategies"" initiatives in order to intensify our land light focus and assure consistency of execution now and in the future as we embrace an ever-more focused manufacturing model for Lennar."" Jon Jaffe, Co-Chief Executive Officer and President of Lennar, said, ""Operationally, both our starts pace and sales pace were 4.9 homes per community in the first quarter, as we continue to move closer to an even flow operating model. Our cycle time was down to 154 days, or 30% year over year, as our production first focus has positively impacted our production times, while our inventory turn improved to 1.5 times reflecting broader efficiencies. Concurrently, the Lennar Machine continued to carefully match our sales pace to our production pace using our digital marketing and dynamic pricing models."" ""During the quarter, we continued the execution of our land light strategy. This was evidenced by our years supply of owned homesites improving to 1.3 years from 1.9 years last year and our controlled homesite percentage increasing to 77% from 68% year over year. These results drove our return on inventory to 30.5%, a sequential improvement of 110 basis points."" Mr. Miller concluded, ""We continue to remain enthusiastic about our current execution and our future. We have remained focused on our operating strategies, while at the same time being observant of current economic and market trends. This has positioned us particularly well as the economic environment continues to define itself throughout the complicated election year in 2024. As we look ahead to our second quarter, we expect to deliver between 19,000 and 19,500 homes with a gross margin of approximately 22.5%. We remain focused on delivering 80,000 homes for the full year, with a margin that remains consistent with last year's margin. We will continue to fortify our balance sheet with significant liquidity and operate from a position of strength, thus enabling us to continue to execute on our core strategies to drive strong cash flow and higher returns."" RESULTS OF OPERATIONSTHREE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 29, 2024 COMPARED TOTHREE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2023 Homebuilding Revenues from home sales increased 13% in the first quarter of 2024 to $6.9 billion from $6.1 billion in the first quarter of 2023. Revenues were higher primarily due to a 23% increase in the number of home deliveries, partially offset by an 8% decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered. New home deliveries increased to 16,798 homes in the first quarter of 2024 from 13,659 homes in the first quarter of 2023. The average sales price of homes delivered was $413,000 in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $448,000 in the first quarter of 2023. The decrease in average sales price of homes delivered in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to pricing to market through an increased use of incentives and product mix. Gross margins on home sales were $1.5 billion, or 21.8%, in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $1.3 billion, or 21.2%, in the first quarter of 2023. During the first quarter of 2024, gross margins increased because of a decrease in costs per square foot as the Company continued to focus on construction cost savings, which was partially offset by a decrease in average sales price and an increase in land costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $568 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $450 million in the first quarter of 2023. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 8.2% in the first quarter of 2024, from 7.4% in the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to an increase in the use of brokers due to current market conditions and an increase in digital marketing and advertising costs to generate more direct sales. Financial Services Operating earnings for the Financial Services segment were $131 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $78 million in the first quarter of 2023. The increase in operating earnings was primarily due to a higher profit per locked loan in the Company's mortgage business as a result of higher margins, and higher lock volume because of increased capture rate and Lennar deliveries. There was also an increase in profitability from the Company's title business due to higher volume and productivity as a result of continued implementation of technology initiatives. Other Ancillary Businesses Operating loss for the Multifamily segment was $16 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to operating loss of $22 million in the first quarter of 2023. Operating loss for the Lennar Other segment was $40 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to an operating loss of $41 million in the first quarter of 2023. Tax Rate In the first quarter of 2024 and 2023, the Company had tax provisions of $211 million and $185 million, respectively, which resulted in an overall effective income tax rate of 22.7% and 23.7%, respectively. In the first quarter of 2024, the Company's overall effective income tax rate was lower than last year, primarily due to tax benefits from share-based compensation. Share Repurchases In the first quarter of 2024, the Company repurchased 3.4 million shares of its common stock for $506 million at an average share price of $148.95. Liquidity At February 29, 2024, the Company had $5.0 billion of Homebuilding cash and cash equivalents and no outstanding borrowings under its $2.6 billion revolving credit facility, thereby providing approximately $7.6 billion of available capacity. Guidance The following are the Company's expected results of its homebuilding and financial services activities for the second quarter of 2024: Second Quarter 2024 New Orders 20,900 - 21,300 Deliveries 19,000 - 19,500 Average Sales Price $420,000 - $425,000 Gross Margin % on Home Sales About 22.5% S,G&A as a % of Home Sales About 7.2% Financial Services Operating Earnings $110 million - $115 million About Lennar Lennar Corporation, founded in 1954, is one of the nation's leading builders of quality homes for all generations.

(2) EBIT is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as earnings before interest and taxes. This financial measure has been presented because the Company finds it important and useful in evaluating its performance and believes that it helps readers of the Company's financial statements compare its operations with those of its competitors. Although management finds EBIT to be an important measure in conducting and evaluating the Company's operations, this measure has limitations as an analytical tool as it is not reflective of the actual profitability generated by the Company during the period. Management compensates for the limitations of using EBIT by using this non-GAAP measure only to supplement the Company's GAAP results. Due to the limitations discussed, EBIT should not be viewed in isolation, as it is not a substitute for GAAP measures.

The Company believes the ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital is a relevant and a useful financial measure to investors in understanding the leverage employed in homebuilding operations. However, because net homebuilding debt to total capital is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, this financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures prescribed by GAAP. Rather, this non-GAAP financial measure should be used to supplement the Company's GAAP results.

The Series offers 10 ETFs providing access to US Treasuries at specific points along the yield curve, attracting investors seeking safety and yield. F/m's President highlights the demand for easy access to short-term investments amidst market volatility. The launch of the US Credit Series further demonstrates F/m's commitment to providing efficient investment tools. F/m's novel exemptive application to the SEC aims to expand accessibility to the US Benchmark Series through mutual fund share classes. Positive The US Treasury 3 Month Bill ETF (TBIL) has surpassed $3 billion in assets, contributing to the total $4.25 billion raised by F/m Investments' US Benchmark Series since August 2022. Investors are drawn to the US Benchmark Series for its 10 ETFs offering exposure to US Treasuries at various points on the yield curve, providing a balance of safety and yield. F/m's President emphasizes the growing demand for accessible short-term investments amidst the influx of new asset classes and cryptocurrencies in the market. The introduction of the US Credit Series aligns with F/m's goal of simplifying investment processes by tracking the industry's first investable index in investment grade credit. F/m's innovative exemptive application to the SEC seeks approval for mutual fund share classes within the US Benchmark Series, potentially broadening access to a wider range of investors. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The recent announcement by F/m Investments regarding the success of their US Benchmark Series, particularly the US Treasury 3 Month Bill ETF (TBIL), which has surpassed $3 billion in assets, is a strong indicator of investor sentiment and behavior. Amidst market volatility and the influx of novel asset classes, there is a clear trend towards the safety and predictability of US Treasury securities. The diversification of the US Benchmark Series across different maturities of the yield curve caters to a wide range of investment strategies, from short-term liquidity management to long-term fixed income allocation.Moreover, the introduction of the US Credit Series ETFs, tracking the first investable index in investment grade credit, signifies an expansion of F/m's product offerings, aiming to provide investors with broader tools for portfolio construction. This could potentially disrupt the traditional mutual fund market, as it offers a level of precision and liquidity that is typically associated with ETFs.The potential SEC approval for a mutual fund share class for the ETFs in the US Benchmark Series could democratize access to these investment vehicles, aligning with the ongoing trend of convergence between mutual funds and ETFs. This could open up opportunities for a segment of investors who are restricted to mutual fund investments due to regulatory or policy constraints. Financial Analyst The accumulation of over $4.25 billion in assets for the US Benchmark Series within 18 months of its inception reflects a strong market demand for these products. This is an important financial metric, as it demonstrates significant capital inflow into the series, which can be seen as a vote of confidence from the investment community. The growth of TBIL, in particular, suggests that investors are seeking haven in short-term securities amidst uncertain economic conditions, which may be indicative of a risk-averse stance in the current market environment.From an investment perspective, the exemptive application filed with the SEC for offering a mutual fund share class is a strategic move that could potentially increase the liquidity and flexibility of the US Benchmark Series. If approved, this could lead to a reshaping of investor portfolios, as they could combine the benefits of mutual funds, such as familiarity and ease of use, with the advantages of ETFs, including intraday trading and typically lower fees. Legal Expert The exemptive application filed by F/m Investments with the SEC is a noteworthy legal development within the ETF industry. If granted, this would set a precedent for ETFs to offer a mutual fund share class, potentially bridging the gap between two distinct types of investment products. The legal implications of such a decision by the SEC could lead to a significant shift in the regulatory landscape, influencing how investment products are structured and offered to different investor classes.Understanding the legal nuances of this application is critical for stakeholders, as it could potentially alter the competitive dynamics within the investment fund industry. The ability to offer a mutual fund share class could provide ETFs with a competitive edge over traditional mutual funds, particularly in attracting a segment of the investor base that has been historically limited to mutual fund investments due to various constraints, including 401(k) plans and other retirement accounts. 03/13/2024 - 04:53 PM F/m Investments’ US Benchmark Series raises $4.25 billion since August 2022 WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- F/m Investments LLC (“F/m”) announces The US Treasury 3 Month Bill ETF (Ticker: TBIL) has crossed the $3 billion threshold in assets, highlighting investors' demand for innovative ways to access the short end of the yield curve. TBIL and the nine additional ETFs that comprise the US Benchmark Series give investors access to US Treasuries at 10 specific points across the US Treasury yield curve. Each ETF in the US Benchmark Series holds the most current (“on the run[1]”) US Treasury security that corresponds to its tenor. The 10 ETFs in the Series are: The US Treasury 3 Month Bill ETF (TBIL) The US Treasury 6 Month Bill ETF (XBIL) The US Treasury 12 Month Bill ETF (OBIL) The US Treasury 2 Year Note ETF (UTWO) The US Treasury 3 Year Note ETF (UTRE) The US Treasury 5 Year Note ETF (UFIV) The US Treasury 7 Year Note ETF (USVN) The US Treasury 10 Year Note ETF (UTEN) The US Treasury 20 Year Bond ETF (UTWY) The US Treasury 30 Year Bond ETF (UTHY) The Series has raised more than $4.25 billion in total in the 18 months since launch, confirming investor demand for a better way to invest in US Treasury securities. “TBIL’s continued growth highlights investors’ appetite for easy access to safety and yield at the short end of the curve,” said Alexander Morris, F/m’s President, and CIO. “In a market inundated recently by novel asset classes and even cryptocurrencies, the US Benchmark Series ETFs – both short and longer durations – are attracting assets from investors seeking duration exposure with the clarity and precision that these ETFs enable.” While TBIL remains the most recognized of F/m’s products, it’s not their most recent innovation. Consistent with F/m’s mission to provide a set of tools that investors can use to build portfolios with precision and efficiency, F/m in January launched the US Credit Series, a suite of ETFs that track the industry’s first investable index in investment grade credit. “We launched TBIL and the US Benchmark Series to bring efficiency and simplicity to US Treasury investing, but our goal was always larger,” said Pete Baden, senior portfolio manager and co-creator of the US Benchmark Series. “It’s our mission to build institutional quality, precise, diversified portfolios with the ease and efficiency of ETFs.” As part of F/m’s mission to expand access for investors, they recently filed a novel exemptive application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) seeking an order that would permit each of the ETFs in the US Benchmark Series to offer a mutual fund share class. The exemptive relief requested by the application is the first of its kind in the ETF industry and, if granted by the SEC, has the potential to make the US Benchmark Series accessible to investor segments that today can only access mutual funds. [1] This periodic transition to the most-recently auctioned Treasury bill, note, or bond of a stated maturity, which is referred to as the “on-the-run” or “OTR” security of that maturity, occurs on one day. An OTR security is the most recently issued of a periodically issued security (as opposed to an off-the-run security, which is a security that has been issued before the most recent issue and is still outstanding). __________________________ About US Treasury 3 Month Bill ETF The investment objective of the US Treasury 3 Month Bill ETF is to seek investment results that correspond (before fees and expenses) generally to the price and yield performance of the ICE BofA US 3-Month Treasury Bill Index (G0O1) About The US Benchmark Series The US Benchmark Series allows investors of all sizes to own each of the “Benchmark” US Treasuries in a single-security ETF. Each ETF holds the most current (“on the run”) US Treasury security that corresponds to its stated tenor. For more information, please visit www.ustreasuryetf.com.

Interest rate risk is the risk of losses attributable to changes in interest rates. In general, if prevailing interest rates rise, the values of debt instruments tend to fall, and if interest rates fall, the values of debt instruments tend to rise. Fund Risks: The UST 3 Month Bill Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the UST 3 Month Bill Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the UST 3 Month Bill Fund’s investments are concentrated in a particular issue, issuer or issuers, country, market segment, or asset class. While U.S. Treasury obligations are backed by the “full faith and credit” of the U.S. Government, such securities are nonetheless subject to credit risk (i.e., the risk that the U.S. Government may be, or be perceived to be, unable or unwilling to honor its financial obligations, such as making payments). ICE BofA US 3-Month Treasury Bill Index is comprised of a single issue purchased at the beginning of the month and held for a full month. At the end of the month that issue is sold and rolled into a newly selected issue. The issue selected at each month-end rebalancing is the outstanding Treasury Bill that matures closest to, but not beyond, three months from the rebalancing date. To qualify for selection, an issue must have settled on or before the month-end rebalancing date. Investments involve risk. Principal loss is possible.

Earnings per share stood at $1.42 with an annualized return of 15.96%. The net asset value per share increased to $28.00, up 1.9% from the previous quarter. The Company had successful investment fundings and debt management strategies, showcasing robust performance. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results and private placement announcement by T. Rowe Price OHA Select Private Credit Fund (OCREDIT) are indicative of a significant capital management strategy and growth trajectory. The company's successful ramp from $50 million in initial equity commitments to a portfolio exceeding $1 billion demonstrates robust fund performance and investor confidence. The issuance of $300 million in 5-Year Senior Unsecured Notes at a fixed interest rate of 7.77% is particularly noteworthy as it aligns with the current credit market conditions where investors are seeking higher yields amidst a fluctuating interest rate environment.OCREDIT's net investment income (NII) per share increase and earnings per share (EPS) growth reflect a strong earnings quality and operational efficiency. The net unrealized appreciation signifies potential for future gains, while the increase in net asset value (NAV) per share suggests a positive trend in asset valuation. It is important to note that the ending debt-to-equity ratio of 0.79x, compared to the prior quarter's 0.78x, remains within a manageable range, indicating a balanced approach to leverage. However, investors should monitor this metric closely as excessive leverage can pose risks to financial stability.The company's investment portfolio, predominantly composed of first lien senior secured loans, highlights a conservative risk profile with a focus on capital preservation. The floating rate nature of the debt investments is a strategic advantage in a rising interest rate environment, as it allows for interest income to potentially increase in tandem with rate hikes, thereby protecting margins. Market Research Analyst The private credit market, where OCREDIT operates, has been expanding as traditional banks have become more regulated, creating opportunities for alternative lenders. OCREDIT's focus on senior private lending is strategic, tapping into a growing demand for private credit solutions among mid-sized companies. The fund's diverse investment across 22 industries suggests a well-diversified portfolio, which can mitigate industry-specific risks and provide stability in returns.The significant increase in total fair value of investments and total assets for OCREDIT highlights the fund's aggressive investment activity and asset growth. This, coupled with consistent distributions, including a special distribution, showcases the fund's ability to return capital to shareholders while still expanding its asset base. The annualized distribution yield of 9.9% is attractive, especially when considering the current low-interest-rate environment, which often leaves income-focused investors searching for higher-yielding opportunities.Investors should consider the implications of OCREDIT's growth strategy on the broader private credit and business development company (BDC) sectors. As funds like OCREDIT continue to scale, they may exert competitive pressure on yields and drive innovation in deal structuring within the private lending space. Legal Expert The Master Note Purchase Agreement for the issuance of $300 million in Series 2024A Senior Notes is a critical legal document that outlines the terms and conditions of the notes offering. The fixed interest rate of 7.77% per annum until 2029 provides investors with clarity regarding their expected income from these notes. It is essential for investors to understand the covenants and restrictions associated with these notes, as they can affect the company's operational flexibility and financial obligations.Furthermore, the classification of the notes as 'Senior Unsecured' means they are given a high priority in case of liquidation, although they are not backed by specific collateral. This positioning in the capital structure is crucial for investors to assess the risk-return profile of the notes.It is also worth noting that the private placement nature of the notes offering implies a more selective process of investor solicitation, often targeting institutional investors. This can have implications for the liquidity and marketability of the notes, as they may not be as readily tradable as publicly issued securities. 03/13/2024 - 05:35 PM NEW YORK, March 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- T.

OCREDIT is a non-exchange traded business development company (""BDC"") that expects to invest at least 80% of its total assets (net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes) in private credit investments. An investment in OCREDIT involves a high degree of risk. An investor should purchase securities of OCREDIT only if they can afford the complete loss of the investment. Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities regulator has approved or disapproved of these securities or determined if this prospectus is truthful or complete. Securities regulators have also not passed upon whether this offering can be sold in compliance with existing or future suitability or Regulation Best Interest standard to any or all purchasers. As of October 4, 2023, OCREDIT is available in 51 states and territories, excluding Arkansas, Massachusetts, and Washington. No offers or sales of OCREDIT securities may be made to residents of Arkansas, Massachusetts, and Washington. As of October 4, 2023, OCREDIT is not registered for offer or sale outside of the United States. BDCs may charge management fees, incentive fees, as well as other fees associated with servicing loans. These fees will detract from the total return. OCREDIT may in certain circumstances invest in companies experiencing distress increasing the risk of default or failure. OCREDIT is not listed on an exchange which heightens liquidity risk for an investor. OCREDIT has limited prior operating history and there is no assurance that it will achieve its investment objectives. The Company's public offering is a ""blind pool"" offering and thus investors will not have the opportunity to evaluate the Company's investments before they are made. Investors should not expect to be able to sell shares regardless of performance and should consider that they may not have access to the money invested for an extended period of time and may be unable to reduce their exposure in a market downturn. OCREDIT employs leverage, which increases the volatility of OCREDIT's investments and will magnify the potential for loss. Fixed-income securities are subject to credit risk, call risk, and interest rate risk. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall. Investments in high-yield bonds involve greater risk. International investments can be riskier than U.S. investments and subject to foreign exchange risk. OCREDIT is ""non-diversified,"" meaning it may invest a greater portion of its assets in a single company. OCREDIT's share price can be expected to fluctuate more than that of a comparable diversified fund. OCREDIT may invest in derivatives, which may be riskier or more volatile than other types of investments because they are generally more sensitive to changes in market or economic conditions. Account opening and closing fees may apply depending on the amount invested and the timing of the account closure. There may be costs associated with the investments in the account such as periodic management fees, incentive fees, loads, other expenses or brokerage commissions. Fees for optional services may also apply.

Financial Analyst The reported full-year revenues of $313.2 million, representing a 4.9% increase, are indicative of BGSF, Inc.'s capacity to grow its top line. This growth, particularly in the Property Management and Professional segments, suggests resilience in the face of economic challenges. The organic growth in Property Management revenues, at 3.3%, is slightly below the Professional segment's growth, which includes contributions from the Arroyo Consulting acquisition. The acquisition strategy appears to be paying off, adding $14.8 million in new revenues, although there is a noted decline in the existing Professional business. This could signal potential issues in core operations that may need addressing.The significant non-cash impairment charge of $22.5 million related to rebranding efforts is a one-time event that has heavily impacted net income figures. However, stakeholders should consider the long-term benefits of such a rebranding, which may enhance brand recognition and market positioning. The increase in gross profit margins by 100 basis points to 35.7% is a positive sign of improved operational efficiency or pricing power. Adjusted EBITDA's increase of 15.9% year over year is a robust indicator of the company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for one-off events, which provides a clearer picture of operational performance. Market Research Analyst The growth in revenues and adjusted EBITDA, despite the reported net loss, suggests that BGSF's market strategy and service offerings are aligning well with client needs. The company's focus on building stronger relationships with world-class ERP technologies could be a strategic move to cement its position in a niche market, which is a positive signal for investors looking for specialized service providers. However, the decline in the existing Professional business segment raises questions about the competitiveness and potential saturation in the market that BGSF operates in. The market for consulting, managed services and professional workforce solutions is highly competitive and the company's ability to differentiate itself through its service offerings and client relationships will be crucial for its continued growth. Economist Despite the macroeconomic headwinds impacting corporations throughout North America, BGSF's ability to grow its revenue and generate $20.4 million of operating cash flow is commendable. This demonstrates the company's operational resilience and financial discipline. The new credit facility closed on March 12, 2024, with a maturity date of March 12, 2028, provides BGSF with financial flexibility. The facility's structure, which includes revolving credit and term loans, suggests a strategic approach to debt management that may support future growth initiatives or provide a buffer against economic downturns. The consistent quarterly cash dividends indicate confidence in the company's cash flow generation capabilities and a commitment to shareholder returns, which can be appealing to investors seeking income-generating investments. 03/13/2024 - 07:29 PM Record Full Year Revenues of $313.2 million, up 4.9% Generated $20.4 Million of Operating Cash Flow New Credit Facility Closed March 12, 2024 PLANO, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BGSF, Inc.

To help the readers understand the Company's financial performance, the Company supplements its GAAP financial results with Adjusted EBITDA, Same Day EBITDA, Adjusted EPS, Same Day Adjusted EPS, Same Day Revenue, and Same Day Gross Profit. A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of operations, balance sheet or statement of cash flows of a company. Adjusted EBITDA, Same Day EBITDA, Adjusted EPS, Same Day Adjusted EPS, Same Day Revenue, and Same Day Gross Profit are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, net income per diluted share, operating income, revenue, gross profit, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities or measures of our liquidity. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA, Same Day EBITDA, Adjusted EPS, Same Day Adjusted EPS, Same Day Revenue, and Same Day Gross Profit are useful performance measures and are used by us to facilitate comparisons of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period-to-period and to provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than measures under GAAP can provide alone. In addition, the financial covenants in our credit agreement are based on EBITDA as defined in the credit agreement. We define “Adjusted EBITDA"" as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, transaction fees and certain non-cash expenses such as share-based compensation expense, as well as certain specific events that management does not consider in assessing our on-going operating performance. We define “Same Day EBITDA” as Adjusted EBITDA on a fifty-two week fiscal year. We define “Same Day Revenue” and “Same Day Gross Profit” as revenue and gross profit on a fifty-two week fiscal year. We define “Adjusted EPS” as diluted earnings per share eliminating amortization expense of intangible assets from acquisitions, transaction fees, and certain non-cash expenses such as impairment losses, as well as certain specific events that management does not consider in assessing our on-going operating performance, net of the respective income tax effect.

Additionally, Hallador signed a significant MOU with Hoosier Energy and WIN REMC to explore non-traditional energy sales at the Merom site, aiming to drive increased margins and support the power grid's transition to new energy sources. Positive Hallador Energy Company achieved notable financial results for full year 2023, including a net income of $44.8 million. The company's basic earnings per share stood at $1.35, showcasing strong profitability. Operating cash flow for 2023 reached $59.4 million, reflecting sound financial management. Hallador reported an adjusted EBITDA of $107 million, indicating robust operational performance. The company secured approximately $500 million in new long-term capacity and energy contracts through 2028. Hallador restructured its coal division to enhance margins and adapt to current market conditions, reducing capital expenditure and maintaining high-margin coal production. Through ATM and unsecured notes, the company raised approximately $19 million to support liquidity and strategic initiatives. The MOU signed with Hoosier Energy and WIN REMC aims to explore new energy sales opportunities at the Merom site, targeting high-density power users for increased margins and operational efficiency. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in net income and adjusted EBITDA for Hallador Energy Company represents a significant improvement in the company's profitability and operational efficiency. The restructuring of their coal division, aimed at increasing margins and adjusting to current market conditions, suggests a strategic move to optimize operations amidst volatile market conditions. The reduction in capital expenditure and employee headcount, along with the idling of high-cost surface mines, indicates a focus on cost management and operational agility.From a financial perspective, the raising of approximately $19 million through ATM and unsecured notes is a noteworthy development. It reflects an active approach to managing liquidity and signals confidence from the board members who provided the unsecured notes. However, it's essential to monitor the terms of these notes and the potential dilution effect of the ATM on existing shareholders.The secured long-term capacity and energy contracts worth nearly $500 million through 2028 provide revenue visibility and a degree of stability in cash flows. The average contracted prices for coal and power, along with the percentage of energy and capacity sold, are critical metrics for investors to assess the company's future revenue streams and pricing power in the market. Market Research Analyst The MOU with Hoosier Energy and WIN REMC could open up new revenue streams for Hallador Energy by tapping into the demand from non-traditional energy consumers like data centers and AI providers. This diversification strategy could mitigate risks associated with fluctuations in traditional energy markets. The focus on supplying reliable electricity to high-density power users aligns with broader industry trends, where energy companies are seeking partnerships with growing sectors to bolster demand for their output.Additionally, the forward-looking statements regarding the potential for increased margins and operational efficiency at the Merom site should be evaluated in light of the broader transition to renewable energy sources. While the company is positioning itself to support the power grid through this transition, investors should consider the long-term sustainability of coal as an energy source against the backdrop of increasing regulatory pressures and shifts in public sentiment towards greener alternatives. Energy Sector Analyst The energy sector is undergoing significant changes with the transition to new energy sources. Hallador Energy's strategic initiatives, including the diversification into power sales and capacity agreements, are timely as they align with the sector's evolution. The company's ability to secure substantial long-term contracts insulates it from some of the risks associated with this transition, but it's important to consider the long-term implications of a potential decline in coal demand.The detailed breakdown of contracted coal revenues and power energy contracts provides transparency into the company's future revenue projections. However, the energy sector's shift towards renewables could impact the valuation of these contracts. An understanding of the MISO accreditation and its implications for capacity revenue is essential, as it reflects the reliability and performance of the company's assets in meeting energy demands. 03/13/2024 - 05:05 PM TERRE HAUTE, Ind., March 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hallador Energy Company (NASDAQ – HNRG) reports full year 2023 net income of $44.8 million, $1.35 basic earnings per share, operating cash flow of $59.4 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $107 million, all respectively. Brent Bilsland, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Hallador had a solid year as a company. Our coal division had near record margins for the full year, the continued integration of Hallador Power shows tremendous promise for future sales of energy and capacity and our recent MOU with Hoosier Energy and WIN REMC will allow us to market our Merom site to data centers, AI providers and other high-density power users to more efficiently operate the plant and drive increased margins to what we are seeing today. While the fourth quarter presented challenges in all sectors, we believe that our recent restructuring in our coal division, agreements like the MOU and the momentum that we are seeing in forward power sales will all continue to improve the long-term outlook for the company.” Below are highlights for the full year results of 2023: We increased Net Income, Operating Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA for the Year Net income increased by approximately $27 million to $45 million for 2023. Operating Cash Flow increased by approximately $5 million to $59.4 million for 2023. Adjusted EBITDA* improved to $107 million for the year, an increase of approximately $51 million. Since January 1, 2023, We Secured Nearly $500 Million in New Long-Term Capacity and Energy Contracts We have secured approximately $225 million in new capacity deals through 2028. We have secured approximately $275 million in new energy deals through 2028. We Restructured our Coal Division to Increase Margins and Adjust to Current Market Conditions The restructuring will reduce capital expenditure at the Oaktown Mining Complex by $10 million. Maintains 4.5 million tons of annual production of our highest margin coal. Reduced employee headcount by 110. Idled highest cost surface mines. We Raised Approximately $19 Million Through ATM and Unsecured Notes to Support Liquidity ATM raised $7.3 million in December and $6.6 million in January. Raised $5 million in unsecured one-year notes from members of the Board of Directors in March 2024. Capital used to support liquidity and accelerate strategic initiatives. We Signed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Hoosier Energy and WIN REMC to Provide Opportunities for Non-Traditional Energy Sales at the Merom Site Allows us to potentially capture additional margins above our traditional wholesale energy markets. Allows us to market industrial users of power, such as data centers, AI providers and power dense manufacturers, to the Merom property.

Our method of computing Adjusted EBITDA may not be the same method used to compute similar measures reported by other companies. Management believes the non-GAAP financial measure, Adjusted EBITDA, is an important measure in analyzing our liquidity and is a key component of certain material covenants contained within our Credit Agreement, specifically a maximum leverage ratio and a debt service coverage ratio. Noncompliance with the leverage ratio or debt service coverage ratio covenants could result in our lenders requiring the Company to immediately repay all amounts borrowed.

Mesoblast Successfully Completes Placement and Accelerated Entitlement Offer,2024-03-13T23:30:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Mesoblast Limited raises A$97 million through entitlement offer and institutional placement, with Dr. Eric Rose subscribing for additional shares.","Mesoblast Successfully Completes Placement and Accelerated Entitlement Offer Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Mesoblast Limited raises A$97 million through entitlement offer and institutional placement, with Dr. Eric Rose subscribing for additional shares. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The capital raise by Mesoblast Limited through its entitlement offer and institutional placement, amounting to A$97 million, is a significant financial move for the company. This influx of capital is likely to bolster the company's balance sheet, providing the necessary funds to continue its research and development into allogeneic cellular medicines. The participation of major shareholders, including a substantial investment by Dr. Eric Rose, signals confidence in the company's trajectory. However, investors should assess the potential dilutive effect of the new shares on their holdings and consider the company's valuation post-capital raise.Furthermore, the commitment of funds by a high-profile medical professional such as Dr. Rose may also serve as a qualitative indicator of the company's potential, given his background and expertise. Yet, it is crucial for investors to evaluate whether the capital raised aligns with the company's strategic growth plans and the competitive landscape of the biotech sector. The long-term success of this capital injection will depend on Mesoblast's ability to effectively utilize the funds to achieve clinical and commercial milestones. Medical Research Analyst Mesoblast's focus on allogeneic cellular medicines for inflammatory diseases positions it within a cutting-edge segment of the biotechnology industry. The successful capital raise provides the company with an opportunity to further its clinical trials and potentially bring new therapies to market. The involvement of Dr. Eric Rose not only adds credibility to the company's endeavors but also underscores the potential impact of its research on the treatment of heart-related conditions, especially considering Dr. Rose's history with the LVAD.Investors should monitor the company's pipeline progress and regulatory interactions, particularly with entities like the FDA, as these will be critical in determining the company's ability to capitalize on its research investments. The long-term implications for Mesoblast's stock will largely hinge on the successful development and commercialization of its cellular therapies, which address a significant unmet medical need in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Market Research Analyst The biotech sector is known for its high volatility and the substantial capital required to fund R&D and navigate regulatory pathways. Mesoblast's successful capital raise indicates a robust fundraising environment and investor willingness to support biotech firms with promising pipelines. The A$97 million raised could enable Mesoblast to maintain its competitive edge in the allogeneic cellular medicine space, which is anticipated to grow due to increasing demand for innovative treatments.Analyzing the investment patterns and the confidence shown by existing shareholders, including Dr. Rose's personal investment, can offer insights into the perceived market potential of Mesoblast's technology. However, the impact on the stock will also depend on broader market trends, investor sentiment towards biotech innovation and the outcomes of Mesoblast's ongoing and future clinical trials. It is essential for stakeholders to consider these factors alongside the company's financial health and R&D progress when evaluating the potential impact of this news on the company's market position. 03/13/2024 - 07:30 PM NEW YORK, March 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mesoblast Limited (Nasdaq:MESO; ASX:MSB), global leader in allogeneic cellular medicines for inflammatory diseases, today announced it has received firm commitments to complete its pro-rata accelerated non-renounceable entitlement offer that was launched on 4 December, 2023 (Entitlement Offer). Together the entitlement offer and institutional placement raised gross proceeds of A$97 million, including A$36.7 million committed today on the same terms as the Entitlement Offer, primarily from Mesoblast’s existing major shareholders. Dr. Eric Rose, the Company’s Chief Medical Officer and a director of Mesoblast, subscribed for additional shares of A$1.5 million, subject to shareholder approval. Dr. Rose is a world-renowned heart surgeon who performed the world’s first successful heart transplant in children and was for many years Chairman of Columbia University’s Department of Surgery. Dr. Rose was the Principal Investigator of the pivotal trial resulting in FDA approval of the first implantable left ventricular assist device (LVAD) for long term support of patients with heart failure, spawning an entire new industry. About Mesoblast Mesoblast (the Company) is a world leader in developing allogeneic (off-the-shelf) cellular medicines for the treatment of severe and life-threatening inflammatory conditions. The Company has leveraged its proprietary mesenchymal lineage cell therapy technology platform to establish a broad portfolio of late-stage product candidates which respond to severe inflammation by releasing anti-inflammatory factors that counter and modulate multiple effector arms of the immune system, resulting in significant reduction of the damaging inflammatory process. Mesoblast has a strong and extensive global intellectual property portfolio with protection extending through to at least 2041 in all major markets. The Company’s proprietary manufacturing processes yield industrial-scale, cryopreserved, off-the-shelf, cellular medicines. These cell therapies, with defined pharmaceutical release criteria, are planned to be readily available to patients worldwide. Mesoblast is developing product candidates for distinct indications based on its remestemcel-L and rexlemestrocel-L allogeneic stromal cell technology platforms. Remestemcel-L is being developed for inflammatory diseases in children and adults including steroid refractory acute graft versus host disease, biologic-resistant inflammatory bowel disease, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Rexlemestrocel-L is in development for advanced chronic heart failure and chronic low back pain. Two products have been commercialized in Japan and Europe by Mesoblast’s licensees, and the Company has established commercial partnerships in Europe and China for certain Phase 3 assets. Mesoblast has locations in Australia, the United States and Singapore and is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (MSB) and on the Nasdaq (MESO).

Negative Decline in TCE rates for Q4 and full year 2023. Decrease in Adjusted EBITDA margin from 21.0% to 14.9% for Q4 compared to the prior year period. Increase in net debt to trailing twelve-month adjusted EBITDA ratio from 1.25x to 2.12x. Total Adjusted EBITDA margin declined from 20.1% in 2022 to 16.0% in 2023 for the full year. Full year TCE rates declined by 35% on a year-over-year basis in 2023. Financial Analyst The reported net income and adjusted net income for Pangaea Logistics Solutions Ltd. reflect a mixed financial performance. A net income of $1.1 million for Q4 2023 and $26.3 million for the full year, alongside adjusted figures of $7.4 million and $31.4 million respectively, indicate a company that is managing to remain profitable despite challenging market conditions. The Time Charter Equivalent (TCE) rates, a key metric in the shipping industry representing the average daily revenue performance of a vessel, have declined year-over-year but still outperform the industry average indices by a significant margin. This outperformance can be attributed to the company's specialized fleet and long-term contracts, which provide a buffer against market volatility.The Adjusted EBITDA figures are crucial for understanding the company's operational efficiency and ability to generate profit from its core business operations. The year-over-year decrease in Adjusted EBITDA and margin reflects the impact of lower market rates and increased shipping days, which, while increasing revenue potential, also add to operational costs. The reported ratio of net debt to trailing twelve-month Adjusted EBITDA has increased, indicating a higher debt load relative to earnings, which could be a concern for long-term financial stability.Investors may find the strategic updates encouraging, as the company's focus on fleet utilization, strategic expansions and capital returns hint at a management team that is proactive in navigating a dynamic market. The sale of non-core assets and investment in fleet renewal are positive signs of strategic asset management that can lead to improved TCE rates and operational efficiency in the long run. Market Research Analyst The maritime logistics sector is sensitive to global trade dynamics and Pangaea's performance offers insights into broader market trends. The company's increased shipping days and successful outperformance against benchmark indices suggest a robust demand for specialized shipping services, despite the overall decline in TCE rates. The company's ability to secure premium rates through its cargo-centric strategy and specialized fleet, such as ice-class vessels, is a competitive advantage that helps mitigate the risk of fluctuating market rates.However, the decline in Adjusted EBITDA margin and the impact of elevated Panama Canal transit fees due to drought conditions are indicative of external factors that can affect operational costs. The strategic focus on expanding port terminal operations and joint operations partnerships in the U.S. Gulf Coast could lead to diversification of revenue streams and potentially higher margins due to integrated shipping and logistics services.The global supply chain disruptions and the constrained supply of newer, compliant fleet tonnage present both challenges and opportunities. Pangaea's approach to capitalizing on market inefficiencies and the limited order book for new dry bulk vessels suggests a favorable outlook for the company's specialized services, particularly if the demand for dry bulk shipping remains robust as anticipated. Economist The financial results of Pangaea Logistics Solutions Ltd. offer a microcosmic view of the economic forces at play in the maritime logistics industry. The company's performance, particularly the ratio of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA, serves as an indicator of leverage and financial health in a capital-intensive industry. The increase in this ratio could signal a cautious note for investors about the company's growing leverage amidst uncertain economic conditions.Furthermore, the company's strategic investments and divestments are a response to broader economic trends, such as the need for fleet modernization to comply with environmental regulations and the strategic positioning in niche markets like Arctic trade routes. These moves are reflective of a company adapting to the evolving economic landscape, where efficiency, compliance and specialization are becoming increasingly important.The company's focus on delivering shareholder value through dividends and capital returns, despite the pressures of a challenging market, reflects a balanced approach to growth and profitability. This is particularly relevant in the context of the ongoing geopolitical trade disruptions, which have the potential to create both obstacles and opportunities for companies like Pangaea that are agile enough to navigate these changes. 03/13/2024 - 05:12 PM NEWPORT, R.I., March 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Pangaea Logistics Solutions Ltd.

The TCE earned was $17,685 per day for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to an average of $20,023 per day for the same period in 2022. During the fourth quarter 2023, the Company's average TCE rate exceeded the benchmark average Baltic Panamax and Supramax indices by approximately 27%, supported by Pangaea's long-term contracts of affreightment (""COAs""), specialized fleet, and cargo-focused strategy. Total Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 27% to $19.7 million in the fourth quarter due to fewer total shipping days and lower market rates, partially offset by the benefit of more owned ship days from a larger owned fleet and a decline in charter-hire expenses. Total Adjusted EBITDA margin was 14.9% during the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to 21.0% during the prior year period. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA margin reflects the 11% year-over-year increase in shipping days, coupled with the 12% year-over-year decrease in TCE rate, partially offset by a 4% year-over-year decline in vessel operating expenses per day, net of technical management fees. Fourth quarter 2024 expenses also reflect approximately $1.0 million impact from elevated Panama Canal transit fees caused by drought conditions in portions of Central and South America. For the full year ended December 31, 2023, Pangaea reported non-GAAP adjusted net income of $31.4 million or $0.69 per diluted share, on total revenue of $499.3 million. Total Adjusted EBITDA was $79.7 million for the full year 2023 and total Adjusted EBITDA margin was 16.0%, compared to 20.1% for the full year 2022. Full year TCE rates declined 35% on a year-over-year basis in 2023 , while total shipping days decreased 5.7% to 16,711 when compared to 2022. The Company's average TCE rate during 2023 exceeded the benchmark average Baltic Panamax and Supramax indices by approximately 39%, supported by Pangaea's specialized fleet of ice-class vessels, long-term COAs, and cargo-focused strategies. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $99.0 million in cash and equivalents. Total debt, including lease finance obligations was $264 million at year-end 2023. At the end of the fourth quarter 2023, the ratio of net debt to trailing twelve-month adjusted EBITDA was 2.12x, versus 1.25x in the prior-year period. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company repaid $3.3 million of long-term debt, $8.0 million of finance leases, and paid $4.5 million of cash dividends. As previously announced on Feb 15, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per common share, to be paid on March 15, 2024, to all shareholders of record as of March 1, 2024. MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY ""We continued to execute on our premium-rate, cargo-centric strategy throughout the year, culminating in a strong fourth quarter operating performance,"" stated Mark Filanowski, Chief Executive Officer of Pangaea Logistics Solutions. ""While the fourth quarter is generally a slower period for Pangaea as we complete the peak Arctic trade season, ongoing geopolitical trade disruptions have led to increased demand for our solutions outside of our traditional trade routes, contributing to increased shipping days in the period compared to the prior year."" ""During the fourth quarter and full-year 2023, our TCE rate exceeded the benchmark BSI Index by nearly 27% and 39%, respectively,"" continued Filanowski. ""This performance is demonstrates our ability to drive relative out performance versus the broader industry even in periods of pronounced rate volatility. We believe we are the industry leader in this regard. During 2023, we also celebrated our 27th year of service to our loyal customer base and we rebranded our operating companies, Phoenix Bulk and Nordic Bulk, with proud Pangaea Logistics names."" ""Entering 2024, trade disruptions are causing persistent market inefficiencies driving a higher seasonal freight rate environment,"" continued Filanowski. ""Through today, we have performed 3,513 shipping days generating a TCE of $17,430/day, representing a strong seasonal start to the new year."" ""While dry bulk demand conditions remain robust, the global supply of newer, compliant fleet tonnage remains constrained, with the order book for new dry bulk vessels continuing to sit well below historical levels,"" continued Filanowski. ""With a limited volume of newbuild vessels scheduled to enter service over the next several years, the existing fleet of vessels in operation are expected to stay in high demand, a dynamic supportive of a strengthening rate environment."" ""In a strengthening dry-bulk market, Pangaea will continue to focus on driving superior returns on capital deployed,"" continued Filanowski. ""In 2023, we invested in the strategic expansion of our logistics capabilities through the acquisition of new port and terminal operations, deployed more than $34 million in our fleet renewal strategy, reduced our long-term debt by $36 million, and returned more than $18 million of capital to shareholders through our quarterly cash dividend. In 2024, we intend to prioritize growth in our fleet and logistics capabilities, while we continue to maintain a stable return of capital program, consistent with our long-term focus on shareholder value creation."" STRATEGIC UPDATE Pangaea remains committed to developing a leading dry bulk logistics and transportation services company of scale, providing its customers with specialized shipping and supply chain and logistics offerings in commodity and niche markets, which drive premium returns measured in time charter equivalent per day. Leverage integrated shipping and logistics model. In addition to operating one of the largest high ice class dry bulk fleet of Panamax and post-Panamax vessels globally, Pangaea also performs stevedoring services, together with port and terminal operations capabilities. Following the acquisition of marine port terminal operations in Port Everglades/Ft. Lauderdale, Port of Palm Beach, Florida, and Port of Baltimore, Maryland in June 2023, the company has been actively working to expand its onshore relationships with new and existing customers. During 2024, the Company intends to opportunistically expand its marine port terminal operations footprint across the U.S Gulf Coast through strategic joint operations partnerships. Continue to drive strong fleet utilization. In the fourth quarter, Pangaea's 24 owned vessels were fully utilized and supplemented with an average of 20 chartered-in vessels to support cargo and COA commitments. While the Company benefited from continued artic trade activity demand early in the quarter, global trade disruptions bolstered demand, resulting in an 11% increase in shipping days. Going forward, the Company will continue to opportunistically evaluate the composition of its fleet in order to meet the growing needs of new and existing customers. Continue to upgrade fleet, while divesting older, non-core assets. In November 2023, the Company completed the sale of the 2006-built Supramax Bulk Trident for $9.8 million. Looking ahead, the Company intends to opportunistically manage its fleet with the purpose of maximizing TCE rates, while continuing to support client requirements on an on-demand basis.

As used herein, ""GAAP"" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. To supplement our consolidated financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, this earnings release discusses non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP net revenue, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP Adjusted EPS. These are considered non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Rule 101 of Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's historical or future performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The presentation of this non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. We use non-GAAP financial measures for internal financial and operational decision making purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons of the performance and results of operations of our core business. Our management believes that non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the performance of our core business by excluding charges that are not incurred in the normal course of business. Non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal planning and comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity. We believe certain non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors as they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the performance and operational results of our core business. Gross Profit. Gross profit represents total revenue less net transportation and service revenue and less vessel depreciation and amortization. Net transportation and service revenue. Net transportation and service revenue represents total revenue less the total direct costs of transportation and services, which includes charter hire, voyage and vessel operating expenses. Net transportation and service revenue is included because it is used by management and certain investors to measure performance by comparison to other logistic service providers. Net transportation and service revenue is not an item recognized by the generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, or any other indicator of a company's operating performance required by U.S. GAAP. Pangaea's definition of net transportation and service revenue used here may not be comparable to an operating measure used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income (or loss), determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, loss on sale and leaseback of vessels, share-based compensation and other non-operating income and/or expense, if any. Earnings per share represents net income divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Adjusted earnings per share represents net income attributable to Pangaea Logistics Solutions Ltd. plus, when applicable, loss on sale of vessel, loss on sale and leaseback of vessel, loss on impairment of vessel, unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments, and certain non-recurring charges, divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock. There are limitations related to the use of net revenue versus income from operations, adjusted EBITDA versus income from operations, and adjusted EPS versus EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP. In particular, Pangaea's definition of adjusted EBITDA used here are not comparable to EBITDA. The table set forth above provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures presented to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ZL-1310 shows high affinity for DLL3 and promising therapeutic potential, leading to a Phase 1 clinical trial initiation in January 2024. Positive Zai Lab Limited presents preclinical findings on ZL-1310 at ELCC 2024. ZL-1310 is an ADC targeting DLL3, a therapeutic target in small cell lung cancer. The preclinical data highlights ZL-1310's high affinity for DLL3 and therapeutic potential. Zai Lab initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial for ZL-1310 in January 2024. Negative None. Oncology Doctor From a clinical perspective, the development of ZL-1310 as an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting DLL3 is significant. DLL3 expression in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) has been established as a therapeutic target, given its role in tumor cell proliferation and survival. The mechanism involving high-affinity binding and payload delivery resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis is a sophisticated approach to cancer treatment. The preclinical efficacy demonstrated in both CDX and PDX models suggests a promising therapeutic index, especially for patients with relapsed and refractory SCLC post-platinum-based therapy, a group with limited treatment options. Medical Research Analyst Analyzing the preclinical data of ZL-1310, it's clear that the collaboration with MediLink Therapeutics and the utilization of their TMALIN® platform could represent a significant advancement in ADC technology. The initiation of a Phase 1 clinical trial indicates confidence in the preclinical findings and a commitment to advancing oncology therapeutics. The ability of ZL-1310 to induce a bystander effect, where the payload can affect neighboring tumor cells not expressing DLL3, could enhance its therapeutic potential. This multifaceted mechanism of action, if validated in clinical trials, could set a new precedent for ADCs in solid tumors. Biotech Market Analyst The strategic partnership between Zai Lab and MediLink Therapeutics, leading to the development of ZL-1310, underscores the importance of collaborative innovation in the biotech industry. The licensing agreement provides Zai Lab with a potentially valuable asset in the competitive oncology market, particularly for SCLC where treatment advancements are urgently needed. The market will be closely monitoring the Phase 1 trial's progress, as positive outcomes could enhance Zai Lab's valuation and market position. The upcoming presentation at ELCC 2024 will likely attract investor attention, as it provides a platform for Zai Lab to showcase their R&D capabilities and the potential of ZL-1310 to address a high unmet medical need. 03/13/2024 - 07:05 PM ZL-1310 is an innovative ADC targeting DLL3, a promising therapeutic target in small cell lung cancer and other DLL3+ solid tumors Data will be shared in a poster presentation at the European Lung Cancer Congress 2024 (ELCC 2024) SHANGHAI & CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Zai Lab Limited (NASDAQ: ZLAB; HKEX: 9688) today announced that it will present findings from preclinical studies highlighting the therapeutic potential of ZL-1310, the company’s global next-generation antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) program. The preclinical profile of ZL-1310 will be the focus of a poster presentation at the European Lung Cancer Congress 2024 (ELCC 2024), scheduled for March 20-23, 2024 in Prague, Czech Republic. ZL-1310 is a novel and promising ADC within the Zai Lab global oncology R&D pipeline, targeting the Delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3), a validated therapeutic target in the treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). DLL3, which is expressed on the cell surface of most SCLC, plays a pivotal role in promoting SCLC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. “ZL-1310 has high affinity for the target, DLL3, and releases its payload both intracellularly and in the tumor microenvironment, also allowing for bystander effect of its camptothecin-derived payload,” said Rafael G. Amado, M.D., president, head of Global Oncology Research and Development, Zai Lab. “The encouraging preclinical data we will present at ELCC 2024 formed the basis for the ZL-1310 Phase 1 clinical trial that we initiated in January of this year.” Data from the preclinical IND-enabling studies which will be shared at ELCC 2024 indicate that ZL-1310 exhibits a strong and specific binding to DLL3 on the cell surface, leading to internalization, cell cycle arrest and the induction of apoptosis in tumor cells. In-vivo, ZL-1310 effectively suppressed the growth of established human tumors in a dose-dependent manner in both cancer cell-derived (CDX) and SCLC patient sample-derived (PDX) xenograft models. ZL-1310 was discovered with MediLink Therapeutics’ proprietary TMALIN® platform, a next-generation ADC platform designed to leverage the tumor microenvironment to overcome the challenges with current ADC drugs. Zai Lab entered a partnership and exclusive worldwide license agreement with MediLink in April 2023. Subsequently, in January 2024, Zai Lab initiated a global Phase 1 study of ZL-1310 in patients with relapsed and refractory SCLC who have progressed after platinum-based treatment. Details regarding the poster presentation at ELCC 2024 are as follows: Title: Development and characterization of a novel DLL3-targeting antibody drug conjugate (ADC) for the treatment of solid tumors Presenter: Linda N Liu, Senior Vice President, Biologics Discovery, Zai Lab Date/Time: Friday, March 22, 2024, 12:00 PM - 12:45 PM CET Location: Prague Congress Centre, Congress Hall Foyer About Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) and Neuroendocrine Tumors SCLC and neuroendocrine tumors are diseases with significant unmet medical needs globally.

(TSX: SLS; OTCQB: SLSSF) (“Solaris” or the “Company”) is issuing the following news release as a result of a continuous disclosure review by the British Columbia Securities Commission. The Company has disclosed in its technical report with an effective date of April 1, 2022, certain Company press releases, and in its corporate presentation both a mineral resource estimate for the greater Warintza project and a mineral resource estimate for an indicative starter pit at the Warintza project. CIM Best Practices state that there can only be one mineral resource on a project. The Company is therefore required to select one of these mineral resource estimates as its mineral resource estimate for the Warintza project. On this basis, the Company is retracting its disclosure of a mineral resource estimate for its indicative starter pit and confirms its mineral resource estimate at the Warintza Project is the unchanged mineral resource estimate for the greater Warintza project, with Indicated mineral resources of 579 million tonnes (“Mt”) at 0.59% copper equivalent (“CuEq”) and Inferred mineral resources of 887 Mt at 0.47% CuEq above a 0.3% CuEq cut-off grade at an effective date of April 1, 2022 (the “MRE”). Copper equivalent assumes recoveries of 90% Cu, 85% Mo, and 70% Au based on preliminary metallurgical testwork, and metal prices of US$3.50/lb Cu, US$15.00/lb Mo, and US$1,500/oz Au. The CuEq formula used is: CuEq (%) = Cu (%) + 4.0476 × Mo (%) + 0.487 × Au (g/t). The Company will file an amended technical report as soon as practicable with disclosure relating to the indicative starter pit removed from such disclosure. The Company has disclosed in its corporate presentation historical district estimates, historical estimates at adjacent properties and potential future results for the property. This disclosure is restricted as it is not categorized as an inferred mineral resource, an indicated mineral resource, a measured mineral resource, a probable mineral reserve, or a proven mineral reserve. The Company has also made certain disclosure in its corporate presentation regarding potential economic results for the property and consensus analyst estimates for the MRE. Disclosure of gross values of a mineral resource estimate is restricted. The Company is retracting the foregoing disclosure noted in this paragraph and confirms it has not completed an economic assessment at the project. The Company has disclosed in its corporate presentation information regarding adjacent and regional properties. This could be misleading if readers infer that the Company will achieve similar results at its own property. The Company would like to clarify that readers should not infer that the Company will obtain similar results at its own property. Qualified Person The MRE was prepared and the scientific and technical information in this news release related to the MRE was approved by Independent Qualified Person, Mario E. Rossi, FAusIMM, SME, IAMG, Principal Geostatistician of Geosystems International Inc (“GSI”). Mr. Rossi is a qualified person pursuant to NI 43-101 and is independent of Solaris under Section 1.5 of NI 43-101. Mr. Rossi has over 30 years of experience in mining and geostatistics, mineral resource and reserves estimation, audits and reviews in over 100 mining projects at various stages of development and operation. GSI is an independent, international mining consulting practice offering services specializing in porphyry deposits from exploration through feasibility, mine planning, and production. Resource Estimation Methodology and Parameters Indicated mineral resources were defined where the nominal drill hole spacing is 120m. The classification reflects not only the drill spacing, but the confidence level in the continuity of the grade and the geometry of the deposit. Inferred mineral resources were defined by blocks which were estimated with less stringent requirements within search ellipses defined for each domain to a maximum distance of 350m. Resources include grade capping and internal dilution. Grade was interpolated by ordinary kriging populating a block model with block dimensions of 25m x 25m x 15m. The Indicated and Inferred mineral resources are classified in a manner that is consistent with the May 10, 2014 CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. In Mr. Rossi’s opinion, there are currently no relevant factors or legal, political, environmental, or other risks that could materially affect the potential development of the mineral resources. Quality Control & Quality Assurance Sample assay results have been independently monitored through a quality control/quality assurance (“QA/QC”) program that includes the insertion of blind certified reference materials (standards), blanks and field duplicate samples. Logging and sampling are completed at a secured Company facility located in Quito, Ecuador. Drill core is cut in half on site and samples are securely transported to ALS Labs in Quito. Sample pulps are sent to ALS Labs in Lima, Peru and Vancouver, Canada for analysis. Total copper and molybdenum contents are determined by four-acid digestion with AAS finish. Gold is determined by fire assay of a 30-gram charge. In addition, selected pulp check samples are sent to Bureau Veritas lab in Lima, Peru. Both ALS Labs and Bureau Veritas lab are independent of Solaris. Solaris is not aware of any drilling, sampling, recovery or other factors that could materially affect the accuracy or reliability of the data referred to herein. Mr. Rossi verified the data disclosed, including sampling, analytical, and test data underlying the information included in this news release for which such qualified person is responsible, by personally inspecting the drill core used in the disclosure and performing a number of checks to confirm the accuracy of such data. In addition, Mr. Rossi reviewed the QA/QC reports from the Company’s drill programs and noted that there were no issues that arose which would affect confidence with the assay data. Mr. Rossi considers the sampling method appropriate for the deposit type, adequate security and QA/QC measures were maintained, and samples are representative of the existing mineralization.

Scrutiny of the Cooperation Agreement with Elliott and legal maneuvers affecting shareholder value. Expensive and distracting litigation surrounding the Company's actions and decisions. Need for a more diverse Board with depth of tower operating and public-company CEO experience. Financial Analyst The open letter from Ted B. Miller and Boots Capital Management to the Crown Castle Board of Directors indicates a significant push towards strategic changes within the company, specifically targeting the sale of the fiber business and a restructuring of leadership to enhance operational excellence. This initiative, if executed, could potentially lead to a rerating of Crown Castle's stock and impact its market valuation. The advocacy for new board members with extensive tower industry experience suggests a strategic pivot that could streamline the company's focus on its core tower operations.From a financial perspective, the sale of the fiber business could unlock capital to be reinvested in core competencies or returned to shareholders. However, the success of this divestiture will depend on the valuation of the fiber assets and market conditions at the time of sale. Shareholders might experience short-term volatility as the market reacts to these proposed changes and the ongoing litigation with Elliott. Long-term implications include the potential for improved operational efficiency and shareholder value, but this hinges on the effectiveness of the new leadership and their strategic decisions. Market Research Analyst The telecom infrastructure industry, particularly tower operations, is highly competitive and requires specialized expertise. Miller's push for a board with deep industry knowledge aligns with the need for strategic decision-making in a rapidly evolving market. The emphasis on operational excellence could resonate with investors who are looking for companies with strong and focused management teams. Furthermore, the outcome of the litigation with Elliott and the subsequent actions taken by the board could signal to the market the company's commitment to governance and shareholder interests.It is also important to consider the broader industry trend of consolidation and specialization within telecom infrastructure providers. If Crown Castle successfully repositions itself as a 'premier pure-play tower company,' it could benefit from increased investor interest in a sector that is critical for the deployment of 5G technology and beyond. However, this transition must be managed carefully to avoid disruption to current operations and preserve customer relationships. Legal Expert The Delaware Vice Chancellor's comments and the ongoing litigation underscore the legal complexities involved in shareholder activism and corporate governance disputes. The court's scrutiny of the Cooperation Agreement and the requirement for advance notice to Miller in the event of significant corporate actions, such as hiring a new CEO or selling the fiber unit, highlight the importance of transparency and due process in corporate decision-making.For stakeholders, the legal proceedings could serve as a catalyst for change or a deterrent, depending on the outcome. While the court's involvement might expedite a resolution, it also adds an element of uncertainty that can affect investor sentiment. The litigation's resolution will be critical in setting a precedent for how Crown Castle addresses shareholder concerns and navigates complex governance issues in the future. 03/13/2024 - 06:13 PM Provides Detailed Operating Plan to Restore Operational Excellence, Bolster Leadership with Experienced Tower Professionals, Maximize Value of the Company's Fiber Business to Position Crown Castle as Premier Pure-Play Tower Company Believes Crown Castle Can be Worth at Least $150 in the Next 18 Months if Board Takes Immediate Action to Restore Leadership and Prevent Further Erosion of Shareholder Value HOUSTON, March 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Ted B. Miller, co-founder of Crown Castle Inc., (NYSE: CCI) (""Crown Castle"" or the ""Company"") and his investment vehicle Boots Capital Management, LLC (""Boots Capital"") today issued the following open letter to the Crown Castle Board of Directors (the ""Board""), the Company's employees, and its shareholders: This is a crucial moment for Crown Castle, its shareholders and employees. It's why we have recommended a slate of four directors who we believe will make a valuable difference with their world class experience, skills and leadership. While the Board has undergone significant change in recent years, this turnover has still left it lacking directors who have the depth of tower operating and public-company CEO experience essential to drive the Company forward. A need for comprehensive leadership change was also put forth by Elliott Investment Management L.P. (""Elliott"") in its November 27, 2023 letter to the Board. At long last, Crown Castle is, after prodding from Elliott, studying the fate of its fiber business. Bankers and lawyers have been hired to do their typical work. That work together with a detailed plan for a fiber sale and a rerating of Crown Castle stock has been completed by Boots and offered to the Company without response. But in our view the work does not stop there. Crown Castle is in dire need of a top-to-bottom reboot with trusted, long-term leadership. The Company needs a concrete plan for the fiber sale, and then an operational revival informed by people who live and breathe towers. We have devoted seven months to a vetted and detailed plan that we believe will create lasting value through a commitment to operational excellence. We shared this detailed plan with the Board during a 90-minute meeting in January. Not surprisingly – since only one member of the Board has any experience as an executive of a tower business – there were a very limited number of questions raised, even then primarily asked by advisors. Meanwhile, many shareholders have responded to our approach and nominees with the response: ""Why wouldn't Crown Castle do this?"" Our nominees provide unrivaled tower-industry experience and expertise and offer a critical operational complement to the academic, legal, telecom-services and asset-management background of the current Board. As a large shareholder, we expect the Board to have a laser focus on building shareholder value, rather than be involved in ""clever"" legal maneuvers such as the Cooperation Agreement with Elliott, which was hastily rewritten after we challenged it in court. That agreement is even under more scrutiny, after the Delaware Vice Chancellor hearing our case rejected a Company effort to delay the hearing of the case, saying last week that ""there are colorable claims"" to the way the Cooperation Agreement was struck. The court also said that the Company should give me advance notice to object should it hire a new CEO or sell the fiber unit. The court's order should be a sign to all involved in this expensive and distracting litigation: That enough is enough. It's time to stop being adversaries and work together to improve the Company and all shareholder prospects, as we've intended all along. To be clear: this is not ""a trade"" for me. I co-founded Crown Castle. I care deeply about the long-term success of the Company. And I am here for the long-term. With our plan, it's time to restore Crown Castle to its prominence as a pure-play tower company, and reestablish it as one of the most strategically important American companies. Outlined below are details about what our four highly qualified nominees intend to do and why our multi-pronged operating plan to improve Crown Castle is value enhancing. 1) Creating Value From the Fiber Sale Based on our analysis, since the decision was made to invest in fiber, we believe the unit has required $22 billion of capital and continues to consume over a billion in capital expenditures each year – 2024 management guidance is $1.4 billion alone. The Board has announced that it is studying the possible sale of the fiber segment, and we also believe that the Board is weighing whether to sell the enterprise fiber business while retaining the small cells. We have spent seven months modeling every possible structure for a sale of fiber from an operational, financial and tax perspective. While the particulars of any transaction must be evaluated on their own merit, our work has given us a very clear point-of-view: there is much more value to be created by selling an estimated 75% interest in the entire fiber/small-cell portfolio, as it resets Crown Castle as a more capital-efficient tower operator. There is a role for small cells in our industry, but our modeling revealed Crown Castle would earn an underwhelming return on its capital on the current fiber/small cells business through at least 2050. A sale of the fiber business is essential for our intended value-creating path as a pure play tower company, with, in our view, a multiple of at least 25 times EBITDA compared to 18 times today. Moreover, if the Company can conclude a fiber sale in 2024, we believe more than $1 billion can be saved in tax efficiencies. The Board nonetheless has ignored our hundreds of pages of thorough analysis, which could be leveraged by its advisors instead of recreating the wheel, and elected not to work with us to evaluate the details of the $1 billion in potential value that could be saved in tax efficiencies. When it comes to executing the fiber sale, time is literally money. And this Board is burning both. We believe our carefully vetted approach creates the most value and best preserves a healthy, sustainable dividend. 2) Maintaining a Healthy, Sustainable Dividend The financials show that Crown Castle cannot support its current dividend trajectory while maintaining the small-cell buildout pace. In the last three years, Crown Castle has funded the dividend by incurring debt – an approach that we do not believe is sustainable. We have a long-term plan – not a short-term trading strategy – to generate sustainable performance for all shareholders. Our approach will drive meaningful operational improvements to enhance margins, as outlined in our unredacted board presentation, which we released yesterday. Our plan protects the underlying health of the dividend and the absolute dividend amount itself. Specifically, our plan offers the Company optionality to pay a $4.62 dividend solely out of cash flow (as outlined in our presentation) or incur an estimated $1.3b of debt in total between now and 2029 and sustain the dividend at its current $6.26 level. This creates soundness and flexibility around the dividend, about which we will continue to take soundings from the shareholder base. Either way, we believe our plan would materially improve Crown Castle's cash flow dynamics. Our approach creates the most value and best preserves a healthy, sustainable dividend. With the fiber sale, we estimate this extra value to be an additional $40+ per share for Crown Castle shareholders. 3) Restoring Operational Excellence We have heard the question asked: Why do the shareholders need our slate if the Board has been recently reconstituted? Start with a simple number. Crown Castle has a 12-person Board, yet only one of its members includes a tower business in their resume. The Board's sum of towers-operating experience from one board member is just seven years. And only one current director has been a public company CEO – of a bank. This is a $75 billion enterprise with virtually no senior leadership experience running either public or tower companies. Our director candidates have over 50 combined years of direct and unrivaled leadership in the towers space and have created billions of dollars of value for investors. Three of us were at the founding of the industry itself, and have remained involved for the 30 years since. That sounds like exactly what Elliott had in mind in its December letter to the Board: ""How much more value destruction will this Board permit before finally taking action and changing the leadership of Crown Castle?"" Yet, over the past several years, much of Crown Castle's executive management team has stepped down, including its former CEO, CFO, and EVP/COO of towers. This Company must urgently attract and retain leaders with the experience, vision and confidence to execute the operational changes and tower-focused innovation necessary for a better future. This need is all the more acute because of a brain drain that has persisted at towers since the fiber investments began. We believe this pattern of departures, coupled with the fact that the Board had no succession plan – a primary obligation of any board – and is still in the process of conducting its CEO search, reflects a lack of leadership and operational capability at the management level as well as the failure of the Board's overall strategic initiatives. Not all of Crown Castle's needed changes will be easy. Transformation must start from the top – from Board leadership. And that Board requires leaders with credibility, operational expertise, and a strong vision for the future at a difficult moment like this. Crown Castle employees want to feel like they're understood, and customers want to know they're being listened to. As founder and a substantial shareholder, I have a special perch from which to drive a cultural and operational reawakening, yet the Board continues to refuse to meaningfully engage with us or our value enhancing proposal. We will keep fighting for our shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers and lenders, and for the future Crown Castle deserves.

The company faces challenges with lower financial results due to external factors like a strengthened Mexican Peso and lower metal prices. Despite this, the company maintains a cash balance of $6.3 million with no debt and working capital of $15.2 million. The completion of the Back Forty Optimization Study shows promising economic returns, while ongoing exploration efforts aim to enhance future mine plans and resources. The company's focus remains on maximizing shareholder value through strategic alternatives, including a potential sale or merger. Positive None. Negative Lower financial results than planned due to external factors like a strengthened Mexican Peso and lower metal prices. Cash balance decreased by $17.4 million from the previous year, primarily driven by cash outflows for capital investments and operating activities. Working capital decreased by 29% from the previous year, mainly due to the decline in cash balance. Total cash costs and all-in sustaining costs per gold equivalent ounce were $1,250 and $1,630, respectively. The company suspended future quarterly dividends to focus on exploration and resource development. Formal review process initiated to evaluate strategic alternatives for maximizing shareholder value, including a potential sale or merger of the company. Financial Analyst Gold Resource Corporation's announcement of its full-year operational results and corporate update presents several key financial metrics that are crucial for evaluating the company's performance and future prospects. The reported cash balance of $6.3 million at the end of 2023, alongside a working capital of $15.2 million, are indicators of the company's liquidity and short-term financial health. A significant decrease from the previous year's figures could indicate cash flow challenges or large capital expenditures. The total cash cost after co-product credits of $1,250 per gold equivalent ounce is a vital measure of production efficiency, directly impacting profitability. The net loss of $16.0 million and operating cash outflow of $5.2 million are concerning, as they suggest the company is not currently generating profit from its operations.The suspension of future quarterly dividends reflects a strategic shift to preserve capital and focus on exploration and development, which could be seen as a move to strengthen long-term value at the expense of short-term shareholder returns. The initiation of a formal review process to evaluate strategic alternatives, including a potential sale or merger, is a signal that the company is actively seeking ways to enhance shareholder value, which could lead to significant stock market movement depending on the outcome of this review. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the operational results and strategic decisions of Gold Resource Corporation are likely to influence investor sentiment. The production and sale of 18,534 ounces of gold and 1,036,229 ounces of silver, along with other metals like zinc, copper and lead, show the company's diverse commodity exposure, which can affect its resilience to metal price volatility. The lower metal prices for co-product metals and external factors such as the strengthened Mexican Peso and increased local power costs have negatively impacted the financial results, which is critical information for investors considering the company's exposure to commodity prices and exchange rate risks.The Back Forty Optimization Study results, indicating an After-Tax NPV6% of $214 million with a 25.7% IRR and a 2.5-year payback, are promising for the project's future profitability and could be a catalyst for future investment. However, the environmental considerations and the success of the permitting process will be crucial for the project's advancement and are factors that environmentally-conscious investors will monitor closely. Mining Industry Analyst Analyzing the operational specifics, the Don David Gold Mine has achieved a lost time injury frequency rate of 0.96 per million hours, substantially below the industry benchmark, indicating a strong safety culture that could lead to fewer operational disruptions. The discovery of the Gloria vein system and the successful testing of northern extensions of existing veins signal potential for resource expansion, which is critical for the mine's long-term sustainability and could positively impact the stock valuation if these explorations translate into increased reserves.The decrease in royalty fee from 5% to 3% for certain mining claims is a positive development that will reduce operational costs. However, the company's 2024 guidance with projected production costs and capital investments suggests an anticipation of increased spending, which could pressure the company's financials if not offset by higher metal prices or production efficiencies. 03/13/2024 - 04:59 PM DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Gold Resource Corporation (NYSE American: GORO) (the “Company”) is pleased to announce its full-year operational results from its Don David Gold Mine (“DDGM”) near Oaxaca, Mexico, and a corporate update on its other activities. 2023 Highlights include: Produced and sold 18,534 ounces of gold and 1,036,229 ounces of silver Produced and sold 10,954 tonnes of zinc, 904 tonnes of copper, and 3,681 tonnes of lead Total cash cost after co-product credits for the full year was $1,250 per gold equivalent ounce Cash balance of $6.3 million with no debt and working capital of $15.2 million at December 31, 2023 Completed Back Forty Optimization Study that indicates an After-Tax of $214 million NPV6% with a 25.7% IRR and a 2.5 year payback “Our operational results for the final quarter of 2023 were in line with our mine plan and guidance even though our financial results were lower than planned,” stated Allen Palmiere, President and CEO for the Company. “Factors that are out of our control affected our bottom line, including a strengthened Mexican Peso to the US dollar, increased local power costs, and lower metal prices for our co-product metals of copper, lead, and zinc. We continue to be committed to the identification and implementation of opportunities that will reduce costs and increase efficiencies to offset these factors as we move forward. Our exploration drilling program at DDGM yielded encouraging drill results from our underground exploration program and will continue with the goal of increasing the average grade of our 2024 mine plan and life of mine resources. We also completed the optimization work for the Back Forty project and filed an inaugural S-K 1300 that resulted in an improved project valuation and increased economic returns, while reducing environment impacts.” Corporate and Financial: The Company closed the year with a $6.3 million cash balance as at December 31, 2023. The decrease of $17.4 million from December 31, 2022 is attributable to a cash outflow of $12.5 million for capital investments and a cash outflow of $5.2 million from operating activities for 2023, which included $7.8 million of income tax payments for the tax years 2022 and 2023, exploration investment of $4.2 million at the DDGM, and $1.6 million in spending on the Back Forty Project optimization work, offset by a $0.2 million increase in the value of cash due to the strengthening of the peso. Working capital at December 31, 2023, was $15.2 million, a 29% decrease from the December 31, 2022, working capital of $21.4 million. The decrease is primarily driven by the decline in cash balance discussed above. DDGM total cash costs (after co-product credits) and total all-in sustaining cost per gold equivalent (“AuEq”)1 ounce sold were $1,250 and $1,630, respectively. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Measures below for a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to applicable GAAP measures. The Company’s At-The-Market Offering Agreement with H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC (the “Agent”), which was entered into in November 2019 (the “ATM Agreement”), pursuant to which the Agent agreed to act as the Company’s sales agent with respect to the offer and sale from time to time of the Company’s common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $75.0 million, was renewed in June 2023. On February 13, 2023, the Company announced the suspension of future quarterly dividends to protect the balance sheet and to focus capital resources on exploration and resource and reserve development. In November 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors decided to initiate a formal review process, with the assistance of outside financial and legal advisors, to evaluate strategic alternatives for the Company. The comprehensive process, which is ongoing, is evaluating a broad range of options to maximize shareholder value, including a potential sale or merger of the Company. Don David Gold Mine: The Don David Gold Mine (“DDGM”) safety program aims to bolster the overall health and safety culture of our employees. In 2023, two incidents resulting in lost time were recorded. Despite their low potential for harm, comprehensive investigations were conducted, and requisite measures were implemented accordingly. The full year lost time injury frequency rate per million hours was 0.96, which is substantially below the 3.95 Camimex (Mexican Chamber of Mines) benchmark.2 DDGM received the Mexican Empresa Socialmente Responsable (“ESR”) award in 2023 for the ninth consecutive year. The Don David Gold Mine produced and sold a total of 31,085 gold equivalent ounces, comprising of 18,534 gold ounces and 1,036,229 silver ounces, sold at an average price per ounce of $1,955 and $23.68, respectively. During the year, our exploration program was executed as planned, maintaining a dual focus on both infill and expansion drilling, with encouraging results from targets in the Switchback, Arista, and Three Sisters vein systems. The 2023 expansion (step-out) drilling program proved highly successful, culminating in the discovery of the Gloria vein system, located immediately north of the Three Sisters system, as well as successfully testing the projected northern extensions of the Splay 31 and Marena North veins of the Arista system. The Company purchased over two thousand tonnes of tailings material for $0.3 million from a third-party artisanal mining operation as a collaborative initiative with the local community at the end of 2022. Some of this material was processed in early 2023 to ensure the proper environmental treatment and storage of the material. During the fourth quarter of 2023, negotiations were successfully undertaken to decrease the royalty fee from 5% to 3% for the mining claims at La Tehuana, El Aguila, and Mina El Aire. Back Forty Project: Optimization work related to the metallurgy and the economic model for the Back Forty Project in Michigan, USA was completed, and the Company filed the Back Forty Project Technical Report Summary, which was prepared in accordance with subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K (“S-K 1300”), as Exhibit 96.1 to the Form 8-K filed on October 26, 2023 (the “Back Forty Project Technical Report Summary”). Results of the work indicate a more robust economic project with no planned impacts to wetlands that is more protective of the environment, which should facilitate a successful mine permitting process.

(BKKT) received a notice from the NYSE regarding non-compliance with the stock price requirement. The company aims to rectify the deficiency within a six-month period to maintain its listing on the NYSE.","Bakkt Notified by NYSE of Non-Compliance with NYSE Trading Share Price Listing Rule Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Bakkt Holdings, Inc. (BKKT) received a notice from the NYSE regarding non-compliance with the stock price requirement. The company aims to rectify the deficiency within a six-month period to maintain its listing on the NYSE. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The notification received by Bakkt Holdings, Inc. from the NYSE regarding non-compliance with the minimum share price requirement is a critical financial development. This scenario, often referred to as a 'share price deficiency', can be indicative of market sentiments and underlying financial health. It's important to note that a sub-$1 share price can sometimes lead to reduced investor confidence and potential delisting if not addressed. The six-month cure period provided by the NYSE is a grace period for the company to rectify this issue, with options like a reverse stock split, which consolidates the number of existing shares into fewer, proportionally more valuable shares to boost the stock price.For stakeholders, the short-term focus will be on the company's strategy to regain compliance. A successful increase in share price could stabilize investor confidence, while failure to do so could lead to volatility and further scrutiny of the company's financial stability. Long-term implications hinge on the effectiveness of the chosen remedy and the company's overall performance post-compliance. Market Research Analyst The market's reaction to Bakkt Holdings' share price deficiency and the subsequent steps the company takes to remedy the situation will be telling of the broader market perception of the company's value and prospects. A reverse stock split, while mechanically increasing the share price, does not inherently change the company's market capitalization or address the fundamental issues that may have led to the stock's decline. Investors and analysts will closely monitor the company's operational performance and growth strategies to determine whether the price correction aligns with genuine value creation or is merely a cosmetic change.Moreover, the company's ability to maintain other NYSE listing standards throughout this period is crucial. Any additional non-compliance issues could compound investor concerns and further impact the stock's performance. The situation presents a learning opportunity regarding the delicate balance between stock market regulations, investor relations and corporate governance. 03/13/2024 - 05:40 PM Intends to cure the deficiency and return to compliance with NYSE standard ALPHARETTA, Ga.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Bakkt Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: BKKT) announced today that the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) notified the Company (the “Notice”) that the Company is not in compliance with Section 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual because, as of March 12, 2024, the average closing price of the Company’s Class A Common Stock (the “Common Stock”) was less than $1.00 per share over a consecutive 30-day trading period. The notice does not result in the immediate delisting of the Common Stock from the NYSE. On March 13, 2024, the Company notified the NYSE that it intends to cure the stock price deficiency and to return to compliance with the NYSE continued listing standard. The Company can regain compliance at any time within the six-month period following receipt of the NYSE notice if the Company has a share price of at least $1.00 on the last trading day of any calendar month within the six-month cure period and an average share price of at least $1.00 over the 30 trading-day period ending on the last trading day of that month. Under the NYSE’s rules, if the Company determines that it will cure such average stock price deficiency by taking an action that will require stockholder approval, it must so inform the NYSE, and the noncompliance with the price condition will be deemed cured if the price promptly exceeds $1.00 per share and the price remains above that level for at least the following 30 trading days. The Company intends to consider all available alternatives to resolve this issue, including but not limited to a reverse stock split, subject to shareholder approval. The Common Stock will continue to be listed and trade on the NYSE during this period, subject to the Company’s compliance with other NYSE continued listing standards.

Market Research Analyst The recent filing by Noventiq Holdings PLC and Corner Growth Acquisition Corp. regarding a Registration Statement on Form F-4/A in connection with their proposed Business Combination is a significant event that warrants the attention of market research analysts. The substantial year-over-year revenue growth reported by Noventiq, particularly the 36.4% increase on a reported currency basis and even more pronounced 41.4% in constant currency, indicates a robust expansion in their business operations. This performance is further underscored by a notable 178.4% surge in adjusted EBITDA, which is a key indicator of a company's financial health and operating profitability.These results suggest that Noventiq is successfully navigating the digital transformation and cybersecurity landscape, sectors that are experiencing high demand. The company's focus on investing in technology and capabilities, as well as its compliance with PCAOB requirements, positions it favorably for a Nasdaq listing. Investors and stakeholders could view this as a positive signal of the company's commitment to transparency and adherence to high standards of financial reporting. Financial Analyst From a financial analysis perspective, the impressive growth in gross profit by 25.3% on a reported currency basis and 32.6% in constant currency for Noventiq is indicative of efficient cost management and a potentially scalable business model. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 6.4% is also a critical metric, reflecting the company's ability to convert revenue into profit while excluding non-cash expenses like share-based compensation.Investors should consider the implications of Noventiq's operational performance on its valuation, especially in light of the proposed business combination with Corner Growth Acquisition Corp. The strategic move towards a Nasdaq listing could enhance liquidity and provide access to a broader investor base, potentially leading to a re-rating of the company's stock. However, it is important to analyze these financials in the context of industry benchmarks and the competitive landscape to fully assess the investment potential. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the filing of the Registration Statement on Form F-4/A is a crucial step in the process of a business combination, especially for a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) like Corner Growth Acquisition Corp. This document provides detailed information about the proposed transaction, the companies involved and the financial implications, all of which are essential for regulatory approval by the SEC.The compliance with PCAOB requirements for financial statement audits is also significant, as it demonstrates Noventiq's adherence to stringent U.S. auditing standards. This level of compliance is important for investor confidence, particularly for a company seeking to list on a U.S. exchange like Nasdaq, where regulatory scrutiny is high. The legal ramifications of this compliance cannot be overstated, as it minimizes the risk of future litigation or regulatory action that could adversely affect shareholders. 03/13/2024 - 05:33 PM LONDON & PALO ALTO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Noventiq Holdings PLC (“Noventiq”), a global digital transformation and cybersecurity solutions and services provider, and Corner Growth Acquisition Corp.

(MIRM) receives FDA approval for LIVMARLI, an oral solution for cholestatic pruritus in PFIC patients. The approval is based on the Phase 3 MARCH study, showing significant reduction in pruritus severity. LIVMARLI also approved for Alagille syndrome. Immediate availability in the U.S. and plans for label expansion for younger patients. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The FDA's approval of LIVMARLI for cholestatic pruritus in PFIC patients represents a significant milestone in the treatment of this rare liver disease. The efficacy of LIVMARLI, as evidenced by the MARCH Phase 3 study, indicates a high level of statistical significance (p<0.0001), suggesting that the drug has a strong effect on reducing pruritus severity compared to placebo. This outcome is especially relevant for pediatric patients, as PFIC primarily affects children, leading to severe symptoms and impacting their quality of life.From a medical research perspective, the broad label coverage for various PFIC subtypes implies that LIVMARLI can cater to a wider patient population. This inclusivity is noteworthy since rare diseases often struggle with limited treatment options. The additional sNDA for a higher concentration formulation to include younger patients further demonstrates Mirum's commitment to addressing unmet needs within this patient community.For stakeholders, the immediate availability of LIVMARLI in the U.S. could lead to an uptick in the company's revenue stream. However, the long-term impact will depend on the adoption rate among healthcare providers, patient accessibility and potential competition from other treatments. The cost of treatment and insurance coverage will also play a crucial role in its market penetration. Market Research Analyst The approval of LIVMARLI by the FDA not only signifies a breakthrough in the therapeutic landscape for PFIC but also has the potential to disrupt the market for cholestatic pruritus treatments. Given the rarity of PFIC, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in every 50,000 to 100,000 live births, the market size is relatively small. However, the lack of alternative treatments provides Mirum Pharmaceuticals with a significant competitive advantage.Investors should note the potential for market expansion with Mirum's strategic move to submit an sNDA for a higher concentration formulation, which could increase the addressable market by including younger patients. The company's proactive approach to label expansion could be indicative of its long-term growth strategy and commitment to consolidating its presence in the rare disease market.It is important to monitor how Mirum Pharmaceuticals capitalizes on its first-mover advantage and how it navigates pricing and reimbursement challenges. The company's performance in the coming quarters will provide insights into the drug's market uptake and its impact on Mirum's financial health. Healthcare Economist The economic implications of introducing a new treatment like LIVMARLI are multifaceted. On one hand, the drug provides a non-surgical alternative to liver transplantation, which could lead to significant cost savings for the healthcare system. On the other hand, the pricing strategy for orphan drugs, typically high due to research and development costs, could impose a financial burden on patients and payers.An analysis of the cost-effectiveness of LIVMARLI should consider the potential reduction in healthcare resource utilization, such as fewer hospitalizations and medical interventions due to improved disease management. Additionally, the impact on patients' quality of life and the indirect costs associated with PFIC, such as lost productivity for caregivers, must be factored into the overall economic assessment.While LIVMARLI's approval is a positive development for patients, it is crucial to examine the sustainability of its pricing and reimbursement models, especially as healthcare systems globally are increasingly pressured to balance patient access with affordability. 03/13/2024 - 06:00 PM - FDA approval based on MARCH Phase 3 study with highly statistically significant (p<0.0001) reduction in pruritus severity between LIVMARLI vs. placebo - Label covers broad range of PFIC subtypes - Immediate launch and availability for eligible patients in the U.S. FOSTER CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Mirum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: MIRM) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved LIVMARLI® (maralixibat) oral solution for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients five years of age and older with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC). Mirum has also submitted an additional supplemental new drug application (sNDA) to introduce a higher concentration formulation of LIVMARLI, used during the MARCH study, to enable label expansion for younger patients with PFIC, later this year.

(Photo: Business Wire) LIVMARLI is also approved for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients with Alagille syndrome (ALGS) in the U.S. (three months and older), Europe (two months and older), in Canada and other regions globally. “LIVMARLI has the potential to have a transformational impact for patients with cholestatic pruritus associated with PFIC, and importantly, offers an option for those patients with the rarest of subtypes,” said Chris Peetz, chief executive officer at Mirum. “Thank you to the patients, families, and clinicians whose study participation made this approval possible.” The approval is based on data from the Phase 3 MARCH study, the largest randomized trial conducted in PFIC, with 93 patients across a range of genetic PFIC types, including PFIC1, PFIC2, PFIC3, PFIC4, PFIC6, and unidentified mutational status. “LIVMARLI’s approval in cholestatic pruritus for patients with PFIC is a result of years of investigation and a collection of a strong body of clinical evidence showing meaningful improvements across a number of important parameters, including pruritus, affecting children with PFIC,” said Richard Thompson, professor of molecular hepatology at King’s College London and an investigator in the MARCH study. “I am pleased that we will have a well-studied and efficacious option to offer patients whose life has been disrupted by itch.” “PFIC is a difficult disease for both the patient and family and significantly impedes the quality of life for all,” said Emily Ventura, executive director of the PFIC Network and mom to a daughter with PFIC. “These young and fragile patients endure an itch so severe that they experience deficits in their sleep, nutrition, growth, and, in the past, some have turned to transplant to resolve their itch. We are hopeful that LIVMARLI will have a measurable impact for patients, potentially offering a new normal and relief from the sleepless nights and disruption to their lives caused by cholestatic pruritus.” About PFIC Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) is a rare genetic disorder that causes progressive liver disease typically leading to liver failure. In people with PFIC, liver cells are less able to secrete bile. The resulting buildup of bile causes liver disease in affected individuals. Signs and symptoms of PFIC typically begin in infancy. Patients experience severe itching, jaundice, failure to grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive), and an increasing inability of the liver to function (liver failure). The disease is estimated to affect one in every 50,000 to 100,000 births in the United States and Europe. More than six types of PFIC have been genetically identified, all of which are similarly characterized by impaired bile flow and progressive liver disease. About LIVMARLI® (maralixibat) oral solution LIVMARLI® (maralixibat) oral solution is an orally administered, once-daily, ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT) inhibitor and the only approved medication by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients with Alagille syndrome (ALGS) three months of age and older and progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) five years of age and older. LIVMARLI is also the only approved IBAT inhibitor approved by the European Commission for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients with ALGS two months and older, and by Health Canada for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in ALGS. For more information for U.S. residents, please visit LIVMARLI.com. Mirum has also submitted LIVMARLI for approval in Europe in PFIC for patients two months of age and older. LIVMARLI has received Breakthrough Therapy designation for ALGS and PFIC type 2 and orphan designation for ALGS and PFIC. To learn more about ongoing clinical trials with LIVMARLI, please visit Mirum’s clinical trials section on the company’s website. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION Limitation of Use: LIVMARLI is not for use in PFIC type 2 patients who have a severe defect in the bile salt export pump (BSEP) protein. LIVMARLI can cause side effects, including: Liver injury. Changes in certain liver tests are common in patients with Alagille syndrome and PFIC but can worsen during treatment. These changes may be a sign of liver injury. In PFIC, this can be serious or may lead to liver transplant or death. Your healthcare provider should do blood tests and physical exams before starting and during treatment to check your liver function. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you get any signs or symptoms of liver problems, including nausea or vomiting, skin or the white part of the eye turns yellow, dark or brown urine, pain on the right side of the stomach (abdomen), bloating in your stomach area, loss of appetite or bleeding or bruising more easily than normal. Stomach and intestinal (gastrointestinal) problems. LIVMARLI can cause stomach and intestinal problems, including diarrhea and stomach pain. Your healthcare provider may advise you to monitor for new or worsening stomach problems including stomach pain, diarrhea, blood in your stool or vomiting. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms more often or more severely than normal for you. A condition called Fat Soluble Vitamin (FSV) Deficiency caused by low levels of certain vitamins (vitamin A, D, E, and K) stored in body fat is common in patients with Alagille syndrome and PFIC but may worsen during treatment. Your healthcare provider should do blood tests before starting and during treatment and may monitor for bone fractures and bleeding which have been reported as common side effects.

The company exceeded CPUC's supplier diversity goal for the 19th consecutive year, showcasing a commitment to economic prosperity and inclusion. Positive None. Negative None. Economist The economic impact of San Diego Gas & Electric's (SDG&E) procurement program, generating $2.59 billion and contracting with over 2,000 businesses, is significant. The program's focus on diversity, with 43% of total expenditures going to diverse suppliers, aligns with broader economic trends emphasizing inclusive growth. The direct local impact, with $450.6 million spent in San Diego County and $950.7 million in California, suggests a substantial multiplier effect on the regional economy. This effect can stimulate job creation, increase local revenue and foster a more resilient economic environment.SDG&E's long-term commitment to surpassing the California Public Utilities Commission's (CPUC) supplier diversity goal for 19 years consecutively demonstrates a sustainable approach to corporate social responsibility. This is likely to enhance the company's reputation and could lead to a more favorable regulatory environment, potentially benefiting shareholders. Moreover, by investing in small and diverse businesses, SDG&E may be contributing to innovation and competitiveness, which can indirectly support the company's operational efficiency and growth prospects. Market Research Analyst The success of SDG&E's procurement program can be attributed to its strategic engagement with small and diverse businesses, which reflects a growing consumer and investor interest in companies with strong Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) practices. The involvement with local suppliers, like Rancho Tree Service, indicates a potential competitive advantage for SDG&E in terms of community relations and local brand perception.Furthermore, the emphasis on diverse suppliers could appeal to a broader customer base and may lead to increased customer loyalty. This procurement strategy, which includes mentoring relationships between primes and subcontractors, could also create a more robust supply chain for SDG&E, reducing risks associated with supplier concentration and enhancing the company's agility in the face of market changes or disruptions. Sustainability Expert SDG&E's procurement program is not only a driver of economic growth but also a reflection of the company's commitment to sustainability and social responsibility. By integrating vegetation management services into their Wildfire Mitigation Plan, SDG&E is addressing critical environmental concerns. This initiative, particularly in a state prone to wildfires, underscores the importance of sustainable practices in utility operations.The engagement of a Minority Business Enterprise as a prime contractor for such services highlights the dual focus on environmental sustainability and social equity. This approach can enhance SDG&E's sustainability profile and potentially attract investors who prioritize responsible environmental stewardship and community engagement in their investment decisions. 03/13/2024 - 05:00 PM Program Expanded Opportunities for Hundreds of Small and Diverse Businesses, Helping to Promote Economic Prosperity SAN DIEGO, March 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- San Diego Gas & Electric's (SDG&E) procurement program generated $2.59 billion in direct economic impact in 2023, contracting with more than 2,000 businesses for goods and services to deliver on the company's mission to serve the 3.7 million people in its service area with increasingly clean, safe and reliable energy infrastructure. More than 43% of SDG&E's total expenditures were with diverse suppliers – enterprises owned by minorities, women, LGBT individuals, service-disabled veterans and persons with disabilities, according to the company's annual supplier diversity report submitted recently to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). Nearly 600, or a third of the suppliers who did business with SDG&E in 2023, were diverse businesses. In 2023, SDG&E's spending with diverse businesses reached $450.6 million in San Diego County and $950.7 million in California. For the 19th consecutive year, SDG&E has not only met but surpassed the CPUC's supplier diversity goal. ""We are laser-focused on maximizing every dollar for our customers, while also growing economic opportunities for small and diverse businesses in our region,"" said SDG&E CEO Caroline Winn. ""Championing people by creating opportunities through diversity, equity and inclusion is one of our core values."" SDG&E contracts with suppliers for a wide range of goods and services, everything from vegetation management, undergrounding, civil engineering and electric construction to IT, fire prevention, project management and material procurement and transport. Since launching its supplier diversity program in the 1980s, SDG&E has helped many small businesses grow into primes. Some of the company's diverse primes are paying it forward by serving as mentors to diverse subcontractors. Last year, for the first time, SDG&E engaged Rancho Tree Service, a Minority Business Enterprise, as a prime contractor to provide vegetation management services – an important component of the company's Wildfire Mitigation Plan. ""We are a family-owned business, and we are proud of our local operation and the jobs we have created through our vegetation management work with SDG&E,"" said Jose De La Cruz, owner of Rancho Tree Service. ""Our crews help keep local communities safe from wildfires by trimming and clearing trees, bushes and other plants to prevent them from coming into contact with our electric infrastructure, such as power lines."" ""Large employers like SDG&E play a significant role in sustaining and growing our region's economy because of the large volume of goods and services they purchase,"" said Mark Cafferty, president and chief executive officer of the San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation. ""Our research has shown that if major companies make small shifts in procurement to direct more spending locally, it can help create thousands of jobs and add tens of millions of dollars to the local economy."" SDG&E continues to grow its diverse supplier pool through collaboration with community-based organizations and business associations.

The study demonstrated 94% sensitivity for CRC at 91% specificity, outperforming the fecal immunochemical test. Cologuard Plus aims to reduce unnecessary follow-up colonoscopies and is set to be available in 2025 pending FDA approval. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The findings from the BLUE-C study regarding Exact Sciences' Cologuard Plus are significant for the medical community and patients alike. The reported 94% sensitivity for colorectal cancer (CRC) is a substantial improvement over the 67% sensitivity of the traditional fecal immunochemical test (FIT). This high sensitivity is crucial for early detection, which is directly linked to better treatment outcomes and survival rates for CRC patients. Moreover, the high specificity rates, particularly the 96% in the 45-54 age group, suggest a reduction in false-positive results, which can alleviate the burden on healthcare systems by minimizing unnecessary colonoscopies.It is also noteworthy that the study included a diverse population, which enhances the generalizability of the results across different racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. The inclusion of participants with a family history of CRC serves to broaden the potential application of the test to higher-risk groups. The potential market expansion for Cologuard Plus could be substantial, given the emphasis on early detection and personalized medicine in oncology. Healthcare Economist From an economic perspective, the introduction of Cologuard Plus could have a considerable impact on the healthcare industry. The test’s ability to reduce false positives and its high sensitivity may lead to a decrease in unnecessary procedures, which in turn could result in cost savings for both patients and insurers. This is particularly relevant in the context of the U.S. healthcare system, where the cost of medical procedures is a significant concern.Furthermore, early and accurate detection of CRC through Cologuard Plus could lead to lower treatment costs associated with late-stage cancer care. This preventative approach aligns with value-based care initiatives that prioritize patient outcomes and cost-effectiveness. The potential approval and market release of Cologuard Plus in 2025 could disrupt the current CRC screening market, potentially affecting the stock valuations of companies involved in CRC screening and diagnostics. Market Research Analyst For investors and stakeholders in Exact Sciences, the publication of the BLUE-C study in a prestigious journal like The New England Journal of Medicine adds credibility and visibility to Cologuard Plus. The reported performance metrics position the product as a leader in the noninvasive CRC screening space. Given the size of the CRC screening market and the emphasis on noninvasive tests, the introduction of Cologuard Plus could capture significant market share.However, the timeline for FDA approval and market availability in 2025 suggests a lag before revenue impact is realized. Investors will need to weigh the potential long-term gains against the current investment in research and development, as well as regulatory approval processes. The impact on Exact Sciences’ stock will likely be influenced by investor confidence in the company’s ability to navigate these processes successfully and the anticipation of market adoption rates post-approval. 03/13/2024 - 05:03 PM Cologuard Plus is only noninvasive test to be evaluated head-to-head against an independent fecal immunochemical test, which it significantly outperformed 20,000-participant BLUE-C study included 98 colorectal cancers and reflects racial and ethnic diversity of U.S. Company will host conference call and webcast at 8:00 a.m. ET on March 14 to discuss study results MADISON, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Exact Sciences Corp. (NASDAQ: EXAS), a leading provider of cancer screening and diagnostic tests, today announced online publication of the BLUE-C study results in The New England Journal of Medicine. The peer-reviewed study, ""Next-Generation Multitarget Stool DNA Test for Colorectal Cancer Screening"", will also appear in the journal's March 14, 2024 print issue. The 20,000-participant BLUE-C study was designed to determine the performance characteristics of Exact Sciences’ next-generation multitarget stool DNA test, Cologuard Plus, for colorectal cancer (CRC) and to compare that performance to the fecal immunochemical test (FIT), a commonly used noninvasive CRC screening test. Exact Sciences submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) its pre-market approval (PMA) application for Cologuard Plus in December 2023, including complete results from BLUE-C, and plans to make the test available in 2025, pending approval. Cologuard Plus met all BLUE-C study endpoints, demonstrating 94% sensitivity for CRC at 91% specificity including non-advanced findings, and 93% specificity including no findings. Specificity was even better in younger age groups, at 96% in 45-54 year olds. Cologuard Plus will minimize unnecessary follow-up colonoscopies by reducing the likelihood of a false-positive screening test. Results from BLUE-C also show Cologuard Plus significantly outperformed an independent FIT* for overall CRC sensitivity, treatable-stage CRC (stages I-III) sensitivity, high-grade dysplasia sensitivity, and advanced precancerous lesion sensitivity. Cologuard Plus1 Independent FIT1 Cancer sensitivity 94 67 Specificity including non-advanced findings 91 95 Specificity including no findings 93 96 Stages I-III cancer sensitivity 93 65 High-grade dysplasia sensitivity 75 47 Advanced precancer sensitivity 43 23 Note: specificity including non-advanced findings includes colonoscopy results that were negative for cancer or advanced precancer upon histopathological review; specificity including no findings includes no findings on colonoscopy and no histopathological review; high-grade dysplasia is a subtype of advanced precancer that includes carcinoma in situ or stage 0 cancer To potentially expand the eligible screening population beyond average-risk patients, the BLUE-C study enrolled a small subset of participants with a first-degree relative with a history of CRC. Sensitivities for CRC and advanced precancerous lesions were similar among participants with a first-degree relative with a history of CRC and those without such a relative. Among the subset of nearly 19,000 participants who were average-risk, without a first-degree relative with a history of CRC, Cologuard Plus exhibited 95% sensitivity for CRC and 43% sensitivity for advanced precancerous lesions at a 91% specificity including non-advanced findings, or 94% specificity including no findings. “Cologuard Plus is highly sensitive for detecting colorectal cancer,” said Thomas F. Imperiale, MD, professor of medicine at the Indiana University School of Medicine, research scientist at the Regenstrief Institute, and principal investigator for the BLUE-C study. “This noninvasive test also detected a good proportion of the most advanced precancerous lesions, and did so with a low number of false-positive test results.” The prospective, multi-center BLUE-C study utilized colonoscopy as a reference method, directly comparing Cologuard Plus and an independent FIT. BLUE-C investigators also collected blood samples for evaluation of a blood-based CRC screening test developed by Exact Sciences. “BLUE-C’s publication in The New England Journal of Medicine reflects a decade of deep scientific and medical research in collaboration with Mayo Clinic,” said Kevin Conroy, chairman and CEO of Exact Sciences. “We’re eager to bring an improved, noninvasive colorectal cancer screening test to patients in Cologuard Plus, as colorectal cancer remains the most preventable, yet least prevented cancer.” The BLUE-C study cohort was diverse and reflective of the U.S. population. About 40% of all participants identified as Hispanic or Latino, Black, Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, or Pacific Islander. This enrollment diversity helps ensure that the BLUE-C findings and Cologuard Plus are relevant for all screen-eligible individuals, regardless of race or ethnicity. “Many of the 53,000 Americans killed by colorectal cancer each year come from communities of color, a disparity we must work together to eliminate,” said Gary A. Puckrein, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of National Minority Quality Forum. “Access to innovations in colorectal cancer screening like the Cologuard Plus test and navigation that helps people get screened will play an important role in helping reduce the disproportionate and deadly impact colorectal cancer has on communities of color.” Conference call and webcast details Exact Sciences management will host a conference call and webcast on March 14 at 8:00 a.m. ET to discuss results of the pivotal BLUE-C study.

About the BLUE-C Study BLUE-C was a multi-center, prospective study (NCT04144738) of more than 20,000 adults 40 years of age and older.1 The trial was designed to evaluate the performance of Cologuard Plus (next generation multitarget stool DNA or mt-sDNA). Using colonoscopy as a reference method, the robust study design directly compared Cologuard Plus and an independent FIT. Blood samples were also collected for evaluation of a blood-based screening test developed by Exact Sciences. BLUE-C is one of the largest, noninvasive CRC screening trials ever conducted, and the study population reflects the racial and ethnic makeup of the United States according to the 2020 census.1,2 About Cologuard Plus Developed in collaboration with Mayo Clinic, Cologuard Plus features novel biomarkers and improved laboratory processes. It also incorporates enhanced sample stability components to provide patients more time to return their sample to Exact Sciences' lab and increase the valid result rate.

The outlook is stable. Humana plans to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes and debt repayment.,"AM Best Assigns Issue Credit Ratings to Humana Inc.’s New Senior Unsecured Notes and New Shelf Registrations Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary AM Best assigns 'bbb' Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings to Humana Inc.'s recently announced senior unsecured notes. The outlook is stable. Humana plans to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes and debt repayment. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The assignment of Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings to Humana Inc.'s senior unsecured notes by AM Best reflects a significant financial event for the company and its investors. The ratings of 'bbb' for both the $1.25 billion and $1 billion notes due in 2031 and 2054, respectively, indicate a good ability to meet ongoing financial obligations, which can be seen as a positive signal for current and potential investors. The stable outlook suggests a low likelihood of a near-term rating change, implying a stable financial environment for the company.However, it is important to note that Humana's financial leverage slightly exceeds its target debt-to-capital ratio of 40%, standing at 42% at year-end 2023. This could indicate a slightly higher risk profile in terms of debt management. Investors might be concerned that excessive leverage could affect the company's financial flexibility. Nonetheless, the planned use of proceeds for repayment of existing debt and outstanding commercial paper could mitigate such concerns by improving the company's debt maturity profile and potentially reducing interest costs. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the issuance of senior unsecured notes by Humana could be interpreted as a strategic move to optimize its capital structure amidst fluctuating interest rates. The interest rates of 5.375% and 5.75% on the newly issued notes are indicative of the current cost of borrowing for corporations and should be compared with industry benchmarks for a comprehensive analysis. Investors and analysts will likely monitor the impact of these notes on Humana's EBIT interest coverage, which remains solid. A strong interest coverage ratio suggests that Humana is well-positioned to cover its interest expenses, a reassuring factor for debt holders.Additionally, the withdrawal of ratings on the expired shelf registration is a routine administrative process and is unlikely to have a material impact on the company's financial health or market perception. The key takeaway for the market is the company's proactive approach to managing its debt portfolio, which can be a positive indicator of its financial prudence and strategic planning. Economist The broader economic implications of Humana's recent financial activities must be considered, especially in the context of the healthcare industry's capital requirements. The decision to issue long-term debt in a potentially rising interest rate environment can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it locks in capital for long-term projects at fixed rates, which can be advantageous if interest rates rise further. On the other hand, it could increase the cost of future borrowing if rates stabilize or fall.Given the stable outlook, it appears that the economic environment and industry-specific factors are favorable for Humana, which may have contributed to the decision to proceed with the issuance. The company's ability to maintain a solid EBIT interest coverage ratio in this context suggests a robust operational performance capable of sustaining higher levels of debt without jeopardizing financial stability. This strategic financial maneuvering is indicative of a responsive management team attuned to both market conditions and the company's long-term financial strategy. 03/13/2024 - 04:47 PM OLDWICK, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AM Best has assigned Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings (Long-Term IRs) of “bbb” (Good) to Humana Inc.’s (Humana) (headquartered in Louisville, KY) [NYSE: HUM] recently announced $1.25 billion 5.375% senior unsecured notes, due 2031, and $1 billion 5.75% senior unsecured notes, due 2054. In addition, AM Best has assigned indicative Long-Term IRs of “bbb” (Good) to senior unsecured issues, “bbb-” (Good) to subordinated issues and “bb+” (Fair) to preferred stock and of the recently filed shelf registration of Humana. The outlook assigned to these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable. Concurrently, AM Best has withdrawn the ratings on the previous shelf registration, which expired. Humana is anticipated to use the proceeds from the senior unsecured notes issuance for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of existing debt and outstanding commercial paper. As such, AM Best expects the issuance to be mostly neutral to financial leverage. Financial leverage, as measured by AM Best, was approximately 42% as of year-end 2023, slightly exceeding the organization's long-term target debt-to-capital ratio of 40%. Humana’s earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) interest coverage remains solid at about 8 times; however, it did decrease at year-end 2023 due to a moderate decline in operating results driven by increased utilization in its Medicare Advantage segment in the fourth quarter of 2023, as well as higher interest expense. Humana has sound liquidity measures as the organization maintains consolidated cash holdings of $4.7 billion and generates consistently strong operating cash flows, which totaled $4 billion in 2023. Liquidity is also supported by subsidiary dividends, its $4 billion commercial paper program, and access to short-term borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati through its subsidiary, Humana Insurance Company. The organization’s consistent profitability has driven equity growth over the past five years. Humana generated strong premium growth in 2023, driven by a membership increase in its core Medicare Advantage segment. However, service revenue derived from its CenterWell segment declined because of the divestiture of its 60% ownership in Gentiva Hospice operations. While profitability remained solid in 2023, net income was impacted by increased utilization in Medicare Advantage and supplementary benefits in the fourth quarter of 2023. AM Best expects the company’s earnings to remain positive albeit with margin compression. This press release relates to Credit Ratings that have been published on AM Best’s website.

Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The election of Carol 'John' Davidson as the new chairman of the board for TE Connectivity Ltd. signifies a strategic shift in leadership which could influence the company's governance and decision-making processes. With Davidson's extensive experience and previous role as lead independent director, his appointment may be viewed positively by investors seeking stability and seasoned oversight. Furthermore, the approval of a consistent dividend payout may reinforce investor confidence, as it suggests a stable financial position and a commitment to returning value to shareholders.From a market research perspective, leadership transitions can have a profound impact on investor perception and stock performance. Davidson's election could potentially lead to shifts in company strategy, especially considering his cross-industry leadership background. Investors will likely monitor the company's performance closely in the subsequent quarters to gauge the effectiveness of the new chairman's influence on the company's growth trajectory. Financial Analyst The announcement of a $2.60 per share annual dividend, distributed in quarterly increments, is a critical piece of financial information for current and potential investors. This dividend yield, based on the current stock price, can be compared to industry averages to assess TE Connectivity's attractiveness as an investment. The commitment to a quarterly dividend also suggests that the company has a reliable cash flow and is managing its capital efficiently enough to reward shareholders. This could be indicative of fiscal prudence and a strong balance sheet.Long-term investors might be particularly interested in the sustainability of these dividends. It is essential to analyze the company’s payout ratio and compare it to earnings to evaluate whether the dividends are supported by profits or if they could potentially strain the company's finances in the future. A financial analysis of TE Connectivity's past dividend history and financial health could provide valuable insights into the company's long-term strategic financial planning. 03/13/2024 - 04:45 PM Shareholders also approve quarterly dividend at annual general meeting SCHAFFHAUSEN, Switzerland, March 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Shareholders of TE Connectivity Ltd.

Financial Analyst The secondary offering of Kinetik Holdings Inc. shares by Apache Midstream LLC represents a liquidity event for the selling shareholder rather than a capital raise for the company itself. This transaction will not directly infuse new capital into Kinetik, as the proceeds do not go to the company. However, the market's response to this offering could indirectly impact Kinetik's stock price due to potential changes in the stock's perceived value and supply and demand dynamics.Investors should note that the CEO's indication of interest in purchasing shares could be interpreted as a positive signal of confidence in the company's value and prospects. The involvement of prominent financial institutions as book-running managers may also lend credibility to the offering and facilitate the process. Nonetheless, it is important to monitor the offering's pricing, as it may affect the market's valuation of Kinetik's shares. Market Research Analyst Understanding the context of Kinetik's secondary offering requires analyzing the broader energy sector and midstream market conditions. If the industry is facing headwinds, such as volatile commodity prices or regulatory challenges, the offering might be met with cautious investor sentiment. Conversely, a robust sector outlook could lead to a more favorable reception.Additionally, the size of the offering and the option for underwriters to purchase additional shares could indicate the selling shareholder's outlook on Kinetik's future stock performance. A successful offering could potentially enhance Kinetik's trading liquidity and shareholder base diversity, which are factors that can contribute to a more stable stock performance in the long run. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the offering's conduction under a previously filed registration statement that became automatically effective signals adherence to SEC regulations. The preliminary prospectus supplement will provide crucial information and prospective investors should review these documents thoroughly. It is essential to consider the legal implications and the accuracy of the disclosures made in these filings, as they can significantly impact investor decisions and the success of the offering.Moreover, the 30-day option granted to the underwriters is a standard practice known as a 'greenshoe' option, which can help stabilize the stock price after the offering. This mechanism allows underwriters to manage potential excess demand and reduce price volatility, which could benefit both the selling shareholder and existing investors. 03/13/2024 - 04:45 PM HOUSTON & MIDLAND, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Kinetik Holdings Inc.

The study reveals 83% sensitivity in detecting individuals with CRC and 88% sensitivity in detecting Stages I-III. Shield's potential FDA approval could revolutionize CRC screening, offering a convenient and accurate alternative to traditional methods. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The recent findings from the ECLIPSE study represent a significant advancement in the field of oncology, particularly in the early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC). The study's reported 83% sensitivity in detecting CRC and 90% specificity are notable because early-stage detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. The high sensitivity rates for Stages II and III, both at 100%, are particularly encouraging, as these stages are often when CRC is most treatable. However, the lower sensitivity for Stage I, at 65% for pathology-confirmed and 55% for clinical Stage I, suggests there is still room for improvement in detecting the earliest stages of CRC.From a clinical perspective, the potential FDA approval and subsequent Medicare coverage of the Shield blood test could lead to increased screening adherence, given the non-invasiveness and convenience compared to traditional methods like colonoscopy. This shift could ultimately result in earlier diagnoses and better survival rates, as the 5-year relative survival rate for early-stage colon cancer is significantly higher than that of advanced stages. The test's ability to detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a testament to the advancements in precision medicine and the move towards more patient-friendly screening modalities. Market Research Analyst Guardant Health's Shield test has the potential to disrupt the CRC screening market by offering a more accessible and less invasive alternative to current methods. The test's high adherence rate in real-world settings and the ability to triple screening rates among previously non-compliant adults are particularly promising for the company's market penetration and growth. The market impact could be substantial, not only for Guardant Health but also for competitors, as it may set a new standard for CRC screening practices.Investors should monitor the FDA's decision on Shield's premarket approval application closely, as approval could lead to significant revenue growth for Guardant Health. Additionally, the test's alignment with the increasing preference for non-invasive medical procedures could position the company favorably within the precision oncology sector. It's important to note, however, that market adoption rates and the impact on Guardant Health's financials will depend on factors such as insurance coverage, pricing strategy and the ability to maintain high sensitivity and specificity in a broader population. Health Economist The introduction of the Shield blood test could have profound implications for healthcare economics, particularly in the realm of preventative care for colorectal cancer. The potential for Medicare coverage is a critical factor in ensuring widespread access and could lead to cost savings by reducing the number of advanced-stage CRC cases that are more expensive to treat. Moreover, the test's convenience could lead to increased compliance with screening guidelines, which is cost-effective in the long run by catching cancers earlier when they are less costly to manage.However, it is essential to consider the cost-effectiveness of the Shield test compared to existing screening methods. While non-invasive, if the cost per test is significantly higher, it could offset the savings from increased early detection. Furthermore, the economic impact will also depend on the test's adoption by healthcare providers and whether it can truly replace or complement current screening protocols. Long-term studies on health outcomes and cost implications will be crucial to assess the full economic impact of incorporating Shield into standard CRC screening practices. 03/13/2024 - 05:00 PM Study shows blood-based cancer screening test detects 83% of people with colorectal cancer with specificity of 90% Results pave the way for first potential FDA-approved blood test for colorectal cancer screening to meet requirements for Medicare coverage PALO ALTO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Guardant Health, Inc. (Nasdaq: GH), a leading precision oncology company, today announced that results from the ECLIPSE study showing the effectiveness of its ShieldTM blood test for detecting colorectal cancer (CRC) in average-risk adults will be published in the March 14 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240313547689/en/Shield (TM) from Guardant Health is a blood test for colorectal cancer screening for adults age 45-84 who are at average risk. (Photo: Business Wire) “Over 50 million eligible Americans do not get recommended screenings for colorectal cancer, partly because current screening methods are inconvenient or unpleasant,” said AmirAli Talasaz, Guardant Health co-CEO. “We believe the publication of the ECLIPSE study in The New England Journal of Medicine, one of the world’s leading medical journals, is an endorsement of the quality of our clinical data and the potential value of the Shield test. We are confident that offering an accurate blood test has the potential to significantly reduce preventable colorectal cancer deaths.” One of the largest studies of its kind, ECLIPSE (Evaluation of ctDNA LUNAR Assay In an Average Patient Screening Episode) is a 20,000+-patient registrational study to evaluate the performance of Shield compared to a screening colonoscopy. The Shield test detects colorectal cancer signals in the bloodstream from DNA that is shed by tumors, called circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Highlights of the study results to be published in The New England Journal of Medicine* show that Shield demonstrated: 83% sensitivity in detecting individuals with CRC 88% sensitivity in detecting pathology-confirmed Stages I-III Sensitivity by stage of: 65% for pathology-confirmed Stage I; 55% for clinical Stage I 100% for Stage II 100% for Stage III 100% for Stage IV These results are on par with the performance of other guideline-recommended non-invasive screening modalities, where overall sensitivity in detecting colorectal cancer ranges from 74% to 92%.1 “More than 3 out of 4 Americans who die from colorectal cancer are not up to date with their recommended screening,2 highlighting the need for a more convenient and less invasive screening method that can overcome barriers associated with traditional options,” said Daniel Chung, MD, gastroenterologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. “The ECLIPSE study results published today support the use of a blood test as a screening option that could help overcome these barriers and improve CRC screening rates."" Publication of ECLIPSE follows Guardant Health’s submission of its premarket approval (PMA) application to the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Shield, which included key data points from the study. Since the launch of the lab-developed version of the Shield test in May 2022, it has been used by more than 20,000 people and more than 90% of patients who were prescribed the test in the real-world clinical setting completed it. One recent study showed that CRC screening rates tripled among adults who had declined prior CRC screening when they were offered Shield. The test’s sensitivity in detecting CRC, combined with this real-world adherence, suggests that Shield has the potential to detect more CRCs at a curable stage than traditional screening methods.3,4,5,6 “Colorectal cancer is highly treatable if caught in the early stages, yet more than 50 million people in the U.S. are still not completing their recommended screening with the methods available today,” said Chris Evans, president of the Colon Cancer Coalition. “This publication gets us one step closer to having an additional option to offer patients – one that is both convenient and accessible—and will help us close the screening gap.” Colorectal cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. The American Cancer Society estimates that more than 150,000 people will be diagnosed with CRC in 20247 and it is expected to become the leading cause of cancer-related deaths by 2030 in adults aged 20-49.8 More than 75% of people who die from CRC are not up to date with recommended screening,9 often due to the perception that current methods such as colonoscopy or stool-based tests are invasive, time-consuming and inconvenient. Early detection, however, is crucial. When colon cancer is found at an early stage before it has spread, the 5-year relative survival rate is 91%. If the cancer has spread to distant parts of the body, the 5-year survival rate is 13%. “The results of the study are a promising step toward developing more convenient tools to detect colorectal cancer early while it is more easily treated,” said corresponding author William M. Grady, MD, a gastroenterologist at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. “The test, which has an accuracy rate for colon cancer detection similar to stool tests used for early detection of cancer, could offer an alternative for patients who may otherwise decline current screening options."" * Representatives of the media who are not able to access the article content can contact press@guardanthealth.com. About the ECLIPSE study ECLIPSE is a prospective registrational study to evaluate the performance of Guardant Health’s blood test in detecting signs of CRC compared to a screening colonoscopy in average-risk adults between the ages of 45 and 84 from across the U.S. The ECLIPSE study included more than 200 clinical trial sites in rural and urban communities across 34 states. Study data includes 12% Black, 13% Hispanic and 7% Asian American populations. Enrollment among Black Americans was above average for a clinical trial, which is important given the disproportionate impact of CRC on the Black community.10 About Shield The Shield test for colorectal cancer screening is commercially available for eligible individuals by prescription only through healthcare professionals. This LDT (Laboratory Developed Test) is intended to be complementary to, and not a replacement for, current recommended CRC screening methods. A negative result does not rule out the presence of cancer. Patients with an abnormal blood-based screening result should be referred for a diagnostic colonoscopic evaluation.

The Company aims to use the net proceeds for working capital expenses and investments. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst When a company announces a public offering of shares, it is typically a strategic move to raise capital. In this case, Pagaya Technologies Ltd.'s decision to offer 6,500,000 Class A ordinary shares can be an indicator of the company's need for liquidity or desire to fund growth initiatives. The additional option for underwriters to purchase up to 975,000 shares suggests confidence in the offering's success, potentially indicating a positive market sentiment towards Pagaya.Investors will be interested in the utilization of the net proceeds, which are earmarked for 'general corporate purposes and to support future growth.' This broad description warrants scrutiny, as the specifics of these investments can significantly affect the company's financial trajectory. The involvement of reputable financial institutions as active joint book-running managers and co-managers, such as Citigroup and Jefferies, can be seen as a vote of confidence in the offering's management.However, it's crucial to consider the dilutive effect on existing shareholders. The increase in outstanding shares can lead to earnings per share dilution if the capital raised does not result in a proportional increase in net income. Market reaction to such offerings can be mixed, depending on the perceived value of the investment for which the capital is raised. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Pagaya Technologies Ltd.'s public offering can reflect broader trends in the financial technology sector. AI infrastructure is a rapidly growing field and companies like Pagaya are at the forefront of innovation. The success of this offering could signal to the market that investors are eager to support companies that are leveraging AI to disrupt traditional financial ecosystems.It is also important to monitor the market conditions at the time of the offering. If market conditions are favorable, Pagaya might secure better terms and pricing for their shares, which can be beneficial for both the company and the investors. Conversely, in a bear market, the offering might be priced lower, potentially leading to less capital raised than anticipated. Legal Expert The legal framework surrounding a public offering is complex and requires compliance with regulatory requirements. Pagaya's use of a shelf registration statement allows them to prepare the offering documents in advance and go to market quickly when conditions are favorable. This is a common strategy for companies looking to have the flexibility to time their offerings to market conditions.Investors should be aware that the prospectus and prospectus supplement will contain critical information, including risk factors and detailed use of proceeds. These documents are key to understanding the legal and financial implications of the offering. The SEC's role in reviewing these documents is to ensure transparency and protect investor interests. 03/13/2024 - 04:40 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pagaya Technologies Ltd.

Upcoming Zoom conference call to discuss Q4 2023 financial results. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent declaration of a cash dividend by Navigator Holdings Ltd. indicates a positive return to shareholders, reflecting the company's financial stability and commitment to shareholder value. The dividend payout, coupled with the share repurchase program, suggests a strategic approach to capital allocation that aligns with the company's Return of Capital policy. This policy, which aims to distribute 25% of net income, could be appealing to income-focused investors and may influence the stock's attractiveness in the market.Furthermore, the reported increase in net income and earnings per share (EPS) year-over-year signifies an improved financial performance, likely driven by operational efficiencies and favorable market conditions. The repayment of long-term debt also demonstrates prudent financial management, potentially enhancing the company's credit profile and reducing interest expenses in future periods. Market Research Analyst The reported increase in average daily time charter equivalent (TCE) rates suggests a robust demand for Navigator Gas's services, which could be attributed to market dynamics such as the longer ton-miles due to the constrained Panama transit. However, the slight decrease in fleet utilization may warrant monitoring, as it could indicate market saturation or operational challenges. The handysize market assessments provide a bullish outlook for the sector, particularly for ethylene transport, which is likely benefiting from the increased demand for shipping due to longer transit routes.The investment in the Ethylene Export Terminal Expansion Project is a forward-looking move that could position Navigator Gas advantageously in the growing market for gas exports. This expansion aligns with global energy trends and could result in increased throughput capacity and revenue streams. The capital expenditure involved in this expansion and its financing strategy, will be critical areas for stakeholder evaluation, as they may impact the company's leverage and liquidity profiles. Energy Sector Analyst The strategic investment in Azane aligns with the broader industry shift towards green fuels, positioning Navigator Gas at the forefront of the transition to low-carbon shipping solutions. The focus on ammonia as a marine fuel is particularly noteworthy, given the maritime industry's search for viable alternatives to traditional fossil fuels. This joint venture could provide Navigator Gas with a competitive edge in a nascent market, potentially opening up new revenue streams and partnerships.However, it is important to consider the risks associated with emerging technologies and markets, such as regulatory uncertainty and the pace of adoption. The projected delivery timeline for the green ammonia bunkering units also suggests a long-term horizon for any substantial impact on the company's financials. Stakeholders should weigh the potential for future value creation against the inherent risks of investing in unproven technologies and markets. 03/13/2024 - 04:32 PM LONDON, March 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Financial Highlights On March 12, 2024, the Board of Navigator Holdings Ltd. (the ""Company"", “Navigator Gas”,""we"", ""our"" and ""us"") (NYSE: NVGS) declared a cash dividend of $0.05 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, (the “Dividend”) under the Company's Return of Capital policy. The Dividend will be payable on April 25, 2024, to all shareholders of record as of the close of business New York time on April 4, 2024.Also as part of the Company's Return of Capital policy for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, the Company expects to repurchase approximately $0.8 million common stock (the “Share Repurchases”) between March 13, 2024, and March 31, 2024, subject to operating needs, market conditions and other circumstances, such that the Dividend and Share Repurchases together equal 25% of net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2023.The Company reported total operating revenue of $141.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $123.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022.Net Income attributable to stockholders' of the Company was $17.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $10.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022.Earnings per share was $0.24 for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $0.13 per share for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Adjusted earnings per share which excludes realized and unrealized gains or losses on non-designated derivative instruments and profit and loss from sale of vessel, was $0.32 for the three months ended December 31, 2023.EBITDA(1) was $66.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $58.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Adjusted EBITDA(1) was $71.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $55.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The Company repaid $23.8 million of the $111.8 million Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility held with Credit Agricole on December 28, 2023 which resulted in an equal reduction in long-term debt outstanding and cash and cash equivalents. The amount repaid of $23.8 million remains available to be redrawn by the Company in accordance with the terms of the Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility which matures in September 2028. (1) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA represents net income before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before profit/loss on sale of vessel, unrealized gain/loss on non-designated derivative instruments and foreign currency exchange gain or loss on senior secured bonds. Management believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful to investors in evaluating the operating performance of the Company. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered alternatives to consolidated net income, cash generated from operations or any measure. Other Highlights and Developments Operational Update Average daily time charter equivalent (""TCE"") across the fleet increased to $28,428 for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $23,622 for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Utilization across the fleet decreased from 93.4% in the third quarter of 2023 to 91.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023. Utilization during fourth quarter of 2022 was 94.1%. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the handysize 12-month market assessment for semi-refrigerated and fully refrigerated vessels increased by $60,000 and $115,000 per calendar month (“pcm”), to $885,000 pcm and $910,000 pcm, respectively. The handysize ethylene market assessment increased by $400,000 pcm to $1,400,000 pcm. During the fourth quarter of 2023 we experienced downward pressure on ethylene arbitrage to Asia, however this was compensated by additional activity on the ethane spot and time charter (""TC"") market. Low rainfall in Panama, and a subsequent reduction in available daily transits meant that ethane transport between US Gulf and China had to sail a longer distance via Cape of Good Hope. This resulted in longer ton-miles and more demand for shipping, which supported the handysize ethylene market assessment. In the fourth quarter of 2023 we had approximately 30 vessels engaged under time charters, 17 vessels on spot voyage charters and contracts of affreightment (""CoA"") and nine vessels were operated in the independently managed Unigas Pool. From January 1, 2024, and 12 months out, we have 48% of our ship days covered under time charter. Our midsize and fully refrigerated vessels are largely employed on time charters, our semi-refrigerated vessels are employed under time charters and spot voyage charters, and most of our ethylene capable vessels are employed on the spot voyage market. Ethylene Export Terminal The Ethylene Export Terminal throughput during the fourth quarter of 2023 was 208,495 metric tons, compared to 262,835 metric tons during the fourth quarter of 2022. We, together with Enterprise Products Partners L.P, our joint venture partner, have agreed to invest in the Terminal Expansion Project, which is expected to increase the export capacity from approximately one million tons per year to at least 1.55 million tons. Long lead items have been ordered, groundwork is progressing and construction is expected to occur throughout 2024 with completion in the fourth quarter of 2024. The total capital contributions required from us to the Export Terminal Joint Venture for the Terminal Expansion Project are expected to be approximately $130 million which the Company expects to finance using existing cash resources, distributions from the Export Terminal Joint Venture during the course of the expansion and additional debt. Of the expected total of $130 million, $35.0 million has been contributed as of December 31, 2023, $17.0 million of which was contributed during the fourth quarter of 2023. Azane Fuel Solutions AS (""Azane"") Azane, a joint venture between ECONNECT Energy AS and Amon Maritime AS, both of Norway, was founded in Norway in 2020 to develop proprietary technology and services for ammonia fuel handling and to facilitate the transition to green fuels for shipping. The Company acquired a 14.5% interest in Azane on October 25, 2023, for $1.4 million. Azane intends to build the world’s first ammonia bunkering network, with Yara Clean Ammonia already pre-ordering 15 units from Azane. The first green ammonia bunkering units are scheduled to be delivered in 2025 enabling low carbon fuel offering to shipowners. The investment made by Yara and Navigator is expected to enable Azane to begin construction of its first bunkering unit for ammonia supply in Norway, aiming to kickstart the transition to zero-carbon fuels for maritime transportation. Future value creation for Azane is expected to come through international expansion with its bunkering solutions and broadening of its offerings in ammonia fuel handling technology. Return of Capital Policy The Company’s current Return of Capital policy, which is subject to operating needs and other circumstances, is based on paying out quarterly cash dividends of $0.05 per share of common stock and returning additional capital in the form of additional cash dividends and/or share repurchases, such that the two elements combined equal at least 25% of net income for the applicable quarter. As part of the Return of Capital policy, we expect to repurchase the Company’s common stock (the “Share Repurchases”) and any such Share Repurchases will be made via open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions or any other method permitted under U.S. securities laws and the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Declarations of any dividends in the future, and the amount of any such dividend, are subject to the discretion of the Company’s Board. The Return of Capital policy does not oblige the Company to pay any dividends or repurchase any of its shares in the future and it may be suspended, discontinued or modified by the Company at any time, for any reason. Further, the timing of any share repurchases under the Return of Capital policy will be determined by the Company’s management and will depend on market conditions, legal requirements, stock price, and other factors.

About Navigator Gas We are the owner and operator of 56 liquefied gas carriers, which includes the world’s largest fleet of handysize gas carriers. We also own a 50% share in an ethylene export marine terminal at Morgan’s Point, Texas on the Houston Ship Channel (the “Ethylene Export Terminal”) through a joint venture (the “Export Terminal Joint Venture”). Our liquefied gas carrier fleet currently consists of 42 handysize liquefied gas carriers, which we define as those with capabilities between 15,000 and 24,999 cubic meters, or “cbm”. In addition, we have five larger 37,300 – 38,000 cbm midsize liquefied gas carriers; five 12,000 cbm ethylene carriers and four smaller 3,770 – 9,000 cbm semi-refrigerated liquefied gas carriers. Of our total fleet of 56 liquefied gas carriers, 25 are ethylene or ethane capable gas carriers. Our handysize liquefied gas carriers typically transport LPG on short or medium distance routes that may be uneconomical for smaller vessels and can call at ports that are unable to support larger vessels due to limited onshore capacity, absence of fully-refrigerated loading or discharge infrastructure and/or vessel size restrictions. These handysize liquefied gas carriers are amongst the largest semi-refrigerated vessels in the world, which also makes them the ideal choice for transporting petrochemicals on long routes, typically intercontinental. We play a vital role in the liquefied gas supply chain for energy companies, industrial consumers and commodity traders, with our sophisticated vessels providing an efficient and reliable ‘floating pipeline’. We carry LPG typically for major international energy companies, state-owned utilities and reputable commodities traders. LPG, which consists of propane and butane, is a relatively clean alternative energy source with more than 1,000 applications, including as a heating, cooking and transportation fuel and as a petrochemical and refinery feedstock. LPG is a by-product of oil refining and natural gas extraction, and shale gas, principally from the U.S. We also carry petrochemical gases for numerous industrial users. Petrochemical gases, including ethylene, propylene, butadiene and vinyl chloride monomer, are derived from the cracking of petroleum feedstocks such as ethane, LPG and naphtha and are primarily used as raw materials in various industrial processes, like the manufacture of plastics, vinyl and rubber, with a wide application of end uses. Our vessels also carry ammonia mainly for the producers of fertilizers in the agricultural industry, and for ammonia traders. Our 50% share in the Ethylene Export Terminal at Morgan’s Point comprises an ethylene refrigeration unit and an ethylene cryogenic storage tank with a capacity of 30,000 tons. The terminal has the capacity to export approximately one million tons of ethylene per year and is capable of loading ethylene-capable gas carriers at rates of 1,000 tons per hour.

Operating revenues, net of address commissions, was $129.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $24.0 million or 22.8% compared to $105.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to: an increase in operating revenues of approximately $19.3 million attributable to an increase in average monthly time charter equivalent rates, which increased to an average of approximately $28,428 per vessel per day ($864,670 per vessel per calendar month) for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to an average of approximately $23,622 per vessel per day ($718,539 per vessel per calendar month) for the three months ended December 31, 2022;an decrease in operating revenues of approximately $3.4 million attributable to a decrease in fleet utilization, which declined to 91.3% for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to 94.1% for the three months ended December 31, 2022;an increase in operating revenues of approximately $6.8 million or 7.7%, attributable to a 305 day increase in vessel available days for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022. This increase was in part as a result of five handysize vessels acquired by the Navigator Greater Bay Joint Venture being fully operational during the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022, in which only one vessel had been acquired and was operational for only 12 days.a increase in operating revenues of approximately $1.2 million primarily attributable to an increase in pass through voyage costs for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022. The following table presents selected operating data for the three months ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, which we believe are useful in understanding the basis of movements in our operating revenues.

TCE is not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For all charters, we calculate TCE by dividing total operating revenues (excluding collaborative arrangements and revenues from the Unigas Pool), less any voyage expenses (excluding collaborative arrangements), by the number of earning days for the relevant period. TCE excludes the effects of the collaborative arrangements, as earning days and fleet utilization, on which TCE is based, is calculated for our owned vessels, and not the average of all pool vessels. Under a time charter, the charterer pays substantially all of the vessel's voyage related expenses, whereas for voyage charters, also known as spot market charters, we pay all voyage expenses. TCE is a shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period-to-period changes in a company’s performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (i.e., voyage charters, time charters and contracts of affreightment) under which the vessels may be employed. We include average daily TCE, as we believe it provides additional meaningful information in conjunction with net operating revenues. Our calculation of TCE may not be comparable to that reported by other companies. Reconciliation of Operating Revenues to TCE The following table represents a reconciliation of operating revenues to TCE. Operating revenues are the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP for the periods presented. Three months ended December 31, 2022Three months ended December 31, 2023 (in thousands, except earning days and average daily time charter equivalent rate)Fleet Data: *** Operating revenue$105,115$129,068*** Voyage expenses 16,865 18,115Operating revenue less voyage expenses 88,250 110,953Earning days 3,736 3,903Average daily time charter equivalent rate$23,622$28,428 ***Operating revenues and voyage expenses excluding collaborative arrangements and Unigas Pool. Operating Revenues – Unigas Pool. Operating revenues – Unigas Pool was $12.6 million an increase of 6.1% for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $11.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, and represents our share of the revenues earned from our nine vessels operating within the Unigas Pool, based on agreed pool points. Operating Revenues – Luna Pool Collaborative Arrangements. Luna Pool earnings are aggregated and then allocated (after deducting pool overheads and manager's fees) to the pool participants in accordance with the Pooling Agreement. Operating revenues - Luna Pool collaborative arrangements was $nil for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $6.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and represents our share of pool net revenues generated by the other participant’s vessels in the pool, prior to the acquisition of the vessels by Navigator Greater Bay Joint Venture. This decrease was primarily a result of the arrangement ending following the acquisition of the final vessel, Navigator Vega, on April 13, 2023. Brokerage Commissions. Brokerage commissions, which typically vary between 1.25% and 2.5% of operating revenues, increased by $0.2 million or 14.2% to $1.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, from $1.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to an increase in operating revenues on which brokerage commissions are based. Voyage Expenses. Voyage expenses increased by $1.2 million or 7.4% to $18.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, from $16.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. These voyage expenses are pass through costs, corresponding to an increase in operating revenues of the same amount. Voyage Expenses – Luna Pool Collaborative Arrangements. Voyage expenses – Luna Pool collaborative arrangements was $nil for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $5.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. These voyage expenses – Luna Pool collaborative arrangements represent the other participant’s share of pool net revenues generated by our vessels in the pool, prior to the acquisition of the vessels by Navigator Greater Bay Joint Venture. This decrease was primarily a result of the arrangement ending following the acquisition of the final vessel Navigator Vega on, April 13, 2023. Vessel Operating Expenses. Vessel operating expenses increased by $2.8 million or 6.4% to $46.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, from $43.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Average daily vessel operating expenses increased by $7 per vessel per day, or 0.1%, to $9,067 vessel per day for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $9,060 per vessel per day for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased by $2.3 million to $32.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to $30.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The increase is driven by the acquisition of the five vessels by the Navigator Greater Bay Joint Venture. Depreciation and amortization included amortization of capitalized drydocking costs of $5.0 million and $4.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. General and Administrative Costs. General and administrative costs increased by $0.5 million or 5.8% to $8.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, from $8.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Non-Operating Results Foreign Currency Exchange Gain on Senior Secured Bonds. In December 2022, we redeemed all of the 600 million Norwegian Kroner then outstanding principal amount of our senior secured bonds (the “2018 Bonds”). No exchange gains and losses were recorded for the three months ended December 31, 2023. A foreign currency exchange gain of $6.0 million was recorded for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as a result of the Norwegian Kroner weakening against the U.S. Dollar. Realized Gain on Cross Currency Interest Rate Swap. The realized gain of $6.9 million on cross currency interest rate swap related to the movement in the fair value of our cross-currency interest rate swap between September 30, 2022 and the actual value of the swap on December 23, 2022, when our 2018 Bonds, on which the swap was based, were redeemed. Unrealized Gains / (Losses) on Non-Designated Derivative Instruments. The unrealized loss of $5.3 million on non-designated derivative instruments for the three months ended December 31, 2023, relates to fair value losses on interest rate swaps associated with a number of our secured term loan and revolving credit facilities, as a result of a decrease in forward Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) interest rates, compared to an unrealized loss of $0.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased by $2.4 million, or 17.0%, to $16.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, from $14.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. This is primarily as a result of increases in US dollar SOFR rates and the draw down of facilities that provided financing for the acquisition of five ethylene carriers by the Navigator Greater Bay Joint Venture. Income Taxes. Income taxes relate to taxes on our subsidiaries and businesses incorporated around the world including those incorporated in the United States of America. Income taxes is $0.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $4.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, primarily as a result of current tax of $1.3 million and a deferred tax gain of $1.4 million in relation to our investment in the Ethylene Export Terminal. Share of Result of Equity Method Investments. The share of the result of the Company’s 50% ownership in the Export Terminal Joint Venture was an income of $5.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to an income of $7.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. This decrease is a result of higher gas prices resulting in reduced throughput rates and by decreased volumes exported through the Ethylene Export Terminal, of 208,495 tons for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to 262,835 tons for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Non-Controlling Interest. The Company entered into a sale and leaseback arrangement in November 2019 with a wholly-owned special purpose vehicle of a financial institution (“Lessor SPV”). Although we do not hold any equity investments in this Lessor SPV, we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of this entity and accordingly we are required to consolidate this Variable Interest Entity (""VIE"") into our financial results. The net income attributable to the Lessor SPV was $0.3 million and this is presented as a non-controlling interest for each period for both the three months ended December 31, 2023, and three months ended December 31, 2022. In September 2022, the Company entered into the Navigator Greater Bay Joint Venture to acquire five ethylene vessels, Navigator Luna, Navigator Solar, Navigator Castor, Navigator Equator and Navigator Vega. The joint venture is owned 60% by the Company and 40% by Greater Bay Gas. The Navigator Greater Bay Joint Venture is accounted for as a consolidated subsidiary in our consolidated financial statements, with the 40% owned by Greater Bay Gas accounted for as a non-controlling interest. A gain attributable to Greater Bay Gas of $1.1 million is presented as part of the non-controlling interest in our financial results for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to effectively $nil for the three months ended December 31, 2022 . Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The following table shows a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022: Three months endedYear ended December 31, 2022December 31, 2023December 31, 2022December 31, 2023 (in thousands)(in thousands)Net income$10,255 $19,145$54,878 $86,872 Net interest expense 13,270 14,296 49,758 59,192 Income taxes 4,459 56 5,949 4,325 Depreciation and amortization 30,559 32,828 126,220 129,202 EBITDA(1)$58,543 $66,325$236,805 $279,591 Unrealized loss/(gain) on non-designated derivative instruments 471 5,254 (25,124) 7,282 Realized (gain)/loss on non-designated derivatives instruments (6,888) — 6,270 — Loss on repayment of senior bonds 1,102 — 1,102 — Write off of deferred financing costs 212 — 212 171 Foreign currency exchange loss/(gain) on senior secured bond 5,969 — (6,589) — (Profit)/Loss from sale of vessel (4,363) 144 (4,721) (4,797)Adjusted EBITDA(1)$55,046 $71,723$207,955 $282,247 (1) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA represents net income before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before profit/loss on sale of vessel, unrealized gain/loss on non-designated derivative instruments and foreign currency exchange gain or loss on senior secured bonds. Management believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful to investors in evaluating the operating performance of the Company. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered alternatives to consolidated net income, cash generated from operations or any measure. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity and Cash Needs Our primary sources of funds are cash and cash equivalents, cash from operations, undrawn bank borrowings and proceeds from bond issuances. As of December 31, 2023, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $158.2 million . The Company repaid $23.8 million of the $111.8 million Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility held with Credit Agricole on December 28, 2023 which resulted in an equal reduction in long-term debt outstanding and cash and cash equivalents. The amount repaid of $23.8 million remains available to be redrawn by the Company in accordance with the terms of the Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility which matures in September 2028. Our secured term loan facilities and revolving credit facilities require that the borrowers have liquidity of no less than (i) $35.0 million or $50.0 million, as applicable to the relevant loan facility, or (ii) 5% of total debt (which was $45.1 million as of December 31, 2023), whichever is greater. Our primary uses of funds are drydocking and other vessel maintenance expenditures, voyage expenses, vessel operating expenses, general and administrative costs, insurance costs, expenditures incurred in connection with ensuring that our vessels comply with international and regulatory standards, financing expenses, quarterly repayment of bank loans and the Terminal Expansion Project. We also expect to use funds in connection with our Return of Capital policy. In addition our medium-term and long-term liquidity needs relate to debt repayments, repayment of bonds, potential future vessel newbuildings, related investments, vessel acquisitions, and or related port or terminal projects. As of December 31, 2023, we had $906.1 million in outstanding obligations, which includes principal repayments on long-term debt, including our bonds, commitments in respect of the Navigator Aurora Facility and office lease commitments. Of the total outstanding obligations, $123.8 million matures during the twelve months ending December 31, 2024, and $782.4 million matures after December 31, 2024. We believe, given our current cash balances, that our financial resources, including the cash expected to be generated within the year, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and working capital needs for at least the next twelve months, taking into account our existing capital commitments and debt service requirements. Capital Expenditures Liquefied gas transportation by sea is a capital-intensive business, requiring significant investment to maintain an efficient fleet and to stay in regulatory compliance. We currently have no newbuildings on order. However, we may place newbuilding orders or acquire additional vessels as part of our growth strategy. We may invest further in terminal infrastructure, such as the expansion of our existing Ethylene Export Terminal. The total capital contributions required from us related to the Terminal Expansion Project are expected to be approximately $130 million, of which $35.0 million has been contributed as of December 31, 2023. $17.0 million was contributed during the fourth quarter of 2023. Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash provided by / (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022: Year ended December 31, 2022Year endedDecember 31, 2023 (in thousands)Net cash provided by operating activities$130,308 $174,703 Net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities1 29,725 (176,481)Net cash (used in)/provided by financing activities1 (128,225) 6,809 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (2,837) 17 Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash$28,971 $5,048 Operating Cash Flows. Net cash provided by operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, increased to $174.7 million, from $130.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $44.4 million . This increase was primarily due to an increase in net income of $4.6 million (after adding back the unrealized gains and loss on derivative instruments and our share of the result from equity method investments); a decrease in drydocking payments of $3.5 million and changes in working capital of $12.5 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. Net cash flow from operating activities principally depends upon charter rates attainable, fleet utilization, fluctuations in working capital balances, repairs and maintenance activity, amount and duration of drydocks and changes in foreign currency rates. We are required to drydock each vessel once every five years until it reaches 15 years of age, after which we drydock vessels approximately every two and a half years. Drydocking each vessel, including travelling to and from the drydock, can take approximately 30 days in total being approximately 5-10 days of voyage time to and from the shipyard and approximately 15-20 days of actual drydocking time. Ten of our vessels completed their respective drydockings during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, We estimate the current cost of a five-year drydocking for one of our vessels is approximately $1.0 million, a ten-year drydocking cost is approximately $1.3 million, and the 15 year and 17 year drydocking costs is approximately $1.5 million each (including the cost of classification society surveys). As our vessels age and our fleet expands, our drydocking expenses will increase. Ongoing costs for compliance with environmental regulations are primarily included as part of drydocking, such as the requirement to install ballast water treatment plants, and classification society survey costs, with a balance included as a component of our operating expenses. Investing Cash Flows1. Net cash used in investing activities was $176.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of $191.7 million used by the Navigator Greater Bay Joint Venture for the acquisition of four vessels and contributions to our investment in the ethylene export terminal via the Terminal Expansion Project of $35.0 million, offset by distributions received from our investment in the Export Terminal Joint Venture of $30.8 million and proceeds from the sale of Navigator Orion of $20.7 million. Net cash provided by investing activities of $29.7 million million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily represents net proceeds from the sale of vessels of $38.8 million, distributions from our equity method investments of $27.5 million, insurance recoveries during the year of $9.3 million and capital contributions from non-controlling interests of $5.9 million; offset by expenditure on vessels and their equipment of $45.7 million. Financing Cash Flows. Net cash provided by financing activities was $6.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of the drawdown of $200.0 million from our March 2023 Secured Term Loan facility and $123.6 million from our Navigator Greater Bay Joint Venture Secured Term Loan facility to partially finance the acquisition of four vessels; as well as $27.3 million received as a capital contribution from the non-controlling interest for those vessels; offset by our regular quarterly debt repayments and the refinancing of our two maturing secured term loan facilities totaling $268.3 million, $48.7 million for our share repurchase program and $7.3 million for our quarterly dividends. Net cash used in financing activities of $128.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, principally relates to repayments of our secured term loan facilities of $186.4 million, the repayment of the NOK Bond and the settlement of the related cross currency swap of $72.9 million, the repurchase of the Company’s shares pursuant to the share repurchase program in the amount of $5.5 million, as well as an extemporaneous repayment of $6.7 million on the Navigator Aurora Facility held within our consolidated lessor VIE, offset by drawdowns on the new term loan facilities of $139.3 million.

Award Construction successfully implements the system, reducing generator run time by 91% and achieving an 80% fuel and emissions reduction. Positive None. Negative None. Environmental Sustainability Expert The integration of battery energy systems in construction equipment, particularly tower cranes, represents a significant advancement in environmental sustainability within the construction industry. This technology reduces the reliance on diesel generators, which are traditionally used to power such equipment. By minimizing generator run time and leveraging the potential for solar panel integration, the system substantially cuts down on fuel consumption and carbon emissions. This not only aligns with global efforts to reduce greenhouse gases but also meets the increasing demand for green construction practices from both regulators and the public.The long-term implications for stakeholders include potential cost savings on fuel and maintenance, as well as compliance with stricter environmental regulations. Construction firms adopting such technologies may also gain a competitive edge by aligning with the values of environmentally conscious clients and partners. However, the initial investment in battery energy systems and the scalability of such solutions for larger projects could pose challenges that need to be addressed. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the adoption of battery energy systems by United Rentals could lead to operational efficiencies and cost savings for their clients, as evidenced by the case study of Award Construction. A reduction in generator run time by 91% and a corresponding decrease in fuel consumption by approximately 80% could translate into significant cost reductions over the lifespan of construction projects. For United Rentals, this move may enhance their value proposition and potentially drive demand for their rental equipment, which could positively impact their financial performance.Investors and stakeholders should monitor the adoption rate of this technology and its impact on United Rentals' revenue streams. While the upfront costs of these systems may be higher, the long-term operational savings and potential for increased market share in an environmentally conscious market could provide a return on investment. However, it's important to consider the competitive landscape and the speed at which competitors might introduce similar sustainable solutions. Market Research Analyst The construction industry is increasingly moving towards sustainability and the market for eco-friendly construction solutions is expanding. The introduction of battery energy systems for tower cranes by United Rentals taps into this growing trend. As a market research analyst, observing the market's response to such innovations is crucial. Early adopters like Award Construction showcase the practical benefits and could serve as a case study for other firms considering similar investments.Market acceptance will be determined by factors such as the reliability of the technology, cost-effectiveness compared to traditional methods and the regulatory environment promoting sustainable practices. It's also essential to understand how this fits into the broader trend of electrification and renewable energy adoption in construction. The ability of United Rentals to capitalize on this trend will depend on their marketing strategy, the effectiveness of their technology and their capacity to scale up operations in response to demand. 03/13/2024 - 05:30 PM Helping Award Construction Achieve More Sustainable Jobsite at St. Albert Project STAMFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- United Rentals, Inc. (NYSE: URI), the world's largest equipment rental company, today announced it has added battery energy systems for tower cranes to its North American rental fleet. Developed by Termaco in collaboration with United Rentals, this innovative system provides clean, sustainable power that enables contractors to reduce fuel consumption and equipment-related downtime while achieving quieter, lower-emission jobsites. Configurable up to 500kW, the system operates alongside a generator to deliver reliable power to support tower crane operations. It minimizes generator run time by storing energy in batteries and running on battery power whenever possible. For smaller applications, the battery unit can be powered by solar panels to create a completely emission-free solution. This allows a contractor to significantly downsize the generator and dramatically reduce generator run time and emissions, while still meeting peak power demands. “Battery energy systems for tower cranes provide a great application of practical sustainability on the jobsite by helping contractors address their economic and environmental goals,” said Larry Worthington, Region Vice President, Power and HVAC, United Rentals. “This solution demonstrates United Rentals’ commitment to bringing innovative products to market that deliver outstanding value to our customers.” Proven in the Field General contracting firm Award Construction, based in Alberta, Canada, pioneered the use of the United Rentals battery energy system to fully power an 8-ton, 70-meter-tall tower crane at Riverbank Landing, a 20-acre planned mixed-use community being built in Edmonton. At the project, Award went from running a 300kVA T4 generator 24 hours a day to power its tower crane, to charging the battery energy system with a 100kW generator for just two and a half hours a day and operating the crane solely on battery power. Generator run time was reduced by 91%, which resulted in a fuel and emissions reduction of approximately 80%. “Sustainable building aligns with our company’s core values. We are proud our Riverbank Landing construction site is making history as one of the first in Canada to fully power its site tower crane entirely by battery,” said Brian Hennessey, Construction Manager, Award Construction. This innovative tower crane battery energy system is part of a range of low and zero-emission solutions. Learn more on the Sustainability at United Rentals webpage.

The company's CFO emphasizes the commitment to returning cash to shareholders and effective capital allocation strategies. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of an increased dividend by Travel + Leisure Co. signals a robust financial posture and a commitment to shareholder returns. The 11% hike in the quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share from the previous $0.45 is a substantial increment, which suggests that the company has a positive outlook on its cash flow and profitability. This move might attract income-focused investors, potentially leading to an increased demand for the stock.It's important to consider the dividend yield, which is a financial ratio that shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its stock price. An increase in dividends can affect this yield and make the stock more attractive if the price remains stable or grows at a slower pace than the dividend increase. Moreover, the company's capital allocation strategy, including share repurchases, organic growth investments and potential M&A activities, indicates a comprehensive approach to utilizing its capital for driving shareholder value. Market Research Analyst The travel and leisure industry has been recovering post-pandemic and Travel + Leisure Co.'s decision to increase dividends likely reflects the company's confidence in the industry's continued growth. This confidence is also supported by the CFO's statement regarding the company's prospects for growth. An increased dividend can be seen as a signal to the market about the company's future performance expectations.However, it is essential to monitor the company's ability to sustain this increased dividend through its future earnings and cash flow. Investors should be aware that a high dividend payout, if not supported by solid financial health, can become unsustainable in the long term. Therefore, analyzing the company's earnings, payout ratio and free cash flow is crucial in assessing the sustainability of the dividend increase. Economist In the broader economic context, dividend policy changes can be influenced by macroeconomic factors like interest rates and economic growth. In a low-interest-rate environment, higher dividends might be particularly attractive as they offer better returns than many fixed-income alternatives. However, as interest rates rise, the relative attractiveness of dividend stocks may diminish unless they can maintain a yield advantage.Furthermore, the travel and leisure sector's performance is closely tied to consumer discretionary spending, which is affected by economic cycles. In periods of economic expansion, consumers are more likely to increase spending on travel and leisure, benefiting companies like Travel + Leisure Co. Conversely, during economic downturns, such companies might face challenges in maintaining their financial performance and, by extension, their dividend payouts. 03/13/2024 - 04:30 PM ORLANDO, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The board of directors of Travel + Leisure Co. (NYSE:TNL) declared a regular cash dividend on the company’s common stock, increasing the quarterly dividend rate by 11% to $0.50 per share from $0.45 per share.

RMBS portfolio details are also provided, showcasing asset valuation and risk measures. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of a monthly dividend payment by Orchid Island Capital, Inc. is a tangible indicator of the company's current financial health and its commitment to returning value to shareholders. The declared dividend of $0.12 per share is particularly noteworthy for income-focused investors and could affect the stock's attractiveness in the dividend-paying sector of the market. The consistency of dividend payments suggests a stable cash flow position, which can be reassuring to investors during volatile market conditions.However, it is crucial to assess the sustainability of these dividends. The REIT structure requires the distribution of at least 90% of taxable income, which could limit the company's ability to reinvest earnings into growth opportunities. Furthermore, the lack of a minimum distribution payment level indicates that future dividends are not guaranteed and could be influenced by changes in taxable income or available cash. This uncertainty may introduce a level of risk that should be considered in portfolio management decisions. Tax Specialist From a taxation perspective, the REIT status of Orchid Island Capital has important implications. The obligation to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income helps the company avoid paying corporate income tax on distributed amounts, but it also exposes the company to potential income and excise taxes on undistributed taxable income. This tax structure necessitates careful financial planning to optimize distributions while minimizing tax liabilities.The company's potential exposure to excise tax for not distributing a certain percentage of its taxable income by specified dates adds another layer of complexity to its financial strategy. Investors should be aware of these tax considerations as they can significantly impact the net income of the company and ultimately affect the sustainability of dividend payments. Market Research Analyst Looking at the broader market, REITs like Orchid Island Capital are often evaluated based on their yield, stability and the quality of their underlying assets. The details provided on the RMBS portfolio characteristics such as valuation, assets by agency and risk measures will be closely scrutinized by investors. These portfolio characteristics can signal the company's risk management strategy and the expected performance of its RMBS assets.Given that the RMBS market can be sensitive to interest rate changes and economic conditions, the portfolio's composition and the company's exposure to repurchase agreements are critical factors. Investors should monitor these aspects to gauge the company's ability to maintain dividend payments and navigate market fluctuations. This information, although preliminary, gives a snapshot of the company's investment focus and risk profile, which are essential for making informed investment decisions in the fixed-income space. 03/13/2024 - 04:52 PM March 2024 Monthly Dividend of $0.12 Per Share of Common Stock RMBS Portfolio Characteristics as of February 29, 2024 Next Dividend Announcement Expected April 10, 2024 VERO BEACH, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Orchid Island Capital, Inc.

Adjusted EBITDA for 2023 stood at $52.0 million. OPAL Fuels doubled its RNG production over the last two years and expanded its fueling station network. The company anticipates ending 2024 with 8.8 million MMBtu of RNG capacity online. OPAL Fuels expects Adjusted EBITDA for 2024 to range between $90 million and $100 million. The company's liquidity as of December 31, 2023, was $347.8 million, with sufficient funding to meet existing needs. Negative None. Financial Analyst OPAL Fuels Inc. has reported a substantial year-over-year revenue increase of 30% for the quarter and 9% for the full year, indicating a positive trend in the company's financial performance. The net income shows a significant increase for the annual figure, rising from $32.6 million to $127.0 million, which could be attributed to the company's operational efficiency and strategic initiatives, including the closing of a $500 million credit facility. However, there is a notable decrease in quarterly net income from $32.0 million to $20.1 million, which warrants further analysis to understand the underlying factors.The company's Adjusted EBITDA also presents a mixed picture, increasing for the quarter but showing a slight decline on an annual basis. This metric is crucial for investors as it provides insight into the company's operating profitability by excluding non-operating expenses and revenue. The RNG Pending Monetization amount of $18.5 million suggests that the company has a significant volume of RNG that is produced but not yet sold, which could impact future revenue streams.Considering the capital expenditure of approximately $230 million planned for 2024, it is essential to evaluate the company's liquidity position. With $347.8 million in liquidity, OPAL Fuels appears well-positioned to fund its upcoming projects. The anticipated growth in the Fuel Station Services segment by 75%-90% could be a key driver for future revenue, provided the company successfully navigates the challenges in the RNG market. Market Research Analyst The renewable energy sector, particularly the RNG market, is experiencing strong tailwinds due to increased policy support and demand. OPAL Fuels' strategic focus on expanding its RNG production capacity and fueling station network is well-aligned with industry trends. The company's projection of ending the year with 8.8 million MMBtu of RNG capacity online indicates an aggressive growth strategy that could capture a larger market share.Moreover, the company's vertical integration allows for better control over the supply chain, potentially leading to cost efficiencies and competitive advantages. The growth in the volume of RNG sold as transportation fuel by 44% and 49% for the three and twelve months, respectively, reflects the increasing demand for cleaner fuel alternatives in the heavy-duty fleet sector.Investors should note the company's guidance for 2024, which forecasts an Adjusted EBITDA range between $90 million and $100 million. This guidance, along with the expected growth in RNG production, provides a promising outlook. However, external factors such as the price volatility of environmental attributes like D3 RINs and LCFS credits and natural gas prices will play a crucial role in the company's performance. Energy Sector Analyst The report highlights OPAL Fuels' commitment to increasing its design capacity for RNG production, which is essential for meeting the rising demand for low carbon intensity energy products. The company's operational highlights, including the anticipated commencement of commercial operations for multiple projects, suggest a strategic expansion in line with the global shift towards renewable energy sources.The dispute with the Engineering, Procurement and Construction contractor over change order requests for two dairy projects in California may pose risks to project timelines and cost overruns. It is crucial for stakeholders to monitor such developments closely, as they could impact future earnings and operational efficiency.It's also important to consider the company's focus on renewable power projects. The Fall River project, with 2.4 MW of renewable power nameplate capacity, diversifies the company's product offerings and may provide additional revenue streams. The industry-specific terms such as GGEs, MMBtu and utilization rates are critical for understanding the company's operational capacity and efficiency. For instance, the utilization rates of inlet gas reflect the efficiency of converting feedstock biogas into RNG, which is a key performance indicator in the RNG sector. 03/13/2024 - 05:00 PM WHITE PLAINS, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- OPAL Fuels Inc. (“OPAL Fuels” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: OPAL), a vertically integrated leader in the capture and conversion of biogas into low carbon intensity renewable natural gas (RNG) and renewable electricity, today announced financial and operating results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023. “OPAL Fuels continues to progress on its strategic and operational goals,” said Co-CEO Jonathan Maurer. “Over the last two years, we have more than doubled RNG production and significantly expanded our fueling station network while continuing to organically grow our project pipeline with industry leading partners. We are pleased with our results as we leverage the benefits of our vertically integrated platform.” “Fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial and operational results were in-line with our most recent guidance,” said Maurer. “These results, coupled with achieving strategic initiatives such as closing on our $500 million credit facility and advancing industry partnerships, put us in a position to capitalize on favorable industry fundamentals in 2024.” “We now have 5.2 million MMBtu of annual design capacity online at eight RNG facilities. We anticipate ending the year with 8.8 million MMBtu of RNG capacity online, adding 3.6 million MMBtu in 2024 as Prince William, Sapphire and Polk County (Florida) projects begin operations. We also anticipate bringing online 2.4 MW of renewable power nameplate capacity (0.2 million MMBtu of biomethane equivalent per year) as our Fall River project commences operations in the fourth quarter. Further, we expect several additional RNG projects to enter construction this year and see increasing momentum in Fuel Station Services, supporting growth beyond 2024.” “The tailwinds from the capture and conversion of biogas into low carbon intensity energy products that replace fossil fuels continue to be strong. Constructive domestic and international policy support continues to broaden, and demand for RNG is increasing as positive feedback continues from heavy duty fleets testing RNG,” said Co-CEO Adam Comora. “Our business model is designed to position us to take advantage of these tailwinds and drive growth.” Financial Highlights Revenue for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, was $87.0 million and $256.1 million, respectively, up 30% and 9%, compared to same periods last year. Net income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, was $20.1 million and $127.0 million, respectively, compared to $32.0 million and $32.6 million, in the comparable periods last year.

An explanation of this measure and how it is calculated is also included below under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures."" 2 Design capacity is the annual design output for each facility and may not reflect actual production from the projects, which depends on many variables including, but not limited to, quantity and quality of the biogas, operational up-time of the facility, and actual productivity of the facility. 3 Represents OPAL Fuels' proportional share with respect to RNG projects owned with joint venture partners. Construction Update The Prince William RNG project is mechanically complete and in commissioning. The project will commence commercial operations in the coming weeks. This project, owned 100% by OPAL Fuels, represents approximately 1.7 million MMBtu of annual design capacity. We anticipate commencing commercial operations at our Sapphire RNG project in the third quarter of 2024. This project represents approximately 0.8 million MMBtu for OPAL Fuels’ 50% ownership share of annual design capacity. We expect the Polk County (Florida) RNG project to commence commercial operations in the fourth quarter of 2024. This project, owned 100% by OPAL Fuels, represents approximately 1.1 million MMBtu of annual design capacity. Completion of construction at two dairy projects in California (Hilltop and Vander Schaaf) has been delayed due to a dispute with the Engineering, Procurement and Construction contractor over a series of change order requests.4 The Atlantic RNG project is expected to commence commercial operations in mid-2025. This project represents approximately 0.3 million MMBtu for OPAL Fuels’ 50% ownership share of annual design capacity. The Fall River project is a renewable power project that is expected to commence operations at the end of 2024. This project represents 2.4 MW of renewable power nameplate capacity (0.2 million MMBtus of biomethane equivalent per year) and is 100% owned by OPAL Fuels. ____________________________________________ 4 For more information, please see the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. 2024 Guidance The Company currently estimates that Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2024 will range between $90 million and $100 million. Adjusted EBITDA does not include: Approximately $40 million of potential ITC cash proceeds from Emerald and the three landfill RNG projects coming online this year, which would be included in net income in 2024; An increase of approximately $15 million from RNG pending monetization in 2024, which represents the time lag between the recognition of RNG production costs compared with the associated revenues; and An adjustment for development and project start up expenses5 of approximately $12 million in 2024, which is predominantly the Prince William virtual pipeline expense. We anticipate Adjusted EBITDA from our Fuel Station Services segment to grow by 75%-90% compared to 2023. We expect 2024 RNG production to range from 4.4 to 4.8 million MMBtu. We expect full year 2024 capital expenditures at wholly-owned and joint venture projects to total approximately $230 million. This total includes approximately $28 million for Fuel Station Services and $41 million relating to equity method investments in RNG projects. We anticipate putting into construction at least 2.0 million annual MMBtu of RNG design capacity in 2024 which is included in our 2024 capital expenditure guidance. 2024 guidance assumes a weighted average annual price for D3 RINs of approximately $3.0/gallon, natural gas price of $2.00/MMBtu, and an LCFS credit price of $65.0/metric ton. ___________________ 5Project development and start up expenses will be presented as a separate line item on the Income Statement in 2024.

An explanation of this measure and how it is calculated is also included below under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures."" Landfill RNG Facility Capacity and Utilization Summary Three Months Ended December 31, Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Landfill RNG Facility Capacity and Utilization(1)(2)(3)(4) Design Capacity (Million MMBtus) 1.3 0.9 4.1 3.2 Volume of Inlet Gas (Million MMBtus) 1.0 0.7 3.2 2.4 Inlet Design Capacity Utilization % 80 % 75 % 78 % 75 % RNG Fuel volume produced (Million MMBtus) 0.7 0.6 2.6 2.0 Utilization of Inlet Gas % 79 % 84 % 83 % 86 % (1) Design Capacity for RNG facilities is measured as the volume of feedstock biogas that the facility is capable of accepting at the inlet and processing during the associated period. Design Capacity is presented as OPAL’s ownership share (i.e., net of joint venture partners’ ownership) of the facility and is calculated based on the number of days in the period. New facilities that come online during a quarter are pro-rated for the number of days in commercial operation. (2) Inlet Design Capacity Utilization is measured as the Volume of Inlet Gas for a period, divided by the total Design Capacity for such period. The Volume of Inlet Gas varies over time depending on, among other factors, (i) the quantity and quality of waste deposited at the landfill, (ii) waste management practices by the landfill, and (iii) the construction, operations and maintenance of the landfill gas collection system used to recover the landfill gas. The Design Capacity for each facility will typically be correlated to the amount of landfill gas expected to be generated by the landfill during the term of the related gas rights agreement. The Company expects Inlet Design Capacity Utilization to be in the range of 75-85% on an aggregate basis over the next several years. Typically, newer facilities perform at the lower end of this range and demonstrate increasing utilization as they mature and the biogas resource increases at open landfills. (3) Utilization of Inlet Gas is measured as RNG Fuel Volume Produced divided by the Volume of Inlet Gas. Utilization of Inlet Gas varies over time depending on availability and efficiency of the facility and the quality of landfill gas (i.e., concentrations of methane, oxygen, nitrogen, and other gases). The Company generally expects Utilization of Inlet Gas to be in the range of 80% to 90%. (4) Data not available for the Company's dairy projects, i.e., Sunoma and Biotown. Total RNG fuel design capacity for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023 is 1.3 million MMBtu and 4.3 million MMBtu, respectively. Including Sunoma and Biotown, RNG fuel volume produced is 0.8 and 2.7 million MMBtu for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, respectively.

Liquidity As of December 31, 2023, we have drawn approximately $186.6 million, and utilized $13.8 million of our revolver availability to issue letters of credit, under the $500 million senior secured credit facility we entered into in September 2023. As of December 31, 2023, our liquidity was $347.8 million, consisting of $299.6 million of availability under the above referenced credit facility, and $48.2 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. We believe our liquidity and anticipated cash flows from operations are sufficient to meet our existing funding needs. Capital Expenditures During the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, OPAL Fuels invested $113.8 million across RNG projects in construction and OPAL Fuels proprietary fueling stations in construction as compared to $131.4 million in the prior year. In addition, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, the Company's portion of capital expenditures in unconsolidated entities was $20.6 million. This represents our share of capital expenditures incurred by Paragon for the Emerald and Sapphire projects post deconsolidation.

We believe these measures provide important supplemental information to investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results. We use these measures, together with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""GAAP"" or ""U.S. GAAP""), for internal managerial purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. However, we do not, and you should not, rely on non-GAAP financial measures alone as measures of our performance. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations, that when taken together with GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures that we also provide give a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. We strongly encourage you to review all of our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and to not solely rely on any single non-GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP financial measures are limited as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the Company's GAAP results. The Company expects to continue reporting non-GAAP financial measures, adjusting for the items described below (and/or other items that may arise in the future as the Company's management deems appropriate), and the Company expects to continue to incur expenses, charges or gains like the non-GAAP adjustments described below. Accordingly, unless expressly stated otherwise, the exclusion of these and other similar items in the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that these costs are unusual, infrequent, or non-recurring. These Non-GAAP financial measures are not recognized terms under GAAP and do not purport to be alternatives to GAAP net income or any other GAAP measure as indicators of operating performance. Moreover, because not all companies use identical measures and calculations, the Company's presentation of Non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. We strongly encourage you to review all of our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and to not solely rely on any single non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA To supplement the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company uses a non-GAAP financial measure that it calls adjusted EBITDA (""Adjusted EBITDA""). This non-GAAP measure adjusts net income for interest and financing expense, net, loss on debt extinguishment, net (income) loss attributable to non-controlling interests, depreciation, amortization and accretion expense, adjustments to reflect Adjusted EBITDA from equity method investments, loss on warrant exchange, unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments, non-cash charges, one-time non-recurring expenses, major maintenance on renewable power and gain on deconsolidation of VIEs. Management believes this non-GAAP measure provides meaningful supplemental information about the Company's performance, for the following reasons: (1) it allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management to assess the Company's operating performance and make financial and operational decisions; (2) the measure excludes the effect of items that management believes are not directly attributable to the Company's core operating performance and may obscure trends in the business; (3) the measure better aligns revenues with expenses; and (4) the measure is used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help analyze the Company's business. In future quarters, the Company may adjust for other expenditures, charges or gains to present non-GAAP financial measures that the Company's management believes are indicative of the Company's core operating performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are limited as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the Company's GAAP results. The Company expects to continue reporting non-GAAP financial measures, adjusting for the items described below (and/or other items that may arise in the future as the Company's management deems appropriate), and the Company expects to continue to incur expenses, charges or gains like the non-GAAP adjustments described below. Accordingly, unless expressly stated otherwise, the exclusion of these and other similar items in the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that these costs are unusual, infrequent, or non-recurring. Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized term under GAAP and does not purport to be an alternative to GAAP net income or any other GAAP measure as an indicator of operating performance. Moreover, because not all companies use identical measures and calculations, the Company's presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Onco360 Selected as the Preferred National Specialty Pharmacy Partner for XPOVIO® (selinexor),2024-03-13T20:35:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Onco360, the largest independent Oncology Pharmacy, partners with Karyopharm to distribute XPOVIO, a first-in-class XPO-1 inhibitor for multiple oncology indications.

The partnership aims to improve access to XPOVIO for patients in need.","Onco360 Selected as the Preferred National Specialty Pharmacy Partner for XPOVIO® (selinexor) Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Onco360, the largest independent Oncology Pharmacy, partners with Karyopharm to distribute XPOVIO, a first-in-class XPO-1 inhibitor for multiple oncology indications. XPOVIO is approved for multiple myeloma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, addressing unmet medical needs. The partnership aims to improve access to XPOVIO for patients in need. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Pharmacist The partnership between Onco360 and Karyopharm for the distribution of XPOVIO is a significant development in the field of oncology pharmaceuticals. XPOVIO, being a first-in-class XPO-1 inhibitor, represents a novel approach in treating multiple myeloma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). As an oncology pharmacist, it's crucial to understand the implications of this partnership for patient access to treatment. The availability of XPOVIO through Onco360 may improve the distribution efficiency and accessibility for patients, which is particularly important given the high relapse rate in multiple myeloma and the aggressive nature of DLBCL.From a pharmaceutical standpoint, XPOVIO's mechanism of action, inhibiting the nuclear export protein XPO-1, offers a unique therapeutic option for patients who have exhausted other treatments. This could potentially lead to improved outcomes in a patient population with limited options. However, managing the complex treatment regimens and potential side effects will require specialized knowledge and patient education, which Onco360 is well-positioned to provide as a specialty pharmacy. Market Research Analyst The strategic partnership between Onco360 and Karyopharm could have a substantial impact on the market dynamics of oncology treatments. As a market research analyst, assessing the potential market penetration and growth prospects is essential. XPOVIO's approval for multiple indications broadens its target patient population, potentially increasing its market share in the oncology segment. Onco360's role as a national specialty pharmacy network partner may enhance Karyopharm's distribution capabilities and market reach, possibly leading to increased sales and revenue.It is important to monitor how this partnership affects Karyopharm's market position relative to competitors, especially those with established treatments for multiple myeloma and DLBCL. The partnership's success will also depend on the efficacy and safety profile of XPOVIO, as well as the ability of Onco360 to effectively manage and support the treatment's distribution and patient adherence. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the partnership between Onco360 and Karyopharm is likely to influence Karyopharm's financial performance. As a financial analyst, it's important to evaluate how this partnership might affect Karyopharm's revenue streams, given that XPOVIO is approved for multiple oncology indications. The drug's positioning as a treatment option for patients with limited alternatives could command a premium pricing strategy, potentially leading to higher profit margins.Investors should consider the costs associated with the partnership, such as marketing and distribution expenses, against the anticipated increase in sales volume. Additionally, the long-term financial impact will hinge on the drug's clinical success and adoption by healthcare providers. It's also vital to assess the potential risks, including competition from emerging therapies and the possibility of adverse clinical findings affecting drug utilization. 03/13/2024 - 04:35 PM LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Onco360®, the nation’s largest independent Oncology Pharmacy, is now the national specialty pharmacy network partner for Karyopharm’s product XPOVIO® (selinexor), a first-in-class, XPO-1 inhibitor. XPOVIO is approved in multiple oncology indications, including: (i) in combination with Velcade® (bortezomib) and dexamethasone (XVd) in patients with multiple myeloma after at least one prior therapy; (ii) in combination with dexamethasone in patients with heavily pre-treated multiple myeloma; and (iii) in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), including DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma, after at least two lines of systemic therapy. “Onco360 is excited to expand our partnership with the team at Karyopharm and become the preferred national specialty pharmacy partner for XPOVIO,” said Benito Fernandez, Chief Commercial Officer. Multiple myeloma is an incurable hematological malignancy involving plasma cells. Only 50 percent of patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma survive past five years following initial diagnosis. The National Cancer Institute estimates that in 2018, approximately 30,770 new patients were diagnosed with multiple myeloma in the U.S.1 Unfortunately, most multiple myeloma patients will relapse following the first complete remission and often require continuous treatment to prevent disease progression. Previously, there were no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved products or regimens for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who failed treatment with lenalidomide, pomalidomide, bortezomib, carfilzomib, and/or daratumumab. XPOVIO is manufactured by Karyopharm Therapeutics, and has received multiple approvals from the U.S. FDA since 2019.2 XPOVIO functions by selectively binding to and inhibiting the nuclear export protein XPO-1.

Reports February 2024 Operating Data Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Robinhood Markets, Inc. reported strong growth in February 2024 with 23.6 million funded customers, $118.7 billion in Assets Under Custody, and $3.6 billion in Net Deposits. Trading volumes increased across all asset classes, with notable growth in Equity, Options, and Crypto trading. Margin Balances and Cash Sweep Balances also saw positive growth. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported growth in Funded Customers and Assets Under Custody (AUC) for Robinhood indicates a positive trend in customer acquisition and retention, which is crucial for the company's revenue generation. A 16% month-over-month increase in AUC and a 29% annual growth rate in Net Deposits are significant indicators of customer trust and an expanding user base. These metrics are essential for evaluating the company's financial health and growth trajectory, especially when considering the competitive landscape of online brokerage platforms. Moreover, the substantial increase in Trading Volumes across all asset classes suggests heightened trading activity, which could lead to increased transaction-based revenues. The rise in Margin Balances and Total Cash Sweep Balances also points to an increase in revenue-generating activities for Robinhood, such as interest on margin lending and cash management services. However, it is important to note the potential risks associated with margin lending, such as credit risk and market volatility that could affect the company's financial stability. The Total Securities Lending Revenue, despite being up 8% month-over-month, shows a year-over-year decline of 24%. This discrepancy could be due to a variety of factors, including changes in market demand for securities lending or alterations in Robinhood's revenue strategies. Investors should monitor these figures closely, as they could have implications for future revenue and profitability. Market Research Analyst Robinhood's performance metrics provide valuable insights into user engagement and platform utilization. The growth in Equity Notional Trading Volumes and Options Contracts Traded is indicative of an increased appetite for investment risk, which may be driven by market conditions or enhanced user confidence in Robinhood's platform. The uptick in Crypto Notional Trading Volumes reflects the ongoing interest in cryptocurrency trading, despite the volatile nature of this asset class. It is also noteworthy that the Total Cash Sweep Balances have seen a substantial year-over-year increase. This could suggest that users are opting to keep more idle cash in their Robinhood accounts, potentially due to the platform's cash management features or as a strategic response to the current interest rate environment. This trend can be seen as a positive sign of user engagement and trust in the platform's ability to manage funds. These metrics provide a snapshot of Robinhood's operational performance and can be used to benchmark against competitors. The data suggests that Robinhood is successfully capitalizing on market opportunities and user trends, which could have favorable implications for its market position and future growth prospects. Economist The data from Robinhood reflects broader economic trends, such as retail investor participation in the financial markets and the impact of economic conditions on investment behavior. The increase in Net Deposits and Assets Under Custody implies that despite potential economic headwinds, retail investors remain active, which could be a sign of consumer confidence or a search for yield in a low-interest-rate environment. This behavior has implications for the overall market liquidity and volatility. Furthermore, the rise in Margin Balances suggests that investors may be leveraging their investments to capitalize on market opportunities, which could amplify market movements. The growth in Trading Volumes indicates that retail investors continue to play a significant role in market dynamics. This can have both stabilizing effects, through increased liquidity and destabilizing effects, if driven by speculative trading. Lastly, the increase in Cash Sweep Balances could be interpreted as a sign that investors are keeping cash reserves in a volatile market, which may reflect a cautious outlook on future market conditions. This behavior could potentially influence monetary policy considerations, such as interest rate decisions, which affect the broader economy. 03/13/2024 - 04:05 PM MENLO PARK, Calif., March 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robinhood Markets, Inc.

Management Commentary “Our fourth quarter was a strong finish to an incredible year for Jushi as we successfully increased our margins through our commitments to reducing operating expenses and driving operational efficiencies across the business,” said Jim Cacioppo, Chief Executive Officer, Chairman, and Founder of Jushi. “Looking ahead we expect to continue to strengthen our profitability through further optimization of our grower processor facilities, including reducing green waste, increasing our yields and potency, and introducing higher margin products in our vertical markets. In addition to our improved profitability, we continue to focus on de-levering our balance sheet.” Mr. Cacioppo continued, “During the year, we launched new SKUs into the market that were developed using the proprietary retail data and consumer insights we have gathered across our footprint. Focusing on proprietary retail data and consumer insights during the development process has helped us develop products that are in demand and fit into the marketplace enabling us to add more Jushi-branded products on shelves. These new products, including Sѐchѐ Kind Grind and Fine Grind, have been performing exceptionally well and have helped grow our Jushi-branded sales to approximately 53% of our total retail revenue across our vertical footprint in Q4 2023.” Mr. Cacioppo concluded, ""I am incredibly proud of what our team has accomplished this past year, and we believe we are extremely well-positioned and ready for potential new adult-use markets to come online in key states such as Virginia and Pennsylvania.” Financial Results for the Fourth Quarter Ended December 31, 2023($ in millions) Quarter EndedDecember 31,2023 Quarter EndedDecember 31,2022 % ChangeRevenue$67.8 $76.8 (11.8)%Gross profit$27.2 $22.0 24.0 %Selling, general and administrative expenses$25.2 $39.1 (35.6)%Asset impairments$8.6 $122.0 (93.0)%Net loss$(18.0) $(139.9) 87.1 %Adjusted EBITDA1$11.3 $6.0 88.3 % Revenue in Q4 2023 decreased 11.8% to $67.8 million as compared to $76.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 (“Q4 2022”). The year-over-year decrease in revenue can be attributed to a reduction in Nevada and Pennsylvania sales due to increased competition and pricing pressures, a reduction in Illinois sales due to the impact of the state of Missouri beginning adult-use (i.e. recreational) cannabis sales, and the closure of four underperforming stores in California and Pennsylvania. The decrease was partially offset by increased sales in Ohio, Massachusetts, and Virginia. In our five vertical markets, Jushi-branded product sales grew as a percentage of total retail sales from 47% in Q4 2022, to 52% in Q3 2023, to approximately 53% in Q4 2023. Gross profit in Q4 2023 was $27.2 million, or 40.2% of revenue, compared to $22.0 million, or 28.6% of revenue in Q4 2022. Year-over-year improvements in gross profit and gross profit margin were driven by increased operating efficiencies at the Company's grower-processor facilities, as well as increased sell-through of our branded products which have higher margins. This increase was partially offset by market price compression and increased competition in Nevada and Pennsylvania, as well as in Illinois due to the impact of the state of Missouri beginning adult-use. Selling, general and administrative expenses for Q4 2023 were $25.2 million compared to $39.1 million in Q4 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by lower salaries, wages, and employee-related expenses due to a decrease in the number of employees as the Company worked to right size the organization, as well as due to changes to the Company's staffing model at retail stores. Additionally, lower share-based compensation expense reflects lower value of share-based compensation granted as well as forfeitures of unvested equity awards. Asset impairments for Q4 2023 were $8.6 million compared to $122.0 million in Q4 2022. The asset impairment charges primarily related to indefinite-lived assets. The net loss for Q4 2023 was $18.0 million, compared to a net loss of $139.9 million in Q4 2022. The decrease in the net loss was driven primarily by asset impairment charges in Q4 2022 as discussed above, lower fair value gain on derivatives, and loss on redemption of the 10% senior notes in 2022, partially offset by increased gross profit. Adjusted EBITDA1 in Q4 2023 was $11.3 million compared to $6.0 million in Q4 2022. The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA1 is primarily due to increased gross profit due to realizing the benefits of operational efficiencies and a reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses as discussed above. 1See “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information” and “Unaudited Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA and Calculation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin” below. Financial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2023($ in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2023 Year Ended December 31, 2022 % ChangeRevenue$269.4 $284.3 (5.2)%Gross profit$116.2 $95.5 21.7 %Selling, general and administrative expenses$110.5 $156.2 (29.3)%Asset impairments$8.6 $159.6 (94.6)%Net loss$(65.1) $(202.3) 67.8 %Adjusted EBITDA1$40.8 $7.1 474.6 % Revenue decreased 5.2% to $269.4 million, compared to $284.3 million in 2022. The year-over-year decrease can be attributed to a reduction in Pennsylvania sales due to increased competition, a reduction in Illinois sales due to the impact of the state of Missouri beginning adult-use (i.e., recreational) cannabis sales, and the closure of four underperforming stores in California and Pennsylvania. The decrease in retail revenue was partially offset by new Beyond Hello™ dispensary openings in Virginia and Ohio, and increased wholesale revenue from continued advancements at our cultivation and processing facilities that have enabled us to diversify our product offerings and increase our competitiveness with respect to quality, cost, and distribution. The Company ended 2023 with thirty-four operating dispensaries in seven states, as compared to thirty-five in six states at the end of 2022. Gross profit was $116.2 million, or 43.1% of revenue, in 2023 compared to $95.5 million, or 33.6% of revenue, in 2022. The improvement in gross profit was driven by operating efficiencies at our grower-processor facilities and cost optimization initiatives such as changes to our packaging and changes to our retail labor model. The benefit of these improvements was partially offset by declines in retail revenue in Illinois and Pennsylvania driven by competition both inside of such states and, with respect to Illinois, in neighboring Missouri. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $110.5 million in 2023 compared to $156.2 million in 2022. Salaries, wages, and employee-related expenses decreased due to a decrease in the number of employees as the Company works to right size the organization, as well as due to changes to the Company's staffing model at the retail stores. Lower share-based compensation expense reflects lower value of share-based compensation granted as well as forfeitures of unvested equity awards. Additionally, 2022 included general and administrative expenses related to the Company's transition to GAAP reporting and costs associated with the Company's registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC""). Asset impairments for 2023 were $8.6 million compared to $159.6 million in 2022. The asset impairment charges primarily related to indefinite-lived assets. The net loss in 2023 was $65.1 million, primarily due to a loss from operations of $2.8 million, net interest expense of $37.0 million, income tax expense of $31.8 million, and other expense of $3.1 million, which was partially offset by fair value gain on derivatives of $9.6 million. This compared to a net loss of $202.3 million in 2022 primarily due to a loss from operations of $220.3 million that included non-cash asset impairment charges as previously discussed, net interest expense of $45.6 million, income tax expense of $8.4 million, and other expense of $19.8 million primarily relating to loss on redemption of the 10% senior notes in 2022, which was partially offset by a gain on the fair value of derivatives of $91.9 million. Adjusted EBITDA1 in 2023 was $40.8 million compared to $7.1 million in 2022 representing an improvement of $33.7 million. The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA1 is primarily due to increased gross profit and realizing the benefits of operational efficiencies. 1See “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information” and “Unaudited Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA and Calculation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin” below. Balance Sheet and Liquidity As of December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately $31.3 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. For FY 2023, the Company paid $10.7 million in capital expenditures. In 2024, the Company expects maintenance capital expenditures to be approximately $3.0 - $5.0 million.

As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $225.6 million in principal amount of total debt, excluding leases and property, plant, and equipment financing obligations. Excluding the notes payable to Sammartino and the Jushi Europe debt as the repayments of these two debts are contingent on the resolution of the Sammartino matter and the completion of the liquidation of Jushi Europe, respectively, the Company had $200.8 million in principal amount of debt that is subject to scheduled repayments. As of March 8, 2024, the Company’s issued and outstanding shares were 196,634,931 and its fully diluted shares outstanding were 312,786,702.

We use non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes and to evaluate our financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin (each as defined below). We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect our ongoing business by excluding the effects of expenses that are not reflective of our operating business performance and allow for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in our business. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies. As there are no standardized methods of calculating these non-GAAP measures, our methods may differ from those used by others, and accordingly, the use of these measures may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by others, thus limiting their usefulness. Accordingly, these non-GAAP measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are financial measures that are not defined under GAAP. We define EBITDA as net income (loss), or “earnings”, before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before: (i) non-cash share-based compensation expense; (ii) inventory-related adjustments; (iii) fair value changes in derivatives; (iv) other income/expense items (v) transaction costs; (vi) asset impairment; (vii) loss on debt extinguishment; and (viii) start-up costs. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total revenue. These financial measures are metrics that have been adjusted from the GAAP net income (loss) measure in an effort to provide readers with a normalized metric in making comparisons more meaningful across the cannabis industry, as well as to remove non-recurring, irregular and one-time items that may otherwise distort the GAAP net income measure. Other companies in our industry may calculate this measure differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.

(2) Includes amounts that are included in cost of goods sold and in operating expenses. (3) Includes: (i) inventory step-up on business combinations; (ii) inventory recall reserves; and (iii) reserves for discontinued products. The inventory step-up on business combinations relates to the fair value write-up on inventory acquired on the business acquisition date and then sold subsequent to the acquisition date. The inventory recall reserves relate to the estimated impact of the Pennsylvania Department of Health recall and ban of vape products containing certain cannabis concentrates. The ban was lifted in June 2022. (4) Includes: (i) remeasurement of contingent consideration related to acquisitions; (ii) losses (gains) on investments and financial assets; (iii) losses (gains) on legal settlements; (iv) severance costs; (v) foreign exchange losses (gains); and (vi) indemnification asset adjustments related to acquisitions. (5) Expansion and start-up costs incurred in order to prepare a location for its intended use. Start-up costs are expensed as incurred and are not indicative of ongoing operations of each new location. (6) Transaction costs include: (i) registration statement costs such as professional fees and other costs relating to our SEC registration; and (ii) acquisition and deal costs. (7) The sum of the four quarters in 2023 will not add to the year to date amounts due to an overstatement of $503 add back relating to net foreign exchange losses.

Net income increased to $3.6 million compared to the prior year. EBITDA improved to $9.9 million from $3.5 million in the previous year. Full-year 2024 outlook includes sales forecasted at $558-568 million and earnings per share of $0.61-0.68. Negative None. Financial Analyst Superior Group of Companies' financial results indicate a marginal decrease in net sales by 0.9%, which may seem negligible but can be a signal of a plateau in revenue growth or increased competition. However, the increase in net income from $2.2 million to $3.6 million suggests improved operational efficiency or cost management. The substantial rise in EBITDA from an adjusted $3.5 million to $9.9 million is particularly noteworthy, representing a significant improvement in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which could imply better cash flow management and profitability.The provided outlook for 2024, with sales forecasted to grow to $558 million to $568 million, indicates optimism about the company's revenue growth. The forecasted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.61 to $0.68, up from $0.54 diluted adjusted EPS, suggests an expectation of continued profitability improvements. This guidance will be closely monitored by investors as it provides a proxy for the company's financial health and future performance. Market Research Analyst Superior Group of Companies' reference to strong retention and new client wins may reflect the company's competitive positioning and customer satisfaction levels. The mention of growth in all three attractive end markets signifies potential for expansion and increased market share. However, investors should consider the highly fragmented nature of these markets, which could present both opportunities and challenges in terms of competition and market penetration.The company's statement about a stronger financial position enabling market share capture and shareholder value enhancement could be indicative of strategic investments or acquisitions planned for 2024. This strategic direction, if executed effectively, could positively impact the company's long-term market standing and stock performance. Economist The company's performance and optimistic outlook must be contextualized within the broader economic environment. Factors such as inflation, interest rates and economic growth rates can significantly influence the company's operating costs, consumer demand and overall financial health. Given the current economic indicators and market trends, the company's ability to improve profitability despite a slight sales decline could be viewed as a robust operational outcome.Moreover, the company's improved balance sheet, as indicated by the CEO, is a positive sign for financial stability. A strong balance sheet can provide a buffer against economic downturns and enable the company to invest in growth opportunities, which is essential for long-term shareholder value creation. 03/13/2024 - 04:05 PM – Total net sales of $147.2 million versus $148.6 million in prior year fourth quarter –– Net income of $3.6 million versus net income of $2.2 million in prior year fourth quarter –– EBITDA of $9.9 million versus adjusted $3.5 million in prior year fourth quarter –– Provides full-year outlook – ST.

With our strong retention and new client wins, we are optimistic that we will continue to drive improved performance and consistently solid results. All three of our attractive end markets are growing and highly fragmented, and we believe our stronger financial position will enable us to take additional market share and enhance shareholder value in 2024 and beyond.” Fourth Quarter Results For the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023, net sales decreased 0.9% to $147.2 million compared to fourth quarter 2022 net sales of $148.6 million.

The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of operating performance because it allows management, investors and others to evaluate and compare the Company’s core operating results from period to period by removing (i) the impact of the Company’s capital structure (interest expense from outstanding debt), (ii) tax consequences, (iii) asset base (depreciation and amortization), (iv) the non-cash charges from asset impairments and (v) gains or losses on the sale of property, plant and equipment. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA internally to monitor operating results and to evaluate the performance of its business. In addition, the compensation committee has used Adjusted EBITDA in evaluating certain components of executive compensation, including performance-based annual incentive programs. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. The items excluded to calculate Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing the Company’s results of operations. The presentation of the Company’s Adjusted EBITDA may change from time to time, including as a result of changed business conditions, new accounting pronouncements or otherwise. If the presentation changes, the Company undertakes to disclose any change between periods and the reasons underlying that change. The Company’s Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of another company because other entities may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner. (2) The tax impact of adjustments includes the tax effect of each separate adjustment based on the statutory tax rate for the jurisdiction(s) in which the adjustment was taxable or deductible, and the tax effect of items that relate to tax specific financial transactions. (3) Adjusted net income (loss) and diluted adjusted net income (loss) per share, which are non-GAAP measures, are defined as net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share, excluding the impacts of impairment charges and gains or losses on the sale of property, plant and equipment. Management believes adjusted net income (loss) and diluted adjusted net income (loss) per share provides useful information to investors because it allows management, investors and others to evaluate and compare our operating results from period to period by removing the impact of impairment charges and gains or losses on the sale of property, plant and equipment that are not reflective of our core business. (4) Diluted weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate diluted adjusted net loss per share excludes shares of common stock of 234,198 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as the Company recognized an adjusted net loss and their inclusion would have been antidilutive. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate diluted adjusted net income per share includes shares of common stock of 400,381 for the year ended December 31, 2022. These shares were excluded from diluted weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate diluted net income (loss) per share, as the Company recognized a net loss and their inclusion would have been antidilutive.

Financially, the company had $10.7 million in cash by December 31, 2023, with a net loss of $2.0 million for the quarter. Positive Positive initial clinical data for QRX003 in Netherton Syndrome study Lowered eligibility age for enrollment to fourteen years and older No safety concerns observed in ongoing clinical studies Cash runway extended into the second half of 2025 with $6.5 million offering on March 5th Additional extension of cash runway by $8 million Equity Line of Credit arrangement FDA clearance for teen subject recruitment in Netherton Syndrome studies Filed patent applications for novel Netherton Syndrome combination product Positive clinical data from open-label trial with significant improvement in pruritus Improvement in skin scoring system and favorable impression of QRX003 by subjects Financially, $10.7 million in cash, with net loss of $2.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 Negative None. Medical Research Analyst Quoin Pharmaceuticals Ltd.'s announcement regarding the positive initial clinical data for QRX003 in treating Netherton Syndrome is a significant milestone in the field of rare and orphan diseases. The observed clinical benefits in the first six subjects, coupled with no reported safety concerns, suggest a favorable risk-benefit profile for the drug. This data may expedite the drug's development pathway, potentially leading to an accelerated approval process. The expansion of the trial to include adolescents broadens the potential patient base and underscores the unmet need within this demographic.From a research perspective, the efficacy metrics, such as reduction in pruritus and improvement in skin scoring, are critical. They not only demonstrate QRX003's potential impact on patients' quality of life but also strengthen the drug's value proposition. It is important to monitor the long-term outcomes and any emerging safety data as the trial progresses to ensure these initial results translate into sustained therapeutic benefits. Financial Analyst The financial stability of Quoin Pharmaceuticals, as indicated by its cash runway extension into the second half of 2025, provides the firm with a solid financial footing to continue its clinical trials without the immediate need for further capital raising. This is reassuring for investors, as it suggests that the company can focus on its core operations and drug development without the overhang of short-term financing concerns.Additionally, the $6.5 million capital raise and the $8 million equity line of credit arrangement, pending shareholder approval, are strategic moves that could potentially dilute current shareholders but also provide the necessary funds to reach critical milestones. The net loss figures show a marginal improvement year-over-year, which, while not indicative of profitability, may signal a controlled burn rate and efficient use of capital in the company's operations. Market Research Analyst The market potential for QRX003 targeting Netherton Syndrome, a rare and underserved condition, could be substantial given the lack of approved treatments. The company's strategic patent filings for a novel combination product further indicate an attempt to solidify its market position and create barriers to entry for competitors.Investors and stakeholders should consider the implications of Quoin's recent FDA clearances and clinical optimizations, as these developments may enhance the company's reputation and credibility within the biopharmaceutical sector. The market reaction to these milestones will likely be contingent upon continued positive data and the successful navigation of the regulatory pathway. 03/13/2024 - 04:05 PM Company reported positive initial clinical data for QRX003 from first six evaluable subjects in ongoing open-label Netherton Syndrome study with positive benefits observed across a number of clinical endpoints Eligibility age for enrollment into both studies has been lowered to fourteen years and older No safety concerns have been observed to date in either ongoing clinical study Quoin expects its cash runway will extend into the second half of 2025 following $6.5 million offering on March 5th Cash Runway to be further extended by $8 million Equity Line of Credit arrangement signed January 25, 2024 ASHBURN, Va., March 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Quoin Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (NASDAQ: QNRX) (the “Company” or “Quoin”), a clinical stage, specialty pharmaceutical company focused on rare and orphan diseases, today provides a business update and announces financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. Quoin CEO, Dr. Michael Myers, said, “2023 marked another year of significant progress for Quoin and for the development of QRX003 for the treatment of Netherton Syndrome. Notably, we released initial positive data from our open label clinical study, representing a first for the very underserved Netherton community. That progress has continued, and based on the strength of the initial positive clinical data, we implemented a number of important protocol changes that we believe could lead to a more streamlined development program overall. “We have also strengthened our balance sheet through the recently completed $6.5 million capital raise and we have the capacity to further solidify our cash position via the $8.0 million equity line of credit transaction we entered into earlier this year, once shareholder approval is received. We continue to believe that Quoin is in position to deliver the first approved treatment for this terrible disease.” Recent Corporate Highlights – On March 4th, Quoin announced FDA Clearance to recruit teen subjects into both ongoing Netherton Syndrome clinical studies.On February 8th, 2024, Quoin filed U.S. and International patent applications for a novel Netherton Syndrome combination product.On December 13th, Quoin announced FDA clearance of the Clinical Optimization Plan for QRX003 for Netherton SyndromeOn October 24th, Quoin announced positive clinical data from the first six evaluable patients in the company’s open-label clinical trial in Netherton Syndrome patients. Five of the six subjects reported that their pruritus, or itch, was either negligible or absent following treatment with QRX003, a significant improvement from prior to the study.All six subjects exhibited improvement in the Investigator assessed skin scoring system with three subjects showing improvement at the completion of the study and the other three at various points during the study.All six subjects expressed a favorable impression of QRX003 across multiple assessed metrics.No safety concerns have been reported to date for any subject in either of Quoin’s studies.

Adjusted EBITDA net loss improved in Q4 2023 to $2.9 million from $4.7 million in Q4 2022. Net cash used in operating activities decreased to $14.7 million in 2023 from $16.6 million in 2022.

Negative Decrease in cash position from $18.0 million in 2022 to $10.6 million in 2023 despite raising $7.5 million through a direct offering in July 2023. Financial Analyst An 87% increase in net sales for electroCore is a significant leap, indicative of a robust demand for the company's bioelectronic medicine and wellness products. The gross margin improvement from 81% to 83% suggests that the company is effectively managing its cost of goods sold (COGS), a key indicator of operational efficiency and profitability. However, the reported GAAP net loss of $18.8 million, despite being an improvement over the previous year's $22.2 million, raises concerns about the company's current profitability and cash burn rate.Investors should note the company's cash position which decreased from $18.0 million to $10.6 million year-over-year, signaling a substantial cash burn despite the capital raised in July. This trend, if sustained, could lead to future liquidity challenges or the need for additional funding, which might dilute current shareholders or impose additional debt burdens.Adjusted EBITDA net loss figures are often scrutinized as they exclude certain expenses that are nonetheless real costs to the business. The improvement in adjusted EBITDA net loss from $19.0 million to $15.4 million indicates some level of cost control, but stakeholders should be wary of overreliance on these figures for a true health assessment of the company. Market Research Analyst The substantial revenue growth in the prescription gammaCore segment, particularly from the VA/DoD channel, suggests that electroCore is gaining traction within the governmental healthcare sector, which is a promising sign for future contracts and stability. The expansion in international sales and the successful introduction of nonprescription products like Truvaga and TAC-STIM also highlight the company's diversification strategy and potential for market expansion.However, the slight decrease in U.S. commercial sales of Rx gammaCore raises questions about market saturation or competitive pressures in the domestic market. It is important to analyze the company's marketing strategies and customer acquisition costs to ensure that the increased spending in these areas is yielding proportional benefits.Investors should consider the company's product pipeline and any upcoming regulatory milestones that could significantly impact future sales. The R&D investments mentioned by the company in smart phone-integrated therapies could represent a strategic move to capitalize on the growing digital health market. Medical Research Analyst The performance of electroCore's medical devices, such as gammaCore, is a testament to the increasing acceptance and integration of bioelectronic medicine into treatment paradigms. The technology's non-invasive nature and application in various conditions, including migraine and cluster headache, may be driving its adoption. The company's ability to maintain a high gross margin suggests that its products have a competitive edge in terms of cost-effectiveness and value proposition to healthcare providers.Future R&D focus on smart phone-connected therapies could tap into the trend of personalized and accessible healthcare solutions. The efficacy and user-friendliness of such technologies will be critical for their success. It will be important to monitor clinical trial outcomes and peer-reviewed publications to assess the potential impact of these therapies on patient outcomes and healthcare costs. 03/13/2024 - 04:05 PM Record full year 2023 net sales of $16.0 million increased 87% over $8.6 million for the full year 2022 Company to host conference call and webcast today, March 13, 2024 at 4:30pm EST ROCKAWAY, N.J., March 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- electroCore, Inc.

Research and development expense for the full year of 2023 was $5.3 million as compared to $5.5 million for the full year of 2022. This decrease in research and development expense was due to a decrease in compensation associated with cost cutting measures effected April 1, 2023, offset by targeted investments to support the future iterations of our therapy delivery platform, including the use of our intellectual property around the delivery of smart phone-integrated and smart phone-connected non-invasive therapies. Selling, general and administrative expense for the full year of 2023 was $27.2 million as compared to $24.3 million for the full year of 2022.

Management uses this non-GAAP measure principally as a measure of the Company’s core operating performance and believes that this measure is useful to investors because it is frequently used by the financial community, investors, and other interested parties to evaluate companies in the Company’s industry. The Company also believes that this measure is useful to its management and investors as a measure of comparative operating performance from period to period. Additionally, the Company believes its use of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA net loss from operations facilitates management’s internal comparisons to historical operating results by factoring out potential differences caused by gains and charges not related to its regular, ongoing business, including, without limitation, non-cash charges and certain large and unpredictable charges such as restructuring expenses. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA net loss as GAAP net loss, adjusting to exclude non-operating gains/losses, depreciation and amortization, stock-compensation expense, write-off of right of use operating lease, inventory reserve charges, legal fees associated with stockholders’ litigation, and provision/benefit from income taxes. A reconciliation of GAAP net loss to Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA net loss is provided in the financial statement table below.

Some of these limitations are: (i) the non-GAAP measure does not reflect interest or tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available; (ii) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and the non-GAAP measure does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; (iii) the non-GAAP measure does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; and (iv) the non-GAAP measure does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for working capital needs; other companies, including companies in electroCore’s industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA net loss differently, effectively reducing its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider the non-GAAP measure together with other GAAP-based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net loss, and other GAAP results. A reconciliation of GAAP net loss to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA net loss has been provided in the preceding financial statements table of this press release. What were electroCore, Inc.'s (ECOR) net sales for the full year 2023? electroCore reported net sales of $16.0 million for the full year 2023, representing an 87% increase over 2022. What contributed to the increase in net sales for electroCore in 2023? The increase in net sales was attributed to growth across major channels, including prescription gammaCore devices and revenue from nonprescription products. What was electroCore's gross profit for 2023? electroCore's gross profit for 2023 was $13.2 million with a gross margin of 83%. How did electroCore's operating expenses change in 2023 compared to 2022? Operating expenses increased to approximately $32.5 million in 2023 from $29.9 million in 2022. What was electroCore's GAAP net loss for 2023? electroCore reported a GAAP net loss of $18.8 million for 2023, an improvement from the $22.2 million net loss in 2022."

Reports Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2023 Financial Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary SuRo Capital Corp. announces a Net Asset Value of $7.99 per share as of December 31, 2023, along with a Modified Dutch Auction Tender Offer to repurchase up to 2 million shares. The company's financial results for Q4 and fiscal year 2023 show net assets of approximately $203.4 million, with notable investments in various portfolio companies. SuRo Capital aims to enhance shareholder value through strategic initiatives and believes the market undervalues its portfolio. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported Net Asset Value (NAV) of $7.99 per share by SuRo Capital as of December 31, 2023, indicates a moderate increase from the previous year's $7.39 per share but a decrease from $8.41 per share in the preceding quarter. This fluctuation in NAV reflects the company's asset valuation adjustments and investment performance over time. The modified Dutch Auction tender offer to repurchase up to 2 million shares is a strategic move to manage the company's capital structure and potentially enhance shareholder value, particularly as the share price trades at a discount to NAV. This repurchase program could signal management's confidence in the intrinsic value of their portfolio and may be accretive to NAV per share if executed below the current NAV.Investors should note the company's investment activity, including new investments in privately held companies and follow-on investments, which suggest an active portfolio management approach. The top five investments, representing 56% of the total portfolio, indicate a concentrated exposure which can lead to higher volatility in NAV based on the performance of these key holdings. The investment in Liquid Death, a consumer packaged goods brand, reflects a strategic move into a high-growth potential market, which could diversify the portfolio's risk profile. Market Research Analyst The broader market context mentioned by SuRo Capital's CEO, with megacap stocks driving public indices and a decline in private market valuations, sets the stage for potential opportunities in undervalued assets. SuRo Capital's strategy to capitalize on these conditions by investing in new and existing portfolio companies could position the firm well if the market corrects these valuations upward. The focus on sectors like logistics, technology and consumer goods, through investments in companies like FourKites, Xpoint and Liquid Death, aligns with current trends of digital transformation and consumer health consciousness, potentially offering robust growth prospects.However, the concentration of the portfolio in a few significant investments can pose risks if any single investment underperforms. Diversification across more holdings or sectors could mitigate this risk. Stakeholders should also consider the impact of lock-up provisions on publicly held companies within the portfolio, which may restrict liquidity and affect the timing of potential returns. Legal Expert The modified Dutch Auction tender offer is a notable corporate action that requires careful legal structuring to comply with securities regulations. It offers shareholders the option to tender their shares at a chosen price within a specified range, which can be beneficial for both the company and shareholders. The company can repurchase shares below NAV, which may be accretive to the remaining shareholders, while shareholders have the opportunity to liquidate their holdings at a potentially favorable price.Additionally, the legal implications of holding both private and public equity, particularly with lock-up provisions, necessitate robust compliance frameworks to manage insider trading risks and reporting obligations. Investors should be aware that such provisions can affect the liquidity and valuation of these assets, potentially impacting the timing and magnitude of realized returns. 03/13/2024 - 04:05 PM Net Asset Value of $7.99 Per Share as of December 31, 2023 Modified Dutch Auction Tender Offer to Repurchase Up To 2 Million Shares Commenced on February 20 NEW YORK, March 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SuRo Capital Corp. (“SuRo Capital”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “our”) (Nasdaq: SSSS) today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Net assets totaled approximately $203.4 million, or $7.99 per share, at December 31, 2023, as compared to $8.41 per share at September 30, 2023 and $7.39 per share at December 31, 2022. “In 2023, public market indices were driven higher by a handful of megacap stocks, while the private markets saw decreased valuations and fundraising volume. We have stated for several quarters that we believe valuations are becoming more attractive and that we are continuing to see more investable opportunities. We are now executing on these opportunities. During the fourth quarter, we added one new portfolio company through a $1.6 million investment in Colombier Sponsor II LLC and completed a $2.7 million follow-on investment in FourKites, Inc. and a $0.3 million follow-on investment in XGroup Holdings Limited (d/b/a Xpoint) through SuRo Capital Sports, LLC. Subsequent to year-end, we added one new portfolio company through a $10.0 million primary investment in Supplying Demand, Inc. (d/b/a Liquid Death), a CPG brand focused on still water, sparkling water, and teas,” said Mark Klein, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of SuRo Capital. “As we have consistently demonstrated, SuRo Capital is committed to initiatives that enhance shareholder value, and we believe the market is currently undervaluing our portfolio. Accordingly, as previously announced on February 14, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a modified Dutch Auction tender offer to purchase up to 2.0 million shares of our common stock at a price per share between $4.00 and $5.00. Given that our stock is trading at a significant discount to net asset value per share, we believe the modified Dutch Auction tender offer to be an efficient and accretive deployment of capital,” Mr. Klein concluded. Investment Portfolio as of December 31, 2023 At December 31, 2023, SuRo Capital held positions in 38 portfolio companies – 34 privately held and 4 publicly held, some of which may be subject to certain lock-up provisions – with an aggregate fair value of approximately $184.1 million, excluding short-term US treasuries. The Company’s top five portfolio company investments accounted for approximately 56% of the total portfolio at fair value as of December 31, 2023.

Modified Dutch Auction Tender Offer On February 14, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a modified Dutch Auction tender offer (the “Tender Offer”) to purchase up to 2,000,000 shares of its common stock at a price per share not less than $4.00 and not greater than $5.00 in $0.10 increments, using available cash. The Tender Offer commenced on February 20, 2024 and will expire at 5:00 P.M. Eastern Time on April 1, 2024, unless extended. If the Tender Offer is fully subscribed, the Company will purchase 2,000,000 shares, or approximately 7.9%, of the Company’s outstanding shares of its common stock. Any shares tendered may be withdrawn prior to expiration of the Tender Offer. Stockholders that do not wish to participate in the Tender Offer do not need to take any action. Based on the number of shares tendered and the prices specified by the tendering stockholders, the Company will determine the lowest per-share price that will enable it to acquire up to 2,000,000 shares of its common stock. All shares accepted in the Tender Offer will be purchased at the same price even if tendered at a lower price. The Tender Offer is not contingent upon any minimum number of shares being tendered. The Tender Offer is, however, subject to other conditions, which are disclosed in the Tender Offer documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 20, 2024. In the future, the Board of Directors may consider additional tender offer(s) or other measures to enhance shareholder value based upon a variety of factors, including the market price of the Company’s common stock and its net asset value. The Company’s Board of Directors is not making any recommendation to stockholders as to whether to tender or refrain from tendering their shares into the Tender Offer. Stockholders must decide how many shares they will tender, if any, and the price within the stated range at which they will offer their shares for purchase. The information agent for the Tender Offer is D.F. King & Co. Inc., and the depositary is Equiniti Trust Company, LLC. The offer to purchase (the “Offer to Purchase”), a letter of transmittal and related documents have been mailed to registered holders and certain of our beneficial holders.

Financial Analyst The financial results of RCM Technologies for both the thirteen and fifty-two weeks ending December 30, 2023, demonstrate a nuanced performance with varied implications for stakeholders. While the company reported a slight increase in quarterly revenue and a notable improvement in gross profit, the annual figures show a decline in both revenue and gross profit. This mixed performance could suggest that while the company may be implementing effective cost control or pricing strategies in the short term, there might be underlying challenges in sustaining long-term growth.It is particularly noteworthy that the company's adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income per diluted share have increased on a quarterly basis, signaling improved operational efficiency and profitability. However, the decline in annual operating income and net income warrants attention, as it could be indicative of competitive pressures or market saturation affecting the company's core business segments.Investors may find the CFO's comment on improved cash collections and the confidence in achieving a $20 million cash flow from operations in fiscal 2024 to be a positive forward-looking statement. This could potentially signal to the market that management is focused on liquidity and cash management, which is critical for the company's ability to invest in growth opportunities and service any existing debt. Market Research Analyst RCM Technologies' performance must be contextualized within the broader industry trends of business and technology solutions. The modest revenue growth in the quarterly comparison, juxtaposed with the annual revenue decline, might reflect shifting demand for the company's services or increased competition. The technology sector is rapidly evolving and companies like RCM Technologies must continuously innovate to maintain market share.From a market perspective, the positive quarterly results, including the growth in adjusted EBITDA, could be a sign that RCM Technologies is adapting well to market demands and operational challenges. It is also encouraging to see that all three business segments are contributing to growth, as diversification can be a key strength in the face of sector volatility.However, the annual decline in key financial metrics could raise concerns about the company's strategic direction and market position. Investors and analysts will likely scrutinize the company's upcoming conference call for insights into management's plans to address these challenges and capitalize on market opportunities. Economist The financial results of RCM Technologies reflect broader economic conditions that may be impacting the business and technology solutions sector. While the quarterly increase in revenue and gross profit suggests resilience in the face of economic headwinds, the annual figures indicate a contraction that could be associated with broader macroeconomic factors such as reduced business spending due to economic uncertainty or supply chain disruptions.Additionally, the company's focus on cash flow generation as a goal for fiscal 2024 suggests a strategic emphasis on financial stability in an uncertain economic climate. The ability to generate strong cash flow is essential for weathering economic downturns and investing in strategic initiatives that can drive future growth.Stakeholders should consider how macroeconomic trends, such as interest rate changes, inflation and shifts in consumer and business spending, could influence the company's performance moving forward. The management's commentary during the upcoming conference call could provide valuable insights into how RCM Technologies plans to navigate these economic challenges and leverage any potential opportunities that may arise. 03/13/2024 - 04:05 PM PENNSAUKEN, N.J., March 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- RCM Technologies, Inc.

The company also improved its net income and Adjusted EBITDA compared to the previous year. Management is optimistic about the future, highlighting share gains and strategic initiatives driving margin improvements. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results from Turtle Beach Corporation indicate a mixed performance with a slight decrease in net revenue for the fourth quarter but an overall increase for the full year. The transition from a net loss to net income in the fourth quarter and a significant improvement in adjusted EBITDA both quarterly and annually are positive indicators of the company's operational efficiency and cost management effectiveness. These figures suggest a turnaround in profitability, which is crucial for investor confidence and can influence the company's stock performance positively.Despite the net revenue decline in the fourth quarter, the year-over-year growth in annual revenue reflects resilience in the core business of console gaming headsets. The strategic focus on portfolio optimization and SKU rationalization mentioned by the CEO could streamline operations and potentially enhance margins. Investors will be interested in the 2024 projections, which promise groundbreaking product launches and further cost management initiatives. The anticipation of these developments could generate investor interest and influence stock market activity in anticipation of future growth. Market Research Analyst The gaming accessories market is highly competitive, with continuous innovation and product launches being key drivers for success. Turtle Beach's focus on new product development and expansion across multiple categories and geographies indicates a strategic approach to capturing market share. The mention of significant share gains is an important aspect that investors should note, as market share gains can lead to increased revenue and profitability in the long term.The post-pandemic transitional effects mentioned by Turtle Beach's CEO reflect a broader industry trend where gaming companies are adjusting to changes in consumer behavior as the world moves beyond the pandemic. The company's optimistic outlook for 2024, with the expected launch of groundbreaking products, suggests potential for growth and market leadership. However, investors should also consider the risks associated with product launches, including market reception and the competitive response. Economist The gaming industry has experienced significant growth over the past few years, partly fueled by the pandemic-induced demand. Turtle Beach's financial results indicate that the company is navigating the post-pandemic market effectively, with an increase in annual net revenue and a substantial improvement in adjusted EBITDA. These improvements are indicative of a robust business strategy that could withstand economic fluctuations.Furthermore, the company's focus on cost management initiatives is a prudent approach in an uncertain economic environment, where inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges are prevalent. Effective cost management can safeguard profit margins and provide stability to the company in the face of economic headwinds. The projected improvements for 2024, if realized, could position Turtle Beach favorably in an economy that may still be recovering from the effects of the pandemic and facing potential new challenges. 03/13/2024 - 04:05 PM WHITE PLAINS, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Turtle Beach Corporation (Nasdaq: HEAR) (“Turtle Beach” or the “Company”), a leading gaming accessories brand, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Fourth Quarter Summary vs. Year-Ago Quarter: Net revenue was $99.5 million, a decrease of 1.3% compared to $100.9 million a year ago; Net income was $8.6 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $23.2 million, or $1.40 per diluted share, a year ago; Adjusted EBITDA improved to $14.0 million compared to $1.0 million a year ago. 2023 Full-Year Summary vs. 2022: Net revenue was $258.1 million, an increase of 7.5% compared to $240.2 million a year ago; Net loss was $17.7 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, compared to $59.5 million, or $3.62 per diluted share, a year ago; Adjusted EBITDA improved to $6.5 million compared to an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $29.9 million a year ago. Management Commentary “Turtle Beach’s resilience and adaptability have elevated our leadership position across gaming accessories,” said Cris Keirn, Chief Executive Officer, Turtle Beach Corporation. “Our 2023 full year net revenue increased by 7.5% year-over-year as a result of significant share gains across multiple categories and geographies, including our core business of console gaming headsets. With post-pandemic transitional effects to gaming markets and our business now behind us, we are looking forward to a strong era of exciting new products and growth. “We continued to execute against our strategic pillars and ongoing cost management initiatives, which drove margin improvements ahead of our expectations. These initiatives, including portfolio optimization, SKU rationalization, and platformed product development, come into full effect in 2024. We look forward to realizing these benefits with dramatically improved business performance and a 2024 portfolio that will showcase groundbreaking product launches across key categories. We anticipate that these new products, along with our continued focus on multiple cost management initiatives, will result in significant improvements in Turtle Beach’s performance in 2024. “We are incredibly optimistic about our 2024 prospects given our progress against optimizing the business for the future, our growth prospects in all our gaming categories driven by fantastic new product launches, and our focus on significantly increasing profitability. In addition, today we separately announced the highly accretive acquisition of PDP to significantly diversify our leadership position in gaming accessories, strengthen profitability and meaningfully enhance scale. We view this as a transformational change for the company and our growth prospects have never been stronger. “Additionally, as part of our 2024 strategy, we will be consolidating all PC products, including mice, keyboards and headsets, under our best-selling Turtle Beach Brand. Over the last few years, we’ve demonstrated the power of our brand through our successful entries into other accessories categories, and we expect our customers and portfolio of PC products to benefit from this consolidation. We will continue to drive growth and build on our innovative expansion of gaming categories and products while maintaining our leadership in gaming headsets. With our highly accretive acquisition of PDP and continued category expansion for Turtle Beach products, we expect revenue contribution outside of console gaming headsets to exceed 40% of total revenues in 2024. We believe Turtle Beach is poised for significant value creation in 2024 and beyond.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Net revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $99.5 million, a decrease of 1% compared to $100.9 million a year ago, driven primarily by a softer than expected console gaming headset market, but returned to growth in late December. Additionally, the slight decline was driven by higher promotional spend than anticipated due to the softer than expected console gaming headset market. Gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2023 increased to 32.0%, the highest level in the past seven quarters, compared to 19.8% a year ago. This increase was driven primarily by lower freight costs and promotional spend. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company recorded a $4.5 million incremental inventory provision related to the pandemic driven supply chain challenges. Excluding this provision, the fourth quarter of 2022 adjusted gross margin was 24.3% resulting in an expansion of 770 basis points after this normalization. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $23.4 million compared to $28.1 million a year ago. Fourth quarter recurring operating expenses declined approximately 12.6% year over year, primarily driven by continued proactive expense management. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $8.6 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $23.2 million, or $1.40 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. The weighted average diluted share count for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 18.4 million compared to 16.6 million in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below in “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”) in the fourth quarter of 2023 improved to $14.0 million, compared to $1.0 million in the year-ago period. The adjusted EBITDA improvement of $12.9 million for the quarter was due to gross margin expansion and operating expense reductions. 2023 Financial Results Net revenue in 2023 was $258.1 million, an increase of 7.5% compared to $240.2 million a year ago, driven by market share gains and new product launches. Gross margin in 2023 increased to 29.3%, compared to 20.5% a year ago. This increase was driven primarily by lower freight and logistics costs as the elevated freight rates driven by the pandemic normalized. In 2022, the Company recorded a $9.8 million incremental inventory provision related to the pandemic driven supply chain challenges. Excluding this provision, 2022 adjusted gross margin was 24.6%. Operating expenses in 2023 were $91.9 million compared to $100.7 million a year ago. Full year 2023 recurring operating expenses declined approximately 10.6% year over year, primarily driven by continued proactive expense management. Net loss in 2023 was $17.7 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, compared to $59.5 million, or $3.62 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. The weighted average diluted share count for 2023 was 17.1 million compared to 16.5 million in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below in “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”) in 2023 improved to $6.5 million, compared to adjusted EBITDA loss of $29.9 million in the year-ago period. Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Summary At December 31, 2023, the Company had $18.7 million of cash and no outstanding borrowings on its revolver. This compares to $11.4 million of cash and $19.1 million outstanding on its revolver at December 31, 2022. This is a $26.4 million improvement in the Company’s net cash position versus a year ago. Inventories at December 31, 2023 were $44.0 million compared to $71.3 million at December 31, 2022. Cash flow from operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 was $27.0 million, a $68.9 million improvement year over year. Outlook Turtle Beach separately announced today, among other strategic items, the acquisition of PDP, adding significant financial benefits to Turtle Beach that, in conjunction with synergies realized, fundamentally transforms the financial profile of the Company. Accordingly, the Company expects 2024 net revenues to be in the range of $370 million to $380 million, with the growth driven primarily by the acquisition of PDP and the expected out-performance of the gaming markets in specific categories based on the Company’s product plans for 2024. Additionally, in light of the Company’s strong execution on its efficiency and profitability initiatives, the Company expects pro forma combined Adjusted EBITDA to be between $51 million and $54 million, which incorporates approximately 9 months of operations from PDP. The Company further reiterates its long-term goals of a 10%+ revenue CAGR, a mid-30’s gross margin percentage, and is now focused on low to mid-teens percentage for Adjusted EBITDA margins. Value Enhancement Committee Review The Company today issued a separate press release announcing the outcome of the Board’s Value Enhancement Committee review, which can be found at https://corp.turtlebeach.com/press-releases/. With respect to the Company's adjusted EBITDA outlook, a reconciliation to its net income (loss) outlook for the same periods has not been provided because of the variability, complexity, and lack of visibility with respect to certain reconciling items between adjusted EBITDA and net income (loss), including other income (expense), provision for income taxes and stock-based compensation. These items cannot be reasonably and accurately predicted without the investment of undue time, cost and other resources and, accordingly, a reconciliation of the Company’s adjusted EBITDA outlook to its net income (loss) outlook for such periods is not provided. These reconciling items could be material to the Company’s actual results for such periods. Conference Call Details In conjunction with this announcement, Turtle Beach will host a conference call at 5:00 p.m. ET / 2:00 p.m. PT with the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Cris Keirn, and CFO, John Hanson. A live webcast of the call will be available on the “Events & Presentations” page of the Company’s website at www.corp.turtlebeach.com. To access the call by phone, please go to this link (registration link) and you will be provided with dial in details. To avoid delays, we encourage participants to dial into the conference call 15-minutes ahead of the scheduled start time. A replay of the webcast will also be available for a limited time at www.corp.turtlebeach.com. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to its reported results, the Company has included in this earnings release certain financial metrics, including adjusted EBITDA, that the Securities and Exchange Commission define as “non-GAAP financial measures.” Management believes that such non-GAAP financial measures, when read in conjunction with the Company's reported results, can provide useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period-to-period comparisons of the Company's results. Non-GAAP financial measures are not an alternative to the Company’s GAAP financial results and may not be calculated in the same manner as similar measures presented by other companies. “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined by the Company as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation (non-cash), and certain non-recurring special items that we believe are not representative of core operations, as further described in Table 4. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented because management uses non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company’s operating performance, to perform financial planning, and to determine incentive compensation. Therefore, the Company believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to, and facilitates additional analysis by, investors. The non-GAAP financial measures included herein exclude items that management does not believe reflect the Company’s core operating performance because such items are inherently unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring, or non-cash. See a reconciliation of GAAP results to Adjusted EBITDA included as Table 4 below for each of the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023.

Financial Analyst The announcement by ESS Tech, Inc. of a significant reduction in their Q4 adjusted EBITDA loss and the maintenance of a robust cash and short-term investments balance above $100 million is a strong indication of the company's improving financial health. The ability to lower Energy Warehouse manufacturing costs by 60% in 2023 and set a target for a further 40% reduction in 2024 is a testament to the company's operational efficiencies and cost management. These improvements are crucial as they directly contribute to the company's path towards non-GAAP gross margin profitability.From a financial perspective, the cost reductions and cash conservation strategies suggest a proactive approach to managing the company's burn rate and extending its operational runway. This is particularly significant given the capital-intensive nature of the energy storage industry. The strategic focus on shipping to customers with the greatest long-term opportunity, rather than volume, indicates a prioritization of quality partnerships over short-term revenue maximization. This could bode well for sustainable growth, although it may affect short-term revenue projections.Investors should note that the company's record revenue of $7.5M for FY 2023, while a positive development, needs to be evaluated in the context of the company's overall financial position, including its net loss figures and cash flow statements. Additionally, the expected revenue of approximately $2 million in Q1 2024, which was delayed from Q4 2023, highlights the importance of understanding the timing and certainty of revenue recognition in evaluating the company's performance. Energy Market Analyst The deployment of the first Energy Warehouses under a partnership with Honeywell and the expected commissioning of the Energy Center for Portland General Electric later this year represent strategic milestones for ESS Tech, Inc. in the long-duration energy storage (LDES) market. The LDES market is gaining traction as utilities and other stakeholders seek to integrate more renewable energy sources into the grid, which requires storage solutions capable of balancing supply and demand over longer periods.The Energy Center's ability to provide up to eight hours of energy storage is particularly noteworthy, as it addresses a gap in the market for storage solutions beyond the short-duration capabilities of lithium-ion batteries. The scalability of ESS's technology could position the company favorably in a market that is increasingly looking for flexible and long-term storage solutions.Furthermore, the company's engagement in projects like the Burbank Water and Power EcoCampus and the Turlock Irrigation District's Project Nexus demonstrates the versatility of its storage solutions in different applications, from pairing with renewables to tactical microgrids for military use. These projects not only serve as proof of concept for the technology but also help in establishing a track record of successful deployments that can attract additional customers.It is crucial to understand that the LDES market, while growing, is still at a relatively early stage of development. The pace of regulatory changes, technological advancements and cost declines will significantly influence the adoption rate of LDES solutions and, consequently, the performance of companies like ESS Tech, Inc. Sustainability Expert ESS Tech, Inc.'s focus on long-duration energy storage systems is a critical component of the transition to a more sustainable energy grid. The company's efforts to reduce the cost of its Energy Warehouse systems by 60% in 2023, with a further 40% reduction targeted for 2024, are significant for the affordability and scalability of renewable energy solutions. The cost reductions in energy storage are essential for making renewable energy sources like solar and wind more viable and reliable, as they enable the storage of excess energy for use when production is low.The company's projects, such as the pairing of an Energy Warehouse system with solar panels over irrigation canals, showcase innovative approaches to integrating energy storage with renewable energy generation. These initiatives not only generate clean energy but also contribute to water conservation by reducing evaporation, demonstrating the multifaceted benefits of such sustainable practices.Additionally, the deployment of ESS's iron flow battery technology within a tactical microgrid at a US Army Corps of Engineers facility underscores the broader implications of LDES for energy security and resilience. The ability to reduce fuel consumption at Contingency Bases through the use of LDES is an example of how sustainability measures can also align with strategic and economic objectives.Stakeholders should consider the environmental and social governance (ESG) implications of ESS Tech, Inc.'s advancements, as these factors are increasingly relevant to investors and may influence the company's valuation and access to capital in the long term. 03/13/2024 - 04:05 PM Lowered Q4 Adjusted EBITDA loss by More Than 50% year over year Exited 2023 with Cash and Short-Term Investments over $100 million; Expected to Carry ESS Well Into H1’25 Delivered First Energy Warehouses to Honeywell Energy Warehouse manufacturing cost lowered by 60% in 2023 Target 40% 2024 EW Cost Reduction to Achieve non-GAAP Gross Margin Profitability WILSONVILLE, Ore.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ESS Tech, Inc. (“ESS,” “ESS, Inc.” or the “Company”) (NYSE:GWH), a leading manufacturer of long-duration energy storage systems (LDES) for commercial and utility-scale applications, today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. “During 2023 our team made significant progress towards our most important objectives, including securing transformative partnerships with LEAG and Honeywell, optimizing our internal operations, and pursuing design initiatives to lower production costs by improving manufacturability and scale. While we faced customer-related delays that impacted our financial results, the team’s work during the year laid a solid foundation for us to scale the business, launch the Energy Center and move toward unit profitability in 2024. In fact, our strategic decision to make fewer Energy Warehouses (EWs) and ship them to customers with the greatest long-term opportunity allowed us to conserve cash and exit the year with a cash and short-term investments balance over $100 million. Importantly, we brought down costs to build an EW by almost 60% during 2023 and successfully cut our Q4 adjusted EBITDA loss in half year over year,” said Eric Dresselhuys, CEO of ESS. “ESS continues to make tremendous progress on our strategy to build a world class, scalable company that is well-positioned to serve the immense long-duration energy storage market. The actions we’ve already taken have resonated with customers and we continue to see robust customer engagement. In 2024 we plan to further reduce EW unit costs by up to 40% as we move toward unit profitability while ramping our scale and maintaining a healthy cash balance.” Recent Business Highlights Achieved record revenue of $7.5M for FY 2023. Delivered first Energy Warehouses™ under the partnership with Honeywell in Q4 2023 and recently cleared previously announced customer delays in Australia, which we expect will result in revenue of approximately $2 million in Q1 2024 which was originally anticipated in Q4 2023. At the end of 2023, ESS successfully “lifted” its first Energy Center™ (EC), a key milestone in the manufacturing process. The EC is a utility-scale, front-of-the-meter long-duration energy storage product which provides up to eight hours of energy storage with a flexible, scalable platform to meet the LDES needs of utilities worldwide. We expect this inaugural EC system will be commissioned and delivered to Portland General Electric later this year. Delivered an Energy Warehouse™ system to the Burbank Water and Power (BWP) EcoCampus, BWP’s first utility-scale battery storage project. This EW will be paired with an on-site solar array where ESS technology will demonstrate the critical role of LDES in a fully renewable grid. Delivered two Energy Warehouses™ to Turlock Irrigation District (TID) in Central California to support TID’s Project Nexus. At TID, the EW will be paired with a proof of concept of solar panels over irrigation canals. which aims to conserve water resources by reducing evaporation while generating clean energy, reducing diesel generation and reducing energy costs. Completed commissioning of an Energy Warehouse™ system at the Contingency Base Integration Training Evaluation Center (CBITEC) operated by the US Army Corps of Engineers Engineer Research and Development Center in Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. This EW has been incorporated into a tactical microgrid at CBITEC and will demonstrate the key role that LDES, specifically iron flow battery technology, can play to reduce fuel consumption at Contingency Bases such as Forward Operating Bases or other temporary use locations providing humanitarian assistance or disaster relief.

About Trevi Therapeutics, Inc.Trevi Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing the investigational therapy Haduvio™ (oral nalbuphine ER) for patients with chronic cough in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and refractory chronic cough (RCC). Trevi also is evaluating Haduvio for prurigo nodularis. Haduvio is a dual ĸ-opioid receptor agonist and µ-opioid receptor antagonist that works both centrally in the brain as well as peripherally in the lungs and has the potential for a synergistic antitussive effect to treat chronic cough. The impact of chronic cough is significant and often leads to a decline in patients' social, physical, and psychological quality of life. In IPF, chronic cough may lead to worsening disease and may be associated with a higher risk of progression, death, or need for lung transplant. There are no approved therapies for the treatment of chronic cough in IPF and current treatment options provide minimal relief to patients. RCC affects up to 10% of the adult population, and Haduvio's expansion into RCC has the potential to reach patients suffering from moderate to severe chronic cough. There are also no approved therapies for RCC in the US. Parenteral nalbuphine is not scheduled by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency. Trevi intends to propose Haduvio as the trade name for oral nalbuphine ER. Its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.

Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The new $58 million contract between ICF and the California State Lottery indicates a significant investment in digital infrastructure, which is a growing trend across various sectors. This collaboration underscores the importance of digital transformation as a means to enhance user experience and operational efficiency.From a market perspective, the contract suggests a stable revenue stream for ICF over the next five years, with the potential for extension. This stability can be appealing to investors, as it provides predictable cash flows and may contribute to the company's financial health. Furthermore, the emphasis on cloud solutions and data analytics aligns with the broader industry's shift towards cloud computing and big data, which are key drivers of innovation and growth.For the California State Lottery, the improved website and cloud infrastructure could result in increased sales and customer engagement, which is essential for the organization's goal of raising supplemental funding for public schools. This is indicative of how digital platforms can be leveraged by state-run entities to improve public services and funding mechanisms. Financial Analyst ICF's contract with the California State Lottery represents a substantial long-term investment that could positively impact ICF's earnings and stock performance. The contract's duration and extensions provide a long-term outlook for revenue, which can be factored into financial models and forecasts for the company.Investors often look for companies with strong, diversified contract portfolios that demonstrate the ability to secure and maintain large-scale projects. ICF's ability to renew and expand its collaboration with the Lottery is a testament to its competitive position within the technology services industry.It's also worth noting that contracts with government entities, like state lotteries, are often seen as more secure compared to private sector contracts, which can be subject to more volatility. This could be perceived as a lower-risk revenue source, potentially making ICF more attractive to risk-averse investors. Legal Expert The compliance aspect of the contract with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is crucial, as it demonstrates ICF's commitment to inclusivity and legal compliance. Ensuring that digital platforms are accessible to all users is not only a legal requirement but also expands the potential customer base for the California State Lottery.ADA compliance can also mitigate the risk of potential legal challenges, which could result in costly settlements and damage to reputation. By focusing on these legal standards, ICF not only protects its client but also positions itself as a responsible and ethical service provider, which can be a differentiating factor in the industry. 03/13/2024 - 04:05 PM Company Will Expand Website Development and Cloud Infrastructure Support Services RESTON, Va., March 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- California State Lottery has recently expanded its collaboration with global consulting and technology services provider ICF (NASDAQ:ICFI) through a new $58 million contract award to continue supporting the Lottery's website.

The revocation of the 2024 financial guidance due to the sale of tafasitamab to Incyte raises uncertainties about future financial performance. R&D expenses for the full year 2023 were € 283.6 million, reflecting significant investments in development activities. Financial Analyst The acquisition of MorphoSys by Novartis at a substantial premium indicates a strategic move by Novartis to bolster its pipeline with MorphoSys' advanced clinical assets, particularly pelabresib. This acquisition price suggests a strong confidence in the future revenue streams and market potential of these assets. The significant premium also reflects the competition and scarcity of advanced biotech assets in the market. Investors should note the liquidity position of MorphoSys, which is robust with €680.5 million in cash and financial assets, providing operational runway until early 2026. However, the reported operating loss and net loss for both the quarter and the full year are areas of concern, indicating a need for further efficiency in operations or a strategic pivot to return to profitability. Medical Research Analyst The Phase 3 MANIFEST-2 study results for pelabresib are pivotal, as they show potential for a new standard of care in myelofibrosis treatment. The combination therapy with ruxolitinib, a JAK inhibitor, has shown significant improvements in disease hallmarks, which could lead to a strong market position if approved. The safety profile aligning with previous trials adds to the compound's credibility. The planned submission of a New Drug Application to the FDA and a Marketing Authorization Application to the EMA in mid-2024 is a critical next step for MorphoSys and will be a key driver of the company's value proposition post-acquisition. Market Research Analyst The decrease in Monjuvi's U.S. net product sales year-over-year, despite the overall stability in annual revenues, may raise questions about the drug's market penetration and competitive landscape. The royalty revenue growth is a positive sign, reflecting the underlying value of MorphoSys' licensing agreements. The sale of tafasitamab rights to Incyte for a modest sum suggests a strategic repositioning, possibly to streamline the company's focus on pelabresib and tulmimetostat. Investors should monitor the market response to pelabresib's potential approval and commercial launch, as it will significantly influence MorphoSys' future financial performance within the Novartis portfolio. 03/13/2024 - 04:02 PM – Entered into Business Combination Agreement to be acquired by Novartis for € 68.00 per share in cash or € 2.7 billion equity value – Sold all tafasitamab rights worldwide to Incyte – Presented comprehensive Phase 3 MANIFEST-2 study results at ASH 2023 Annual Meeting, demonstrating pelabresib improves all four disease hallmarks of myelofibrosis – Monjuvi® U.S. net product sales of US$ 24.1 million (€ 22.4 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023 and US$ 92.0 million (€ 85.0 million) for the full year of 2023 – € 680.5 million in cash and other financial assets as of December 31, 2023 – MorphoSys to host conference call and webcast on Thursday, March 14, 2024, at 1:00 pm CET (12:00 pm GMT; 8:00 am EDT) PLANEGG/MUNICH, Germany--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- MorphoSys AG (FSE: MOR; NASDAQ: MOR) reports results for the fourth quarter and the full year 2023. “In 2023, we demonstrated the potential for pelabresib to shift the myelofibrosis treatment paradigm, as results from our Phase 3 MANIFEST-2 study showed that all four disease hallmarks were improved with the pelabresib and ruxolitinib combination therapy over standard of care,” said Jean-Paul Kress, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of MorphoSys. “Now, in 2024, we are pleased that Novartis is committing to the future of our promising pipeline. With its ample resources, additional scientific expertise and global footprint, Novartis can help accelerate pelabresib's potential worldwide. The acquisition process is progressing steadily, and we expect to close the proposed transaction in the first half of the year.” Novartis’ Public Takeover Offer: On February 5, 2024, MorphoSys announced the company entered into a Business Combination Agreement with Novartis BidCo AG (formerly known as Novartis data42 AG) and Novartis AG (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Novartis”) based on Novartis’ intention to submit a voluntary public takeover offer for all outstanding MorphoSys no-par value bearer shares at an offer price of € 68.00 per share in cash. The offer price corresponds to a premium of 94% and 142% on the volume-weighted average price during the last month and three months, as of the unaffected January 25, 2024, close, respectively. As part of the Business Combination Agreement with Novartis, Novartis seeks to obtain exclusive, worldwide rights to develop and commercialize pelabresib, an investigational BET inhibitor, and tulmimetostat, an investigational next-generation dual inhibitor of EZH2 and EZH1, across all indications. The offer will contain customary closing conditions, in particular a minimum acceptance threshold of 65% of MorphoSys’ share capital and antitrust clearances. MorphoSys and Novartis have received antitrust clearance in Germany and Austria. The companies have also made antitrust filings in the U.S. under the HSR Act and continue to expect the closing to take place in the first half of 2024. Pelabresib Highlights: On December 10, 2023, comprehensive results from the Phase 3 MANIFEST-2 study at 24 weeks were presented during an oral presentation at the 65th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition. In MANIFEST-2, the combination of pelabresib and the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib improved all four disease hallmarks of myelofibrosis, including a significant reduction in spleen size with a response rate nearly double that of placebo plus ruxolitinib. The combination therapy showed a strong positive trend in reducing symptom burden and improvements in measures of anemia and bone marrow fibrosis, and demonstrated safety results in line with assessments from prior clinical trials. Monjuvi/Minjuvi® Highlights: Monjuvi (tafasitamab-cxix) U.S. net product sales of US$ 24.1 million (€ 22.4 million) for the fourth quarter 2023 (Q4 2022: US$ 25.3 million (€ 24.7 million)) and US$ 92.0 million (€ 85.0 million) for the full year of 2023 (2022: US$ 89.4 million (€ 84.9 million)). Minjuvi royalty revenue of € 1.3 million for sales outside of the U.S. in the fourth quarter 2023 (Q4 2022: € 0.7 million) and € 5.4 million for the full year of 2023 (2022: € 3.0 million). On February 5, 2024, MorphoSys also announced it entered into a Purchase Agreement to sell and transfer all rights worldwide related to tafasitamab to Incyte Corporation (“Incyte”). Under the terms of MorphoSys’ Purchase Agreement with Incyte, Incyte will obtain exclusive rights worldwide, assume full responsibility and cover all costs going forward for the development and commercialization of tafasitamab for a purchase price of US$ 25 million. Corporate Developments: On December 14, 2023, MorphoSys announced the completion of a share capital increase from € 34,231,943 by € 3,423,194 to € 37,655,137 through a full utilization of its authorized capital 2023-II, resulting in gross proceeds of € 102.7 million. Financial Results for the Fourth Quarter of 2023 (IFRS): Total revenues for the fourth quarter 2023 were € 59.0 million compared to € 81.6 million for the same period in 2022. The decrease resulted first and foremost from prior year revenues stemming from the execution of an out-licensing agreement with Novartis. in € million* Q4 2023 Q3 2023 Q4 2022 Q-Q Δ Y-Y Δ Total revenues 59.0 63.8 81.6 (8)% (28)% Monjuvi product sales 22.4 21.5 24.7 4% (9)% Royalties 34.0 34.0 29.1 0% 17% Licenses, milestones and other 2.6 8.3 27.9 (69)% (91)% * Differences due to rounding. Cost of Sales: In the fourth quarter of 2023, cost of sales was € 14.6 million compared to € 15.4 million for the comparable period in 2022. Research and Development (R&D) Expenses: In the fourth quarter 2023, R&D expenses were € 80.3 million compared to € 94.0 million for the same period in 2022. The decrease mainly resulted from lower expenses for external services. Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses: Selling expenses in the fourth quarter 2023 were € 22.6 million compared to € 23.0 million for the same period in 2022. General and administrative (G&A) expenses amounted to € 22.9 million compared to € 17.5 million for the same period in 2022. Operating Loss: Operating loss amounted to € 81.4 million in the fourth quarter 2023 compared to € 68.4 million for the same period in 2022.

Financial Results for the Full Year 2023 (IFRS): Total Revenues for the full year 2023 were € 238.3 million compared to € 278.3 million in 2022. The decrease resulted first and foremost from prior year revenues stemming from the execution of out-licensing agreements with HI-Bio and Novartis. Royalties in 2023 include € 5.4 million from the sale of Minjuvi outside of the U.S. by our partner Incyte and € 111.0 million from Tremfya® sales which is fully passed on to Royalty Pharma. in € million* 2023 2022 Y-Y Δ Total revenues 238.3 278.3 (14)% Monjuvi product sales 85.0 84.9 0% Royalties 116.4 99.9 17% Licenses, milestones and other 36.9 93.5 (61)% * Differences due to rounding. Cost of Sales: For the full year 2023, cost of sales were € 58.4 million compared to € 48.6 million in 2022. The increase compared to the previous year is mainly due to one-off effects from write-downs on inventories in the amount of € 11.9 million recognized in 2023. R&D Expenses: For the full year 2023, R&D expenses were € 283.6 million compared to € 297.8 million in 2022. The decrease of R&D expenses reflects our current clinical study progress as well as prioritization activities relating to our R&D portfolio. SG&A Expenses: Selling expenses for the full year 2023 were € 81.4 million compared to € 92.4 million in 2022. The decrease is mainly due to the ongoing measures to streamline and focus sales efforts. G&A expenses amounted to € 65.8 million for 2023 compared to € 60.1 million in 2022. The increase was mainly driven by the increase in share-based payment expenses. Operating Loss: Operating loss amounted to € 252.5 million for the full year 2023 compared to a loss of € 220.7 million in 2022. Consolidated Net Loss: For the full year 2023, consolidated net loss was € 189.7 million compared to a net loss of € 151.1 million in 2022. Cash and Other Financial Assets: As of December 31, 2023, the Company had cash and other financial assets of € 680.5 million compared to € 907.2 million on December 31, 2022. The liquid funds are predominantly required to advance the development of the proprietary portfolio to key clinical and regulatory milestones. The Management Board believes that the cash and other financial assets, which also incorporates the additional cash impacts from the sale of tafasitamab to Incyte as announced on February 5, 2024, will be sufficient to fund the operating activities and other cash requirements until early 2026 including the repayment of the convertible bonds. Any potential cashflows resulting from the Novartis Business Combination Agreement as announced on February 5, 2024, were not considered in the recent corporate planning. Under the Business Combination Agreement, Novartis agreed to use all such efforts which are from the perspective of a prudent business person reasonable and appropriate to provide MorphoSys with the financial resources required following completion of the Novartis Takeover Offer to enable MorphoSys to pay any obligations of MorphoSys arising from the implementation of the Novartis Takeover Offer as and when due, for example, but not limited to the obligation from the convertible bonds and the obligations arising from the long-term incentive plans, each to the extent triggered by the completion of the Novartis Takeover Offer. For the unlikely case that the proposed transaction with Novartis is not consummated, and MorphoSys consequently would remain a stand-alone company, management would need to assess different financing options to ensure the going-concern assumption beyond the said timeframe according to regulatory requirements. Management would then consider both anti-dilutive financing options, such as out-licensing of (pre-) clinical assets or the sale of potential future royalties, but also consider accessing the capital markets by way of issuance of new shares or share instruments (ADSs) and/ or issuance or refinancing of convertible debt. Number of Shares: The number of shares issued totaled 37,655,137 on December 31, 2023. Financial Guidance 2024: As a consequence of the sale and transfer of tafasitamab to Incyte on February 5, 2024, MorphoSys' 2024 financial guidance published on January 30, 2024, cannot be maintained and therefore was revoked. For the time being, MorphoSys will no longer make a forecast for revenues from product sales, as no such revenues will be realized. For 2024, the Group expects R&D expenses of € 170 million to € 185 million. R&D expenses mainly represent our investments in the development of pelabresib and tulmimetostat. Selling, administrative and general expenses are expected to be between € 90 million and € 105 million. Any effects from the implementation of the Novartis takeover offer are not included in this forecast. The overall forecast is subject to a number of uncertainties, including inflation and foreign currency effects. Operational Outlook: The following activity is planned for 2024: Submit a New Drug Application for pelabresib in combination with ruxolitinib in myelofibrosis to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency in the middle of 2024.

About Pelabresib Pelabresib (CPI-0610) is an investigational selective small molecule designed to promote anti-tumor activity by inhibiting the function of bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) proteins to decrease the expression of abnormally expressed genes in cancer. Pelabresib is being investigated as a treatment for myelofibrosis and has not yet been approved by any regulatory authorities. Its safety and efficacy have also not been established in a pivotal trial. The development of pelabresib was funded in part by The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society®. About MANIFEST-2 MANIFEST-2 (NCT04603495) is a global, double-blind, Phase 3 clinical trial that randomized 430 JAK inhibitor-naïve adult patients with myelofibrosis 1:1 to receive pelabresib in combination with ruxolitinib or placebo plus ruxolitinib. The primary endpoint of the study is a 35% or greater reduction in spleen volume (SVR35) from baseline at 24 weeks. The key secondary endpoints of the study are the absolute change in total symptom score (TSS) from baseline at 24 weeks and the proportion of patients achieving a 50% or greater improvement in total symptom score (TSS50) from baseline at 24 weeks. TSS is measured using the myelofibrosis self-assessment form (MFSAF) v4.0, which asks patients to report the severity of seven common symptoms, rating each of them on a scale from 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable). The new key secondary endpoint, absolute change in TSS, was added to directly measure change in the average TSS from baseline to week 24 of treatment and is listed as the first key secondary endpoint in the MANIFEST-2 hierarchical testing scheme. The decision to update the MANIFEST-2 clinical trial protocol was made following a Type C meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September 2023. Additional secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, overall survival, duration of the splenic and total symptom score response, hemoglobin response rate and improvement in bone marrow fibrosis, among others. Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a MorphoSys company, is the MANIFEST-2 trial sponsor. About Tafasitamab Tafasitamab is a humanized Fc-modified CD19 targeting immunotherapy. In 2010, MorphoSys licensed exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize tafasitamab from Xencor, Inc. Tafasitamab incorporates an XmAb® engineered Fc domain, which mediates B-cell lysis through apoptosis and immune effector mechanism including Antibody-Dependent Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity (ADCC) and Antibody-Dependent Cellular Phagocytosis (ADCP). In the United States, Monjuvi® (tafasitamab-cxix) is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in combination with lenalidomide for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL not otherwise specified, including DLBCL arising from low grade lymphoma, and who are not eligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s). Please see the U.S. full Prescribing Information for Monjuvi for important safety information.

Record date is March 29, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a cash dividend of $0.12 per share by AGNC Investment Corp. reflects the company's current financial health and its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to return value to shareholders. Dividend announcements are closely monitored by investors as they provide insights into a company's profitability and its board's confidence in future earnings. This specific dividend payment could indicate a stable income stream for investors, particularly those with a focus on income-generating assets.However, it's crucial to compare the dividend yield and payout ratio to industry benchmarks to assess sustainability. A payout ratio that is too high might suggest that the company is not reinvesting enough back into its operations, which could impact long-term growth. Conversely, a yield that is significantly higher than peers might indicate a higher risk profile or a potential red flag that the market expects future dividends to decrease. Market Research Analyst AGNC Investment Corp.'s dividend announcement can serve as an indicator of market positioning within the real estate investment trust (REIT) sector. REITs are typically expected to pay out a majority of their taxable income as dividends and thus they are often part of income-focused investment strategies. The amount of $0.12 per share should be contextualized within the historical dividend payments of AGNC and the broader market trends.Investors should consider the consistency of AGNC's dividend payments, as well as any historical changes in the amount, to gauge the reliability of the income stream. Additionally, external economic factors such as interest rate changes can affect the performance of REITs and subsequently their ability to maintain or raise dividends.

(Nasdaq: SPRB) announced topline results from its CAHmelia-203 and CAHptain-205 studies of tildacerfont in adult and pediatric classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). While CAHmelia-203 did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint, CAHptain-205 showed promising results. The company plans to meet regulatory authorities for a potential registrational program. Positive Positive topline results from CAHmelia-203 and CAHptain-205 studies. Tildacerfont showed safety and tolerability in adult and pediatric CAH patients. Significant unmet medical need in CAH addressed by Spruce Biosciences. Cost-saving initiatives and workforce reduction to extend cash runway. Plans to meet with regulatory authorities for potential registrational program. Negative CAHmelia-203 did not achieve the primary efficacy endpoint. Low compliance with study medication and GC in CAHmelia-203. Tildacerfont clearance differences between adult and pediatric patients. Workforce reduction of approximately 21% implemented by the company. Medical Research Analyst The failure of the CAHmelia-203 study to meet its primary efficacy endpoint is a significant setback for Spruce Biosciences. The study's inability to demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in androstenedione levels in adults with severe hyperandrogenemia indicates that tildacerfont may not be effective for this particular patient subset. This outcome necessitates a reassessment of the drug's development strategy and could impact investor confidence, given that the drug's efficacy is crucial for regulatory approval and market success. Furthermore, the low compliance rate with study medication and glucocorticoid therapy observed in the trial raises concerns about patient adherence in real-world settings, which is essential for achieving therapeutic outcomes.From a medical research perspective, the result highlights the complexity of treating severe hyperandrogenemia in CAH and underscores the need for therapies that can be more easily integrated into patients' lives to enhance compliance. The safety profile of tildacerfont, however, remains a positive aspect, with no serious adverse events reported, which could be a key consideration for future clinical trials and potential market adoption if efficacy can be proven in other studies. Pediatric Endocrinologist The positive preliminary findings from the CAHptain-205 study in pediatric patients present a glimmer of hope for a new treatment option for children with CAH. The ability of tildacerfont to reduce androgen levels and potentially decrease the required dose of glucocorticoids could represent a significant advancement in managing CAH in pediatric patients. Glucocorticoid therapy, while essential, is associated with adverse effects like growth suppression and obesity, which can profoundly affect children's development and quality of life.The reported rapid clearance of tildacerfont in children compared to adults is an interesting pharmacokinetic consideration, suggesting that dosing strategies may need to be tailored differently for pediatric populations. The anticipation of further dose-ranging studies to inform the registrational program indicates a commitment to optimizing treatment for this demographic. The potential to improve long-term clinical outcomes by balancing androgen suppression and glucocorticoid use is an exciting prospect for pediatric endocrinology. Financial Analyst The announcement by Spruce Biosciences regarding the CAHmelia-203 study's results and the CAHptain-205 study's progress has mixed implications for the company's financial outlook. The negative outcome of the CAHmelia-203 trial could potentially lead to volatility in the company's stock price as investors reassess the drug's commercial viability. However, the extended cash runway through the end of 2025, due to cost reduction measures, including workforce reduction and termination of the CAHmelia-203 study, may provide some reassurance to investors about the company's financial stability in the short term.The company's future now hinges more heavily on the outcomes of the ongoing CAHmelia-204 and CAHptain-205 studies. Positive results from these could reinvigorate investor interest and provide a path forward for regulatory approval. The strategic decision to engage with the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, assuming positive results, demonstrates proactive planning. It will be crucial to monitor the company's cash burn rate and any changes in its clinical development strategy that could affect its financial position. 03/13/2024 - 04:01 PM CAHmelia-203 Study of Tildacerfont in Adult Classic Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) with Severe Hyperandrogenemia Did Not Meet Primary Efficacy Endpoint Positive Data from CAHptain-205 Study of Tildacerfont in Pediatric Classic CAH Supports Further Dose-Ranging Across Additional Dosing Cohorts Topline Results from CAHmelia-204 Study of Tildacerfont in Adult Classic CAH Evaluating Glucocorticoid (GC) Reduction Anticipated in Third Quarter of 2024 Resource Prioritization and Cost Reductions Extend Cash Runway Through End of 2025 Conference Call Today at 4:30 p.m. ET SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Spruce Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: SPRB), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing novel therapies for rare endocrine disorders with significant unmet medical need, today announced topline results from its CAHmelia-203 study of tildacerfont in adult classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and its CAHptain-205 study of tildacerfont in pediatric classic CAH. Spruce is investigating tildacerfont, a second generation, once-daily oral antagonist of the CRF1 receptor, for the treatment of classic CAH. The global CAHmelia program in adult classic CAH is comprised of two Phase 2b studies designed to address the unmet medical needs of two distinct populations of adult CAH patients. CAHmelia-203 assesses androstenedione (A4) reduction in adult CAH patients with severe hyperandrogenemia, while CAHmelia-204 assesses glucocorticoid (GC) reduction, a potentially registrational endpoint, in adult CAH patients on supraphysiologic GC doses with normal or near normal levels of A4. The Phase 2 CAHptain-205 study is focused on addressing the unmet medical need in pediatric CAH patients, which represents approximately 25% of the total patient population. The CAHmelia and CAHptain programs seek to address the unmet medical need across the entire spectrum of the CAH patient community, which has not seen a new standard of care since GCs were introduced in the 1950s. CAHmelia-203 Study of Tildacerfont in Adult Classic CAH CAHmelia-203 enrolled 96 subjects with a mean baseline A4 level of 1,151 ng/dL, which is more than five times above the upper limit of normal (ULN). Data Highlights The clinical trial did not achieve the primary efficacy endpoint of the assessment of dose response for the change in A4 from baseline to week 12. 200mg QD of tildacerfont demonstrated a placebo-adjusted reduction from baseline in A4 of -2.6% at week 12 with a non-significant p-value. Compliance with study medication and GC was low with approximately 50% of patients reporting 80% or greater compliance, resulting in lower-than-expected tildacerfont exposure. Tildacerfont was generally safe and well tolerated at all doses with no treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs). Most adverse events were reported as mild to moderate. “We are grateful to all the patients, families, study team and investigators who supported the CAHmelia-203 clinical trial,” said Javier Szwarcberg, M.D., M.P.H., Chief Executive Officer, Spruce Biosciences. “CAHmelia-203 is the first study of its kind to address a difficult-to-treat CAH patient population with severe and more refractory hyperandrogenemia, which is often attributed to challenging real-life compliance with daily GCs. We garnered important data from this study which will inform ongoing development of tildacerfont in adult classic CAH.” Dr. Szwarcberg added, “Looking ahead to the third quarter of 2024, we are eager to report topline results from CAHmelia-204, which is focused on assessing GC reduction, a potentially registrational endpoint, in a different population of adult CAH patients with relatively controlled A4 levels and historically better adherence to GC therapy. Assuming positive results from CAHmelia-204 and CAHptain-205, we plan to meet with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and comparable foreign regulatory authorities to outline the design of a registrational clinical program in adult and pediatric classic CAH.” CAHmelia-203 and 204 Baseline Characteristics Highlight Two Distinct Patient Populations in Adult CAH with Differing Disease Status and Treatment Goals Patients in CAHmelia-203 enrolled with severe hyperandrogenemia, as indicated with mean baseline A4 levels more than five times above the ULN. By contrast, patients in CAHmelia-204 enrolled with a mean baseline A4 value of 224 ng/dL, which is approximately the ULN, with 66% of patients enrolled with androgenic control, which is defined as having A4 values below the ULN at baseline. Study Characteristics CAHmelia-203 (N = 96) CAHmelia-204 (N = 100) Male/Female (Proportion of Total Subjects) 47% Male 53% Female 47% Male 53% Female Average Age Age Ranges 32 Years Old (18 – 65 Years Old) 33 Years Old (18 – 64 Years Old) Average Baseline Glucocorticoid (GC) Dose1 27 mg/day (14 mg/m2/day) 37 mg/day (20 mg/m2/day) Average Baseline Androstenedione (A4) Level2 1,151 ng/dL (>5x ULN) 224 ng/dL (~ULN) Average Baseline 17-Hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) Level2 16,653 ng/dL (>80x ULN) 5,675 ng/dL (>28x ULN) Average Baseline Adrenocorticotropic (ACTH) Level2 435 pg/dL (>6x ULN) 168 pg/dL (>2x ULN) Body Mass Index (BMI) 50% Obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) 53% Obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) 1 In hydrocortisone equivalents (HCe) 2 Pre-GC dose. “The CAHmelia-203 results underscore the complexities inherent in managing a patient group with challenges related to androgenic control and GC compliance,” said Irina Bancos, M.D., Principal Investigator and Associate Professor of Medicine and Endocrinologist at the Mayo Clinic. “Based on my clinical experience, patients within this group may face difficulties adhering to any therapeutic interventions, potentially impacting treatment outcomes.” Dr. Bancos continued, “Patients with higher glucocorticoid doses and normal or near normal androgen levels, such as those enrolled in CAHmelia-204, are generally more consistent with GC therapy and easier to manage due to lower ACTH overdrive of the adrenal gland but carry higher risk of glucocorticoid-associated comorbidities. I look forward to reviewing results from CAHmelia-204, which will provide a more complete picture into the therapeutic potential of tildacerfont.” CAHptain-205 Study of Tildacerfont in Pediatric Classic CAH CAHptain-205 enrolled 30 children between two and 17 years of age with a mean baseline GC dose of 14 mg/m2/day and mean baseline A4 level of 372 ng/dL. The study characterized the safety and pharmacokinetic profiles of tildacerfont, as well as changes in androgen levels over 12 weeks of treatment, and the ability to reduce daily GC dose upon A4 normalization. Data Highlights Tildacerfont was generally safe and well tolerated at all dose ranges with no treatment-related SAEs reported. Preliminary pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that tildacerfont is cleared more rapidly in children than in adult CAH patients. 73% of all patients (22 of 30 patients) met the efficacy endpoint of A4 or GC reduction from baseline at 12 weeks of treatment with tildacerfont. 70% of patients with elevated baseline A4 values (16 of 23 patients) demonstrated an A4 reduction at week 4. “As a pediatric endocrinologist, I’ve witnessed first-hand the significant unmet medical need and lack of treatment options for children and adolescents living with CAH,” said Will Charlton, M.D., M.A.S., Chief Medical Officer, Spruce Biosciences. “The CAHptain-205 study results demonstrate safety and tolerability in pediatric CAH patients with weight-adjusted tildacerfont doses up to 200mg daily. While we are encouraged by the therapeutic activity of doses investigated in the study, we plan to continue dose-ranging across additional cohorts to evaluate dose selection to inform our registrational program. We anticipate topline results in the fourth quarter of 2024.” “I’m encouraged by the initial results from the CAHptain-205 study and the potential of tildacerfont to shift the treatment paradigm for pediatric classic CAH to a more balanced approach between androgens and GCs,” said Paul Thornton, M.B.B.S., Principal Investigator and Medical Director of the Endocrine and Diabetes Program at a CAH Center of Excellence. “These data suggest that tildacerfont may enable clinically meaningful reduction of A4 and GC levels in children and adolescents. This may improve long-term clinical outcomes, such as short stature and obesity, which are related to both androgen excess and exposure to chronic supraphysiologic GC doses.” Business and Financial Update The company intends to implement cost savings initiatives, including termination of the CAHmelia-203 study and a workforce reduction of approximately 21%. The company currently has over $81 million in cash and cash equivalents, which is anticipated to fund its current operating plan through the end of 2025, including through the CAHmelia-204 topline results and CAHptain-205 topline results from additional dosing cohorts. Conference Call Details Spruce’s management team and key study investigators will host a conference call today at 4:30 p.m. ET to discuss the topline results of the CAHmelia-203 and CAHptain-205 clinical studies. Analysts and investors can participate in the conference call by registering here or dialing (866) 777-2509. An archived copy of the call will be available on the events section of the company’s investor relations website for approximately 90 days. About CAHmelia-203 CAHmelia-203 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of tildacerfont in 96 adults with classic CAH and highly elevated levels of A4 at baseline while on stable glucocorticoid dosing. For the first six weeks, patients received blinded placebo to assess their adherence to their existing glucocorticoid therapy. Patients who continued to meet all eligibility criteria at the end of this period and where compliant with therapy entered a three-part treatment period. During the placebo-controlled treatment period, patients randomized in a blinded manner to receive placebo, 50mg, 100mg, or 200mg tildacerfont once daily. Dosing in the placebo-controlled treatment period continued for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint of the clinical trial was the assessment of dose response for the change in A4 from baseline to week 12. Following the placebo-controlled treatment period, all patients received tildacerfont following a dose-escalation protocol that allowed dose increase to 200mg once daily over 12 weeks. Following the 12-week dose-escalation period, all patients continued receiving tildacerfont at 200mg once daily for an additional 46 weeks. Patients who achieved control of A4 while on supraphysiologic glucocorticoid treatment had the opportunity to reduce their glucocorticoid dosing in the open-label period according to a pre-specified algorithm in the protocol. For more information about the CAHmelia program, please visit https://www.sprucebio.com/cahmelia. About CAHmelia-204 CAHmelia-204 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tildacerfont in reducing glucocorticoid usage in 100 adults with classic CAH on supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids with normal or near normal levels of A4 at baseline. This clinical trial is designed in two parts. In the first part of the clinical trial, patients will be randomized to receive 200mg tildacerfont once daily or placebo for 24 weeks. During the second part of the clinical trial, all patients will receive open-label 200mg tildacerfont once daily for 52 weeks. Throughout the trial, tapering of glucocorticoids will be guided according to a pre-specified algorithm and continue to the lowest level possible (physiologic replacement levels), as long as patients remain well controlled based on standard biomarkers and clinical assessments. The primary endpoint of this clinical trial is the absolute change in daily glucocorticoid dose from baseline at week 24. For more information about the CAHmelia program, please visit https://www.sprucebio.com/cahmelia. About CAHptain-205 CAHptain-205 is a Phase 2 open-label clinical trial, which utilized a sequential three cohort design, to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of tildacerfont in children two to 17 years of age. The study will also characterize changes in androgen levels over 12 weeks of treatment, and the ability to reduce daily glucocorticoid dose based on A4 normalization. An optional open-label extension period will provide additional open-label treatment with tildacerfont to provide long-term safety data for up to two years. Cohort 1 enrolled five participants between the ages of 11 and 17 years of age, who received a weight-adjusted, adult dose equivalent of 50mg QD of tildacerfont. Cohort 2 enrolled seven participants between the ages of 11 and 17 years of age, who received a weight-adjusted, adult dose equivalent of 200mg QD of tildacerfont. Cohort 3 enrolled 18 participants between the ages of two and 10 years of age, who received a weight-adjusted, adult dose equivalent of 200mg QD of tildacerfont. The primary endpoint of this clinical trial is safety. Additional secondary endpoints include the proportion of subjects who achieve reduction in A4 or daily glucocorticoid dosing at week 12 and the proportion of subjects with elevated A4 at baseline who achieve a reduction in A4 at week 4. For more information about the CAHptain program, please visit https://www.sprucebio.com/cahptain. About Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) CAH is an autosomal recessive disease, driven by a mutation in the gene that encodes an enzyme necessary for the synthesis of key adrenal hormones. In CAH patients, the body is not able to produce cortisol, leading to serious health consequences. The absence of cortisol alters the normal feedback cycle of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and leads to excess secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), hyperplasia of the adrenal gland, and consequently high levels of adrenal androgen production. As a result, CAH patients may suffer from premature puberty, impaired fertility, hirsutism, acne, the development of adrenal rest tumors, and an impaired quality of life, and additionally for females, virilized genitalia and menstrual irregularities. Currently, the only way to downregulate the production of excess androgens in CAH patients is to administer supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids, which present specific side effects, including increased risks of developing diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stunted growth, osteoporosis, thin skin, gastrointestinal disorders, and decreased lifespan. About Tildacerfont Tildacerfont is a potent and highly selective, non-steroidal, once-daily oral antagonist of the CRF1 receptor, which is the receptor for corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), a hormone that is secreted by the hypothalamus. The CRF1 receptor is abundantly expressed in the pituitary gland where it is the primary regulator of the HPA axis. By blocking the CRF1 receptor, tildacerfont has the potential to address the uncontrolled cortisol feedback regulatory pathway in CAH, and in turn reduce the production of ACTH in the pituitary, limiting the amount of androgen produced downstream from the adrenal gland. By controlling excess adrenal androgens through an independent mechanism, tildacerfont has the potential to reduce the unwanted clinical symptoms associated with high androgen exposure and could also enable treating physicians to lower the supraphysiologic glucocorticoid doses given to CAH patients to near physiologic levels. No drug-related serious adverse events have been reported related to tildacerfont treatment in completed studies.

(SPRO) announces financial results for Q4 and full year 2023, along with updates on SPR720 Phase 2a trial, Tebipenem HBr Phase 3 trial, and IND submission for SPR206. The company reiterates expected cash runway into late 2025. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Spero Therapeutics regarding their financial results and pipeline progress presents a multifaceted picture for stakeholders. The reported net income of $51.2 million for Q4 2023 and an overall net income of $22.8 million for the year is a significant turnaround from the net loss of $(46.4) million in the previous year. This improvement is primarily attributed to the collaboration revenue from partnerships with GSK and Pfizer, underscoring the value of strategic alliances in the biopharmaceutical industry. The milestone payments from GSK, including the recent $23.8 million tranche, enhance the company's cash position, extending the cash runway into late 2025, which is crucial for sustaining operations and funding ongoing clinical trials.However, the increase in research and development expenses, albeit offset by personnel cost savings, indicates an uptick in clinical activity which investors should monitor as it could impact future financials. The anticipated data from the SPR720 Phase 2a trial and the progress of the PIVOT-PO Phase 3 trial for tebipenem HBr are pivotal events that could influence the company's valuation and stock performance. Positive outcomes could lead to potential FDA approval and commercialization, whereas any setbacks may have adverse effects on investor confidence and the company's financial health. Medical Research Analyst The therapeutic pipeline updates provided by Spero Therapeutics have significant implications for the treatment of rare diseases and multi-drug resistant infections. SPR720, being an oral treatment for NTM-PD, represents a novel approach in a space with limited options. The upcoming top-line data from the Phase 2a trial will be critical in determining its efficacy and safety, which, if positive, could lead to a new standard of care and provide a substantial market opportunity for Spero.Similarly, tebipenem HBr has the potential to be a game-changer for patients with cUTI by providing an oral treatment alternative to intravenous therapies, potentially reducing hospital stays and healthcare costs. The Phase 3 PIVOT-PO trial, backed by an FDA Special Protocol Assessment, indicates a clear regulatory path forward, which could expedite the approval process upon successful trial outcomes. The unique value proposition of tebipenem HBr, as the first oral broad-spectrum carbapenem in the United States, could significantly impact treatment protocols and market dynamics upon approval. Infectious Disease Expert From an infectious disease perspective, the development of SPR206 is particularly noteworthy due to its activity against MDR Gram-negative pathogens, which are a growing public health concern due to limited treatment options. The advancement into a Phase 2 trial for hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia could address a critical need in hospital settings. The published preclinical and Phase 1 study results provide a scientific basis for its potential efficacy and safety profile. The support from government agencies like the Department of Defense and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases underscores the importance of SPR206's target indications and the need for innovative treatments in combating antibiotic resistance. 03/13/2024 - 04:01 PM On track for topline data from SPR720 Phase 2a proof-of-concept trial in treatment-naive and treatment-experienced non-refractory NTM-PD patients, expected in 2H 2024Initiated enrollment in PIVOT-PO, a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of oral Tebipenem HBr in cUTI Submitted IND for SPR206 and received FDA clearance to proceed with Phase 2 clinical trialReiterate expected cash runway into late 2025Conference call and webcast at 4:30pm ET today CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Spero Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SPRO), a multi-asset clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, focused on identifying and developing novel treatments for rare diseases and multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacterial infections, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023, and provided a business update. “2023 was a productive year for Spero and we have been focused on execution across our programs,” said Sath Shukla, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Spero. “We are well poised to unveil top-line data for SPR720 Phase 2a, which is expected in 2H 2024, and our excitement is fueled by the hope it may bring for the rare disease community grappling with nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease (NTM-PD). On tebipenem HBr, engaging with the FDA and in collaboration with our partner, GSK, we are actively enrolling patients globally in our Phase 3 PIVOT-PO clinical trial. Positioned as the first oral broad-spectrum carbapenem in the United States for cUTI, we believe this product has the potential to change the treatment paradigm for these patients and underscores Spero’s commitment to innovation. We reiterate our expected cash runway into late 2025 based on our year-end cash balance, along with tebipenem HBr development milestone payments from GSK and our disciplined capital allocation.” Pipeline Update SPR720 SPR720 is an investigational novel, oral, first-line treatment for NTM-PD. Top-line data from the Phase 2a proof-of-concept clinical trial in treatment-naive and treatment-experienced non-refractory NTM-PD patients is expected in 2H 2024. The trial is expected to enroll treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced participants with non-refractory NTM-PD due to Mycobacterium avium complex. The primary endpoint evaluates changes in bacterial load in sputum samples from baseline to the end of the 56-day treatment period. Key secondary endpoints include assessments of clinical response, quality of life, pharmacokinetics, and safety and tolerability. For more information on the trial, see ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT05496374.A paper Efficacy of SPR720 in murine models of non-tuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary infection (Nicole Cotroneo et al) was published in Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy in February 2024.A paper Nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease and the potential role of SPR720 (Kevin Winthrop et al) was published in Expert Review of Anti-infective Therapy in October 2023. Tebipenem HBr Tebipenem HBr is an investigational oral carbapenem antibiotic being developed for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) including acute pyelonephritis (AP) to help patients avoid hospitalizations or reduce duration of in-patient therapy. Spero commenced enrollment in PIVOT-PO, a global, randomized, double-blind, Phase 3 clinical trial of tebipenem HBr in patients with cUTI, including AP in December 2023. The trial compares oral tebipenem HBr with intravenous imipenem cilastatin, in hospitalized adult patients with cUTI/AP. The primary endpoint is the number of patients with overall response (a combination of clinical cure and favorable microbiological response) at the Test-of-Cure (TOC) visit. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 2,648 patients, with enrollment completion anticipated in 2H 2025. For more information on PIVOT-PO, refer to ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT06059846. In July 2023, Spero received written agreement from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA), on the design and size of PIVOT-PO. The FDA has indicated that positive and persuasive results from PIVOT-PO, supported with confirmatory evidence of efficacy, could be sufficient to support approval of tebipenem HBr as a treatment for cUTI, including pyelonephritis, for a limited use indication. Under the terms of its license agreement with GSK, in December 2023, upon dosing the first patient, Spero earned $95 million in development milestones payable in four equal installments over two years. Spero also received a $30 million development milestone payment following the SPA. Further details on the agreement with GSK can be found here. SPR206 SPR206 is an innovative, investigational IV-administered direct-acting next generation polymyxin that has shown antibiotic activity against MDR Gram-negative pathogens, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in preclinical studies. An Investigational New Drug (IND) application has been cleared by the FDA to advance SPR206, to treat MDR Gram-negative bacterial infections, into a Phase 2 clinical trial in participants with hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia.The results from the Phase 1 bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) study of SPR206 were published in a paper Pharmacokinetics of SPR206 in Plasma, Pulmonary Epithelial Lining Fluid, and Alveolar Macrophages following Intravenous Administration to Healthy Adult Subjects (Keith Rodvold et al) in Antimicrobials and Chemotherapy in July 2023. A paper Safety and pharmacokinetics of SPR206 in subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment (Jon B. Bruss et al) was published in Antimicrobials and Chemotherapy in October 2023. Corporate Highlights Satyavrat “Sath” Shukla successfully transitioned to President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the company, and a member of the Board of Directors in August 2023. Mr. Shukla had previously been Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of the company. Mr. Shukla succeeded Spero’s prior CEO and President, Ankit Mahadevia, M.D., who became Chair of the Board of Directors in August 2023.Esther Rajavelu was appointed as Chief Financial Officer, Chief Business Officer, and Treasurer in November 2023. Ms. Rajavelu brings over 20 years of experience working in the biotech and financial sectors focused on growth strategy, M&A, and financing. Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results Spero reported net income of $51.2 million for the fourth quarter and an overall net income of $22.8 million, for the year ended December 31, 2023, or a diluted net income per share of common stock of $0.96 and $0.43, respectively. Net income for the fourth quarter and net loss for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $26.8 million and $(46.4) million, or $0.55 and $(1.23) per share of common stock, respectively.Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $73.5 million, compared with total revenue of $47.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. The revenue increase for the fourth quarter of 2023 was primarily due to $71.8 million in collaboration revenue related to our agreements with GSK and Pfizer. Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $103.8 million, compared to $53.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The revenue increase for the year ended December 31, 2023, was primarily due to the aforementioned collaboration revenue related to our agreements with GSK and Pfizer.Research and development expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $16.6 million, compared to $15.1 million of research and development expenses for the same period in 2022. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $51.4 million, compared to $47.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in research and development expenses year-over-year was primarily due to increased clinical activity during the period related to the ongoing Phase 2a clinical trial of SPR720, offset by personnel-related costs.General and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $6.4 million, compared to $6.5 million of general and administrative expenses for the same period in 2022. This year-over-year decrease was primarily due to changes in personnel-related costs, offset by increased professional and consulting fees. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, were $25.6 million, compared to $36.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, with lower expenses in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to decreases in both personnel-related costs and professional and consulting fees.As of December 31, 2023, Spero had cash and cash equivalents of $76.3 million. Since the year-end closing of financials, the company received $23.8 million, the first tranche of the $95.0 million in development milestones from GSK. Based on its current operating plans, Spero expects that its cash and cash equivalents, together with other non-dilutive funding commitments, will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into late 2025.

Financial Analyst The financial results reported by Cue Health Inc. for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 reflect a challenging period for the company, with significant net losses and operating costs. The reported net loss of $148.4 million for the fourth quarter and $373.5 million for the full year indicate substantial financial pressure, exacerbated by one-time inventory charges and impairment of long-lived assets. The adjusted EBITDA loss of $24.4 million for the quarter and $163.8 million for the year further underscores the need for stringent cost management and operational efficiency.From an investment perspective, the company's cost reduction plans, which are projected to save approximately $200 million annually, could be a strategic move to improve financial health. However, investors should closely monitor the company's ability to generate revenue from its pipeline of diagnostic tests and the expansion of its Integrated Care Platform. The anticipated launch of new products, such as the Herpes + Mpox Multiplex Molecular Test, could provide additional revenue streams, but the success of these launches is not guaranteed.The guidance for the first quarter of 2024, with revenues projected between $9 million to $11 million, suggests a continued downward trend in revenue, which could be a point of concern for stakeholders. The company's current cash reserves of $80.9 million, with no debt obligations, provide some buffer, but the burn rate will be a critical factor to watch in the coming quarters. Market Research Analyst Examining Cue Health Inc.'s performance within the broader healthcare technology market, the company's focus on developing multiplex molecular tests for various diseases positions it within a competitive and high-growth potential segment. The demand for accurate, rapid diagnostic solutions, especially for conditions like Flu, RSV and COVID-19, is likely to remain high in the post-pandemic era.However, the company's significant gross profit losses, both GAAP and adjusted, indicate pricing pressures or inefficiencies in the cost of goods sold. The private sector revenue, constituting 91% of total revenue, suggests a strong reliance on this segment, which could be both an opportunity and a risk, depending on the market dynamics and competition.Given the anticipated product launches and the expansion of the Integrated Care Platform, the company's ability to capture market share and establish a strong customer base will be crucial. The 49% decrease in adjusted operating costs year-over-year is a positive sign of cost control, but it is essential to balance this with investments in marketing and sales to drive revenue growth. Medical Research Analyst From a medical research and regulatory standpoint, Cue Health's progress in submitting additional clinical samples and stability data for RSV and Flu A/B to the FDA is a critical step towards expanding its product portfolio. The de novo submission process is a rigorous FDA pathway for novel devices that can be lengthy and uncertain, but successful authorization can significantly enhance the company's market presence.The development of a Herpes + Mpox Multiplex Molecular Test is particularly noteworthy, as it addresses emerging healthcare needs. The planned submission for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the second quarter of 2024 could expedite the test's availability, which is essential during public health emergencies.It is important to note that the company has already secured two FDA authorizations for its COVID-19 and Mpox Molecular Tests, which demonstrates a track record of regulatory success. However, the financial investment required for research and development, as well as the regulatory approval process, must be weighed against the potential market demand and revenue generation capabilities of these new products. 03/13/2024 - 04:01 PM SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cue Health Inc.

Partial prepayment of term loan may lead to increased financial pressure in the future. Financial Analyst The reported net revenue of $91.5 million for the fourth quarter and $257.2 million for the full fiscal year indicates a stable financial performance by Coherus BioSciences. The breakdown into specific product sales such as UDENYCA® and CIMERLI® provides a clear picture of the company's revenue streams. The successful launch of LOQTORZI™ and UDENYCA ONBODY™ could signify the company's potential for growth and diversification in its product portfolio. However, it's crucial to understand how these new products will affect future revenue projections and the competitive landscape.The divestiture of the ophthalmology franchise and the subsequent debt prepayment plan showcase a strategic shift towards strengthening the company's focus on oncology, which may resonate well with investors focusing on specialized biotech firms. The reduction in the workforce by 30% is a significant cost-cutting measure that could improve operational efficiency but may also raise concerns about the company's ability to sustain growth and innovation. The impact of these changes on Coherus's stock will depend on the market's perception of the company's long-term strategy and its execution. Market Research Analyst The divestiture of the ophthalmology franchise to Sandoz for a notable $170 million upfront plus additional considerations suggests a strategic pivot for Coherus BioSciences. This move could be perceived positively by the market as it allows the company to streamline its focus on oncology, a sector with high growth potential. The prepayment of the substantial portion of debt to Pharmakon Advisors LP indicates fiscal prudence and may lead to reduced interest expenses, improving the company's net income in the long run. This financial maneuvering reflects a proactive approach to balance sheet management that is often well-regarded by investors.However, the impact of the workforce reduction on the company's morale and productivity cannot be ignored. While the immediate financial benefits are clear, the long-term effects on innovation and company culture are less certain. Investors will likely monitor how these changes influence the company's ability to maintain a competitive edge in the biopharmaceutical industry. Pharmaceutical Industry Analyst Coherus BioSciences' focus on the oncology sector following the divestiture of their ophthalmology franchise is a strategic decision that capitalizes on the growing demand for cancer treatments. The oncology market is known for its high barriers to entry due to the complexity of drug development and regulatory approvals, but it also offers substantial rewards for successful entrants. The successful launches of LOQTORZI™ and UDENYCA ONBODY™ could potentially enhance Coherus's market positioning within this lucrative sector.The financial results reflect a company in transition, with significant changes in its operational structure. The reduction in workforce, while a difficult decision, may be necessary for the company to align its resources with its strategic focus and to remain competitive in the high-stakes oncology market. Stakeholders should monitor how these changes affect the company's research and development pipeline and its ability to bring new, innovative treatments to market. 03/13/2024 - 04:01 PM – Net revenue of $91.5 million in the fourth quarter and $257.2 million in FY 2023 – – UDENYCA® net sales of $36.2 million in the fourth quarter and $127.1 million in FY 2023 – – CIMERLI® net sales of $52.4 million in the fourth quarter and $125.4 million in FY 2023 – – LOQTORZI™ and UDENYCA ONBODY™ successfully launched in Q1 2024 – – Reduction of work force of 30% for 2024 initiated on March 7, 2024 – – Conference call today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time – REDWOOD CITY, Calif., March 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Coherus BioSciences, Inc.

Category 1 represents the highest level of evidence and uniformity among panel members in terms of agreement that translates into ease of reimbursement and the ability to establish a new standard of care for these patients.Payer coverage for LOQTORZI has been confirmed across Medicare Fee for Service, as well as national and regional commercial health plans.Early demand uptake tracking to expectations, with over 59 NPC targeted accounts ordering the product since launch. NOVEL IMMUNO-ONCOLOGY PIPELINE ADVANCES In January 2024, Coherus entered into a clinical collaboration with INOVIO to evaluate LOQTORZI (toripalimab-tpzi) in combination with INO-3112 in a Phase 3 clinical trial as a potential treatment for patients with locoregionally advanced, high-risk, HPV16/18 positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), a type of head and neck cancer commonly known as throat cancer.Coherus presented new Phase 1b/2 clinical data for casdozokitug, a first-in-class IL-27 antagonist at the 2023 ESMO IO Congress in December and 2024 ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium in January.

Importantly, responses were associated with IL-27 related biomarkers and data support planned clinical trials with casdozokitug/ toripalimab-tpzi in NSCLC and HCC.New preclinical data for CHS-1000 has been selected for a poster presentation at the upcoming 2024 AACR Annual Meeting being held April 5-10, 2024, in San Diego.Coherus plans to file an Investigational New Drug (IND) application in second quarter of 2024 for CHS-1000, a novel ILT4-targeted antibody. “Throughout 2023, Coherus demonstrated significant progress in transforming the Company’s business model and product portfolio for long-term sustainable growth,” said Denny Lanfear, Coherus’ Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “We are clearly focused on driving our revenues, reducing our costs, and advancing our pipeline, with constant attention to long-term shareholder value. The divestiture of CIMERLI and debt paydown improves our capital structure and sharpens our focus on oncology. With a robust portfolio of FDA-approved products and a promising immuno-oncology pipeline, we are now better positioned than ever to execute on our mission of extending the lives of cancer patients.” FOURTH QUARTER and FULL YEAR 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS Net revenue was $91.5 million during the three months ended December 31, 2023 and included $36.2 million of net sales of UDENYCA, $52.4 million of net sales of CIMERLI, $2.2 million of net sales of YUSIMRY™ which was launched in July 2023 and $0.6 million of net sales of LOQTORZI which began shipping to distributors in December 2023 in preparation for launch. Net revenue was $45.4 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, net revenue was $257.2 million and $211.0 million, respectively. The increases in total net revenues were driven by the launches of CIMERLI and YUSIMRY and by the return to growth of UDENYCA throughout 2023. Cost of goods sold (COGS) was $84.6 million and $14.2 million during the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $159.0 million and $70.1 million during the full year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increases in COGS for the three month and the annual periods each included a $47.0 million charge for the write-down of slow moving YUSIMRY inventory and the related partial recognition of certain firm purchase commitments. Increases in COGS also included $19.4 million and $47.5 million in royalty costs compared to the quarterly and annual periods in the prior year, respectively and increases in product costs of $11.5 million and $25.0 million, respectively, primarily driven by CIMERLI sales. The increase in the year over year COGS was partially offset by a $26.0 million write-down in the third quarter 2022 of inventory at risk of expiration and due to the sale in the second half 2023 of certain of those UDENYCA units having a total original cost of $9.9 million but no carrying value following the write-down. UDENYCA COGS includes a mid-single digit royalty on net sales payable through the first half of 2024, and CIMERLI® COGS includes a low to mid 50% royalty on gross profits. Research and development (R&D) expense for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $26.4 million and $29.0 million, respectively. For the full year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, R&D expense was $109.4 million and $199.4 million, respectively. The decline compared to the prior year periods primarily resulted from the reduction in scope of the toripalimab collaboration and from the recognition in the first quarter of 2022 of the $35.0 million option exercise fee paid to Junshi Biosciences to license CHS-006. R&D expense for the full year of 2022 also included development costs for additional presentations of UDENYCA and certain manufacturing expenses for YUSIMRY which began to be capitalized in mid-2022. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense was $49.5 million and $53.6 million during the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $192.0 million and $198.5 million during the full year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decline in SG&A expense in both periods compared to the prior year periods primarily reflects lower headcount, partially offset by transaction costs associated with the Surface acquisition. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $79.7 million, or $(0.71) per share on a basic and diluted basis, compared to a net loss of $58.9 million, or $(0.76) per share on a basic and diluted basis for the same period in 2022. Net loss for the full year of 2023 was $237.9 million, or $(2.53) per share on a basic and diluted basis, compared to a net loss of $291.8 million, or $(3.76) per share on a basic and diluted basis for the full year of 2022. Non-GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $68.9 million, or $(0.62) per share on a basic and diluted basis, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $47.1 million, or $(0.60) per share on a basic and diluted basis for the same period in 2022. Non-GAAP net loss for the full year of 2023 was $186.2 million, or $(1.98) per share on a basic and diluted basis, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $234.8 million, or $(3.02) per share on a basic and diluted basis for the full year of 2022. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for a discussion on how Coherus calculates non-GAAP net loss and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities were $117.7 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $191.7 million at December 31, 2022. 2024 R&D and SG&A Expense Guidance Coherus is introducing a guidance range of combined 2024 R&D and SG&A expenses from $250 to $265 million. This guidance includes approximately $40 million of stock-based compensation expense and excludes the effects of strategic acquisitions, collaborations or investments, the exercise of rights or options related to collaboration programs, and any other transactions or circumstances not yet identified or quantified.

The SGRBX features low noise, integrated EMI filter, high efficiency up to 96%, and radiation-hardened design for space applications. Positive None. Negative None. Electrical Engineer The introduction of VPT Inc.'s SGRBX configurable box solution represents a significant advancement in power conversion technology for space applications. The use of GaN (Gallium Nitride) technology is a notable development, as GaN is known for its high efficiency and ability to handle higher voltages and temperatures compared to traditional silicon-based technologies. This translates to power converters that are not only more efficient but also more reliable and suitable for the harsh conditions of space.The SGRBX's capability to deliver up to 1600 watts of output power and its scalability through paralleling multiple units to achieve even higher power levels is a testament to its versatility. The integration of an EMI filter and its radiation-hardened design, which includes guaranteed Total Ionizing Dose (TID) performance and Single Event Effects (SEE) performance, ensures that the SGRBX meets the stringent requirements of commercial, scientific and military space missions. This could potentially lead to increased demand for VPT's products in the space sector, impacting the company's market share and revenue in this niche market. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the release of the SGRBX could position VPT and by extension HEICO, as a leader in the space-rated power conversion market. The emphasis on high efficiency and low noise is particularly relevant for space applications where power efficiency is critical due to limited energy resources. As space exploration and commercial space ventures continue to grow, the demand for advanced components that can withstand space conditions is expected to rise. VPT's innovation in this area may give it a competitive edge and could be a driver for growth, potentially affecting HEICO's stock performance.It is also important to note that the space technology market is subject to stringent regulations and export license restrictions. As such, VPT's ability to navigate these regulations successfully will be crucial in determining the global reach and adoption of the SGRBX. The announcement of the immediate availability of the SGRBX for sale suggests a readiness to meet market demand, which could have positive implications for the company's short-term sales performance.

She has nearly 30 years of engineering experience. ""I was the first in my family to attend college,"" she shared. ""My dad had an eighth-grade education, and my mom had a high school education, but they both knew the value of a college degree and strongly encouraged me to go to school and pursue a great career,"" she continued. ""My cousin also attended Colorado School of Mines, which influenced my decision to become an engineer, too.""What excites her about her role and the energy industryIn her role at MPC, she is responsible for identifying and driving the strategic vision of the technical services team to help execute the business plans of MPLX Gathering & Processing (G&P). ""What excites me the most about my role is getting to work with a group of engineers with diverse technical backgrounds, all coming together to support the technical operations of G&P,"" she shared. ""It's a lot of fun working with such a great team of people.""Jeannette also shared what excites her about the energy industry. ""Energy is a vital resource that makes people's lives better. The industry is always evolving through technological advancements, and we're continuing to find efficient ways to produce energy while protecting the environment. I'm excited to be part of the energy industry and enjoy attending conferences and networking with other experts in the sector and bringing those learnings back to my team.""Her perspective on why more women should consider a career in engineering""I'd encourage women to consider a career in engineering because there are many different types of engineering roles to explore. Engineers are often well compensated, and it's a lot of fun,"" she shared. ""Women also bring unique perspectives and experiences to the role to help strengthen companies and teams.""In 2020, women made up only 14 percent of the U.S. engineering workforce according to the Society of Women Engineers. ""I think engineering can oftentimes be portrayed as getting dirty and wearing steel-toed boots and hard hats, but if we're going to draw more middle school and high school girls into engineering and other STEM fields, we have to show them why it's fun,"" she shared.From an early age, Jeannette's parents gave her hands-on learning toys and encouraged STEM activities to show her that STEM learning can be fun. ""I recall playing with Lincoln Logs and engaging in activities where science meets nature, such as collecting rocks and growing crystals,"" she shared. ""My husband and I did the same for our children when they were younger by giving them old toolboxes and encouraging them to fix things or build things for their toys, whether it was a ramp for their Hot Wheels or a ramp for their Barbie doll to walk across the red carpet,"" she continued. ""We wanted them to know that problems can be fixed and problem-solving can be fun.""Her advice to women engineers who are early in their career""I'd encourage women engineers who are early in their career to believe in themselves and don't be afraid to fail. I'd also encourage them to find mentors that they can learn from and know that they don't have to have all the answers. It's okay to ask questions, learn and ask for help when needed.""Her involvement in MPC's Women's employee networkJeannette is a leader of our Women's employee network chapter in Denver, Colorado. ""Our Women's employee network chapter helps support the company's goals and provides women an opportunity to network with other MPC employees,"" she shared. ""Our network also supports leadership development opportunities and is a place for women and allies to share their personal and professional experiences.

Hot forming process enables stamping of advanced high-strength steel for safety critical applications. TWB Company plans to invest in supporting customers embracing the technology. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The licensing agreement between TWB Company, LLC and ArcelorMittal Tailored Blanks to utilize patented ablation technology signifies a strategic move in the steel industry, particularly within the automotive sector. This move is poised to enhance Worthington Steel's competitive edge by expanding its product offerings to include hot formed tailored blanks—a segment that is experiencing rapid growth due to the automotive industry's increasing demand for advanced high-strength steel (AHSS).The introduction of ablation technology, which facilitates the welding of AHSS, is expected to yield benefits such as improved crash performance and weight reduction in vehicles, which are critical factors for automotive manufacturers aiming to meet stringent safety and fuel efficiency standards. The adoption of this technology by TWB could lead to increased market share and potentially higher revenues for Worthington Steel, given the technology's relevance in producing components for safety and weight-critical applications. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the investment in a fully automated ablation line represents a significant capital expenditure for Worthington Steel. However, it also indicates a forward-looking approach to capitalizing on emerging market trends. The 12-15 month OEM qualification period suggests a medium-term horizon before revenue generation from this technology begins. Investors should monitor the progress of this qualification phase, as it will be a critical determinant of the timeline for financial returns on the investment.Furthermore, the exclusive nature of the licensing agreement could provide TWB with a competitive moat in North America, potentially leading to pricing power and improved profit margins. The impact on Worthington Steel's stock will depend on the successful integration of the technology and the market's reception of the enhanced product offerings. The company's ability to leverage this technology to secure contracts with automotive OEMs will be a key factor to watch. Automotive Industry Expert The integration of ablation technology in the production of hot formed tailored blanks addresses the automotive industry's push towards lightweighting and safety enhancements. Ablation technology's ability to remove aluminum silicon coating on weld edges is a nuanced but significant advancement, allowing for the welding of press hardened materials. This process is integral to manufacturing components that contribute to vehicle safety and efficiency.Given the automotive industry's trajectory towards electrification and stricter emissions regulations, TWB's expansion in AHSS capabilities may lead to greater collaboration with automotive manufacturers. As these manufacturers increasingly seek out suppliers who can provide innovative solutions for lightweight and safe vehicle structures, TWB's early adoption of this technology could position it as a preferred supplier and drive long-term growth for Worthington Steel. 03/13/2024 - 04:00 PM COLUMBUS, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Worthington Steel, Inc.

The sequential increase from $3.8 million in the third quarter to $6.1 million in the fourth quarter suggests robust demand and effective market penetration strategies. The gross-to-net discount improvement from 21% to 18% indicates a favorable pricing dynamic, which could lead to improved margins over time. However, the expectation of an increasing discount due to contracting efforts may temper the margin expansion outlook.Investors should note the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, which more than doubled from the previous year, reflecting heightened commercial activity and possibly an expanded workforce. While necessary for growth, this increase in expenses has contributed to a net full-year loss of $54.8 million, deepening from $36.8 million in the previous year. The company's cash position of $76 million, while lower than the previous year-end, appears sufficient to support ongoing operations and R&D efforts in the near term. Medical Research Analyst scPharmaceuticals' strategic focus on lifecycle management and expansion of FUROSCIX's indications, such as the potential inclusion for NYHA Class IV heart failure patients and chronic kidney disease, is an important aspect for investors to consider. The initiation of a pivotal pharmacokinetic study for an 80mg/1mL auto-injector represents innovation in drug delivery systems, potentially enhancing patient adherence and expanding the addressable market. The sNDA submissions and formulary inclusion with a large government retiree payer are key regulatory and market access milestones that could significantly impact future revenue streams.It is also critical to monitor the clinical and regulatory developments, such as the FDA's review of the sNDA for expanding FUROSCIX's indication. Positive outcomes in these areas could further validate the product's efficacy and safety, leading to broader market adoption and potentially impacting stock valuation positively. Market Research Analyst The reported metrics such as the number of FUROSCIX doses written and filled, the increase in unique prescribers and completed in-services provide a quantitative measure of market engagement and adoption among healthcare providers. The 44% sequential increase in filled doses and the 52% increase in unique prescribers from the previous quarter are particularly encouraging, as they suggest a growing prescriber base and user acceptance. The addition of 1.1 million lives with preferred access to FUROSCIX through formulary placement is a significant market expansion that can drive future revenue growth.Furthermore, the company's sales to integrated delivery networks, including a large order to one of the largest closed IDNs in the United States, demonstrates the product's penetration into key healthcare networks, which is often a critical factor for sustained growth in the pharmaceutical sector. 03/13/2024 - 04:01 PM Generated 4Q 2023 net FUROSCIX® revenue of $6.1 million, at the upper end of the range provided in January and representing sequential growth of 61% from $3.8 million in 3Q 2023 Generated full-year net FUROSCIX® revenue of $13.6 million, at the upper end of the range provided in January Ended 2023 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $76 million Company to host investor conference call and webcast today, Wednesday, March 13, at 4:30pm ET BURLINGTON, Mass., March 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- scPharmaceuticals Inc.

However, we continue to anticipate that the GTN discount will increase over time as our contracting efforts continue to evolve and mature.” “Also, during the fourth quarter, we continued to advance the life cycle management and long-term growth initiatives for FUROSCIX that we previewed last quarter. These include the potential expansion of the FUROSCIX indication to include NYHA Class IV heart failure patients, which is currently under review by FDA, an additional indication in chronic kidney disease, for which we plan to file with the FDA next month , and the development of an auto-injector that would complement the current on-body infusor, a PK study for which we plan to initiate in the next few weeks. We continue to advance these initiatives while at the same time successfully driving uptake of FUROSCIX, and both our fourth quarter results and leading indicators confirm that FUROSCIX acceptance and utilization among heart failure specialists is accelerating,” Mr. Tucker concluded.

FUROSCIX® (furosemide injection) 80 mg/10mL for subcutaneous use FUROSCIX® is indicated for the treatment of congestion due to fluid overload in adult patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II and Class III chronic heart failure. FUROSCIX is not indicated for use in emergency situations or in patients with acute pulmonary edema. The On-Body Infusor will deliver only an 80-mg dose of FUROSCIX. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FUROSCIX is contraindicated in patients with anuria, patients with a history of hypersensitivity to furosemide or medical adhesives and in patients with hepatic cirrhosis or ascites. Furosemide may cause fluid, electrolyte, and metabolic abnormalities, particularly in patients receiving higher doses, patients with inadequate oral electrolyte intake, and in elderly patients. Serum electrolytes, CO2, BUN, creatinine, glucose, and uric acid should be monitored frequently during furosemide therapy. Excessive diuresis may cause dehydration and blood volume reduction with circulatory collapse and possibly vascular thrombosis and embolism, particularly in elderly patients. In patients with hepatic cirrhosis and ascites, sudden alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic encephalopathy and coma. Treatment in such patients is best initiated in the hospital. Furosemide can cause dehydration and azotemia. If increasing azotemia and oliguria occur during treatment of severe progressive renal disease, furosemide should be discontinued. Cases of tinnitus and reversible or irreversible hearing impairment and deafness have been reported with furosemide. Reports usually indicate that furosemide ototoxicity is associated with rapid injection, severe renal impairment, the use of higher than recommended doses, hypoproteinemia or concomitant therapy with aminoglycoside antibiotics, ethacrynic acid, or other ototoxic drugs. In patients with severe symptoms of urinary retention (because of bladder emptying disorders, prostatic hyperplasia, urethral narrowing), the administration of furosemide can cause acute urinary retention related to increased production and retention of urine. These patients require careful monitoring, especially during the initial stages of treatment. The most common adverse reactions with FUROSCIX administration in clinical trials were site and skin reactions including erythema, bruising, edema, and injection site pain.

Positive None. Negative None. 03/13/2024 - 03:55 PM Nearly Two-Thirds of the Respondents Expect At Least 80% of Their Portfolios To Be Green-Certified in Next Three YearsASIA PACIFIC / ACCESSWIRE / March 13, 2024 / The role of Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO*) is rapidly gaining prominence among the Asia Pacific region as investors display increased appetite for sustainable portfolios, according to CBRE's Asia Pacific Real Estate Chief Sustainability Officer Survey.In collaboration with the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), CBRE conducted a survey among real estate companies and investment funds in Asia Pacific to understand how they perceive the role of CSO, their Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) strategies and challenges, and prospect for achieving net zero.About half of surveyed asset owners named 2050 as their target to achieve net zero, largely aligning with the targets set by their government. However, many multinational occupiers are aiming to reach net zero by 2030. The discrepancy is primarily because building materials and construction activity are carbon-intensive for asset owners, particularly developers, while service sector tenants are asset-light and mainly focusing on operational emissions.""Asset owners have to be aware of the much more aggressive net zero target among occupiers. Both parties must collaborate and drive a common sustainability agenda,"" said Ada Choi, Head of Occupier Research, Asia Pacific, for CBRE. ""We expect projects that could result in cost and energy savings will be prioritised, while investors are advised to increase the use of green finance.""The survey reveals that about half of the CSO roles in Asia Pacific were created within the past three years, with 60% of them as full-time positions. With new regulations requiring sustainability disclosures, the key responsibility of CSOs is to conduct ESG monitoring and reporting, and to implement related projects. CSOs are also responsible for fostering cultural change within the company to achieve sustainability goals.""The path to decarbonization involves significant regulatory change and policy support,"" said David Fogarty, Head of ESG Consulting Services, Singapore & Southeast Asia, for CBRE. ""In view of a complex sustainability landscape, it is crucial for occupiers and investors to develop a strategic blueprint to navigate evolving regulations and achieve progress on decarbonization and net zero goals.""To read the full report, click here.* Chief Sustainability Officer, or Head of ESG, is an executive tasked with overseeing ESG / sustainability initiatives.

""The support from the Department of Energy and the state of Michigan is crucial for realizing our factory, which will create new green industrial jobs and be a significant contribution to the energy transition,"" says Nel's President and CEO, Håkon Volldal. ""It is encouraging to see the Department of Energy taking these strategic steps to stimulate a clean energy economy, and we appreciate their long-time support to take our products from R&D to commercial products,"" he says. On 13 March, the Department of Energy announced that they have granted Nel USD 50 million in direct investment support for the company's planned new US gigafactory and workforce development initiatives in the Detroit region. Partnering with General Motors, Macomb Community College, Wayne State University's College of Engineering, and others, DOE's investment will further enhance domestic electrolyser manufacturing production capacity while building a robust clean hydrogen value chain and an industrialized manufacturing training program. In parallel, the state of Michigan awarded USD 25 million in direct investment support to lead the nation in the clean energy transition. ""By harnessing our Make it in Michigan Competitiveness Fund and partnering with the Biden-Harris Administration, we are creating more than 500 good-paying, high-tech jobs in Plymouth,"" says Governor Whitmer. ""Today's investment in Nel Hydrogen will create a hydrogen production facility and ensure we stay on the cutting-edge of clean energy production and advanced manufacturing. Let's keep working together to bring jobs and projects home as we grow our economy and deliver for Michigan families."" ""Today's announcement is another example of how Michigan is leading America's technology and clean energy future,"" says Lieutenant Governor Garlin Gilchrist II. ""Because of a matching investment from the Michigan Competitiveness Fund, this federal grant will enable our partners to create more than 500 good-paying, high-tech jobs in Plymouth. Governor Whitmer and I will keep working to create jobs and win projects that will grow our economy and help more people `make it' in Michigan."" Nel has previously been awarded approximately USD 50 million from the state of Michigan in support of this electrolyser production facility (see the press release issued on 8 July 2023). Total support from federal and state authorities amounts to approximately USD 125 million. Fully built out, the Michigan site is expected to have an annual nameplate production capacity of 4 GW. In the planned new facility, Nel will manufacture its next-generation electrolyser technologies: the PEM stacks currently being developed together with General Motors, and pressurized alkaline stacks.

Market Research Analyst The announcement of the confirmation of a hearing date for the acquisition of American Equity Investment Life Holding Company by Brookfield Reinsurance represents a significant milestone in a transaction that could reshape the competitive landscape of the U.S. annuity markets. This acquisition, if approved, could potentially increase Brookfield Reinsurance's market share and influence in the insurance sector, particularly in annuity products which are a cornerstone for retirement planning in the United States.From a market research perspective, the integration of AEL into Brookfield's operations could result in synergies that enhance product offerings and customer service. Furthermore, the acquisition may lead to cost efficiencies through economies of scale and the consolidation of administrative processes. It's important to monitor how this acquisition might affect Brookfield's financial performance, as well as the potential market reactions in terms of stock price volatility in the short-term following the closure of the deal. Financial Analyst Investors should closely observe the financial metrics and terms of the deal, such as the acquisition price, the method of financing and the expected return on investment. The deal's effect on Brookfield Reinsurance's balance sheet, including any changes in debt levels or cash flows, will be a key area of focus. The long-term success of the acquisition will largely depend on Brookfield's ability to effectively integrate AEL's operations and realize the projected financial benefits.Additionally, the exchangeability of shares between Brookfield Reinsurance and Brookfield Corporation adds a layer of complexity for shareholders to consider.

The outcome of the hearing will be pivotal in determining whether the transaction proceeds.It is also essential to assess the potential legal and regulatory risks associated with the acquisition, including compliance with insurance regulations and the integration of AEL's policies and contracts.

Negative None. 03/13/2024 - 10:30 AM VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / March 13, 2024 / Falcon Gold Corp. (FG:TSXV)(3FA:GR)(FGLDF:OTCQB); (""Falcon"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce that the Company has awarded a drilling contract to CentreLine Drilling of Newfoundland to conduct a diamond drilling program at its 100% owned Great Burnt Copper Project in Central Newfoundland. The Company initially plans to test up to ten geophysical anomalies with a maximum of 1100 metres of drilling. Falcon will provide further guidance on an estimated drill start date once logistics for the program are determined and remaining service providers are confirmed.Falcon holds 2,275 hectares in the Great Burnt camp, with licenses located north of, and contiguous to, Benton Resources Inc. - Spruce Ridge Resources Ltd. Great Burnt Copper-Gold joint venture (see Figure 1). Benton Resources Inc. (""Benton"") recently optioned the Great Burnt Copper-Gold Project from Spruce Ridge Resources Ltd. (""Spruce Ridge"") in an agreement that allows Benton to earn a 70% interest in the property (see press release dated August 17, 2023). The Benton-Spruce Ridge property is host to the Great Burnt Copper Zone, a deposit with an indicated resource of 381,300 tonnes at 2.68% Cu and inferred resources of 663,100 tonnes at 2.10% Cu (https://www.spruceridgeresources.com/great-burnt.php). Recent drilling by Benton at the Great Burnt Copper Deposit reported drill results that returned 7.20% Cu, 7.12 g/t Ag, and 0.05% Co over 12.30 metres (see press release dated December 5, 2023). Previous drilling in 2020 by Spruce Ridge reported 8.06% Cu over 27.2 m (TSXV: SHL press release dated March 18, 2021). The Great Burnt Greenstone Belt is prospective for copper and gold, and further hosts the South Pond A and South Pond B copper-gold zones, and the End Zone copper prospect along a 14 km mineralized corridor. The mineralized corridor occurs along a conductive trend, and this conductive trend continues into Falcon's Great Burnt Copper Property (see right-hand-side image in Figure 2). The presence of mineral occurrences within ground adjacent to Falcon's Great Burnt Copper Property cannot be used as an indication of mineralization within Falcon's property itself.Figure 1. Location of proposed drilling within Falcon's recent acquisition proximal to the Benton - Spruce Ridge Great Burnt Copper-Gold joint venture in Central Newfoundland. Karim Rayani, Chief Executive Officer, commented; ""We are very excited to move forward on our first phase of exploration drilling at our Great Burnt Copper Project. The Great Burnt camp is quickly becoming recognized for its high-grade copper tenor demonstrated by Benton Resources Inc.'s recent successful drilling (see Benton Resources Inc. press release dated January 30, 2024). Benton's success at Great Burnt and recent press releases from FireFly Metals Ltd that disclose plans to advance the high-grade Green Bay Copper-Gold project in the Rambler camp have put the copper potential of VMS Deposits in Newfoundland front and center. The Green Bay Copper-Gold project hosts a mineral inventory that includes aggregate measured, indicated and inferred resources of 39.2Mt @1.83% Cu (click here to view the report). We believe that Benton's recent success at Great Burnt is a testament to the untapped VMS potential of the Great Burnt area, and we are thrilled to hold an extensive strike extent of this unexplored, never-drilled horizon.""The Great Burnt Copper PropertyThe property is hosted within the Great Burnt Greenstone Belt (GBGB) which hosts massive sulphide deposits that have been interpreted as Besshi-type. These types of deposits generally occur as laterally extensive sheets of pyrrhotite- or pyrite-rich sulphide rock within mixed volcanic-sedimentary environments. Sulphide lenses can be several metres thick and extend for several kilometres. Besshi-type massive-sulphide deposits are generally copper dominant, commonly contain other lithophile elements like cobalt or lead, and can contain precious metals such as gold and silver. The property is also located four km west of the Crest Resources-Exploits Discovery joint venture project within the Exploits Subzone. The Exploits Subzone contains deep-seated gold-bearing structures of the Dog Bay-Appleton Fault-GRUB Line deformation corridor that contains the high-grade Keats Gold Zone of New Found Gold Corp.Figure 2.

Announces $3.5 Million Private Placement Priced At-The-Market under Nasdaq Rules Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags AI Rhea-AI Summary Gaxos.ai Inc. (NASDAQ: GXAI) announced a private placement of common stock and warrants, totaling 628,367 shares, at a purchase price of $5.57 per share. The series A and short-term series B warrants have exercise prices of $5.50 per share and expire at different intervals. The private placement is set to close soon. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The private placement of common stock and warrants by Gaxos.ai Inc. represents a strategic move to raise capital, likely aimed at funding ongoing operations or expanding their AI technology development. The capital infusion, priced at $5.57 per share, is in line with market regulations, which suggests a fair valuation and adherence to market rules. However, it's critical to assess the dilutive impact on existing shareholders. The immediate exercisability of the warrants could lead to a potential increase in the number of shares outstanding, which may depress the stock price in the short term if the market perceives the terms as unfavorable.From a long-term perspective, the use of the raised funds is paramount. If the capital is allocated efficiently towards projects with high return potential, it could lead to future growth and profitability, thereby offsetting the initial dilution. Investors should closely monitor the company's deployment of the raised capital and any subsequent earnings guidance. Market Research Analyst Gaxos.ai's engagement in a private placement transaction signals a proactive approach to capital management. Given the competitive nature of the AI sector, raising capital through such means is not uncommon. It is essential to understand the market sentiment towards Gaxos.ai's growth prospects and how this capital raise aligns with its strategic initiatives. The exercise price of $5.50 for both series A and B warrants is slightly below the purchase price, which could be perceived as an incentive for investors to exercise these warrants, potentially leading to increased investor confidence.However, the market's response to the private placement will largely depend on Gaxos.ai's current market positioning, its technological edge over competitors and the clarity of its growth strategy. Investors would benefit from a comparative analysis of Gaxos.ai's performance metrics against industry benchmarks to gauge the potential impact of this transaction on the company's market value. Legal Expert The structuring of Gaxos.ai's private placement, including the issuance of series A and B warrants, must comply with the Nasdaq rules governing at-the-market offerings. This compliance ensures that the transaction meets regulatory standards, which is crucial for investor protection. The details regarding the exercisability and expiration of the warrants are significant, as they define the timeframe in which investors can potentially influence the company's share structure. Legal transparency in such transactions is essential to maintain investor trust and to prevent any potential legal disputes related to securities law.Investors should also consider the governance implications of such a transaction. The addition of new investors through a private placement could alter the balance of power among shareholders, especially if the new shares represent a significant proportion of the company's equity. It is advisable for investors to review the terms of the agreement in detail to understand their rights and any changes to shareholder voting dynamics. 03/13/2024 - 03:07 PM Roseland, NJ, March 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gaxos.ai Inc. (NASDAQ: GXAI), (“Gaxos” or the “Company”), a company developing artificial intelligence applications across various sectors, today announced that it has entered into definitive agreements for the purchase and sale of an aggregate of 628,367 shares of common stock (or pre-funded warrant in lieu thereof), series A warrants to purchase up to 628,367 shares of common stock and short-term series B warrants to purchase up to 628,367 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $5.57 per share (or per pre-funded warrant in lieu thereof) and accompanying warrants, in a private placement priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules. The series A warrants and short-term series B warrants will have an exercise price of $5.50 per share and will be exercisable immediately upon issuance. The series A warrants will expire five and one-half years from the date of issuance and the short-term series B warrants will expire twenty-four months from the date of issuance. The private placement is expected to close on or about March 15, 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. H.C. Wainwright & Co. is acting as the exclusive placement agent for the offering. The gross proceeds from the offering are expected to be approximately $3.5 million, prior to deducting placement agent’s fees and other offering expenses payable by Gaxos.

The anticipated breakeven on an Adjusted EBITDA basis by Q3 and profitability in Q4 offers a potential turnaround point, but these projections hinge on the successful execution of the company's initiatives and market conditions. The addition of $213 million to the backlog suggests a solid pipeline, but the ability to convert this backlog into revenue efficiently will be critical for the company's financial health. Market Research Analyst The solar industry is experiencing increased competition and price sensitivity, which places emphasis on FTC Solar's strategic moves to improve customer engagement and enhance their product portfolio. The company's focus on operating efficiencies to lower the breakeven revenue level is in response to industry pressures for cost optimization. The backlog growth indicates market demand, but the company's ability to capitalize on this demand through accelerated project delivery will be a key factor in future performance.Investor sentiment may be influenced by the CEO succession plan, as leadership stability is often linked to strategic continuity and investor confidence. The search for a CEO with potential for a long tenure suggests a strategic pivot or sustained growth focus, which will be closely monitored by the market. The company's performance in the upcoming quarters will be pivotal in validating the effectiveness of its strategic initiatives and operational improvements. Legal Expert FTC Solar's financial disclosures reveal a reliance on non-GAAP measures such as adjusted EBITDA to convey a more favorable view of financial health. It is crucial for investors to understand the implications of these adjustments, as they exclude stock-based compensation and other non-cash items that impact the company's actual cash flow. Transparency in financial reporting is essential for investor trust and the company's disclosures should be scrutinized to ensure they accurately represent the company's operational and financial position.The appointment of a new Chairman of the Customer Advisory Board does not directly impact financial performance but can influence strategic customer relations and potentially lead to revenue growth through improved engagement. The legal and regulatory compliance of the succession process for the CEO will also be an area of interest, ensuring that it aligns with corporate governance standards. 03/13/2024 - 04:01 PM Fourth Quarter Highlights and Recent DevelopmentsFourth quarter revenue of $23.2 millionContinue to improve cost structure to lower break-even revenue levelAdded approximately $213 million to backlog1 since Nov. 8; acceleration in contracted projectsAnthony Carroll appointed Chairman of Customer Advisory Board AUSTIN, Texas, March 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FTC Solar, Inc.

Summary Financial Performance: Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022 U.S. GAAP Non-GAAP Three months ended December 31, (in thousands, except per share data) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Revenue $23,201 $26,220 $23,201 $26,220 Gross margin percentage 3.0% (7.3%) 4.8% (3.4%)Total operating expenses $12,428 $17,947 $10,848 $9,971 Loss from operations(a) $(11,736) $(19,861) $(10,050) $(10,976)Net loss $(11,177) $(20,501) $(9,657) $(11,499)Diluted loss per share $(0.09) $(0.20) $(0.08) $(0.11) (a) Adjusted EBITDA for Non-GAAP Total fourth-quarter revenue was $23.2 million, coming in at the mid-point of our target range. This revenue level represents a decrease of 24.1% compared to the prior quarter, on both lower product and logistics volumes. Compared to the year-earlier quarter, revenue decreased 11.5%, driven by lower logistics volumes. GAAP gross profit was $0.7 million, or 3.0% of revenue, compared to gross profit of $3.4 million, or 11.1% of revenue, in the prior quarter. Non-GAAP gross profit was $1.1 million or 4.8% of revenue. The result for this quarter compares to a non-GAAP gross loss of $0.9 million in the prior-year period, with the difference driven primarily by significantly improved product direct margins and lower warranty, retrofit and other indirect costs. GAAP operating expenses were $12.4 million. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation and certain other costs, operating expenses were $10.8 million. This result compares to operating expenses of $10.0 million in the year-ago quarter. GAAP net loss was $11.2 million or $0.09 per share, compared to a loss of $16.9 million or $0.14 per share in the prior quarter and a net loss of $20.5 million or $0.20 per share in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA loss, which excludes approximately $1.1 million, including stock-based compensation expense and other non-cash items, was $10.1 million, compared to losses of $9.7 million in the prior quarter and $11.0 million in the year-ago quarter. OutlookWe expect first quarter 2024 revenue to be down from the fourth quarter and represent the trough in revenue for the year. Beyond the first quarter, we expect to see continued sequential revenue growth for the remainder of the year, with revenue being weighted toward the second half of the year. We expect to approximate breakeven on an Adjusted EBITDA basis in the third quarter and be profitable in the fourth quarter. 4Q'23 4Q'23 1Q'24 (in millions)Guidance Actual GuidanceRevenue$18.0 – $28.0 $23.2 $10.0 – $15.0Non-GAAP Gross Profit$(1.3) – $2.0 $1.1 $(3.8) – $(1.8)Non-GAAP Gross Margin(7%) – 7% 4.8% (38%) – (12%)Non-GAAP operating expenses$10 – $11 $10.8 $8.0 – $8.9Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA$(13.0) – $(2.5) $(10.1) $(12.6) – $(9.8) Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference CallFTC Solar’s senior management will host a conference call for members of the investment community at 5:00 p.m. E.T. today, during which the company will discuss its fourth quarter results, its outlook and other business items.

The term ‘backlog’ or ‘contracted and awarded’ refers to the combination of our executed contracts and awarded orders, which are orders that have been documented and signed through a contract, where we are in the process of documenting a contract but for which a contract has not yet been signed, or that have been awarded in writing or verbally with a mutual understanding that the order will be contracted in the future. In the case of certain projects, including those that are scheduled for delivery on later dates, we have not locked in binding pricing with customers, and we instead use estimated average selling price to calculate the revenue included in our contracted and awarded orders for such projects. Actual revenue for these projects could differ once contracts with binding pricing are executed, and there is also a risk that a contract may never be executed for an awarded but uncontracted project, or that a contract may be executed for an awarded but uncontracted project at a date that is later than anticipated, or that a contract once executed may be subsequently amended, supplemented, rescinded, cancelled or breached, including in a manner that impacts the timing and amounts of payments due thereunder, thus reducing anticipated revenues. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K, for more information on our contracted and awarded orders, including risk factors.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss plus (i) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (ii) interest expense, net (iii) depreciation expense, (iv) amortization of intangibles, (v) stock-based compensation, and (vi) non-routine legal fees, severance and certain other costs (credits). We also deduct the contingent gains from the disposal of our investment in an unconsolidated subsidiary from net loss in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted Net Loss as net loss plus (i) amortization of debt issue costs and intangibles, (ii) stock-based compensation, (iii) non-routine legal fees, severance and certain other costs (credits), and (iv) the income tax expense (benefit) of those adjustments, if any. We also deduct the contingent gains from the disposal of our investment in an unconsolidated subsidiary from net loss in arriving at Adjusted Net Loss. Adjusted EPS is defined as Adjusted Net Loss on a per share basis using our weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Non-GAAP gross profit (loss), Non-GAAP operating expense, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EPS are intended as supplemental measures of performance that are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We present these non-GAAP measures, many of which are commonly used by investors and analysts, because we believe they assist those investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on an ongoing basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. In addition, we use Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EPS to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies. Non-GAAP gross profit (loss), Non-GAAP operating expense, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and you should not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. These Non-GAAP financial measures, when presented, are reconciled to the most closely applicable GAAP measure as disclosed below.

Textron Aviation Special Missions Cessna Grand Caravans to be Acquired to Aid in Horn of Africa Security,2024-03-13T15:00:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,Textron Aviation secures a contract with the U.S. Army to deliver two Cessna Grand Caravan EX aircraft to the Djiboutian Air Force. The contract is part of a $100 million IDIQ agreement for Textron Aviation aircraft over five years.,"Textron Aviation Special Missions Cessna Grand Caravans to be Acquired to Aid in Horn of Africa Security Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Textron Aviation secures a contract with the U.S. Army to deliver two Cessna Grand Caravan EX aircraft to the Djiboutian Air Force. The contract is part of a $100 million IDIQ agreement for Textron Aviation aircraft over five years. Positive None. Negative None. Defense Industry Analyst The recent contract awarded to Textron Aviation by the U.S. Army Contracting Command for the delivery of two Cessna Grand Caravan EX aircraft to the Djiboutian Air Force signifies a strategic expansion of Textron's footprint in the military sector. The significance of this contract lies in its contribution to the company's revenue stream and the strengthening of its position as a key supplier of military aircraft, particularly in the light attack and reconnaissance segment.The indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract model is particularly beneficial for Textron as it provides a more stable and predictable revenue forecast. With the potential of reaching up to $100 million over five years, this contract could represent a substantial portion of Textron's defense-related sales. It's crucial to note that such contracts often come with additional support and maintenance agreements, which can lead to further long-term revenue.The geopolitical importance of Djibouti, located in the Horn of Africa and its proximity to conflict-prone areas, necessitates a robust defense capability. This deal not only supports U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives but also suggests confidence in Textron's Cessna Grand Caravan EX for special missions. From an investor's perspective, this deal could be seen as a positive indicator of Textron's market competitiveness and its ability to secure recurring government contracts. Market Research Analyst Textron Aviation's announcement of the delivery order for two Cessna Grand Caravan EX aircraft tailored for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions reflects a growing trend in the defense sector towards versatile, cost-effective solutions. The increasing demand for Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) aircraft, which are non-developmental items (NDI) readily available for purchase, highlights a shift in military procurement preferences.Market trends suggest that there is a burgeoning market for ISR-equipped aircraft, driven by the need for enhanced border security and military intelligence capabilities. The Cessna Grand Caravan EX's adaptability to special missions underscores the aircraft's appeal to both military and civilian operators. The ability of companies like Textron to quickly modify and deliver such aircraft is a competitive advantage that aligns with the current fast-paced procurement environment.For stakeholders, the contract's implications extend beyond immediate financial gains. It may also influence Textron's stock market performance, as defense contracts tend to provide a buffer against market volatility. Additionally, successful delivery and operation of these aircraft can lead to repeat orders and bolster Textron's reputation as a reliable government contractor, potentially impacting future stock valuations positively. Financial Analyst The announcement of Textron Aviation's contract with the U.S. Army Contracting Command represents a noteworthy development for Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) shareholders. The financial implications of this contract are multifaceted. Initially, the contract for two Cessna Grand Caravan EX aircraft may not appear to be a significant financial event when compared to Textron's overall revenue. However, the long-term potential of the IDIQ contract, which could amount to $100 million over five years, provides a more substantial outlook.Investors should consider the incremental nature of such contracts. While the initial order might have a marginal impact on the company's financials, the cumulative effect of subsequent orders can lead to significant revenue growth. Furthermore, the emphasis on ISR capabilities indicates a strategic investment in high-demand defense technologies, which could enhance Textron's profit margins due to the specialized nature of these products.The contract also serves as a barometer for Textron's future performance in the defense sector. A successful execution of this contract could lead to further orders under the IDIQ agreement and cement Textron's role as a preferred supplier for the U.S. government and allied forces. This could have positive implications for the company's stock, as consistent government contracts are typically viewed favorably by the market. 03/13/2024 - 11:00 AM WICHITA, Kan.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Textron Aviation today announced the award of a contract by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL, for two Cessna Grand Caravan EX turboprop aircraft.

(""Samsonite"" or ""the Company"", together with its consolidated subsidiaries, ""the Group""; SEHK stock code: 1910), a leader in the global lifestyle bag industry and the world's best-known and largest travel luggage company, today published its final results for the year ended December 31, 2023. In this press release, certain financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023, are compared to both the year ended December 31, 2022, and the year ended December 31, 2019. Comparisons to the year ended December 31, 2019, are provided because it is the most recent comparable year during which the Company's results were not affected by COVID-19. OverviewCommenting on the results, Mr. Kyle Gendreau, Chief Executive Officer, said, ""2023 marked another impressive year for Samsonite. We achieved outstanding results, and we are well positioned to continue to outpace the market backed by our portfolio of leading brands, unrivalled global sourcing and distribution infrastructure, and ability to invest in product innovation and marketing. Supported by strategic investments in marketing, we successfully capitalized on the continued recovery and growth in leisure and business travel worldwide, particularly in Asia, to deliver strong year-on-year net sales gains across all regions and core brands, with significant improvements in profitability."" ""During 2023 the Group registered strong double-digit net sales growth year-on-year, while its gross profit margin and Adjusted EBITDA margin3 both reached record highs, reflecting our efficient cost structure and the increased net sales contribution from our higher-margin Asia region and Tumi brand. As a result, our Adjusted EBITDA6 increased by 50.2% on net sales that grew by 30.4%1, 2 in 2023 compared to 2022, a notable achievement that underscores Samsonite's fundamentally transformed profitability. With strong profits and prudent cash management, we generated strong Free Cash Flow4 in 2023, part of which we used to further reduce our debt. We ended the year with a net leverage ratio5 of 1.53x, the lowest level since our acquisition of Tumi in 2016, as well as substantial liquidity of US$1.6 billion7. Considering our strong performance and financial position, the Board decided to resume annual cash distributions in 2024, recommending a cash distribution of US$150.0 million to the Company's shareholders. This represents an increase of US$25.0 million, or 20.0%, compared to the cash distribution of US$125.0 million paid in 2019."" ""We intensified our efforts to embed sustainability into the business in 2023. Among other accomplishments, we increased the share of Samsonite's net sales that came from products made at least in part from recycled materials to approximately 34%, up from about 23% in 2022. We also achieved 100% renewable electricity usage in all our own operations, two years earlier than our 2025 target date. We will continue to advance Samsonite's ""Our Responsible Journey"" sustainability initiatives, leveraging our scale to lead the transformation of the luggage industry to become more sustainable."" Mr. Gendreau continued, ""Looking to 2024, global travel and tourism growth is expected to remain healthy. Asia is expected to continue to see robust travel growth in 2024, as outbound travel from China continues to improve. In markets that reopened earlier, including North America and Europe, travel is expected to see steady growth closer to historical trends, with relatively stronger prospects in Europe from the ongoing return of Chinese travelers."" ""We will continue to invest in our core brands in 2024, focusing on product innovation, sustainability initiatives and further enhancements to our global retail store network, all supported by increased investment in marketing. We are targeting 2024 marketing spend of approximately 7.0% of net sales, and we are confident that, with the amazing new products and exciting advertising campaigns planned for 2024, the Group will continue to deliver robust net sales growth, with strength in the higher-margin Asia region and Tumi brand."" Mr. Gendreau concluded, ""We will continue to be vigilant in limiting promotional discounts to sustain our improved gross profit margin. We will also maintain discipline in managing expenses, especially our fixed SG&A expenses, to drive operating leverage and deliver sustained bottom-line growth. At the same time, we will maintain focus on cash management to sustain strong Free Cash Flow4 generation, further enhancing Samsonite's flexibility in capital allocation to continue to deleverage our balance sheet, invest in organic growth, and return cash to our shareholders.""

The net sales increase during the fourth quarter of 2023 was driven primarily by Asia where the Group registered net sales growth of 40.6%1 year-on-year. During the fourth quarter of 2023, net sales in the direct-to-consumer (""DTC"") channel in North America increased by 7.7%1 year-on-year driven by the Tumi and Samsonite brands. This was offset by wholesale channel net sales decreasing by 8.0%1 year-on-year during the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily due to a shift in timing of shipments to certain wholesale customers following strong year-on-year wholesale net sales growth during the first nine months of 2023. Overall, net sales in North America for the fourth quarter of 2023 were flat1 year-on-year. Net sales in Europe and Latin America for the fourth quarter of 2023 increased by 5.8%1 and 32.9%1 year-on-year, respectively. The Samsonite, Tumi and American Tourister brands recorded year-on-year net sales growth of 14.6%1, 18.7%1 and 14.6%1 for the fourth quarter of 2023, respectively. The Group's gross profit margin expanded to 59.9% in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 340 basis points year-on-year, driven mainly by year-on-year gross profit margin improvements in all regions and Asia, the region with the highest gross profit margin, increasing its share of net sales, as well as overall lower promotional discounts. The Group increased its investment in marketing as planned, with marketing expenses rising to 7.2% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to 6.5% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2022. The team remained disciplined in managing fixed selling, general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses, enabling Samsonite to achieve a 27.0% increase in Adjusted EBITDA6 to US$181.0 million and a 170-basis point expansion in Adjusted EBITDA margin3 to 19.1% for the fourth quarter of 2023, year-on-year. The Group recorded an income tax expense of US$52.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to an income tax benefit of US$25.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to year-on-year changes in unrecognized deferred tax assets. As a result, the Group's profit attributable to the equity holders decreased by US$49.1 million year-on-year to US$149.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023. The Group's Adjusted Net Income10 decreased by US$52.0 million year-on-year to US$95.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023. Compared to the corresponding period in 2019, Samsonite's net sales for the fourth quarter of 2023 increased by 15.1%1, 2, 12; gross profit margin increased by 580 basis points; Adjusted EBITDA6 and Adjusted EBITDA margin3 increased by 25.0% and 400 basis points, respectively; and Adjusted Net Income10 increased by 68.4%; despite marketing spend as a percentage of net sales rising by 290 basis points. This remarkable improvement from 2019 highlights the Group's strong operating leverage and fundamentally enhanced margin profile as net sales continued to grow.

Gross profit margin increased by 350 basis points to 59.3% for 2023 from 55.8% for 2022.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Group's net sales rose by US$802.8 million year-on-year to US$3,682.4 million, but fixed SG&A expenses only increased by US$140.7 million to US$836.0 million due to the Group's disciplined expense management.

Year Ended December 31, 2023, vs. Year Ended December 31, 2019Comparing the year ended December 31, 2023, against year ended December 31, 2019, Samsonite's gross profit margin increased by 390 basis points from 55.4% to 59.3%, marketing expenses as a percentage of sales increased by 140 basis points from 5.2% to 6.6%, and fixed SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased by 460 basis points from 27.3% to 22.7%, resulting in the Group's Adjusted EBITDA margin3 increasing by 580 basis points from 13.5% to 19.3%. In US dollar terms, the Group's Adjusted EBITDA6 for the year ended December 31, 2023, increased by US$217.1 million to US$709.3 million from the US$492.2 million recorded in 2019, despite reported net sales only rising by US$43.6 million in 2023 compared to 2019. Adjusted Net Income10 was US$176.5 million higher than the US$215.9 million in 2019. This remarkable improvement from 2019 highlights the Group's strong operating leverage and fundamentally enhanced margin profile. Working CapitalThe Group continued to optimize its working capital, particularly inventories, to support net sales growth. At US$695.9 million as of December 31, 2023, inventories were US$44.5 million lower than the US$740.4 million as of June 30, 2023, and just US$8.2 million higher than the US$687.6 million at the end of 2022, as the Group gradually reduced inventories with continued strong net sales and tapering product purchases during the second half of 2023, while maintaining a healthy level of inventories to meet ongoing growth in demand. Trade and other receivables increased by US$28.7 million to US$319.6 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to US$290.9 million at the end of 2022. Meanwhile, accounts payable decreased by US$82.9 million to US$500.4 million as of December 31, 2023, from US$583.3 million at the end of 2022. As a result, net working capital was US$515.1 million as of December 31, 2023, an increase of US$119.8 million from US$395.3 million as of December 31, 2022. However, with the Group's strong net sales performance, net working capital efficiency21 was a healthy 14.0% as of December 31, 2023, and the Group will continue to prudently manage its working capital in 2024. Total Capital ExpendituresAs the business recovers, the Group is prudently increasing its spending on total capital expenditures towards retail expansion in key markets and refreshing its retail store fleet after a few years of tight control. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Group selectively opened 96 new retail stores, particularly in Asia. In comparison, the Group opened 50 new retail stores in 2022. As a result, the Group's total capital expenditures were US$110.1 million22 during the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of US$47.3 million compared to US$62.8 million22 in 2022. The Group intends to continue to spend on total capital expenditures to upgrade and expand its retail store fleet, as well as to invest in core strategic functions to support continued sales growth. Balance Sheet and Free Cash FlowThe Group continued to focus on cash management and debt reduction. With strong profits and prudent cash management, Samsonite generated strong Free Cash Flow4 of US$284.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to US$83.5 million in 2022, an increase of US$201.0 million, or 240.6%. The Group utilized part of its Free Cash Flow4 to further deleverage its balance sheet, repaying US$125.9 million of outstanding borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2023, consisting of US$100.0 million in voluntary payments and US$25.9 million in required quarterly amortization payments. As a result, the Group had net debt of US$1,107.4 million 23 as of December 31, 2023, compared to US$1,383.7 million23 at the end of 2022. The reduction in net debt, together with the strong growth in Adjusted EBITDA6, enabled the Group to significantly lower its net leverage ratio5 to 1.53x as of December 31, 2023, a meaningful improvement compared to 2.85x at the end of 2022, and the lowest level since the acquisition of Tumi in 2016. The Group had total liquidity of US$1,562.0 million7 as of December 31, 2023, compared to US$1,481.3 million7 at the end of 2022. 2023 Final Results – Briefing for Analysts and Investors: Date: Thursday, March 14, 2024 Time: 09:00 Hong Kong Venue: Nathan Room, Lower Lobby, Conrad Hong Kong, Pacific Place, 88 Queensway, Admiralty, Hong Kong Webcast Link: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/552xejae About SamsoniteWith a heritage dating back to 1910, Samsonite International S.A.

As such, when comparing the Group's net sales for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, with its net sales for the three months and years ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2019, net sales of the Group's former Russian operations in the respective quarters/years under comparison are excluded. 3 Adjusted EBITDA margin, a non-IFRS measure, is calculated by dividing adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of intangible assets (""Adjusted EBITDA"") by net sales. 4 Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash generated from (used in) operating activities less (i) purchases of property, plant and equipment and software (""total capital expenditures"") and (ii) principal payments on lease liabilities (each as set forth on the consolidated statements of cash flows). 5 The total net leverage ratio is calculated by dividing total consolidated net debt minus the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash by the consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the trailing four fiscal quarters on a pro forma basis as defined in the credit agreement. 6 Adjusted EBITDA, a non-IFRS measure, eliminates the effect of a number of costs, charges and credits and certain other non-cash charges. The Group believes these measures provide additional information that is useful in gaining a more complete understanding of its operational performance and of the underlying trends of its business. 7 Total liquidity is calculated as the sum of cash and cash equivalents per the consolidated statements of financial position plus available capacity under the Group's revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2023, the Group had total liquidity of US$1,562.0 million, comprising cash and cash equivalents of US$716.6 million and US$845.4 million available to be borrowed on the Group's revolving credit facility.

Results for the year ended December 31, 2022, included total restructuring charges of US$1.3 million and total non-cash impairment reversals of US$72.2 million. 9 Operating profit and profit attributable to the equity holders, both excluding total non-cash impairment reversals and restructuring reversals (charges), are non-IFRS measures and, as calculated herein, may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies and should not be considered comparable to operating profit and profit attributable to the equity holders in the Group's consolidated statements of income. 10 Adjusted Net Income, a non-IFRS measure, eliminates the effect of a number of costs, charges and credits and certain other non-cash charges, along with their respective tax effects, that impact the Group's reported profit attributable to the equity holders, which the Group believes helps to give securities analysts, investors and other interested parties a more complete understanding of the Group's underlying financial performance. 11 Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share, both non-IFRS measures, are calculated by dividing Adjusted Net Income by the weighted average number of shares used in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations, respectively. 12 On July 30, 2021, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company sold Speculative Product Design, LLC (""Speck""), including the Speck brand. As such, when comparing the Group's net sales for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, with its net sales for the three months and year ended December 31, 2019, net sales by Speck in 2019 are excluded. 13 The geographic location of the Group's net sales generally reflects the country/territory from which its products were sold and does not necessarily indicate the country/territory in which its end customers were actually located. 14 When excluding the Group's net sales in Russia, net sales in Europe increased by US$110.9 million, or 16.7% (+16.8% constant currency), for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the previous year. 15 When excluding the Group's net sales in Russia, consolidated net sales increased by US$812.5 million, or 28.3% (+30.4% constant currency), for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the previous year. 16 Net sales reported for Hong Kong include net sales made in the domestic Hong Kong market, in Macau, and to distributors in certain other Asian markets. 17 Net sales reported for the United Kingdom include net sales made in Ireland. 18 Other includes certain other non-core brands owned by the Group, such as Gregory, High Sierra, Kamiliant, ebags, Xtrem, Lipault, Hartmann, Saxoline and Secret. 19 The non-travel product category includes business, casual, accessories and other products. 20 ""Other"" primarily consists of licensing revenue. 21 Net working capital efficiency is calculated as net working capital (the sum of inventories and trade and other receivables, minus accounts payable) divided by annualized net sales. 22 For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Group spent US$99.3 million for the purchase of property, plant and equipment and US$10.8 million for software purchases. In comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Group spent US$51.6 million for the purchase of property, plant and equipment and US$11.2 million for software purchases. 23 As of December 31, 2023, the Group had US$716.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and outstanding financial debt of US$1,824.0 million (excluding deferred financing costs of US$17.0 million), resulting in a net debt position of US$1,107.4 million. In comparison, as of December 31, 2022, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of US$635.9 million and outstanding financial debt of US$2,019.6 million (excluding deferred financing costs of US$7.8 million), resulting in a net debt position of US$1,383.7 million. Non-IFRS MeasuresThe Company has presented certain non-IFRS measures in this press release because each of these measures provides additional information that management believes is useful for securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to gain a more complete understanding of the Group's operational performance and of the trends impacting its business. These non-IFRS measures, as calculated herein, may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies, and should not be considered comparable to IFRS measures. Refer to the relevant announcement/report published by the Company for the corresponding period for reconciliations of the Group's non-IFRS Accounting Standards financial information.

Sinclair and APTS Announce Free Virtual Channel Hosting for Public Television Stations Not Yet Transmitting in ATSC 3.0,2024-03-13T15:00:00.000Z,Low,Very Positive,"Sinclair Broadcast Group partners with America’s Public Television Stations to offer free carriage of virtual channels on NEXTGEN Broadcasting Service, enhancing video quality for viewers with HDR technology.","Sinclair and APTS Announce Free Virtual Channel Hosting for Public Television Stations Not Yet Transmitting in ATSC 3.0 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Sinclair Broadcast Group partners with America’s Public Television Stations to offer free carriage of virtual channels on NEXTGEN Broadcasting Service, enhancing video quality for viewers with HDR technology. Positive None. Negative None. Broadcast Technology Expert The announcement by Sinclair Broadcast Group to provide carriage of virtual channels for public television stations in NEXTGEN TV markets is a significant development in the broadcast industry. The adoption of ATSC 3.0, also known as NEXTGEN Broadcast Service, represents a major leap in television technology, offering enhanced features such as high dynamic range (HDR) and interactive content. By hosting these virtual channels at no cost, Sinclair is removing a financial barrier for public television stations, potentially accelerating the adoption of ATSC 3.0.From a technical standpoint, this collaboration could lead to increased viewer engagement due to the improved picture quality and interactive services. Moreover, the ability to access channels seamlessly over the Internet bridges traditional broadcast with modern streaming habits. This hybrid model may prove to be a strategic move as broadcasters seek to retain viewership in an increasingly fragmented media landscape. Media Industry Analyst Strategically, Sinclair's initiative to support public television stations may enhance its competitive position in the broadcasting sector. By facilitating the transition to NEXTGEN TV, Sinclair is likely to gain goodwill among public broadcasters and viewers alike, which can translate into stronger industry partnerships and potentially increased viewership. Furthermore, the initiative may set a precedent for other private broadcasters to support public television, leading to a more collaborative industry environment.In terms of market impact, this move could signal Sinclair's commitment to innovation and leadership in broadcasting technology, which might be reflected in investor confidence. As more markets embrace ATSC 3.0, Sinclair could benefit from first-mover advantages, such as establishing standards for broadcasting and advertising models that leverage the new technology's capabilities. Financial Analyst For investors, the implications of Sinclair's announcement are twofold. Firstly, the investment in NEXTGEN TV infrastructure suggests a long-term strategic vision that could lead to new revenue streams, such as targeted advertising and interactive content services. Secondly, the cost implications of providing free carriage to public television stations must be considered. While this may initially impact Sinclair's financials, the potential market expansion and viewer base growth could offset these costs in the long run.It is essential to monitor how this technology adoption impacts Sinclair's operating expenses and whether the increased market presence translates to tangible financial gains. Investors should also consider the potential for regulatory changes as broadcasting technology evolves, which could affect Sinclair's business model and the broader industry. 03/13/2024 - 11:00 AM Primes the Pump for NEXTGEN Broadcasting HUNT VALLEY, Md. & ARLINGTON, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Sinclair Broadcast Group, LLC, a subsidiary of Sinclair, Inc.

The public television stations will also have the option to pass through programming in high dynamic range (HDR), significantly enhancing the video quality to the viewers.

Expedia Group Welcomes New Partners to its Global Travel Ecosystem,2024-03-13T14:55:00.000Z,Low,Very Positive,Expedia Group announces new partnerships to enhance personalized travel experiences and expand global reach through innovative technology and supply solutions.,"Expedia Group Welcomes New Partners to its Global Travel Ecosystem Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Expedia Group announces new partnerships to enhance personalized travel experiences and expand global reach through innovative technology and supply solutions. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The announcement by Expedia Group regarding the expansion of strategic partnerships and the utilization of its technology solutions like Rapid API and White Label Template represents a significant move in the travel and tourism industry. These partnerships indicate a strategic push to capture increased market share in a post-pandemic landscape where travel demand is surging. The integration of these technologies allows for a more seamless and personalized customer experience, potentially increasing customer loyalty and repeat business.Expedia's collaborations with airlines such as Alaska Airlines and United Airlines to create integrated travel platforms could lead to an increase in bookings through the convenience of one-stop shopping for consumers. This integration could also drive ancillary revenue for the airlines through the sale of additional travel services. Furthermore, the partnerships with tourism boards and the emphasis on sustainable tourism and cultural experiences align with the growing consumer trend towards responsible and enriching travel.From a stock market perspective, these developments could be seen as positive indicators for Expedia's future revenue growth and market position. The expansion of its technological capabilities and global partnerships could attract more investors, potentially leading to an uptick in stock prices if the market perceives these moves as likely to drive long-term growth and profitability. Financial Analyst Expedia Group's announcement reflects an aggressive investment in technology and partnerships to drive growth. The use of Expedia's Rapid API by various international partners, including Ikyu in Japan and Top Town Travel in China, allows these companies to offer a wider range of lodging options and could lead to an increase in transaction volumes on Expedia's platform.Furthermore, the focus on loyalty programs, such as the integration with Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan and United Airlines MileagePlus, is a strategic move to lock in customer bases and encourage repeat usage. This could lead to higher customer lifetime values and increased revenue per user. The financial implications for Expedia may include improved margins due to the scalability of their technology solutions and the potential for increased commission income from partner sales.Investors should monitor the effectiveness of these partnerships in driving additional traffic and bookings, as well as the operational costs associated with expanding and maintaining these technological solutions. The balance between growth-driven expenditures and the resulting revenue will be pivotal in assessing Expedia's financial health and its impact on the stock market. Sustainability Expert Expedia's partnership with regional tourism boards in Australia to promote sustainable tourism is particularly noteworthy. As global awareness of environmental issues grows, travel companies are increasingly expected to demonstrate a commitment to sustainability. By enhancing travelers' experiences while simultaneously improving sustainable tourism practices, Expedia could strengthen its brand reputation and appeal to a demographic of environmentally conscious consumers.This approach could also mitigate potential regulatory risks associated with environmental impact, as governments worldwide are starting to impose stricter regulations on the tourism industry. By proactively addressing sustainability, Expedia may gain a competitive advantage and attract investors who are increasingly looking to support companies with strong environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices.However, the long-term success of these initiatives will depend on their tangible impact on local ecosystems and communities. Stakeholders will be interested in the measurable outcomes of these partnerships, such as reductions in carbon footprint, conservation efforts and benefits to local economies. An authentic and effective sustainability strategy could lead to increased customer loyalty and potentially justify premium pricing for responsible travel options. 03/13/2024 - 10:55 AM Responding to growing travel demand, Expedia Group unveils today new partnerships fuelling further personalized travel experiences, with supply and tech. SEATTLE, March 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Expedia Group continues to power travel for everyone, everywhere by broadening its global reach through a series of new and expanded partnerships underpinned by one of the world's best in travel technology and supply.

The study aims to evaluate safety, tolerability, tumor response, and dosing for patients with skin cancers. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The expansion of clinical trial sites for Phio Pharmaceuticals' Phase 1b study of PH-762 is a significant development in the field of immuno-oncology. PH-762 is an innovative INTASYL compound that targets PD-1, a crucial checkpoint inhibitor that, when silenced, can enhance the ability of T cells to combat tumor cells. This mechanism is particularly relevant for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma, which are the focus of this trial.From a clinical perspective, the inclusion of multiple reputable institutions in the study ensures a diverse patient population, which is critical for assessing the safety and efficacy of PH-762 across different demographics. The neoadjuvant setting of the trial is also noteworthy, as treatments given prior to the main treatment can shrink tumors and may improve surgical outcomes. The outcomes of this study have the potential to shape future therapeutic strategies and contribute to personalized medicine in oncology. Medical Research Analyst As a Medical Research Analyst, it's important to emphasize the strategic importance of broadening the geographic reach of a clinical trial. By engaging additional sites, Phio Pharmaceuticals is likely to accelerate patient enrollment and enhance the statistical power of the study. This is crucial for a Phase 1b trial, which aims to determine the optimal dose for further research.Moreover, the study's design to evaluate tumor response and safety profiles will provide valuable data for subsequent phases of clinical development. The ability to silence PD-1 intratumorally could represent a significant advancement over existing systemic therapies, potentially reducing side effects and improving patient outcomes. Investors and stakeholders will be closely monitoring the results for indications of PH-762's efficacy and tolerability, which could have a profound impact on the company's valuation and future prospects. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, advancements in gene silencing technologies like INTASYL™ have the potential to disrupt the oncology treatment landscape. The successful development and eventual approval of PH-762 could position Phio Pharmaceuticals as a key player in a market that is increasingly focused on precision medicine and targeted therapies. As the trial progresses, positive data could attract partnership opportunities and increase investor confidence.However, it is essential to consider the competitive environment. The immuno-oncology space is crowded, with many companies vying for a share of the market. The success of PH-762 will depend not only on its clinical efficacy but also on its ability to differentiate itself from other therapies. Analysts will need to monitor the evolving landscape and consider how emerging data from PH-762's trials stack up against alternative treatments in terms of efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness. 03/13/2024 - 02:00 PM --Four sites across the U.S. are now engaged in the Phase1b studyMARLBOROUGH, Mass., March 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Phio Pharmaceuticals Corp.

The report highlights the challenges and opportunities in the global energy landscape, emphasizing the importance of energy security, climate policies, and investments in renewable energy sources.","Exploring the Multidimensional Energy Transition: S&P Global Unveils its Latest Look Forward Journal Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary S&P Global published the sixth edition of its Look Forward research series, focusing on the multidimensional energy transition. The report highlights the challenges and opportunities in the global energy landscape, emphasizing the importance of energy security, climate policies, and investments in renewable energy sources. Positive The report emphasizes the need for energy security to ensure a steady and scalable energy transition. Climate policies and investments in developed countries alone are insufficient to address global climate change issues, requiring engagement with developing economies. The electrification of the world's vehicle fleet is progressing in select markets, while the role of natural gas in decarbonization is highlighted as crucial. The report calls for a significant increase in renewable energy capacity globally to meet climate goals, and highlights the importance of AI in managing the complexity of renewable energy integration. Negative None. Energy Market Analyst An integral aspect of the energy sector's future is the alignment of energy security with the progression of the energy transition. The report's emphasis on the necessity of a secure energy supply as a foundational element for a steady transition underlines the sector's vulnerability to geopolitical and market risks. The observation that current climate policies in the Global North are insufficient to address global climate issues accentuates the need for inclusive strategies engaging the Global South, potentially leading to new market opportunities and investment requirements.Furthermore, the report's projection of a doubling in the annual addition of renewable capacity to meet international pledges suggests a significant scaling up of industry operations. This could imply increased demand for capital, advancements in technology and a surge in employment opportunities within the sector. However, it also presents challenges in terms of supply chain management, resource availability and the need for supportive regulatory frameworks. Technology Innovation Analyst The inclusion of artificial intelligence in the energy transition narrative is particularly noteworthy. AI's role in managing the complexities introduced by a higher share of renewables in the energy mix could be a game-changer. The ability to process vast amounts of data and optimize decision-making can lead to more efficient grid management and integration of intermittent energy sources. This technological integration may also stimulate investment in AI-driven startups and R&D within established energy firms, potentially leading to a wave of innovation in energy sector operations. Environmental Policy Analyst The report's nod to the role of gas as a bridge fuel highlights a pragmatic approach to decarbonization. The immediate deployment of natural gas as a substitute for coal can offer a relatively quick reduction in carbon emissions. However, this strategy must be carefully balanced with long-term goals to avoid locking in fossil fuel dependency. Policymakers will need to consider the implications of such transitional policies on environmental targets and the investment landscape, ensuring that they do not stifle the growth of renewable energy technologies.Additionally, the momentum in vehicle electrification, while concentrated in specific markets, indicates a sectoral shift that could have far-reaching consequences for oil demand, electric grid requirements and the automotive industry. This shift may necessitate new infrastructure investments and could lead to changes in consumer behavior, urban planning and energy consumption patterns. 03/13/2024 - 10:05 AM NEW YORK, March 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- S&P Global (NYSE: SPGI) today published the sixth edition of its Look Forward research series, providing in-depth analysis of the major geopolitical, technological, financial and regulatory drivers that are shaping the direction and pace of the multidimensional energy transition. Developments over the last three years have shaken expectations of a linear global transition as climate goals compete with economic development, energy access, energy security and affordability. This research, titled Look Forward: Multidimensional Transition, explores expectations for a multispeed, multifueled and multi-technology transition – with different road maps and end points for different countries. ""We are at a pivotal moment in the energy transition. Sweeping financial investments have set the stage for a decade of deployment,"" said Saugata Saha, President, S&P Global Commodity Insights. ""Thousands of new projects and new technologies will enter the world's energy ecosystem, from hydrogen to carbon capture and more. In addition, artificial intelligence is transforming capabilities in data processing and decision-making that will impact the energy industry."" Key findings from Look Forward: Multidimensional Transition include: Ensuring energy security is a high priority: events in recent years have demonstrated that the energy transition depends on energy security to proceed at a steady pace and at scale.Climate policies and investments in the Global North alone are not sufficient to solve climate change issues worldwide - effective solutions will need to engage the developing economies of the Global South.Wars, polarization and political divides will challenge governments and the private sector to secure energy supplies while also navigating investments for energy transition.Electrification of the world's vehicle fleet is gaining momentum, yet progress remains concentrated on select markets. Gas in its various forms needs to be part of the environmental policy toolkit - the immediate push of natural gas can help achieve fast decarbonization by accelerating the phaseout of coal with a proven alternative technology.At least 1,000 GW of new renewables capacity are needed globally each year – or more than double today's levels – to meet the COP28 pledge to triple renewables capacity.Energy transition dynamics may incentivize, or even require, companies to test and use AI to manage the increased complexity created by more renewable generation in the energy mix.For more insights from Look Forward: Multidimensional Transition (Volume 6 | March 2024), please visit: https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/featured/special-editorial/look-forward/look-forward-volume-3-2024 This is the sixth volume of the Look Forward research series from the S&P Global Research Council.

U.S. Public Sector Adapts to Change by Modernizing HCM,2024-03-13T14:00:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"The 2023 ISG Provider Lens™ report highlights the accelerated adoption of advanced human capital management (HCM) software platforms by U.S. public sector agencies due to workforce changes, retirements, and new expectations.

Agencies are centralizing HCM to address talent retention, diversity, equity, and inclusion challenges, seeking efficiency and modernization. Positive None. Negative None. Human Resources Technology Expert The integration of advanced human capital management (HCM) platforms within U.S. public sector agencies signifies a pivotal shift in how these entities approach workforce management. The move towards these systems is indicative of a broader trend where organizations, in response to dynamic work environments and evolving employee expectations, are leveraging technology to gain a strategic edge in talent acquisition and retention. Advanced HCM platforms offer a suite of tools that not only streamline HR operations but also provide valuable analytics to inform decision-making processes.From a technological standpoint, the adoption of such platforms can lead to increased efficiency and productivity. The ability to automate routine tasks frees up HR professionals to focus on more strategic initiatives, such as workforce planning and employee development. Moreover, the use of analytics can help identify trends and patterns within the workforce, allowing for more informed decisions regarding talent management and potentially enhancing diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. Public Sector Management Analyst The report's findings on the U.S. public sector's adoption of HCM platforms underscore a critical response to an aging workforce and the subsequent talent shortages. As retirements surge, the need to attract younger, tech-savvy professionals becomes more acute. Public agencies are recognizing the necessity of modernizing their HR systems not only to manage their current workforce more effectively but also to appeal to the next generation of employees who expect digital proficiency in their work environments.Furthermore, the standardization on centralized HCM platforms reflects a strategic move to mitigate risks associated with decentralized and outdated HR systems. By centralizing HR functions, agencies can ensure a more consistent application of policies and procedures across the board, which is crucial for maintaining compliance with new regulations and standards. This transition is a significant undertaking for the public sector, which often operates within tight budgetary constraints and faces scrutiny regarding the allocation of resources. Financial Analyst The financial implications of public sector agencies adopting modern HCM platforms are multifaceted. Initially, there is a significant investment required not only for the software purchase but also for the implementation and ongoing maintenance. Most agencies opt to outsource these services due to a lack of internal resources, which can add to the cost. However, the long-term financial benefits may justify the upfront expenses. Enhanced HR operations can lead to cost savings through improved efficiency, reduced turnover and better management of human resources.Investors and stakeholders in companies that provide these HCM solutions should monitor the adoption rates and satisfaction levels within the public sector, as these could be indicators of future market growth and potential revenue streams. The report suggests a growing market for HCM platforms in the public sector, which could have positive implications for the stock performance of companies in this industry. 03/13/2024 - 10:00 AM Agencies roiled by retirements, talent shortages and new regulations standardize on modern, centralized HCM platforms, ISG Provider Lens™ report says STAMFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- U.S. public sector agencies have accelerated their adoption of advanced human capital management (HCM) software platforms in the face of multiple changes that have impacted the sector in the past few years, according to a new research report published today by Information Services Group (ISG) (Nasdaq: III), a leading global technology research and advisory firm. The 2023 ISG Provider Lens™ HCM Technology Platforms report for the U.S. Public Sector finds that changes in the composition and location of workforces, new employee and constituent expectations and a wave of retirements have forced agencies to modernize human resource management. Two of the steepest challenges today are attracting and retaining talent and promoting diversity, equity and inclusion, but agencies recognize other challenges will emerge. “Public sector organizations are turning to centralized HCM platforms so they can take a more holistic approach to staff management,” said Nathan Frey, partner and lead, ISG Public Sector, in the U.S. “What affects one aspect of human resources can influence others, and they want the agility to address future needs.” State and local governments and educational organizations in the U.S. are seeking improvements in HR operations, management and efficiency, the report says. Their goals span several functional areas, many of which have languished in these organizations due to outdated systems, tools and interfaces. Typically, public agencies begin by buying and implementing a core HCM platform, which may be decades ahead of the systems it replaces but still have limited built-in capabilities, ISG says. Later, the agencies add modules for specific functions. Many projects involve purchasing software and then outsourcing implementation and maintenance, for which most agencies lack the resources. To address challenges around talent, organizations are implementing solutions that automate processes and use analytics to make data-driven decisions about recruitment and retention, the report says. In payroll management, new HCM solutions are automating routine tasks and providing better oversight and regulatory compliance, reducing the risk of costly errors and penalties. “Transparency is critical for taxpayer-funded organizations,” said Jan Erik Aase, partner and global leader, ISG Provider Lens Research. “New HCM platforms provide real-time access to data, which can help agencies increase accountability and public trust.” The report also explores other HCM trends in the U.S. public sector, including the rising importance of remote workforce management and mobile access to HR data for employees and administrators.

The top 20 holdings include well-known companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Visa.

The fund's net assets stood at $354.9 million, with a sector breakdown showing a significant allocation to Information Technology and Health Care. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst An examination of the Liberty All-Star Growth Fund's monthly update reveals a noteworthy increase in NAV from $5.65 to $5.95, paired with a market price rise from $5.23 to $5.41. This indicates a performance uptick for the month, with a 5.31% return on NAV and a 3.44% return on market price. However, the widening of the discount from -7.4% to -9.1% suggests a growing discrepancy between market valuation and the underlying assets, which could potentially signal investor concerns or a market undervaluation of the fund.From a sector allocation perspective, the fund's significant exposure to Information Technology and Health Care sectors, comprising 23.0% and 22.1% of the equity portfolio respectively, aligns with trends in all-cap growth strategies that favor sectors with high growth potential. The addition of new holdings such as CECO Environmental Corp. and Waste Management, Inc. indicates strategic portfolio adjustments, likely aimed at capitalizing on specific industry trends or diversifying risks. Market Research Analyst In the context of the current market environment, the fund's strategy of combining managers with different capitalization focuses could be advantageous. This approach allows for diversification across market segments, potentially reducing volatility and improving risk-adjusted returns. The fund's high percentage invested, 98.7%, suggests an aggressive strategy that seeks to fully capitalize on market opportunities, which could appeal to investors with a higher risk tolerance.The sector breakdown, with a heavy emphasis on Information Technology and Health Care, is indicative of a growth-oriented investment philosophy. These sectors are generally known for their dynamic nature and potential for innovation-driven growth, which is consistent with the fund's all-cap growth style. Investors and analysts alike might scrutinize the fund's performance against broader market indices to gauge its competitive edge in achieving superior growth. Economist The fund's performance should be contextualized within the broader economic landscape. Factors such as interest rate changes, inflationary pressures and economic cycles can significantly impact growth-focused investment strategies. For instance, sectors like Information Technology and Health Care may react differently to macroeconomic shifts, which could affect the fund's performance. The fund's ability to navigate these economic variables while maintaining a growth trajectory is crucial for long-term success.Additionally, the fund's discount widening may reflect broader market sentiment or specific concerns about the fund's asset valuation. It is important to consider that closed-end funds like this one can trade at significant premiums or discounts to NAV, which can be influenced by investor sentiment, distribution rates and fund management performance. 03/13/2024 - 01:06 PM BOSTON, March 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Below is the February 2024 Monthly Update for the Liberty All-Star Growth Fund, Inc.

Performance returns for the Fund are total returns, which includes dividends, and are net of management fees and other Fund expenses. Returns are calculated assuming that a shareholder reinvested all distributions. Past performance cannot predict future investment results. Performance will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data shown. Performance information shown does not reflect the deduction of taxes that shareholders would pay on Fund distributions or the sale of Fund shares.

Sources of distributions to shareholders may include ordinary dividends, long-term capital gains and return of capital. The final determination of the source of all distributions in 2024 for tax reporting purposes will be made after year end. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations.

The development is the result of a multi-year innovation project, including a partnership with Delica Switzerland for proprietary technology. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The unveiling of Keurig Dr Pepper's K-Rounds™ plastic-free pods and the Keurig Alta™ brewer represents a significant strategic move within the home coffee brewing market. This innovation addresses the growing consumer demand for sustainable and convenient coffee solutions. The shift towards eco-friendly products is not just a trend but a long-term market transformation as consumers become more environmentally conscious. The introduction of these products could potentially disrupt the market by setting a new standard for sustainability in single-serve coffee systems.Furthermore, the ability to use the new K-Rounds pods with the Keurig Alta brewer, which also accommodates traditional K-Cup® pods, suggests a keen understanding of market segmentation. This dual compatibility caters to both eco-conscious consumers and those resistant to change, mitigating the risk of alienating existing customers. The differentiation of pod sizes for various beverages and the brewer's automatic code reading for optimal brewing pressure could enhance the user experience and create a competitive edge. Sustainability Expert Keurig Dr Pepper's commitment to sustainability is evident in the development of the K-Rounds™ plastic-free pods. The move away from plastic and aluminum, materials traditionally associated with environmental concerns due to their contribution to waste and recycling challenges, is a significant step towards reducing the company's environmental footprint. The expected compostability of the K-Rounds pods could resonate well with the increasing number of consumers seeking environmentally responsible products, potentially boosting brand loyalty and market share.However, the success of this initiative hinges on the certification process for compostability and the actual performance of the pods in composting environments. The company's collaboration with Delica Switzerland and the acquisition of a perpetual license for their proprietary plant-based coating technology could provide a solid foundation for these sustainability claims, but the long-term impact will depend on consumer acceptance and practical use. Financial Analyst Keurig Dr Pepper's (NASDAQ: KDP) announcement could influence its financial performance and stock market valuation. The development and launch of innovative products like the K-Rounds™ and Keurig Alta™ brewer typically involve substantial R&D expenditures. However, if these products capture a significant share of the eco-conscious consumer segment, they could lead to increased revenue streams and potentially higher profit margins due to the premium nature of sustainable products.Investors should monitor the consumer feedback from the beta testing phases, as it will be critical in determining the potential market acceptance and success of the new system. Additionally, strategic engagement with retailers and coffee brand partners will be crucial for distribution and market penetration. The company's stock could see fluctuations based on the market's reception of these innovations and their perceived impact on KDP's future growth trajectory. 03/13/2024 - 01:00 PM Plastic- and aluminum-free coffee pods and visionary new brewer will lead the future of home coffee brewing BURLINGTON, Mass. and FRISCO, Texas, March 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Keurig Dr Pepper (NASDAQ: KDP) today introduced a multi-year innovation agenda for its Keurig® single serve brewing system, including a completely reimagined coffee system and a portfolio of new products and technologies designed to meet the needs of today's and tomorrow's coffee consumer (see also: ""Introducing the Next Chapter of the Keurig® K-Cup® Pod System Product Portfolio""). Experience the full interactive Multichannel News Release here: https://www.multivu.com/players/English/9255651-keurig-unveils-k-rounds-plastic-and-aluminum-free-coffee-pods/ The foundation of the Company's future vision is K-Rounds™ plastic-free pods, a revolutionary new form of single serve coffee. K-Rounds pods are created from expertly roasted coffee beans that are ground, pressed and wrapped in a proprietary, protective plant-based coating preserving the coffee's flavor and aroma, eliminating the need for plastic or aluminum. K-Rounds plastic-free pods will work in the new Keurig Alta™ brewer as part of a reimagined Keurig system that allows consumers to make a variety of hot and cold barista-style beverages – from a bold espresso with velvety crema, to an aroma-rich cup of hot coffee or a refreshingly chilled cold coffee – without having to master complex brewing techniques. As the Company pursues its vision, consumers will have the opportunity to provide essential feedback in the ongoing development of the Keurig Alta system in various beta testing phases with the first starting as early as fall 2024. Keurig will leverage learnings from these trials, as well as strategic engagement with and insights from its retailer and coffee brand partners, to refine and optimize the system before making it available for broader sale to consumers. Chairman and CEO Bob Gamgort shared, ""Thirty years ago, Keurig changed the way consumers brewed coffee, with the introduction of the K-Cup pod single serve coffee system. Today, we are applying all our expertise to create a revolutionary new system that will redefine how consumers will brew coffee for decades to come. Our ambitious agenda reflects our commitment to providing variety, quality, value, and sustainability to the 45 million North American coffee consumers who currently use Keurig brewers and the millions of potential new households who will discover the benefits of a perfect cup of coffee prepared effortlessly in their home."" The unique plastic- and aluminum- free design of K-Rounds allows for brewing at both high pressure for espresso-based drinks and low pressure for drip coffee, cold or hot, so consumers can enjoy a variety of coffeehouse drinks without coffeehouse prices. K-Rounds plastic-free pods will come in different sizes for specific types of coffee beverages and will be marked with a code that the Keurig Alta brewer automatically reads to determine the pressure and extraction profile needed to get the full flavor, aroma and richness of each coffee variety. After brewing, K-Rounds plastic free pods can be disposed of like coffee grounds and are expected to be certified compostable, as the Company is currently working through the certification process. The new Keurig Alta brewer will also provide the option to brew existing K-Cup® pods so that users can enjoy the 500+ varieties offered through the Keurig family of brands. The development of the Keurig Alta brewer and K-Rounds plastic-free pods is the result of a multi-year innovation project which incorporates significant intellectual property in beverage, pod, appliance and manufacturing design and processes. As part of this intellectual property portfolio, KDP has acquired a perpetual license to know-how and technology invented by Delica Switzerland for their CoffeeB system in Europe, including a proprietary plant-based coating and application processes. KDP's partnership with Delica grants Keurig exclusive rights to use and build upon these technologies for consumers across the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Keurig previewed more background about its reimagined single serve system in a launch video – ""Reimagining Keurig: From the Ground Up.""

The transactions were made on various trading venues at different prices, contributing to the company's ongoing capital management strategy.","Transaction in Own Shares Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Shell plc announces the purchase and cancellation of a significant number of its own shares as part of its existing share buy-back program. The transactions were made on various trading venues at different prices, contributing to the company's ongoing capital management strategy. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The share buyback announcement by Shell plc represents a strategic financial decision, potentially signaling the company's confidence in its intrinsic value and a commitment to enhancing shareholder value. From a financial perspective, the reduction in the number of shares outstanding can lead to an increase in earnings per share (EPS), assuming net income remains constant. This can make the stock more attractive to investors, as it may indicate improved financial ratios and a stronger financial position.However, the cost of the buyback must be considered against other potential uses of capital, such as investment in growth opportunities or debt reduction. The decision to execute a buyback also suggests that the company views its stock as undervalued or that it is seeking to return capital to shareholders in a tax-efficient manner. Investors will be interested in how this buyback aligns with the company's long-term strategy and capital allocation priorities. Market Research Analyst The execution of Shell's share buyback program within the parameters of market regulations, such as EU MAR and UK MAR, indicates compliance with market abuse prevention standards. The involvement of Citigroup Global Markets Limited to independently make trading decisions on behalf of Shell suggests an effort to maintain market integrity and transparency. Market participants will monitor the impact of these buybacks on share liquidity and market volatility.Additionally, the geographical split in the buyback across different trading venues and currencies points to a strategic approach to capital management across Shell's investor base. This also reflects the company's global footprint and the need to balance market activities across different regulatory environments. Legal Expert Shell's adherence to the complex regulatory frameworks governing share buybacks, such as EU MAR, UK MAR and the EU MAR Delegated Regulation, is crucial for legal compliance. The detailed disclosure of the buyback transactions and the involvement of an independent trading entity align with the transparency requirements set forth by these regulations. Legal scrutiny in such cases ensures that the company's actions do not contravene market abuse laws and that shareholders are treated fairly.It is important for investors to understand that such regulatory compliance also serves to protect their interests by mitigating the risk of market manipulation. The legal intricacies of these transactions reflect the company's obligation to operate within a tightly controlled legal framework, which can have significant implications for corporate governance and shareholder rights. 03/13/2024 - 02:02 PM Transaction in Own Shares 13 March, 2024 • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • Shell plc (the ‘Company’) announces that on 13 March 2024 it purchased the following number of Shares for cancellation.

The securitization is collateralized by prime quality solar receivables with balances ranging from $10,000 to $150,000, original terms of 10 to 25 years, and interest rates of 3.99% to 10.99%. KBRA applied various methodologies to analyze the asset-backed securities, EverBright's portfolio pool data, and proposed capital structure under stressed cash flow assumptions. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The preliminary ratings assigned by KBRA to EverBright Solar Trust's asset-backed securitization are indicative of the confidence in the underlying assets, which in this case are residential solar retail installment contracts. The affiliation with NextEra Energy, a well-established energy company, provides a backdrop of stability and industry experience. It's important to note that the solar industry is seen as a growth sector and this securitization allows EverBright to leverage its customer receivables into capital for further expansion.Investors should be aware of the interest rates on these receivables, which range from 3.99% to 10.99%. These rates are competitive within the consumer finance sector and suggest a balanced approach to risk, catering to 'prime quality' customers. The long-term nature of the contracts (10 - 25 years) also suggests a stable cash flow for investors, although this is counterbalanced by the inherent risk of default over such periods.From a financial perspective, the capital raised through this securitization could impact EverBright's and NextEra's ability to invest in new technologies and expand market share in the competitive renewable energy sector, potentially affecting their stock performance positively if managed effectively. However, the complexity of the securitization and the reliance on consumer creditworthiness are factors that require careful scrutiny. Market Research Analyst The residential solar market is growing, driven by consumer interest in renewable energy and supportive government policies. EverBright's securitization of solar receivables is a strategic move to capitalize on this trend. By pooling the receivables and offering them as an investment vehicle, EverBright is not only diversifying its funding sources but also tapping into the appetite for green investments among institutional investors.The involvement of KBRA and the application of its rating methodologies, including an ESG Global Rating Methodology, underscore the increasing importance of environmental, social and governance factors in investment decisions. This could attract a broader range of investors, potentially increasing liquidity and lowering capital costs for EverBright.For stakeholders, the key consideration will be the performance of the solar assets and the creditworthiness of the customers. The prime quality of the customers is reassuring, but the solar industry's sensitivity to policy changes and technological advancements can introduce volatility to the underlying asset performance. Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Analyst The explicit inclusion of an ESG Global Rating Methodology by KBRA in their assessment process for EverBright Solar Trust's securitization reflects a broader shift in the investment community towards sustainable and responsible investments. The focus on residential solar power generation aligns with global efforts to transition to cleaner energy sources, which is a positive sign for investors concerned with long-term sustainability issues.Investors looking at the long-term impact of their portfolios on the environment will view EverBright's initiative as an opportunity to contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions. The securitization's success could set a precedent for similar financial instruments in the renewable energy sector, potentially influencing the flow of capital towards more sustainable projects.However, the ESG impact is not without risks. Regulatory changes, technological disruptions and shifts in consumer behavior towards solar energy adoption are factors that can affect the performance of these securities. The alignment of EverBright's business model with ESG principles will be critical in managing these risks and ensuring long-term value creation for stakeholders. 03/13/2024 - 01:04 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- KBRA assigns preliminary ratings to two classes of notes totaling $288.49 million issued by EverBright Solar Trust 2024-A (“EVBRT 2024-A”), an asset-backed securitization collateralized by a pool of residential solar retail installment contracts originated by EverBright, LLC (""EverBright"" or the ""Company"").

EVBRT 2024-A is collateralized by a pool of solar receivables that are made to mostly prime quality customers to finance residential solar power generation and/or storage systems, including solar panels and any additional products, equipment or services related to installation. Currently, EverBright offers solar receivables with balances of $10,000 - $150,000, original terms of 10 - 25 years and interest rates of 3.99% - 10.99%. KBRA applied its General Global Rating Methodology for Asset-Backed Securities as well as its Consumer Loan ABS Global Rating Methodology, Global Structured Finance Counterparty Methodology and ESG Global Rating Methodology.

Financial Analyst The strategic transition of Cuentas Inc. to a new services platform within its Fintech division, Cuentas Money, signifies a pivotal change aimed at increasing the company's operational agility and feature customization. The introduction of the Cuentas Visa Single Load Prepaid card is a strategic move to capture a larger share of the financial services market within the Hispanic community. This demographic is often underserved by traditional banking institutions and the company's targeted approach could lead to an uptick in customer acquisition, given the minimal barriers to onboarding. Additionally, the financial implications of the upcoming 10K filing are crucial for evaluating the company's fiscal health and operational efficiency. The filing is expected to provide investors with insights into the company's profitability and growth trajectory, which could influence investor sentiment and stock performance. Market Research Analyst The expansion of Cuentas Mobile through robust distribution agreements and the launch of the eSIM offering are indicative of the company's commitment to innovation and market penetration. The eSIM technology is a disruptive force in the telecommunications industry that offers a seamless user experience and compatibility across devices. Cuentas Inc.'s focus on the Hispanic demographic in the United States positions it favorably within a niche market. The company's ability to understand and cater to the specific needs of this group could lead to a competitive advantage, fostering brand loyalty and potentially leading to increased market share. The integration of additional features and benefits to the eSIM service will likely enhance the user experience, potentially driving further adoption. Real Estate Investment Analyst The development in Tampa represents a strategic real estate investment venture for Cuentas Inc. Considering the divestiture of this asset in a fast-growing market could result in a significant return on investment. The real estate market's dynamics, particularly in burgeoning areas like Tampa, are critical in assessing the potential financial gain from such a transaction. The company's refinancing and extension of its line of credit suggest a strengthened financial position, which provides more flexibility in exploring divestiture opportunities. The sale of the property would not only result in a cash infusion but also allow for the reallocation of capital towards marketing and expanding the company's core fintech and mobile offerings, potentially enhancing its overall market presence. 03/13/2024 - 12:37 PM Cuentas, Inc.

The top holdings include Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Alphabet. The fund's performance for the month was 4.03%, with a year-to-date performance of 5.91%. Net assets stood at $1,947.4 million, with a sector breakdown dominated by Information Technology and Financials. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The disclosed monthly performance data for the Liberty All-Star Equity Fund, with a net asset value (NAV) increase and a market price movement, provides a snapshot of the fund's health and trajectory. The fund's performance relative to its NAV is particularly noteworthy, as it indicates the market's valuation of the fund's assets compared to the fund's own accounting. A widening discount could signal investor concerns or a potential buying opportunity if the market underestimates the underlying value.The sector breakdown reveals a strategic allocation with a strong emphasis on Information Technology and Financials, which aligns with broader market trends favoring these sectors. The addition and liquidation of holdings suggest active management in response to market conditions or a reevaluation of company prospects.For stakeholders, the year-to-date performance figures are crucial, as they provide insights into the fund's short-term efficacy in capital growth. However, it's important to consider that past performance is not indicative of future results and the fund's volatility must be acknowledged as an inherent investment risk. Market Research Analyst Understanding the top holdings of the Liberty All-Star Equity Fund is essential for assessing its potential risk and return profile. The concentration of investments in leading technology and healthcare companies, such as Microsoft and UnitedHealth Group, suggests exposure to sectors with high growth potential but also to industry-specific risks. The fund's diversification across various sectors, however, may mitigate systemic risks.The fund's new holdings and liquidated positions indicate a strategic shift that could be based on macroeconomic factors, sector outlooks, or company-specific developments. Investors should monitor these changes as they may impact the fund's future performance.Lastly, the fund's distribution sources, including ordinary dividends and potential return of capital, are a key consideration for investors seeking income, as well as for the tax implications of these distributions. Economist The Liberty All-Star Equity Fund's performance and investment approach can be reflective of broader economic conditions. A strong emphasis on large-cap core equities is a sign of confidence in established companies during uncertain economic times. The fund's active management style, involving both value and growth strategies, aims to capitalize on market inefficiencies and could be particularly effective in periods of economic volatility.Investors should also consider the implications of the fund's sector allocations in the context of economic cycles. For instance, an overweight position in Information Technology and Financials might be advantageous during expansionary phases but could pose greater risks during economic downturns.The fund's discount to NAV is also an important economic indicator, as it may reflect broader market sentiment and investor expectations regarding future economic and market conditions. 03/13/2024 - 01:22 PM BOSTON, March 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Below is the February 2024 Monthly Update for the Liberty All-Star Equity Fund.

However, the Fund also has a market price; the value at which it trades on an exchange. If the market price is above the NAV the Fund is trading at a premium. If the market price is below the NAV the Fund is trading at a discount. Performance returns for the Fund are total returns, which includes dividends, and are net of management fees and other Fund expenses. Returns are calculated assuming that a shareholder reinvested all distributions. Past performance cannot predict future investment results. Performance will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data shown. Performance information shown does not reflect the deduction of taxes that shareholders would pay on Fund distributions or the sale of Fund shares. Shareholders must be willing to tolerate significant fluctuations in the value of their investment. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including loss of principal. Sources of distributions to shareholders may include ordinary dividends, long-term capital gains and return of capital. The final determination of the source of all distributions in 2024 for tax reporting purposes will be made after year end. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Based on current estimates a portion of the distributions consist of a return of capital. These estimates may not match the final tax characterization (for the full year's distributions) contained in shareholder 1099-DIV forms after the end of the year.

(NYSE: GIL) (TSX: GIL) (“Gildan” or the “Company”) and beneficially owns approximately 5.0% of the Company’s outstanding shares, today issued the below statement. “Recent media coverage and an independent research report suggest the Board has presided over an egregious failure of due care and judgement by overlooking Mr. Tyra’s seemingly inappropriate relationship with a subordinate – who is currently an executive at Gildan – during his time as CEO of Broder Bros. We question if the Board uncovered this deeply troubling information during its CEO search process and how the sitting directors got comfortable appointing and retaining a CEO who felt it was acceptable to maintain such a relationship with someone who worked under him. We also question if the Board considered that the historical relationship between these two executives creates undue conflicts and risk for Gildan shareholders and employees. No amount of deflecting and downplaying will allow the Board to succeed in sweeping this inexplicable lapse in diligence and judgement under the rug. To be clear, Browning West had absolutely no role in the independent research report referenced in recent media coverage and will pursue legal action against any parties that claim otherwise. We believe it is important to emphasize this point given that the Board has ramped up its PR machine and is proactively contacting media in an effort to push blame onto Browning West and shareholders, who have every right to be concerned about their investments in Gildan and to scrutinize the selection of a seemingly unfit CEO. We urge Chairman Donald Berg and the Board, as well as Mr. Tyra, to recognize that it is in the best interest of all Gildan stakeholders to commence an orderly resignation process and work with Browning West to reconstitute the majority of the Board. The current directors have clearly failed in their assessment of Mr. Tyra in light of his record of value destruction, lack of critical manufacturing experience, and apparent decision to carry on a relationship with a subordinate while he was CEO of Border Bros. Now is the time for Gildan to agree to appoint all of the highly qualified director candidates proposed by Browning West to the Board, so that this unfortunate chapter in the Company’s history can end. This will allow for Gildan to once again focus on growing and strengthening its business and creating value for all of its shareholders.” Disclaimer for Forward-Looking Information Certain information in this news release may constitute “forward-looking information” within the meaning of applicable securities legislation.
