The Act designates companies that control access to their platforms, such as Google, as a gatekeeper.Rivals ranging from comparison shopping sites to hotels, airlines and restaurants have said the changes made by Google do not comply with the DMA and have urged the European Commission to act. Some rivals have complained that Google's search traffic results are even worse than prior to the changes.Bethell says in the speech that re-wiring the company's search engine has been a balancing act.""We need to balance the new opportunities 6(11) is intended to create with the risk to user privacy and security,"" Bethell will tell a workshop organised by the European Commission to allow rivals and other interested parties to quiz the company. Six/11 refers to a DMA article.""The balance requires complex trade-offs,"" Bethell says in the document. ""There is a question of when do we go too far by giving online search engines sensitive information at a high cost to users.""Bethell said some changes demanded by vertical search engines went beyond the DMA.Story continues""We heard some calls for changes from stakeholders that we think would fundamentally degrade Search for European users and businesses, that are not required by the DMA and that we can't implement,"" he said.""The DMA should not require a degraded search experience on Google for European consumers.""Bethell also took a swipe at other companies designated as gatekeepers under the DMA which have faced criticism over their compliance efforts.""As we comply with the DMA, engage with the Commission, and listen to feedback from third parties, we expect the same from other gatekeepers too,"" he said.DMA breaches can cost companies as much as 10% of their annual global turnover.(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee in Brussels; Editing by Matthew Lewis)"

Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) popped about 1% to close at a record of 39,511. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains, rising more than 1% to close at a record level of 16,369.All three of the major averages rallied from small declines before the Fed decision.Along with its policy announcement, the Fed released updated economic forecasts in its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), including its ""dot plot,"" which maps out policymakers' expectations for where interest rates could be headed in the future.Fed officials see the fed funds rate falling to 4.6% by the end of 2024. That suggests the Fed will cut rates by 0.75% this year. Notably, this falls in line with market pricing from investors entering Wednesday.Bonds were little changed on the news. Yields on the 10-year Treasury (^TNX) were slightly lower at around 4.28% after rising over 20 basis points in the past two weeks.In sum, the market's reaction to the Fed meeting furthered signs of broadening in the market rally, exemplified by the small cap benchmark index (^RUT) rallying 2% and six of the 11 S&P 500 sectors rallying more than 1%.Live14 updatesWed, March 20, 2024 at 1:03 PM PDT Josh SchaferThe big broadening continuesFurther signs of broadening in the stock market rally took hold as investors digested the latest message from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday.The S&P 500 equal weighted index, the Industrials, Materials and Financials all hit record highs on Wednesday.Wed, March 20, 2024 at 12:26 PM PDT Josh SchaferA strong labor market isn't a reason to hold on off rate cuts: PowellThe labor market has continued to surprise to the upside to start 2024.When asked directly about if a strong labor market would prevent the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates, Powell said ""no, not all by itself.""He explained that given the increases in the labor market have come with increases in the labor supply, it equates to a ""bigger economy,"" not one where inflationary pressures are increasing.""You saw last year very strong hiring and inflation coming down quickly,"" Powell said. ""We have a better sense that a big part of that was supply side healing particularly with growth in the labor force. So in it of itself, strong job growth is not a reason for us to be concerned about inflation.""Wed, March 20, 2024 at 11:56 AM PDT Josh SchaferThe overall inflation story hasn't 'really changed,' Powell saysDuring Wednesday's press conference, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell addressed recent inflation readings that came in hotter-than-expected. While he said the central bank is careful about dismissing data they don't like, the January and February inflation readings didn't change the overall story to Powell.""They haven't really changed the overall story which is that of inflation moving down gradually on a sometimes bumpy road toward 2%,"" Powell said. ""I don't think that story has changed.""Wed, March 20, 2024 at 11:19 AM PDT Josh SchaferStocks pop after Fed decision, boosted outlook for growthStocks popped after the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady and projected three interest rate cuts this year, an announcement in line with market expectations.Along with its policy announcement, the Fed released updated economic forecasts in its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). Notably within this forecast, the central bank boosted its outlook for economic growth. The Fed now sees nominal GDP ending 2024 at 2.1%, up from a prior forecast of 1.4%.Subsequently, economic sensitive sectors that typically benefit from a growing economy led the rally with Consumer Discretionary (XLY), Industrials (XLI), and Materials (XLB) all rising about 0.5%.Source: Yahoo FinanceWed, March 20, 2024 at 11:02 AM PDT Josh SchaferFed holds interest rates steady, projects 3 rate cuts this yearThe Federal Reserve held rates steady in a range of 5.25%-5.50% at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. The central bank has maintained this range since July after it hiked rates to their highest level in 22 years.Along with its policy announcement, the Fed released updated economic forecasts in its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), including its ""dot plot,"" which maps out policymakers' expectations for where interest rates could be headed in the future.Fed officials see the fed funds rate falling to 4.6% by the end of 2024.

It's about 75% of sales,” Bellinger told Yahoo Finance Live on Wednesday. “Home Depot's at about 50% and we think that gives Lowe's better leverage to any early turns in existing home sales.”The housing market has mostly been at a standstill as buyers and sellers alike stay on the sidelines amid high mortgage rates. The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates this year, effectively lowering the cost of borrowing.Lowe's comparable sales in the most recent quarter slipped 6.2% amid a pullback in home improvement spending. Mizuho expects comparable sales to turn positive toward the back half of this year.Lowe’s exposure to categories like paint and outdoor seasonal appliances could give “a bit of a leg up,” he said, as homeowners typically spend more during the first few years of owning a home.Meanwhile, the housing stock is aging, with about 50% of homes aged 40 or older, Bellinger noted. This could be a boon for the home improvement industry as a whole.“These homes tend to be leaky buckets. There's always some kind of maintenance activity you have to put in place,” Bellinger said. “We do see a potential for this sort of renovation renaissance or renovation boom coming over the next several decades, and Home Depot and Lowe's, they're positioning their businesses for this.”Wed, March 20, 2024 at 10:18 AM PDT Josh SchaferHere comes the Fed...The Fed's latest decision on interest rates is expected at 2 p.m. ET. Along with that release will be an updated version of the Fed's ""dot plot,"" a chart that maps out policymakers' expectations for where interest rates could be headed in the future.As the chart below from Bespoke Investment Group shows, once these updates are out — and Fed Chair Jerome Powell begins speaking to the press at 2:30 p.m. ET — the stock market action for the day usually takes off.A chart from Bespoke Investment Group shows most of the day's market action during Fed days usually comes after the central bank's policy update.

Shares rose more than 4% in midday trading on the news.Intel (INTC) stock initially popped on news it received funding from the White House as part of the CHIPS Act. The White House said it will provide the company withg $8.5 billion in funding.Wed, March 20, 2024 at 8:45 AM PDT Josh SchaferOne area of the stock market to watch if the Fed projects less rate cuts than expectedUncertainty around interest rates is in focus once again as investors fear the Federal Reserve may signal it expects fewer interest rate cuts than market participants had hoped for.After several hotter-than-expected inflation reports and no signs of an economic slowdown, economists have warned the Fed may project fewer cuts and subsequently cause a spike in Treasury yields.""The potential removal of an expected cut would be taken as hawkish by the market, putting upward pressure on rates and the [US dollar], all else equal,"" Bank of America's rate strategy team wrote in a research note on Wednesday.BlackRock senior investment and portfolio solutions strategist Kristy Akullian told Yahoo Finance Live that some of the stock reaction one would expect from a move in Fed rate cut planning has likely been ""priced in."" But areas outside of large-cap stocks could still feel some pain.""It can matter for the lower-quality parts of the market,"" Akullian said. ""So if we look at small caps and highly levered companies, they've struggled this year and I think they can continue to struggle.""Wed, March 20, 2024 at 8:00 AM PDT Josh SchaferIntel stock rises on White House funding announcementIntel (INTC) stock popped on Wednesday morning after the White House announced it will provide Intel with $8.5 billion in funding through the CHIPS Act.Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports:The infusion of cash, Intel says, will fund sites at locations including the massive complex the company is building in Ohio, plants in Arizona and New Mexico, and its research and development facility in Oregon.The $52.7 billion CHIPS Act aims to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US, reducing the nation's dependence on other countries for the processors that power everything from smartphones and laptops to infrastructure and military equipment.“Today is a defining moment for the US and Intel as we work to power the next great chapter of American semiconductor innovation,” Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said in a statement.“AI is supercharging the digital revolution and everything digital needs semiconductors. CHIPS Act support will help to ensure that Intel and the U.S. stay at the forefront of the AI era as we build a resilient and sustainable semiconductor supply chain to power our nation’s future.”President Biden signed the CHIPS Act into law in August 2022, setting aside $39 billion for manufacturing incentives. But the rollout of the cash has been slow going.Wed, March 20, 2024 at 7:15 AM PDT Josh SchaferWhat to watch in today's Fed press conferenceIt's Fed day.With few expecting the Federal Reserve to move interest rates in its policy announcement on Wednesday, much of the investor focus will be on how many interest rate cuts the Fed will project for 2024.Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger has the preview of today's presser:In focus will be the Fed's latest ""dot plot,"" a chart updated quarterly that shows the prediction of each Fed official about the direction of the federal funds rate.In December, the dot plot revealed a consensus among Fed officials for three cuts for 2024, the first sign that the central bank was prepared to start loosening monetary policy.Now that projection is in question following a string of hotter-than-expected inflation readings and cautious commentary from Fed officials.Fed Chair Jay Powell and his colleagues have been emphasizing for months that they want to be sure inflation is moving ""sustainably"" down to their 2% target before starting cuts.Investors have been adjusting their bets on when those cuts could start. After beginning the year predicting six cuts starting in March, they now expect three starting in June.Even the odds of a June cut have been falling in recent weeks.The Fed last hiked rates in July and has elected to keep interest rates unchanged since then in a range of 5.25%-5.50%, a 23-year high.The Fed will announce its policy decision at 2 p.m. ET, followed by Chair Powell’s press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET.Wed, March 20, 2024 at 6:33 AM PDT Josh SchaferStocks mixed at the openUS stocks were mixed in cautious trading on Wednesday as investors waited to find out whether the Federal Reserve has shifted its view on how many interest rate cuts could come this year.The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was flat at the open on the heels of a fresh all-time closing high for the benchmark. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell 0.2%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 0.2%.Most of the day's heavy trading is expected to come during Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference, which is set to begin at 2:30 p.m. ET.Wed, March 20, 2024 at 5:15 AM PDTBrian SozziWhat Wall Street is now doing on NvidiaSpending extra time on that Nvidia (NVDA) discounted cash flow model.Two days into Nvidia's GTC conference, analysts are starting to come out with their takes on everything being seen and heard. Of course, the Street is staying bullish on Nvidia, with price targets being taken higher. But what I find as interesting is how much profit estimates on Nvidia are beginning to rise — for 2025!No doubt the bar is being lifted much higher once more for Nvidia, to the point where you have to wonder if the stock will get crushed under the weight of expectations (I don't think we are there yet).A good example of this is out today from Citi's Atif Malik. Take note of how much higher he now expects Nvidia's earnings to be next year (emphasis added):""We came away from the first two days of GTC more positive in Nvidia's ability to vertically integrate its computing, networking, and software technologies with notably its new NVLink Switch technology which helps the new Blackwell platform outperform prior H100 30x on inference workloads.""""We revise C24/25 EPS by 7%/21% to reflect better-than-expected Blackwell platform pricing or $30-40K vs our prior $20-$30K assumption and lift target price to $1,030 from $820 on consistent 35x PE.

Bonds also saw small moves, having saddled investors with losses this year as expectations faded that the Fed would ease monetary policy sharply.Investors will be focused on Fed officials’ forecasts for interest rates — the “dot plot” — which will show how much the committee expects to ease in 2024 and 2025. The central bank is also scheduled to hold a discussion on its $7.5 trillion balance sheet, which it’s been shrinking by allowing some securities to mature without replacing them — a process known as quantitative tightening.The S&P 500 hovered near 5,180. Reddit Inc. and its selling shareholders are guiding they could price an initial public offering at the top of its marketed range or above. Hindenburg Research’s bet against Equinix Inc. sent the shares lower, with firm pulling an euro bond offering. Treasury 10-year yields declined two basis points to 4.27%. The dollar was little changed.What Will Powell Say?Win Thin and Elias Haddad at Brown Brothers Harriman:Will he reprise the hawkish tone of his January press conference? Or will he repeat his more dovish testimony before Congress earlier this month? We expect the former, but there are significant risks of the latter.It’s the “dot plot” that will command the most attention — and we see risks of a hawkish shift.Jan Hatzius at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.:We’ve had higher inflation numbers in the past week, so the question is: Has that changed his view? My expectation is ‘no,’ but we’ll find out at 2 p.m.Story continuesIf you look at the drivers of inflation, whether it’s on the goods side or on the rent side or in the labor market, I think the trends there still look encouraging.Ian Lyngen and Vail Hartman at BMO Capital Markets:Investors will be particularly attuned for anything from Powell that indicates he has shifted his read on the trajectory of inflation since his ‘not far’ Congressional testimony.Adding to the wild card nature of this afternoon is any potential balance-sheet discussion or hints on QT.50 bp versus 75 bp of cuts remains the great debate — but keep in mind 2025 and 2026 will be impacted by a minimum of any change made to 2024.An increase in the long-run dot would have a curve-wide bearish impact on the Treasury market.Tiffany Wilding at Pacific Investment Management Co:We believe the Fed will likely modestly revise its 2024 projections for growth, inflation, and employment at this week’s meeting — and it’s a “close call” whether officials’ median projection for the policy rate shifts up as well.Nicholas Colas at DataTrek Research:If the committee does choose to “take back” a rate cut, markets might take that poorly. This decision would mean that the Fed sees inflation as stickier than it thought just three months ago. Investors would reasonably ask “what do they know that they are not sharing?”Tom Essaye at the Sevens Report:If the Fed is hawkish and signals a higher-for-longer policy stance (more so than is already priced in), expect some volatility. A dovish decision projecting confidence in a soft landing could see the 2024 rally extend to new highs.Bond traders are stepping up short bets against Treasuries and buying derivatives to protect against a selloff, positioning for the risk that the Fed will dial back the market’s expectations for rate cuts this year. While the US central bank is all but certain to hold rates steady Wednesday, trading data points to growing concern that its new forecasts will show increased reticence to ease monetary policy.Traders have also been targeting protection against a hawkish shift with options linked to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, which closely tracks the central bank’s policy path. Further out on the curve in Treasury options, there’s also been activity hedging for higher yields.Meantime, US funding markets are offering signs of encouragement to the Fed as it determines exactly how and when to slow the pace at which it drains excess cash from the financial system.Short-term funding markets have been stable, and for now, stress free. That offers considerable flexibility and a positive backdrop as Fed officials meet — and likely discuss the path ahead for QT.There are no companies looking to sell debt in the US high-grade bond market on the Fed decision day, according to an informal survey of debt underwriters.Sales year-to-date reached $501 billion, the fastest pace ever, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News. That’s well ahead of the $342 billion average over the last five years.Meantime, traders on the lookout for the next biggest bet in US stocks two years after the Fed kicked off its most-aggressive tightening campaign in a generation can look to one corner of the market nearing all-time highs for clues: shares of financial companies.While technology stocks in the S&P 500 have been the best performing sector by far since the central bank began raising interest rates in March 2022, their gains have consolidated this year as shares of financial companies have advanced with the rally spreading out to other previously unloved groups.Corporate Highlights:The US will award Intel Corp. $8.5 billion in grants and as much as $11 billion in loans to help fund an expansion of its semiconductor factories, marking the largest award from a program designed to reinvigorate the domestic chip industry.Boeing Co. predicted a massive cash drain for the first quarter as regulatory scrutiny and slower output of its 737 Max jetliner following a January mid-air accident take their toll on its finances.Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc.’s board proposed a 50-to-1 stock split to broaden the burrito chain’s investor base after a 13,000% run-up in the stock since its initial public offering.JPMorgan Chase & Co. unexpectedly lifted its dividend 9.5% in the wake of a record annual profit and as regulators signal they may rethink proposals for tightening capital rules.Apple Inc.

Motley Fool,1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks RTX Stock Is Going to $115. Is It a Buy Around $94?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-wall-street-analyst-thinks-183316292.html,This aerospace and defense stock is read to takeoff according to one analyst.,"Soaring about 14% over the past three months, RTX (NYSE: RTX) stock has outperformed the S&P 500 which has risen about 9% during the same period. And Cai von Rumohr, an analyst at TD Cowen Financial, doesn't think the stock's climb is over. In fact, von Rumohr is optimistic about the stock's potential and recently raised his price target on the aerospace and defense conglomerate from $106 to $115. That implies a 22% upside over the next 12 months or so from its current price.But one analyst's improved outlook doesn't mean the stock is necessarily a buy. Let's take a closer look at what's underpinning von Rumohr's estimate and whether investors should fortify their portfolios with this leading defense stock.Two factors form the basis for the bullish outlook on RTXAccording to Thefly.com, von Rumohr predicates his upwardly revised price target on two things. First, RTX (formerly Raytheon Technologies) will benefit from growth in its commercial aftermarket business. Second, the company will prosper from increased defense spending in 2025 and 2026.RTX already enjoys growth in the aftermarket business. In 2023, RTX achieved a 23% increase in commercial aftermarket sales compared to 2022. On the company's Q4 2023 conference call, moreover, Chris Calio, RTX's Chief Operating Officer, said the ""strong recovery [in air travel] has helped drive significant aftermarket demand for both wide-body and narrow-body aircraft, with growth expected to continue into 2024.""A strong backlog makes Raytheon look like a buyThis defense industry stalwart is worthy of consideration for investors looking for a conservative stock for their portfolio. What makes RTX especially appealing now is the company's strong backlog which stands at $196 billion. While the air travel recovery will surely benefit RTX, it's the robust backlog that more notably suggests that the company is poised for growth.Story continuesVon Rumohr's price target is hopeful even if his timeframe for the price target was vague. RTX is a defense industry powerhouse that's a solid buy for those with long-term investing horizons.Should you invest $1,000 in RTX right now?Before you buy stock in RTX, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and RTX wasn’t one of them.

The firm said the new fund's strategy will combine a long position in the Nasdaq-100 Index with a short position in Nasdaq-100 Index call options. The goal, ProShares said, is to use swap agreements to capture exposure to those options and deliver both total return and high income.Roundhill Investments also has rolled out a series of covered call and leveraged ETFs tied to the Nasdaq 100 and the so-called Magnificent Seven - the group of megacap tech stocks that has dominated the U.S. market in recent months.Direxion, another provider of leveraged ETFs, has launched two new funds tied specifically to the Magnificent Seven and offering speculators a way to bet on daily movements in the group. The Direxion Daily Concentrated Qs Bull 2x ETF delivers double their daily gain; its counterpart, the Direxion Daily Concentrated Qs Bear 1x ETF, is designed to capture 100% of the inverse of any move in the group.GraniteShares' Rhind said he hopes to introduce leveraged funds tied to stocks like American Airlines and Exxon Mobil to prove that demand for these ETFs extends beyond technology stocks. He did not give a time frame for those launches.(Reporting by Suzanne McGee in Providence, Rhode Island; Editing by Matthew Lewis)"
Motley Fool,"Chevron Stock Has 29% Upside, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chevron-stock-29-upside-according-175639917.html,"Despite uncertainty around the Hess deal, the oil major looks like a good value.","A Mizuho Financial analyst recently reiterated a ""buy"" rating on Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and increased the price target from $195 to $200.The move follows from a Piper Sandler analyst recently reiterating an ""overweight"" rating on the stock with a $180 price target. The stock currently trades at just under $155, so both price targets suggest substantial upside potential. For example, the Mizuho target implies a 29% upside over the next 12 months or so. When you add in the 4.2% dividend yield, the potential return by this time next year could be 33.5%.The Mizuho upgrade comes with a positive view of Chevron's reserves and factors in the successful acquisition of Hess (NYSE: HES) in a base-case scenario.As fellow Motley Fool contributor Matt DiLallo previously outlined, there's uncertainty around the Hess acquisition due to ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) acting to preserve the right to determine the value of Hess' 30% stake in the Stabroek offshore oil block in Guyana. It's arguably Hess' most important asset. For reference, ExxonMobil owns 45% of the Stabroek block.Chevron's move highlights the attractiveness of the sectorChevron's intended acquisition of Hess highlights the trend of oil majors (ExxonMobil is due to complete its $59.5 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources shortly) taking advantage of lowly valuations and a relatively high price of oil to acquire assets. A high price of oil means the majors have the cash flow to support deal-making at attractive prices.It's also a sign of long-term confidence in the industry, and investors may be unnecessarily shying away from buying Chevron stock due to the uncertainty around the Hess situation. That could create a buying opportunity in the stock. Trading on a forward price-to-earnings multiple of around 12.3 times earnings and yielding 4.2%, it's hard to argue that Chevron isn't a good value.Should you invest $1,000 in Chevron right now?Before you buy stock in Chevron, consider this:Story continuesThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Chevron wasn’t one of them.
