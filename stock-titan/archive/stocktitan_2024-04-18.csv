Financial Analyst The closing of a private placement at 5.7 million signifies a significant capital infusion for AirNet Technology Inc. Such an injection of funds is often utilized for accelerating growth, funding new ventures, or improving the balance sheet. However, this comes at the cost of shareholder dilution. Considering the par value of 0.04 per share and the volume of shares issued, investors should assess the dilution's magnitude relative to the total number of shares outstanding. Moreover, the absence of registration implies a restriction on the liquidity of these shares, which might impact their valuation from the investor's perspective. Securities Compliance Expert From a regulatory standpoint, the fact that these shares are unregistered is critical. Investors should be aware that unregistered shares come with certain resale restrictions which can affect liquidity. The requirement for a registration statement or an exemption for the transfer of shares underscores the private nature of this placement. Prospective investors and current shareholders should understand that this particular capital raise mechanism is typically undertaken by companies outside of public markets to secure funding without the immediate regulatory scrutiny and costs associated with public offerings. 04/18/2024 - 04:15 AM BEIJING, April 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- AirNet Technology Inc., formerly known as AirMedia Group Inc.

Negative None. 04/18/2024 - 04:00 AM Taskforce calls for feedback on the draft Impact Disclosure Guidance and the first Sustainable Development Impact Disclosure (SDID) piloted by DP World NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Impact Disclosure Taskforce today released its draft impact disclosure guidance, helping entities committed to addressing development needs and reducing global inequality to access growing pools of sustainable capital. Established in April of 2023 and now a 60+ strong network of financial institutions, capital markets participants, and industry stakeholders, the Taskforce was formed to help corporate entities and sovereigns measure and disclose their efforts to reduce major gaps to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The release of the draft voluntary guidance today initiates a four-month public consultation period, from April 18, 2024 to September 1, 2024, during which the Taskforce welcomes feedback from industry participants and practitioners. The voluntary guidance aims to assist corporate and sovereign entities, particularly those in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDE), to use the principles of impact measurement and monitoring to attract sustainable pools of capital. The guidance also envisions establishing mechanisms for disseminating and analyzing disclosed impact information to promote transparency and accountability. The creation of a Sustainable Development Impact Disclosure (SDID) could provide sustainable financiers with more information to assist financing decisions. The guidance draws on existing resources and outlines a 5-step process for entities to measure and disclose the impacts of their business strategies or national development plans. The guidance reflects a view amongst financiers that the full balance sheet of entities that follow this process would be considered for their sustainable capital allocation. The guidance is characterized by being: Entity-level: assesses the entity’s overall strategy in countries of focus, as opposed to project-level frameworks; Impact-oriented: focuses on outputs and outcomes, rather than a taxonomy of sustainable activities or eligible investments; Forward-looking: establishes targets that measure intended impacts, as opposed to reporting on current sustainability levels; and Context-specific: tailors document to account for development gaps in local jurisdictions. J.P. Morgan and Natixis Corporate & Investment Banking, the Taskforce co-chairs, supported DP World, a leading global logistics and supply chain solutions provider, in creating the pilot SDID under the Impact Disclosure Guidance. This pilot SDID focuses on DP World’s anticipated contributions to SDGs focused on health, education, equality and economic growth through emerging markets infrastructure. See DP World’s full SDID created in accordance with the impact disclosure guidance here: www.dpworld.com/sustainability. Marc-André Blanchard, Executive Vice-President and head of CDPQ Global, Global Head of Sustainability “I am proud that CDPQ played an active role in developing this important guidance. Transparent corporate disclosure is a priority for long-term investors because it enables investment decisions based on uniform and comparable data - critical information that contributes to a sustainable future. I am also pleased that one of our partners, DP World, is the first company to release a pilot disclosure under the Impact Disclosure guidance.” Timothée Jaulin, Head of ESG Development and Advocacy, Amundi “Mobilizing capital to support the UN Sustainable Development Goals requires meaningful, impact-oriented, enhanced disclosure standards. The Sustainable Development Impact Disclosure guidance will be especially relevant for issuers looking to tap capital markets for their financing needs. All capital market instruments, including equity, general purpose debt or sustainable debt instruments require high quality sustainability disclosure at issuer level.” Robert Simpson, Head of Emerging Markets Strategy & Solutions, Pictet Asset Management “Enhanced disclosure on development impact could be transformative in catalysing the needed flow of funds for investment in emerging markets to support their aim in achieving their SDG targets.” Arsalan Mahtafar, Co-Chair of the Impact Disclosure Taskforce and Head of J.P. Morgan’s Development Finance Institution “This guidance will help connect sustainable investors with entities that are accountable to tackling the development challenges in their countries. By connecting like-minded people and empowering them with relevant data, we can make strides towards achieving our global goals.” Cédric Merle Hamon and Leisa Cardoso De Souza, Co-Chair of the Impact Disclosure Taskforce, from the Center of Expertise and Innovation within Natixis Corporate & Investment Banking’s Green and Sustainable Hub “We are thrilled about the launch of the consultation period and crave for thoughtful feedback. Our endeavor is to harness market signals to sustainability data, providing enhanced financial terms to SDG contributing entities, and creating meaningful investing opportunities.” Adama Mariko, Deputy Executive Director for Mobilisation, Partnerships and Communication at the French Development Agency (AFD) and Secretary General of the Finance in Common Initiative “I am pleased to see the progress made by this taskforce since COP28, submitting today its work for public peer review. This is a commendable effort by the private sector, with the participation of public development banks, aimed at improving access to sustainable financing in emerging and developing countries through improved impact measurement and disclosure.” The Taskforce welcomes feedback on the draft guidance and invites you to provide such feedback by visiting www.orrick.com/IDTfeedback.

Firstly, surpassing a new LTI (Lost Time Injury) free record of 12.5 million hours, outperforming the previous benchmark of 9.8 million hours established in March 2023. Secondly, achieving external accreditation of our Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) management system under ISO 45001:2018 standards, demonstrating our commitment to prioritising the health and safety of our workforce and stakeholders.In Q1, there was one lost time injury (""LTI"") resulting in a Group LTIFR of 0.32 per 1,000,000 site-based hours worked. The total recordable injury frequency rate (""TRIFR"") for Q1 was 1.28 per 1,000,000 site-based hours worked.SUKARI GOLD MINE, EGYPT(Q1 2024 vs Q1 2023)ProductionSukari Gold Mine (""Sukari"") produced 104,821oz in Q1, a 1% decrease YoY.Production guidance range for 2024 remains 470,000 to 500,000 ounces.Open pit miningTotal material moved (waste and ore) in Q1 decreased by 4% YoY to 31.8Mt.Total open pit waste material mined (owner and contractor) for Q1 was 25.5Mt, a 14% decrease YoY, predominantly due to the reclassification of material from Stage 7 scheduled to be waste to low-grade ore. This reclassification of waste to ore also resulted in a reduction in the strip ratio and grade per tonne. The strip ratio for Q1 was 4.1:1 (waste:ore).The ongoing contractor waste-stripping programme mined 7.9Mt, with 93% of the fixed volume contract mined to date, and completion expected during Q2.During Q1, open pit ore was mined from multiple working areas with ore processed sourced primarily from Stage 5 and 7. Lower-grade ore mined from Stage 7 was primarily sent to the dump leach or stockpiled. Total open pit ore mined for Q1 was 6.2Mt, a 90% increase YoY, at an average mined grade of 0.63 g/t Au reflecting the 1.8Mt of additional low-grade ore mined from Stage 7 during the quarter. During 2024, we anticipate continued conversion of waste to ore in Stage 7; however, we currently project that this conversion rate will be lower than the levels seen in Q1.Underground miningTotal material mined (waste and ore) in Q1 was 357kt, a 4% increase YoY. Total ore mined was 230kt at an average combined (stoping and development) grade of 3.20g/t Au. This represented a 4% increase in ore tonnes YoY and a 20% decrease in grade YoY. During the quarter upgrades were made to the primary ventilation including the installation of additional fans to increase airflow in both the Amun/Horus and Ptah regions of the mine and facilitate the planned underground expansion. Whilst this lead to a reduction in material moved QoQ, we expect this to increase over the balance of the year.The underground ore mined consisted of 162kt of ore mined from stopes at an average grade of 3.33g/t Au, and 68kt of ore mined from development, at an average grade of 2.87g/t Au.ProcessingDuring Q1, the plant processed 3.0Mt of ore, a 2% increase YoY, at an average feed grade of 1.12 g/t Au, a 7% decrease YoY. There were several key maintenance projects scheduled for the quarter, including mill relining, which were completed successfully with no unplanned disruption to throughput.The metallurgical gold recovery rate was 87.7% for the quarter, a 1% decrease YoY, driven by the oxide material and lower feed grade.During the quarter, the closing stockpile balance was 21.0Mt at a grade of 0.47g/t Au.EXPLORATION PROJECTSThe total expensed exploration and development spend for the quarter was US$6 million.In 2024, budgeted Group exploration spend (expensed) is US$23 million, including US$14 million to complete the Doropo DFS, ESIA, permitting and financing assessment, and US$9 million for EDX exploration.Doropo Gold Project (Cote d'Ivoire)Work at Doropo continued to progress well, notably with submission of the draft ESIA report to government for approval and permitting. Community consultation continues in parallel alongside the commencement of a suite of pilot livelihood improvement projects.DFS work included; preliminary whittle shell selection and ongoing cost estimates using the mining contactor submissions, metallurgical test work and infrastructure and flowsheet design finalisation, and completion of hydrology, sterilisation and geotechnical drilling.The DFS remains expected to be completed by mid-2024.Eastern Desert Exploration (""EDX"") (Egypt)In the Nugrus block surrounding the Sukari Mining Concession, detailed mapping of Little Sukari and Umm Majal was completed, alongside the initiation of ground-based geophysics consisting of induced polarisation (""IP"") and magnetic surveys over these targets. Additionally, a contractor has been selected for the second phase of drilling, scheduled to commence in Q2. In the Um Rus block, follow-up work on soil and rock chip samples from BLEG anomalies was completed. Finally, in the Nadj block, a remote camp was established, and the BLEG sampling program was successfully concluded with the collected samples being prepared for analysis in overseas laboratories.The EDX exploration update remains expected H2 2024SALES AND COSTSGold sales for the quarter were 92,494 oz, a 14% decrease YoY. However we closed the period with 19,241 oz of gold bullion on hand which was sold at the start of the second quarter. The average realised gold price for the quarter was US$2,062/oz, up 8% YoY. Revenues generated were US$191.0 million, a 7% decrease YoY, driven by lower gold sales partially offset by a higher realised gold price.Unit cash costs of production were US$1,088/oz produced, a 16% increase YoY. The AISC of US$1,519/oz Au sold, a 13% increase YoY, reflected the lower gold sales. In absolute terms, AISC decreased both YoY and QoQ, by US$5 million and US$9 million respectively.CAPITAL EXPENDITUREKey capital projects progressed as scheduled during Q1, including the TSF2 embankment raise, the north dump leach expansion, underground ventilation upgrades - namely the installation of additional fans, underground and open pit equipment purchases and the ongoing waste-stripping programme which remains on track for completion during Q2.(US$m)Q1-242024GuidanceSUSTAINING CAPEX Underground mine development853Equipment rebuilds (60% funded from treasury)744Other sustaining capex915Total adjusted sustaining capex24112 NON-SUSTAINING CAPEX Growth capex (funded from treasury) including grid connection, fleetreplacement and exploration-58Contract waste stripping capitalised1936Other non-sustaining capex39Total non-sustaining capex22103TOTAL ADJUSTED CAPEX (after reclassification)46215Sustaining element of open pit waste stripping capitalised from opex1-91GROSS CAPEX463061Reclassified from operating expenditure, from 2021, the Company implemented a more granular methodology to the accounting and classification of waste-stripping costs, in line with IFRS accounting standards.

Negative The shift towards public cloud alternatives may pose challenges for providers still favoring private cloud solutions. Increased demand for transformation services may lead to competition among service providers, affecting pricing and quality. The need for skilled resources in the region may result in higher costs for providers, potentially impacting service fees. 04/18/2024 - 04:00 AM A recent surge in outsourcing activity points to a positive trajectory for managed cloud services within the Nordics, ISG Provider Lens™ report says STOCKHOLM--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- As the clock winds down on SAP’s support for its ERP Central Component (ECC) system, adoption of the company’s RISE with SAP offering is on the upswing among Nordic enterprises, according to a new research report published today by Information Services Group (ISG) (Nasdaq: III), a leading global technology research and advisory firm. The 2024 ISG Provider Lens™ SAP Ecosystem report for the Nordics finds a notable increase in demand from large enterprises over the past 12–18 months for both on-premises and cloud deployment of S/4HANA. Much of that increase can be attributed to the RISE with SAP program, which offers tools, services and software to help large enterprises adopt SAP solutions, the ISG report says. SAP is pushing companies to implement S/4HANA as it ends support for its on-premises SAP ECC system at the end of 2027. “Growing interest among Nordic businesses in RISE with SAP has increased demand for managed cloud services outsourcing,” said Andreas Fahr, partner and head of ISG DACH and Nordics. “Providers are responding by demonstrating their flexibility in accommodating SAP ERP applications across public and private cloud infrastructures.” With increasing demand for transformation services, SAP and service providers are strategically aligning to offer either public or private cloud solutions depending on enterprise preferences, the ISG report says. While private cloud is currently still the favored choice among enterprises for SAP applications, the landscape of cloud adoption in the Nordics is evolving, ISG says. According to the report, recent market trends indicate a growing demand for public cloud alternatives. To accommodate this demand, providers are enhancing their operations and introducing new services, actively refining their tools, accelerators and functionalities to deliver tangible benefits to clients, the report says. That includes integrating automation and AI into tools and accelerators for SAP transformations and managed services. In addition, providers are offering industry-specific road maps tailored to meet specific client needs and focusing on reducing time to market, ISG says. “Nordic enterprises are looking for providers that are capable of delivering services with minimal lead time,” said Jan Erik Aase, partner and global leader, ISG Provider Lens Research. “That has prompted providers to bolster their skilled resource strength in the region and led to an increase in certified onshore resources.” The report also examines emerging trends in application managed services (AMS) outsourcing in the Nordic region. For more insights into the SAP ecosystem challenges facing enterprises in the Nordics, including finding needed talent and managing complex cloud applications, and ISG’s advice for addressing them, see the ISG Provider Lens™ Focal Points briefing here. The 2024 ISG Provider Lens™ SAP Ecosystem report for the Nordics evaluates the capabilities of 31 providers across three quadrants: SAP S/4HANA System Transformation, SAP Application Managed Services and Managed Cloud Services for SAP ERP. The report names Accenture, Capgemini, Eviden (an Atos Business), HCLTech, TCS and Tietoevry as Leaders in all three quadrants, while Cognizant, IBM, PwC and Tech Mahindra are named as Leaders in two quadrants each. Infosys, Kyndryl, T-Systems and Wipro are named as Leaders in one quadrant each. In addition, Wipro is named as a Rising Star — a company with a “promising portfolio” and “high future potential” by ISG’s definition — in two quadrants, while DXC Technology is named as a Rising Star in one quadrant. In the area of customer experience, Infosys is named the global ISG CX Star Performer for 2024 among SAP Ecosystem partners. The provider earned the highest customer satisfaction scores in ISG's Voice of the Customer survey, part of the ISG Star of Excellence™ program, the premier quality recognition for the technology and business services industry.

Cisco is rearchitecting how we harness and protect AI and other modern workloads with industry-first, Cisco Hypershield. With this unprecedented innovation, Cisco is tipping the scales in favor of defenders, building on its recent announcements to accelerate AI infrastructure with Cisco's ethernet switching, silicon and compute portfolio. Cisco is powering and protecting the engine of the AI revolutionCisco Hypershield protects applications, devices and data across public and private data centers, clouds and physical locations - anywhere customers need it. Designed and built with AI in mind from the start, Hypershield enables organizations to achieve security outcomes beyond what has been possible with humans alone. ""Cisco Hypershield is one of the most significant security innovations in our history,"" said Chuck Robbins, Cisco Chair and CEO. ""With our data advantage and strength in security, infrastructure and observability platforms, Cisco is uniquely positioned to help our customers harness the power of AI."" Hypershield is a revolutionary new security architecture. It's built with technology originally developed for hyperscale public clouds and is now available for enterprise IT teams of all sizes. More a fabric than a fence, Hypershield enables security enforcement to be placed everywhere it needs to be. Every application service in the datacenter. Every Kubernetes cluster in the public cloud. Every container and virtual machine (VM). It can even turn every network port into a high-performance security enforcement point, bringing completely new security capabilities not just to clouds, but to the data center, on a factory floor, or a hospital imaging room. This new technology blocks application exploits in minutes and stops lateral movement in its tracks. ""AI has the potential to empower the world's 8 billion people to have the same impact as 80 billion. With this abundance, we must reimagine the role of the data center – how data centers are connected, secured, operated and scaled,"" said Jeetu Patel, Executive Vice President and General Manager for Security and Collaboration at Cisco. ""The power of Cisco Hypershield is that it can put security anywhere you need it – in software, in a server, or in the future even in a network switch. When you have a distributed system that could include hundreds of thousands of enforcement points, simplified management is mission critical. And we need to be orders-of-magnitude more autonomous, at an orders-of-magnitude lower cost."" Security enforcement with Hypershield happens at three different layers: in software, in virtual machines, and in network and compute servers and appliances, leveraging the same powerful hardware accelerators that are used extensively in high-performance computing and hyperscale public clouds. Hypershield was built on three key pillars: AI-Native: Built and designed from the start to be autonomous and predictive, Hypershield manages itself once it earns trust, making a hyper-distributed approach at scale possible.Cloud-Native: Hypershield is built on open source eBPF, the default mechanism for connecting and protecting cloud-native workloads in the hyperscale cloud. Cisco acquired the leading provider of eBPF for enterprises, Isovalent, earlier this month.Hyper-Distributed: Cisco is completely reimagining how traditional network security works by embedding advanced security controls into servers and the network fabric itself. Hypershield spans all clouds and leverages hardware acceleration like Data Processing Units (DPU) to analyze and respond to anomalies in application and network behavior. It shifts security closer to the workloads that need protection.Cisco, with its industry-leading expertise in networking, security and extensive partner ecosystem, together with NVIDIA, is committed to building and optimizing AI-native security solutions to protect and scale the data centers of tomorrow. This collaboration includes leveraging the NVIDIA Morpheus cybersecurity AI framework for accelerated network anomaly detection, as well as NVIDIA NIM microservices for powering custom security AI assistants for the enterprise. NVIDIA's class of converged accelerators combine the power of GPU and DPU computing, to augment Cisco Hypershield with robust security from cloud to edge. ""Enterprises across all industries are seeking the security that can protect them against ever expanding cyber threats,"" said Kevin Deierling, Senior Vice President of Networking at NVIDIA. ""Together, Cisco and NVIDIA are leveraging the power of AI to deliver powerful, incredibly secure data center infrastructure that will enable enterprises to transform their businesses and benefit customers everywhere."" As a revolutionary new security architecture, Hypershield is solving three key customer challenges in defending against today's sophisticated threat landscape: Distributed Exploit Protection: Attackers are adept at weaponizing newly published vulnerabilities faster than defenders can patch. With defenders seeing nearly 100 new vulnerabilities every day, according to Cisco Talos Threat Intelligence, this can lead to catastrophic results. Hypershield delivers protection in minutes by automatically testing and deploying compensating controls into the distributed fabric of enforcement points.Autonomous Segmentation: Once an attacker is in the network, segmentation is key to stopping their lateral movement. Hypershield perpetually observes, auto-reasons and re-evaluates existing policies to autonomously segment the network, solving this in large and complex environments.Self-qualifying Upgrades: Hypershield automates the incredibly laborious and time-consuming process of testing and deploying upgrades once they are ready, leveraging a dual data plane. This completely new software architecture allows software upgrades and policy changes to be placed in a digital twin that tests updates using the customer's unique combination of traffic, policies and features, then applying those updates with zero downtime.Built into the Security Cloud, Cisco's unified, AI-driven, cross-domain security platform, Cisco Hypershield is expected to be Generally Available in August 2024. With Cisco's recent acquisition of Splunk, customers will gain unparalleled visibility and insights across their entire digital footprint for unprecedented security protection. ""AI is not just a force for good but also a tool used for nefarious purposes, allowing hackers to reverse engineer patches and create exploits in record time. Cisco looks to address an AI enabled problem with an AI solution as Cisco Hypershield aims to tip the scales back in favor of the defender by shielding new vulnerabilities against exploit in minutes - rather than the days, weeks or even months as we wait for patches to actually get deployed,"" said Frank Dickson, Group Vice President, Security & Trust at IDC. ""With the number of vulnerabilities ever increasing and the time for attackers to exploit them at scale ever decreasing, it's clear that patching alone can't keep up. Tools like Hypershield are necessary to combat an increasingly clever malicious cyber adversary."" ""Cisco Hypershield takes aim at the complex security challenges of modern, AI-scale data centers. Cisco's vision of a self-managing fabric that seamlessly integrates from the network to the endpoint will help redefine what's possible for security at scale,"" said Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst of ZK Research. ""For instance, this level of visibility and control across a hyper-distributed environment prevents lateral movement of attackers, enabled through a unique approach to segmentation that's autonomous and highly effective. While this may seem fantastical, the time is right given recent AI advances combined with the maturity of cloud-native technologies like eBPF."" ""At AHEAD we believe cybersecurity should be integrated into everything we do. Bolted-on security is more expensive and less effective,"" said Steven Aiello, Field Chief Information Security Officer at AHEAD. ""Cisco Hypershield ensures that cyber protections are included into the fabric of the enterprise. Distributed Exploit Protection will be a massive win for blue teams - legacy synthetic patching was primarily limited to edge devices, allowing lateral movement once an attacker breached the perimeter. It's a great day for cyber-defenders!"" Cisco protects 100 percent of the Fortune 100. To learn more, visit cisco.com/go/hypershield.

March 22, 2024: Danone announced that the Russian regulatory approvals required for the disposal of its EDP business in Russia to Vamin R LLC have been obtained. The closing of this disposal is expected in the coming weeks. April 1, 2024: Danone completed the sale of its milk and dairy activity Horizon Organic and Wallaby in the U.S. to Platinum Equity. Danone retains a non-consolidated minority stake in the business. IV. ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY IFRS IAS 29: impact on reported data Danone has been applying IAS 29 in hyperinflation countries as defined in IFRS. Adoption of IAS 29 in hyperinflationary countries requires its non-monetary assets and liabilities and its income statement to be restated to reflect the changes in the general pricing power of its functional currency, leading to a gain or loss on the net monetary position included in the net income. Moreover, its financial statements are converted into euros using the closing exchange rate of the relevant period. IAS 29: impact on reported data € million except %Q1 2024Sales12.7Sales growth (%)0.19% Definitions of geographical zones Europe refers to European countries and Ukraine. North America includes United States and Canada. China, North Asia & Oceania includes China, Japan, Australia and New-Zealand. Latin America includes Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay. Rest of the World includes AMEA (Asia, Middle East including Turkey, Africa) and CIS. Financial indicators not defined in IFRS Due to rounding, the sum of values presented may differ from totals as reported. Such differences are not material. Like-for-like changes in sales reflect Danone's organic performance and essentially exclude the impact of: changes in consolidation scope, with indicators related to a given fiscal year calculated on the basis of the previous year's scope;changes in applicable accounting principles;changes in exchange rates, with both previous-year and current-year indicators calculated using the same exchange rates (the exchange rate used is a projected annual rate determined by Danone for the current year and applied to both previous and current years). Since January 1st, 2023, all countries with hyperinflationary economies are taken into account in like-for-like changes as follows: net sales growth in excess of around 26% per year (a three-year average at 26% would generally trigger the application of hyperinflationary accounting as defined in IFRS) is now excluded from the like-for-like net sales growth calculation.

Other operating income and expenses comprise items that, because of their significant or unusual nature, cannot be viewed as inherent to Danone’s recurring activity and have limited predictive value, thus distorting the assessment of its recurring operating performance and its evolution. These mainly include: capital gains and losses on disposals of fully consolidated companies;impairment charges on intangible assets with indefinite useful lives;costs related to strategic restructurings or transformation plans;costs related to major external growth transactions;costs related to major crisis and major litigations;in connection with IFRS 3 (Revised) and IAS 27 (Revised) relating to business combinations, (i) acquisition costs related to business combinations, (ii) revaluation profit or loss accounted for following a loss of control, and (iii) changes in earn-outs relating to business combinations and subsequent to acquisition date.

Financial Analyst Lithium Americas Corp.'s announcement of a $275 million public offering is a significant event that merits a close examination of its financial implications. The company is selling 55 million common shares at $5.00 each, which is a strategic move to generate capital. This decision often reflects a company's confidence in its projects and its ability to scale operations. In this case, funds are earmarked for the Thacker Pass lithium project, a key asset with potential to feed into the growing demand for lithium carbonate, driven by the electric vehicle market.However, investors should be aware of the dilutive effect of such offerings on existing shareholders. Additionally, the offering price can signal how the market values the company's stock. Here, the issue price may be compared with recent trading prices to assess market sentiment. The option for underwriters to purchase additional shares, known as the Over-Allotment Option, provides a buffer that can stabilize the share price post-offering. It is also an indicator of underwriter confidence in the offering's success.Furthermore, the company's liquidity position seems robust, with cash and cash equivalents, combined with the net proceeds of the offering, designed to cover the estimated remaining capital expenditures for the construction of Phase 1. This indicates strategic financial planning but also signals that should any unexpected costs or delays arise, the company could face additional funding needs. Energy Sector Analyst The context in which Lithium Americas is advancing its Thacker Pass project is important for understanding its potential impact on the energy sector. Lithium is a critical component in the production of batteries for electric vehicles (EVs) and as such, the EV market's trajectory directly influences the demand for lithium.Given the U.S. government's backing through the Conditional Commitment from the Department of Energy's ATVM Loan Program, the Thacker Pass project carries a stamp of strategic importance. This not only helps in the financial viability of the project by reducing capital costs but also aligns with the broader policy push towards a green economy. The involvement of General Motors with its Tranche 2 Investment further enhances the credibility of the project and its alignment with the automotive industry's shift towards electrification.However, investors should remain cognizant of the regulatory and environmental challenges associated with lithium mining in the U.S. Potential delays or additional requirements could affect the timeline and financial projections of the Thacker Pass project. The market should also keep an eye on global lithium supply dynamics, as they will influence the pricing power of suppliers like Lithium Americas. 04/18/2024 - 01:56 AM (All amounts in US$ unless otherwise indicated) VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lithium Americas Corp. (TSX: LAC) (NYSE: LAC) (“Lithium Americas” or the “Company”) announced the pricing of its previously announced underwritten public offering (the “Offering”) of 55,000,000 of its common shares (the “Common Shares”) at a price to the public of $5.00 per Common Share (the “Issue Price”) for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of $275,000,000. The Offering is being conducted through a syndicate of underwriters led by Evercore ISI, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and BMO Capital Markets (together, the “Lead Underwriters”), as the co-lead book-running managers, J.P. Morgan as joint book-running manager, and Canaccord Genuity, Cormark Securities Inc., Scotiabank, Stifel Canada, Eight Capital and Tuohy Brothers as co-managers (together with the Lead Underwriters, collectively, the “Underwriters”). The Company has granted the Underwriters an option to purchase up to 8,250,000 additional Common Shares (the “Over-Allotment Option”) at the Issue Price, exercisable, in whole or in part, for up to 30 days after the closing of the Offering. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the Offering for advancing the construction and development of its Thacker Pass lithium project in Humboldt County, Nevada (“Thacker Pass”), as further described in the Prospectus Supplements. In March 2024, the Company achieved a significant milestone for Thacker Pass by receiving a conditional commitment (the “Conditional Commitment”) from the U.S. Department of Energy under the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program (the “ATVM Loan Program”) for a $1.97 billion loan in aggregate principal to fund eligible construction costs of the processing facilities at Thacker Pass, targeting to produce an initial 40,000 tonnes per year of battery grade lithium carbonate (“Phase 1”), plus interest to be accrued during construction, which is estimated to be $290 million over a three-year period, together totaling a $2.26 billion loan (the “Loan”). As of December 31, 2023, after accounting for funding from the Loan and the pending $330 million second tranche investment (the “Tranche 2 Investment”) from General Motors Holdings LLC (“GM”), the Company estimates approximately $436 million remains to be committed to Phase 1 capital costs from the Company's existing cash and cash equivalents and incremental funding. The Company’s approximately $196 million of cash and cash equivalents, as of December 31, 2023, when combined with the net proceeds of the Offering of approximately $263 million (before giving effect to any exercise of the Over-Allotment Option), along with and after accounting for the funding from the Loan and the GM Tranche 2 Investment, are expected to result in the estimated remaining capital expenditures of approximately $2.736 billion for construction of Phase 1 as well as the Company’s 2024 operating budget being substantially fully funded. Incremental funding requirements will be funded through the exercise of the Over-Allotment Option (if exercised) or other financing alternatives. Closing is expected to occur on April 22, 2024, and is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of required approvals of the Toronto Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange. The Offering will be made in the United States by way of a prospectus supplement (the “U.S. Prospectus Supplement”) to the Company’s existing base shelf prospectus (the “U.S. Base Shelf Prospectus”) forming part of an effective registration statement on Form F-3 (File No. 333-274883) (the “Registration Statement”), and will be made in Canada by way of a prospectus supplement (the “Canadian Prospectus Supplement”, together with the U.S. Prospectus Supplement, the “Prospectus Supplements”) to the Company’s existing base shelf prospectus (the “Canadian Base Shelf Prospectus”, together with the U.S. Base Shelf Prospectus, the “Base Shelf Prospectuses”). The Offering is being made in the United States and in each of the provinces and territories of Canada, except Québec. The Prospectus Supplements, the Base Shelf Prospectuses and the Registration Statement contain important information about the Company and the proposed Offering. Prospective investors should read the Prospectus Supplements, the Base Shelf Prospectuses and the Registration Statement and the other documents the Company has filed before making an investment decision.

Financial Analyst The public offering from Montrose Environmental Group presents an opportunity to raise capital, notably for accelerating strategic growth initiatives. The offer of an additional 15% of shares as an option for underwriters is a common hedge against post-offering price volatility. The pricing at <$37.15> per share reflects current market valuation and its impact on the stock will depend on investor perception of the company's growth prospects. Use of the net proceeds for a diverse set of corporate purposes suggests a balanced approach to growth and debt management. However, the dilutive effect of the offering on existing shareholders' equity should be considered, as it might affect earnings per share in the short term. Market Research Analyst Montrose Environmental Group's offering occurs in a context where environmental services are increasingly valued, with tightened regulations likely bolstering demand. This strategic move to fund acquisitions and R&D could position the company advantageously if it leads to innovative solutions and expanded market share. Their apparent focus on commercialization of intellectual property and software development speaks to a forward-thinking approach, potentially increasing their competitiveness in the environmental sector. Nevertheless, investor sentiment will be critical; if the market interprets this offering as a lack of liquidity or an overextension of the company's financial leverage, it could negatively influence Montrose's stock in the near term. 04/17/2024 - 11:15 PM LITTLE ROCK, Ark.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Montrose Environmental Group, Inc.

The incremental backlog from these fixtures amounts to around $248 million. The total backlog for Transocean is approximately $8.9 billion as of April 17, 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst Transocean's latest Fleet Status Report signals a substantial fortification of their financial position with the extended contract for Deepwater Asgard and the exercised option for Deepwater Skyros. The disclosed $248 million of incremental backlog is a significant addition to their already robust total backlog of $8.9 billion. This positions the company favorably in terms of revenue visibility, which is a vital aspect for investors seeking stability in their investments.The daily rates disclosed, $505,000 for the Asgard and $400,000 for the Skyros, are above industry average, reflecting a strong market demand for deepwater drilling services and Transocean's ability to command premium pricing due to its advanced fleet. This should contribute positively to the company's EBITDA margins, assuming operational costs remain controlled. Investors should monitor future reports for signs of cost inflation that could erode these margins. Market Research Analyst The focus on expanding activities in key geographical regions such as the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Angola highlights the strategic approach Transocean is taking to optimize its fleet's deployment. A 365-day extension in the Gulf of Mexico underscores the region's ongoing potential and Transocean's commitment to leveraging its assets in a high-activity area.Investors should appreciate the importance of the contract extension and option exercise as indicators of client confidence and a predictable revenue stream. Such extended contracts in the offshore drilling industry suggest a backlog stability that can shield the company from the sector's cyclical nature. 04/17/2024 - 04:49 PM STEINHAUSEN, Switzerland, April 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Transocean Ltd.

Adjusted leasing assumptions within the same store portfolio for 2024 due to ongoing economic uncertainty. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported cash rental rate increase of approximately 45% on leases commencing in 2024 indicates a robust pricing power for First Industrial Realty Trust, potentially reflective of a strong demand for logistic real estate. Investors should note that such growth is substantial when compared to the industry averages, which could denote either market growth or strategic positioning by the company amidst broader economic uncertainties.Moreover, the declaration of an increased dividend of $0.37 per share, up 15.6% from the previous rate, is a tangible sign of confidence from the management in the company's cash flow stability. Dividend hikes are often seen as a signal of financial health, which might attract income-focused investors. However, one should consider the sustainability of such dividend payouts in relation to the company's overall financial commitments and investment in growth. Real Estate Market Analyst Occupancy rates remaining constant at 95.5% in the face of economic headwinds suggest that First Industrial is maintaining its asset utilization effectively. Nonetheless, a slight drop from 98.7% in the previous year could point to market-wide challenges. Investors might find solace in the company's ability to pre-lease significant developments, indicating credible future revenue streams.The cash basis same store net operating income (SS NOI) growth of 10% is a key performance metric in real estate, reflecting the organic growth in income from properties. This is a strong indicator of the company's operational efficiency and ability to manage expenses and lease terms strategically. Construction and Development Analyst The completion of high-profile development projects, such as the pre-leasing of the entire First Stockton Logistics Center, is a testament to First Industrial's strategic forward-planning. This aggressive development strategy could serve to further solidify their market presence in strategic locations, though it also bears the risk of overexposure should market conditions deteriorate.First Industrial's future guidance adjustments, reflecting decreased assumptions in certain areas, should remind investors that the real estate sector is cyclical and sensitive to broader macroeconomic factors. The forecasted SS NOI growth decrease of 75 basis points may warrant a cautious outlook in terms of expected profitability and operational performance going forward. 04/17/2024 - 04:56 PM Signed 1.6 Million Square Feet of New Leases for Speculative Developments on Balance Sheet and 376,000 Square Feet in the Joint Venture in the First Quarter45% Cash Rental Rate Increase on Leases Signed To-Date Commencing in 2024Cash Same Store NOI Growth of 10.0%Sold Nine Buildings for $49 MillionIncreased First Quarter 2024 Dividend to $0.37 Per Share; 15.6% Growth Compared to Prior Quarterly RateCHICAGO, April 17, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc.

Portfolio Performance In service occupancy was 95.5% at the end of the first quarter of 2024, compared to 95.5% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, and 98.7% at the end of the first quarter of 2023.In the first quarter, cash rental rates on new and renewal leasing increased 44.8% and increased 67.2% on a straight-line basis.The Company has achieved a cash rental rate increase of approximately 45% on leases signed to-date commencing in 2024 reflecting 68% of 2024 expirations by rental income.Cash basis same store net operating income before termination fees and the aforementioned accelerated recognition of a tenant improvement reimbursement (""SS NOI"") increased 10.0% reflecting increases in rental rates on new and renewal leasing, contractual rent escalations, and lower free rent, partially offset by lower average occupancy.Development Leasing Highlights During the first quarter, the Company: Pre-leased 100% of the 1.0 million square-foot First Stockton Logistics Center in Northern California with an expected start date in the third quarter.Leased 100% of the 500,000 square-foot First Rockdale IV in Nashville.Leased 40,000 square feet of its 200,000 square-foot First 76 Logistics Center in Denver.Leased 100% of the 376,000 square-foot Building A in its Camelback 303 joint venture in Phoenix to two tenants.Investment and Disposition Highlights In the first quarter, the Company: Sold nine buildings comprised of 443,000 square feet for a total of $49 million consisting of properties in Cincinnati, Detroit and Chicago.Common Stock Dividend The board of directors declared a common dividend of $0.37 per share/unit for the quarter ending March 31, 2024 that was paid on April 15, 2024 to stockholders of record on March 28, 2024. The new dividend rate represented a 15.6% increase from the prior quarterly rate of $0.32 per share/unit. Outlook for 2024 ""With ongoing uncertainty in the overall economy and interest rate environment, some businesses continue to be measured in their leasing decision-making,"" said Mr. Baccile. ""As a result, we have adjusted certain leasing assumptions within our same store portfolio that are reflected in our updated guidance.""

Excluding this impact, the range of our FFO guidance is $2.55 to $2.65 per share/unit with a midpoint of $2.60. The Company believes that providing modified FFO, which excludes certain infrequent items, is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance because investors may use this measure to help compare the operating performance of the Company between periods or other REITs on a consistent basis. The following assumptions were used for guidance: Average quarter-end in service occupancy of 95.75% to 96.75%, a decrease of 25 basis points at the midpoint.SS NOI growth on a cash basis before termination fees of 7.25% to 8.25% for the full year, a decrease of 75 basis points at the midpoint. SS NOI excludes $2.9 million of income related to the 1Q23 accelerated recognition of a tenant improvement reimbursement.Includes the incremental costs expected in 2024 related to the Company's completed and under construction developments as of March 31, 2024. In total, the Company expects to capitalize $0.05 per share of interest in 2024.General and administrative expense (""G&A"") of $39.5 million to $40.5 million. This includes approximately $3.0 million of accelerated expense related to accounting rules that require the Company to fully expense the value of granted equity-based compensation for certain tenured employees.Guidance does not include the impact of any future investments, property sales, debt repurchases prior to maturity, debt issuances, or equity issuances post the date of this press release.Conference Call First Industrial will host its quarterly conference call on Thursday, April 18, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. CDT (11:00 a.m. EDT).

While we believe net income available to First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc.'s common stockholders and participating securities, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate measure, we consider FFO, NOI, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO, given their wide use by, and relevance to investors and analysts, appropriate supplemental performance measures. FFO, reflecting the assumption that real estate asset values rise or fall with market conditions, principally adjusts for the effects of GAAP depreciation and amortization of real estate assets. NOI provides a measure of rental operations, and does not factor in depreciation and amortization and non-property specific expenses such as general and administrative expenses. Adjusted EBITDA provides a tool to further evaluate the ability to incur and service debt and to fund dividends and other cash needs. AFFO provides a tool to further evaluate the ability to fund dividends. In addition, FFO, NOI, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO are commonly used in various ratios, pricing multiples/yields and returns and valuation calculations used to measure financial position, performance and value. In accordance with the NAREIT definition of FFO, we calculate FFO to be equal to net income available to First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc.'s common stockholders and participating securities, plus depreciation and other amortization of real estate, plus impairment of real estate, minus gain or plus loss on sale of real estate, net of any income tax provision or benefit associated with the sale of real estate. We also exclude the same adjustments from our share of net income from an unconsolidated joint venture. NOI is defined as our revenues, minus property expenses such as real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, property management, utilities, insurance and other expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as NOI minus general and administrative expenses and the equity in FFO from our investment in joint venture, net of noncontrolling interest. AFFO is defined as adjusted EBITDA minus interest expense, minus capitalized interest and overhead, plus amortization of debt discounts and hedge costs, minus straight-line rent, amortization of above (below) market leases and lease inducements, minus provision for income taxes or plus benefit for income taxes not allocable to gain on sale of real estate, plus amortization of equity based compensation and minus non-incremental capital expenditures. Non-incremental capital expenditures refer to building improvements and leasing costs required to maintain current revenues plus tenant improvements amortized back to the tenant over the lease term. Excluded are first generation leasing costs, capital expenditures underwritten at acquisition and development/redevelopment costs. FFO, NOI, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs, including the repayment of principal on debt and payment of dividends and distributions. FFO, NOI, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO should not be considered substitutes for net income available to common stockholders and participating securities (calculated in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of results of operations, cash flows (calculated in accordance with GAAP) or as a measure of liquidity. FFO, NOI, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO as currently calculated by us may not be comparable to similarly titled, but variously calculated, measures of other REITs. We consider cash-basis same store NOI (""SS NOI"") to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. Same store properties include all properties owned prior to January 1, 2023 and held as an in service property through the end of the current reporting period (including certain income-producing land parcels), and developments and redevelopments that were placed in service prior to January 1, 2023 (the ""Same Store Pool""). Properties which are at least 75% occupied at acquisition are placed in service, unless we anticipate tenant move-outs within two years of ownership would drop occupancy below 75%. Properties acquired with occupancy greater than 75% at acquisition, but with tenants that we anticipate will move out within two years of ownership, will be placed in service upon the earlier of reaching 90% occupancy or twelve months after move out. Properties acquired that are less than 75% occupied at the date of acquisition are placed in service as they reach the earlier of reaching 90% occupancy or one year subsequent to acquisition. Developments, redevelopments and acquired income-producing land parcels for which our ultimate intent is to redevelop or develop on the land parcel are placed in service as they reach the earlier of 90% occupancy or one year subsequent to development/redevelopment construction completion. We define SS NOI as NOI, less NOI of properties not in the Same Store Pool, less the impact of straight-line rent, the amortization of above (below) market rent and the impact of lease termination fees. Same Store revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2023 exclude $2,934 related to accelerated recognition of a tenant improvement reimbursement associated with a departing tenant in Dallas. We exclude lease termination fees, straight-line rent and above (below) market rent in calculating SS NOI because we believe it provides a better measure of actual cash basis rental growth for a year-over-year comparison. In addition, we believe that SS NOI helps the investing public compare the operating performance of a company's real estate as compared to other companies. While SS NOI is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. SS NOI also does not reflect general and administrative expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, income tax benefit and expense, gains and losses on the sale of real estate, equity in income or loss from joint venture, joint venture fees, joint venture development services expense, capital expenditures and leasing costs. Further, our computation of SS NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating SS NOI.

Financial Analyst NRx Pharmaceuticals' public offering is a strategic move to bolster its financial position for future operations. The company's decision to allocate net proceeds towards working capital and general corporate purposes signals a focus on strengthening its operational capabilities. A portion directed to debt repayment suggests an intent to improve their balance sheet and potentially lower future interest expenses, which can positively influence net income figures. Investors should closely monitor the final terms and size of the offering, as dilution could occur, impacting share value. Given the industry's volatility and the risk profile of clinical-stage biopharmaceuticals, the market's reception to this offering will be indicative of investor confidence in NRx's pipeline and overall strategy. Biotech Market Analyst The move to initiate a national treatment protocol and safety database indicates NRx Pharmaceuticals' commitment to advancing its clinical programs. Investors should recognize that such strategic investments can lead to long-term growth if the protocols demonstrate positive outcomes. However, they should also be aware of the inherent risks associated with the clinical development process, which is typically characterized by high R&D costs and uncertain regulatory outcomes. The company's ability to progress through clinical stages and eventually secure FDA approval is critical for value creation. Industry benchmarks suggest that successful protocol implementation can lead to significant partnerships or buyout opportunities, which are bullish indicators for investors. 04/17/2024 - 04:45 PM RADNOR, Pa., April 17, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- NRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Das Kraftwerk wird einen 15-Jahres-Vertrag erfüllen und feste Leistungskapazität bereitstellen. Der Bau hat bereits begonnen, und der kommerzielle Betrieb wird bis August 2026 erwartet. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst New Fortress Energy's expansion in Brazil with a 1.6 GW power plant kickstarts a significant chapter in the country's energy sector. This development aligns with the global shift towards LNG, a cleaner-burning fossil fuel, to address energy needs and transition goals. The fixed-price EPC contract mitigates cost overrun risks, which is favorable from an investor's standpoint. The 15-year Agreement ensures a long-term revenue stream, potentially stabilizing NFE's financial outlook. Considering NFE's simultaneous development of the Barcarena and Santa Catarina terminals, synergy effects could lead to operational efficiencies and cost savings. This could make NFE a more competitive player in the region, possibly impacting the stock positively. However, the capital expenditure for this project is substantial and investors should monitor the company’s debt levels and cash flow to sustain construction without financial strain. Environmental and Regulatory Expert The choice to build an LNG-powered facility is noteworthy in the context of Brazil's energy policy, which is incentivizing cleaner energy sources. LNG is considered a transition fuel, offering lower emissions than coal or oil. NFE's long-term contract with the Brazilian Chamber of Electric Energy Commercialization suggests compliance with regulatory standards and governmental support. From an environmental perspective, the project is a stride towards reducing carbon footprint. Investors should note that regulatory changes or shifts in energy policy could impact project viability. The commitment to a cleaner energy source could enhance NFE's reputation and brand value, potentially appealing to the growing segment of ESG-focused investors. Construction and Infrastructure Expert The involvement of Mitsubishi Power Americas and Andrade Gutierrez, both established entities in power plant construction, adds credibility to the project's timely completion. The fixed-price, date-certain EPC contract structure is a strategic move, often employed to manage and lock-in project costs, which can reassure investors about budget adherence. However, the high cost and complexity of such infrastructure projects carry inherent risks like construction delays or technical challenges. Investors would be wise to consider the track record of the consortium in similar projects as a benchmark for execution capability. NFE's confidence in a 24-month completion timeline indicates robust project management, but investors should still account for potential delays typical in large-scale construction. 04/17/2024 - 04:37 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- New Fortress Energy Inc. (NASDAQ: NFE) (“NFE” or the “Company”) today announced that it has finalized and executed an engineering, procurement and construction contract (the “EPC Contract”) with a consortium formed by Mitsubishi Power Americas and Andrade Gutierrez (the “MHI/AG Consortium”) for a 1.6 GW power plant to be built adjacent to the Barcarena LNG terminal. NFE has also issued full Notice to Proceed to the MHI/AG Consortium to begin construction work under the contract. The power plant will provide firm power capacity under the previously announced 15-year Capacity Reserve Contract (“Agreement”) that NFE acquired from Denham Capital and CEIBA Energy, which closed in March 2024. Under the terms of the fixed-price, date-certain EPC Contract, construction activities for the thermal power plant are already in progress with commercial operations projected to commence no later than August 2026. The power plant will operate under the 15-year Agreement with the Brazilian Chamber of Electric Energy Commercialization. In Q1 2024, NFE completed construction and commissioning of both the Barcarena and Santa Catarina “TGS” terminals. Along with the existing 630 MW power plant and 25-year agreement, the Barcarena LNG terminal will now host and supply LNG to more than 2,200 MWs of power capacity owned by NFE, as well as supply natural gas to Norsk Hydro’s Alunorte alumina refinery under a 15-year contract which commenced in Q1 2024. “We are very pleased to announce this EPC Contract and the start of construction for our 1.6 GW power plant in Barcarena. We are grateful to our partners at Mitsubishi Power and Andrade Gutierrez for their swiftness and collaboration in placing this great project into construction and we look forward to finalizing the work over the next 24 months,” said Andrew Dete, Managing Director of New Fortress Energy. “This 1.6 GW power plant is a historic project for Brazil. It will allow for an efficient energy transition and ensure the reliability of the national electrical system. We are proud to participate together with Andrade Gutierrez to design and construct this important project to support NFE’s growth in Brazil,” said Tim Shore, Senior Vice President of LATAM Commercial and Regional Leader for Mitsubishi Power Americas.

(NYSE: LBRT) (“Liberty” or the “Company”) announced today first quarter 2024 financial and operational results. Summary Results and Highlights Revenue of $1.1 billion, flat sequentially Net income1 of $82 million, or $0.48 fully diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) Adjusted EBITDA2 of $245 million, a 3% decrease sequentially Delivered 32% TTM Adjusted Pre-Tax Return on Capital Employed (“ROCE”)3 Distributed $42 million to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends Repurchased and retired 0.9% of shares outstanding during the first quarter, and a cumulative 12.5% of shares outstanding since reinstatement of the repurchase program in July 2022 Record TTM safety performance and operational efficiency Released 2024 Bettering Human Lives report, highlighting the critical need to advance energy systems and Liberty’s leadership role in energy technology advancement. “As we enter the fourth year of what appears to be a durable cycle for North American oil and gas production, consolidation across the energy industry is pushing larger companies to seek technical solutions and expertise to drive value creation. Liberty’s strong first quarter results demonstrate the continued benefits of leading the industry in technology innovation, service quality and investment in talent. Over the last year, the operations teams delivered our highest combined safety performance and average daily pumping efficiency in Liberty’s history,” commented Chris Wright, Chief Executive Officer. “Our 32% Adjusted Pre-Tax Return on Capital Employed for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, represents a continuance of our history of strong returns. I’m proud of the continued outstanding results our team achieved during a period marked by softening industry activity trends.” “We are in a generational shift towards low emissions, capital efficient natural gas fueled technologies. Our comprehensive solution from critical power generation to the CNG fuel supply supports our digiFleet deployments and uniquely serves our customers in their development of oil and gas resources,” continued Mr. Wright. “Furthermore, a growing demand for power from AI-driven data centers and reshoring of industrial and manufacturing activity require reliable sources of energy, which we believe will be best served by domestic natural gas. Liberty Power Innovations (LPI) is well-positioned to benefit from these wider opportunities beyond the oilfield.” “We are focused on generating strong returns and free cash flow. We are pairing investment in profitable growth initiatives that increase our competitive advantage with a robust return of capital program,” continued Mr. Wright. “Since July 2022, we have now distributed $417 million to shareholders through the retirement of 12.5% of shares outstanding and quarterly cash dividends.” Outlook Frac industry dynamics remain constructive, as relatively steady demand in recent months has focused service companies on disciplined pricing and quality of service. Superior performance and reliability drive higher returns for both E&P operators and service companies alike. Liberty’s continual focus on technical innovation in equipment technology and software automation augments our industry leading service offerings while lowering the total delivered cost to the customer, reinforcing our position as the supplier of choice. Global oil and gas commodity prices have diverged and moved materially in recent months. Yet these changes have not materially impacted demand for North American frac services. Oil prices have rallied since early in the year, owing to an improved global economic outlook, ongoing OPEC+ voluntary production cuts, and rising geopolitical tensions. Natural gas prices have conversely declined considerably since last fall, primarily owing to strong production and mild winter weather driving high natural gas inventories. Natural gas prices are likely to strengthen in the future with increasing LNG exports and surging domestic power demand in the years ahead. Global energy demand continues to march higher, supporting a strong North American oil and gas industry in future years. “Our focus is profitable growth through disciplined investment in talent, technology, and equipment that leads the industry in efficiency and emissions. We are confident that our strategic investment in digiFleets and power and fuel supply through LPI better positions us to deliver superior returns over cycles. We are also excited by our latest partnerships in the Australian Beetaloo shale gas basin, which exemplify our continued efforts toward growing reliable energy sources worldwide,” commented Mr. Wright. “In the second quarter, we expect low double-digit sequential growth in revenue on stable pricing and increased efficiency and corresponding improvement in profitability. We continue to expect strong cash flow generation in 2024, supporting our technology transition investments and industry-leading return of capital program,” continued Mr. Wright. Share Repurchase Program On January 23, 2024, the Board increased Liberty’s existing share repurchase authorization announced July 25, 2022 to $750 million, a $250 million increase from the previously authorized and upsized amount. The Board also extended the authorization through July 31, 2026. During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, Liberty repurchased and retired 1,480,084 shares of Class A common stock at an average of $20.36 per share, representing 0.9% of shares outstanding, for approximately $30 million. Liberty has cumulatively repurchased and retired 12.5% of shares outstanding at program commencement on July 25, 2022. Total remaining authorization for future common share repurchases is approximately $392 million. The shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions, through block trades, in privately negotiated transactions, through derivative transactions or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws. The timing, as well as the number and value of shares repurchased under the program, will be determined by the Company at its discretion and will depend on a variety of factors, including management’s assessment of the intrinsic value of the Company’s common stock, the market price of the Company’s common stock, general market and economic conditions, available liquidity, compliance with the Company’s debt and other agreements, applicable legal requirements, and other considerations. The exact number of shares to be repurchased by the Company is not guaranteed, and the program may be suspended, modified, or discontinued at any time without prior notice. The Company expects to fund the repurchases by using cash on hand, borrowings under its revolving credit facility and expected free cash flow to be generated through the authorization period. Cash Dividend During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, Liberty paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share of Class A common stock, or approximately $12 million in aggregate to shareholders. On April 16, 2024, the Board declared a cash dividend of $0.07 per share of Class A common stock, to be paid on June 20, 2024 to holders of record as of June 6, 2024. Future declarations of quarterly cash dividends are subject to approval by the Board of Directors and to the Board’s continuing determination that the declarations of dividends are in the best interests of Liberty and its stockholders. Future dividends may be adjusted at the Board’s discretion based on market conditions and capital availability.

Please see the supplemental financial information in the table under “Reconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA” at the end of this earnings release for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 3 Adjusted Pre-Tax Return on Capital Employed (“ROCE”) is a non-U.S. GAAP operational measure. Please see the supplemental financial information in the table under “Calculation of Adjusted Pre-Tax Return on Capital Employed” at the end of this earnings release for a calculation of this measure. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This earnings release includes unaudited non-GAAP financial and operational measures, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Pre-Tax Return on Capital Employed (“ROCE”). We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial and operational measures provides useful information about our financial performance and results of operations. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted to eliminate the effects of items such as non-cash stock-based compensation, new fleet or new basin start-up costs, fleet lay-down costs, costs of asset acquisitions, gain or loss on the disposal of assets, bad debt reserves, transaction, severance, and other costs, the loss or gain on remeasurement of liability under our tax receivable agreements, the gain on investments, and other non-recurring expenses that management does not consider in assessing ongoing performance. Our board of directors, management, investors, and lenders use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to assess our financial performance because it allows them to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of our capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense), asset base (such as depreciation, depletion, and amortization) and other items that impact the comparability of financial results from period to period. We present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because we believe they provide useful information regarding the factors and trends affecting our business in addition to measures calculated under GAAP. We define ROCE as the ratio of pre-tax net income (adding back income tax and tax receivable agreement impacts) for the three months ended March 31, 2024 to Average Capital Employed. Average Capital Employed is the simple average of total capital employed (both debt and equity) as of March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023. ROCE is presented based on our management’s belief that these non-GAAP measures are useful information to investors when evaluating our profitability and the efficiency with which management has employed capital over time. Our management uses ROCE for that purpose. ROCE is not a measure of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to net income, as defined by U.S. GAAP Non-GAAP financial and operational measures do not have any standardized meaning and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The presentation of non-GAAP financial and operational measures is not intended to be a substitute for, and should not be considered in isolation from, the financial measures reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. See the tables entitled Reconciliation and Calculation of Non-GAAP Financial and Operational Measures for a reconciliation or calculation of the non-GAAP financial or operational measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

(the ""Company,"" ""Old Second,"" ""we,"" ""us,"" and ""our"") (NASDAQ:OSBC), the parent company of Old Second National Bank (the ""Bank""), today announced financial results for the first quarter of 2024. Our net income was $21.3 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2024, compared to net income of $18.2 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2023, and net income of $23.6 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2023. Adjusted net income, a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes certain nonrecurring items, as applicable, was $21.3 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $19.1 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2023, and $23.4 million, or $0.52 per share, for the first quarter of 2023. There were no adjusting items impacting the first quarter of 2024; significant adjusting items impacting the fourth quarter of 2023 results included a $1.2 million litigation reserve related to prior years' overdraft fee compliance. See the discussion entitled ""Non-GAAP Presentations"" below and the tables beginning on page 17 of the full earnings release that provide a reconciliation of each non-GAAP measure to the most comparable GAAP equivalent.Net income increased $3.1 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to the decrease of $4.5 million in provision for credit losses and the $1.8 million increase in noninterest income primarily due to a more favorable mark on the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, which were partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease in net interest and dividend income, a $1.2 million increase in noninterest expense and a $518,000 increase in provision for income taxes. Net income decreased $2.3 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to a decrease in net interest income of $4.3 million year over year driven by contraction in the securities portfolio, as well as higher market rates and increased short-term borrowing. The higher market rates and increased borrowing resulted in a $7.5 million increase to interest expense.Operating ResultsFirst quarter 2024 net income was $21.3 million, reflecting a $3.1 million increase from the fourth quarter 2023, and a decrease of $2.3 million from the first quarter of 2023. Adjusted net income, as defined above, was $21.3 million for the first quarter of 2024, an increase of $2.2 million from adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2023, and a decrease of $2.1 million from adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2023.Net interest and dividend income was $59.8 million for the first quarter of 2024, reflecting a decrease of $1.5 million, or 2.4%, from the fourth quarter of 2023, and a decrease of $4.3 million, or 6.7%, from the first quarter of 2023.We recorded a net provision for credit losses of $3.5 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to a net provision for credit losses of $8.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, and a net provision for credit losses of $3.5 million in the first quarter of 2023.Noninterest income was $10.5 million for the first quarter of 2024, an increase of $1.8 million, or 20.3%, compared to $8.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, and an increase of $3.2 million, or 42.9%, compared to $7.4 million for the first quarter of 2023.Noninterest expense was $38.2 million for the first quarter of 2024, an increase of $1.2 million, or 3.3% compared to $37.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, and an increase of $2.3 million, or 6.5%, compared to $35.9 million for the first quarter of 2023.We had a provision for income tax of $7.2 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared to a provision for income tax of $6.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and a provision of $8.4 million for the first quarter of 2023.

Return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity came in at 1.51% and 17.8%, respectively, and the efficiency ratio remains strong at just over 53% despite seasonally high expenses. The net interest margin is proving to be quite resilient despite volatility in market interest rates and asset quality continues to trend favorably with continuing positive migration and no surprises in the first quarter. Over the year ago quarter, our tangible book value per share has increased by 25% and our common equity Tier 1 ratio now exceeds 12% from under 10% just a year ago. The strength of our balance sheet today, combined with exceptional profitability, provides us the flexibility to continue to invest for growth while evaluating the potential to return capital to stockholders in the near term. In short, balance sheet flexibility, combined with continuing strength in core banking trends, gives me confidence Old Second can deliver another strong year in 2024 for our stockholders, communities and employees. I have never been more excited for the future of Old Second.""Asset Quality & Earning AssetsNonperforming loans, comprised of nonaccrual loans plus loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing, totaled $65.1 million at March 31, 2024, $68.8 million at December 31, 2023, and $64.5 million at March 31, 2023. Nonperforming loans, as a percent of total loans, were 1.6% at March 31, 2024, 1.7% at December 31, 2023, and 1.6% at March 31, 2023. The decrease in the first quarter of 2024 is driven by a partial charge-off of $3.9 million for a commercial real estate-owner occupied loan.Total loans were $3.97 billion at March 31, 2024, reflecting a decrease of $73.5 million compared to December 31, 2023, and a decrease of $33.9 million compared to March 31, 2023. The decrease year over year was largely driven by the declines in commercial and commercial real estate-owner occupied portfolios. Average loans (including loans held-for-sale) for the first quarter of 2024 totaled $4.02 billion, reflecting an increase of $2.9 million from the fourth quarter of 2023 and an increase of $86.9 million from the first quarter of 2023.Available-for-sale securities totaled $1.17 billion at March 31, 2024, compared to $1.19 billion at December 31, 2023, and $1.46 billion at March 31, 2023.

During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, we had security purchases of $15.7 million, security maturities of $2.0 million, paydowns of $30.7 million, and sales of $5.3 million, resulting in net realized gains of $1,000, compared to security purchases of $9.2 million, paydowns of $25.6 million, no sales of securities and $55.9 million of maturities and calls during the quarter ended December 31, 2023, which resulted in net realized losses of $2,000. During the quarter ended March 31, 2023, we had $4.2 million of security purchases, $37.7 million of security paydowns, calls and maturities, and security sales of $66.2 million, which resulted in net realized losses of $1.7 million. We may continue to buy and sell strategically identified securities as opportunities arise.Non-GAAP PresentationsManagement has disclosed in this earnings release certain non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and measure our performance, including the presentation of adjusted net income, net interest income and net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis, and our efficiency ratio calculations on a taxable equivalent basis. The net interest margin fully taxable equivalent is calculated by dividing net interest income on a tax equivalent basis by average earning assets for the period. Consistent with industry practice, management has disclosed the efficiency ratio including and excluding certain items, which is discussed in the noninterest expense presentation on page 7 of the full filing of this release; see the investor relations tab at oldsecond.com for this full release.We consider the use of select non-GAAP financial measures and ratios to be useful for financial and operational decision making and useful in evaluating period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain expenditures or assets that we believe are not indicative of our primary business operating results or by presenting certain metrics on a fully taxable equivalent basis. We believe these measures provide investors with information regarding balance sheet profitability, and we believe that management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, analyzing, and comparing past, present and future periods.These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for GAAP financial measures, and we strongly encourage investors to review the GAAP financial measures included in this earnings release and not to place undue reliance upon any single financial measure. In addition, because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this earnings release with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. The tables beginning on page 17 of the full filing of this release provide a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP equivalent; see the investor relations tab at oldsecond.com for this full release.Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsThis earnings release and statements by our management may contain forward-looking statements within the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The increase in both book value per share and tangible book value per share was primarily due to a $1.3 million decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of equity related to the unrealized loss on available for sale securities and the repurchase of 3,021,498 shares at a total cost of $36.8 million, or $12.18 per share.Statement of Financial ConditionTotal assets decreased $14.4 million, or 1.7%, to $833.2 million at March 31, 2024, from $847.6 million at June 30, 2023, primarily due to a $13.3 million decrease in available for sale and held to maturity investments.

The Company remains focused on maintaining a high-quality investment portfolio that provides a steady stream of cash flows.Net loans increased $714 thousand, or 0.1%, to $478.3 million at March 31, 2024, from $477.5 million at June 30, 2023.

The interest rate environment has created significant pricing competition for deposits within our market.Borrowings increased $31.0 million, or 91.2%, to $65.0 million at March 31, 2024, from $34.0 million at June 30, 2023.

These decreases to stockholders' equity were partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of equity related to the unrealized loss on available for sale securities and $326 thousand of net income during the nine months ended March 31, 2024. Book value per share measured $13.30 as of March 31, 2024 compared to $12.91 as of June 30, 2023, and tangible book value per share(3) measured $12.74 as of March 31, 2024 compared to $12.48 as of June 30, 2023.Net Interest IncomeFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, net interest income was $4.0 million, a decrease of $1.5 million, or 27.5%, from the three months ended March 31, 2023.

The net interest margin measured 2.15% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to 2.84% for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in the net interest margin during the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of borrowings and the rise in interest rates that caused an increase in the cost of borrowings and deposits that exceeded the increase in interest income on loans.For the nine months ended March 31, 2024, net interest income was $13.0 million, a decrease of $4.8 million, or 27.2%, from the nine months ended March 31, 2023.

Negative Domestic passenger traffic decreased by 6.7% YoY. Cargo volume was below March 2019 levels in most countries. Negative impact on traffic in Brazil due to financial and aircraft constraints. Market Research Analyst The latest passenger traffic report from Corporación América Airports S.A. reflects a nuanced recovery trajectory in the aviation sector. While overall passenger numbers in March 2024 saw a modest increase compared to the previous year, the breakdown reveals a mixed performance. The slight year-over-year growth of 0.8% underscores the challenges facing airport operators as they strive to reach pre-pandemic levels—a barometer of the industry's health. The report highlights that while international passenger traffic shows a robust year-over-year improvement of 12.9%, surpassing pre-COVID volumes by 4.7%, domestic passenger counts are lagging, still down 6.7% year-over-year. For investors, these figures suggest a slow but positive momentum in the global travel recovery, with a particular strength in international travel demand. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, Corporación América Airports S.A.'s traffic report signals a cautious optimism for revenue streams reliant on passenger volumes. While the 0.8% increase in total passenger traffic may not seem significant, the consistent international traffic growth and the recovery in key markets like Italy and Uruguay, which have exceeded March 2019 levels, are promising for the company's international operations. However, the 6.3% YoY decrease in cargo volume presents a headwind, potentially impacting cargo revenue. The nuanced recovery, with Argentina and Brazil still facing constraints, indicates variable regional performances that investors should monitor. The company's ability to adapt to these market-specific dynamics while managing cost structures will be important in determining their financial health and stock performance. Aviation Industry Expert The mixed passenger traffic performance by region highlights the uneven recovery in the aviation sector. Notably, the resurgence in international travel, particularly in Italy and Uruguay, showcases the strength of these corridors. However, the stark contrast in Brazil, with a 13.5% decline in passenger traffic, reflects ongoing local challenges such as financial and aircraft constraints on airlines. In addition, the exit of the local airline Equair in Ecuador underscores the volatility and changing dynamics within the industry. Investors should consider these regional discrepancies when assessing the potential growth trajectory of Corporación América Airports S.A. The announcement of new routes and increased frequencies, as witnessed in Uruguay, is positive, but it's imperative to also account for capacity constraints, such as those at the Zvartnots airport in Armenia, which may limit growth potential. 04/17/2024 - 04:31 PM Total passenger traffic up 0.8% YoY, or up 4.0% YoY ex-Natal International passenger traffic 4.7% above pre-pandemic LUXEMBOURG--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Corporación América Airports S.A.

Corporation reported a solid first quarter performance resulting in operating earnings per diluted common share (non-GAAP) of $0.34. A key contributor to our earnings this quarter was a near-record level of non-interest income totaling $88 million as Capital Markets, Wealth Management, Treasury Management and Mortgage Banking produced strong results.

Tangible book value (non-GAAP) grew 11%, year-over-year, reaching an all-time high of $9.64. We also are very pleased with our strong credit results in this environment which is a testament to our risk management culture,"" said F.N.B. Corporation Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Vincent J. Delie, Jr. ""FNB's investments in digital technology and data science continue to be at the center of our desire to gain efficiency and execute on our client acquisition strategy. FNB experienced growth in the number of customers and prospects opening multiple accounts since adding deposit products to our eStore® platform in December 2023, contributing to FNB's year-over-year growth of 6% and 2% for loans and deposits, respectively. FNB's unique digital and data strategies are key to our continued success driving customer expansion and primacy, increasing product penetration and delivering an innovative and comprehensive banking experience for our consumer, wealth management and commercial clients."" First Quarter 2024 Highlights(All comparisons refer to the first quarter of 2023, except as noted) Period-end total loans and leases increased $1.9 billion, or 6.2%. Commercial loans and leases increased $1.0 billion, or 5.3%, and consumer loans increased $873.8 million, or 7.8%. FNB's organic loan growth was driven by the continued success of our strategy to grow high-quality loans and deepen customer relationships across our diverse geographic footprint.On a linked-quarter basis, period-end total loans and leases increased $261.4 million, or 3.3% annualized, with an increase in consumer loans of $208.7 million and commercial loans and leases of $52.6 million.Period-end total deposits increased $545.3 million, or 1.6%. The mix of non-interest-bearing deposits to total deposits equaled 29% at March 31, 2024, compared to 33% at March 31, 2023, and 29% at December 31, 2023, as customers continue to migrate deposits into higher-yielding deposit products.On a linked-quarter basis, period-end total deposits slightly increased $24.5 million, or 0.3% annualized, even with the seasonal outflows during the current quarter.Net interest income totaled $319.0 million, a decrease of $5.0 million, or 1.5%, from the prior quarter, primarily due to one less day in the current quarter as well as higher deposit costs from continued balance migration to higher yielding deposit products and higher total average borrowings, largely offset by higher earning asset yields.On a linked-quarter basis, net interest margin (FTE) (non-GAAP) decreased 3 basis points to 3.18% as a 15 basis point increase in the total yield on earning assets (non-GAAP) to 5.40% was more than offset by a 19 basis point increase in total cost of funds to 2.33%.Non-interest income totaled $87.9 million, benefiting from our diversified business model with strong contributions from Mortgage Banking, Capital Markets and record Wealth Management revenues.The ratio of non-performing loans and other real estate owned (OREO) to total loans and OREO decreased 5 basis points to 0.33%. Total delinquency increased 4 basis points to 0.64%. Both measures continue to remain at or near historically low levels.FDIC insurance expense of $12.7 million included a $4.4 million estimated FDIC special assessment. The special assessment was considered a significant item impacting earnings as it reflected further replenishment of the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund associated with protecting uninsured depositors following the failed banks in early 2023 based on updated loss information from the FDIC.Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) regulatory capital ratio was a record 10.2% (estimated), compared to 10.0% at both March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2023. Tangible book value per common share (non-GAAP) of $9.64 increased $0.98, or 11.3%, compared to March 31, 2023, and $0.17, or 1.8%, compared to December 31, 2023. Accumulated other comprehensive income/loss (AOCI) reduced the tangible book value per common share (non-GAAP) by $0.70 as of March 31, 2024, primarily due to the impact of interest rates on the fair value of available-for-sale (AFS) securities, compared to a reduction of $0.87 as of March 31, 2023, and $0.65 as of December 31, 2023.On February 15, 2024, FNB redeemed all of its outstanding Series E Perpetual Preferred Stock and the final preferred dividend of $2.0 million was paid on the redemption date. The excess of the redemption value over the carrying value on the Series E Perpetual Preferred Stock of $4.0 million was considered a significant item impacting earnings.Non-GAAP measures referenced in this release are used by management to measure performance in operating the business that management believes enhances investors' ability to better understand the underlying business performance and trends related to core business activities.

(2) Estimated for 1Q24. First Quarter 2024 Results – Comparison to Prior-Year Quarter(All comparisons refer to the first quarter of 2023, except as noted) Net interest income totaled $319.0 million, a decrease of $17.6 million, or 5.2%, primarily due to higher deposit costs, including migration to higher yielding deposit products, as well as higher total average borrowings, partially offset by growth in earning assets and higher earning asset yields. Total average earning assets increased $2.0 billion, or 5.3%, driven by a $2.0 billion increase in average loans and leases from organic origination activity. Total average borrowings increased $1.8 billion due to maintaining additional liquidity on the balance sheet following the banking industry disruption in 2023 and in a continued effort to support strong loan growth. The net interest margin (FTE) (non-GAAP) decreased 38 basis points to 3.18%. The yield on earning assets (non-GAAP) increased 72 basis points to 5.40%, primarily due to higher yields on loans, investment securities and interest-bearing deposits with banks reflecting the higher interest rate environment. Total cost of funds increased 115 basis points to 2.33% with a 132 basis point increase in interest-bearing deposit costs to 2.82%, as well as an increase of 28 basis points in long-term debt costs which include the impact of additional liquidity following the banking industry disruption in 2023. Total cumulative spot deposit beta since the current interest rate increases began in March of 2022 equaled 36% at March 31, 2024. Average loans and leases totaled $32.4 billion, an increase of $2.0 billion, or 6.5%, including growth of $1.1 billion in commercial loans and leases and $0.9 billion in consumer loans. Commercial real estate led the average commercial growth with an increase of $755.1 million, or 6.6%, primarily due to funding on existing construction projects. Commercial and industrial loans increased $225.3 million, or 3.1%, and commercial leases increased $124.3 million, or 23.3%. The increase in average commercial loans and leases was driven by organic growth across the footprint, particularly in the Pittsburgh, Charlotte, Cleveland and Raleigh markets. The increase in average consumer loans included a $1.3 billion increase in residential mortgages that largely reflected the adjustable-rate mortgages retained on the balance sheet, reflecting the continued success of the Physicians First mortgage program. This was partially offset by a decrease in indirect auto loans of $401.8 million reflecting the sale of $332 million of indirect auto loans that closed in the first quarter of 2024. Average deposits totaled $34.2 billion, consistent with the prior-year quarter. The growth in average time deposits of $2.1 billion offset the decline in average non-interest-bearing demand deposits of $1.5 billion and average savings deposits of $611.7 million as customers continued to migrate balances into higher-yielding products. The funding mix has slightly shifted compared to the year-ago quarter with non-interest-bearing deposits comprising 29% of total deposits at March 31, 2024, compared to 33% a year ago. Non-interest income totaled $87.9 million, a 10.7% increase compared to $79.4 million in the first quarter of 2023. Mortgage Banking operations income increased $3.1 million, driven by improved gain on sale from strong production volumes. Wealth Management revenues were at record levels and increased $1.6 million, or 8.8%, as securities commissions and fees and trust income increased 10.5% and 7.7%, respectively, through continued strong contributions across the geographic footprint. Dividends on non-marketable equity securities increased $2.1 million, reflecting higher FHLB dividends due to additional borrowings. Insurance commissions and fees decreased $1.0 million, or 13.3%, with lower contingent revenues compared to the year-ago quarter. Non-interest expense totaled $237.1 million, increasing $17.2 million, or 7.8%. When adjusting for $3.0 million1 of significant items in the first quarter of 2024 and $2.1 million2 in the first quarter of 2023, operating non-interest expense (non-GAAP) totaled $234.1 million, an increase of $16.2 million, or 7.5%. Salaries and benefits increased $8.9 million, or 7.4%, primarily from normal annual merit increases and higher production-related commissions from strong non-interest income activity. Net occupancy and equipment increased $3.9 million, or 10.0%, largely from technology-related investments. Outside services increased $3.5 million, or 18.0%, with higher volume-related technology and third-party costs. The ratio of non-performing loans and OREO to total loans and OREO decreased 5 basis points to 0.33%. Total delinquency increased 4 basis points to 0.64%, compared to 0.60% at March 31, 2023. Both measures continue to remain at or near historically low levels. The provision for credit losses was $13.9 million, compared to $14.1 million in the first quarter of 2023. The first quarter of 2024 reflected net charge-offs of $12.8 million, or 0.16% annualized of total average loans, compared to $13.2 million, or 0.18% annualized. The allowance for credit losses (ACL) was $406.3 million, an increase of $2.9 million, with the ratio of the ACL to total loans and leases decreasing 7 basis points to 1.25% reflecting net loan growth and charge-off activity. The effective tax rate was 21.5%, compared to 19.5% in the first quarter of 2023, due to lower stock compensation vesting deductions and higher levels of proportional amortization on certain tax credit investments. The CET1 regulatory capital ratio was 10.2% (estimated) at March 31, 2024, and 10.0% at March 31, 2023. Tangible book value per common share (non-GAAP) was $9.64 at March 31, 2024, an increase of $0.98, or 11.3%, from $8.66 at March 31, 2023. AOCI reduced the current quarter tangible book value per common share (non-GAAP) by $0.70, compared to a reduction of $0.87 at the end of the year-ago quarter. On February 15, 2024, FNB redeemed all of its outstanding Series E Perpetual Preferred Stock. 1 First quarter 2024 non-interest expense significant items of $3.0 million included $1.2 million (pre-tax) of branch consolidation costs and $4.4 million (pre-tax) of FDIC special assessment, partially offset by a ($2.6 million) (pre-tax) reduction to the previously estimated loss on the indirect auto loan sale. 2 First quarter 2023 non-interest expense significant items included $2.1 million (pre-tax) of merger expenses. First Quarter 2024 Results – Comparison to Prior Quarter(All comparisons refer to the fourth quarter of 2023, except as noted) Net interest income totaled $319.0 million, a decrease of $5.0 million, or 1.5%, from the prior quarter total of $324.0 million, primarily due to one less day in the quarter, higher deposit costs and continued migration to higher yielding deposit products, largely offset by higher earning asset yields. The total yield on earning assets (non-GAAP) increased 15 basis points to 5.40% due to higher yields on both loans and investment securities. The total cost of funds increased 19 basis points to 2.33%, as the cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 17 basis points to 2.82% and the total cost of borrowings increased 30 basis points to 4.87%. The resulting net interest margin (FTE) (non-GAAP) decreased 3 basis points to 3.18%. Average loans and leases totaled $32.4 billion, an increase of $113.4 million, or 1.4% annualized, as commercial loans and leases increased $253.8 million, or 5.0% annualized, offsetting the decrease in consumer loans of $140.4 million, or 4.7% annualized. The increase in average commercial loans and leases was led by growth of $303.2 million, or 10.2%, in commercial real estate loans which more than offset a decrease of $57.7 million, or 3.1%, in commercial and industrial loans. The organic quarterly growth in commercial loans and leases was led by the Raleigh, South Carolina and Cleveland markets. For consumer lending, average residential mortgages increased $216.2 million, driven by growth in adjustable-rate mortgages which was more than offset by indirect auto loans decreasing $328.4 million due to the impact of the sale of $332 million of indirect auto loans that closed in the first quarter of 2024. Average deposits totaled $34.2 billion, decreasing $220.5 million, or 2.6% annualized, due to the seasonal outflows of deposits in the first half of the quarter. Average certificates of deposits increased $499.9 million which were offset by declines in non-interest-bearing deposits of $483.9 million, savings balances of $119.7 million and interest-bearing deposits of $116.9 million, resulting from customers' preferences for higher-yielding deposit products. On a spot basis, total deposit balances increased slightly from the prior quarter. The mix of non-interest-bearing deposits to total deposits was 29% at March 31, 2024, flat compared to the prior quarter. The loan-to-deposit ratio was 93.8% at March 31, 2024, relatively stable compared to 93.1%. Non-interest income totaled $87.9 million, compared to $13.1 million in the prior quarter. On an operating basis (non-GAAP), the first quarter of 2024 non-interest income increased $7.4 million, or 9.2%, when adjusting for the $67.4 million realized loss (pre-tax) on the investment securities restructuring in the prior quarter. Insurance commissions and fees increased $2.5 million, or 58.0%, largely driven by seasonal contingent revenues. Wealth Management revenues totaled $19.6 million, an increase of $2.1 million, or 12.0%, with record revenues in both trust income of $11.4 million and securities commissions and fees of $8.2 million. Non-interest expense totaled $237.1 million compared to $265.6 million in the prior quarter. When adjusting for significant items of $3.0 million3 in the first quarter of 2024 and $46.6 million4 in the fourth quarter of 2023, non-interest expense increased $15.2 million, or 6.9%, on an operating basis (non-GAAP). Salaries and employee benefits increased $15.0 million, primarily related to normal seasonal long-term compensation expense of $6.9 million in the first quarter of 2024 as well as seasonally higher employer-paid payroll taxes which increased $4.6 million linked-quarter and reduced salary deferrals given lower loan origination volumes. Bank shares and franchise taxes increased $2.5 million due to the timing of charitable contributions that qualified for Pennsylvania bank shares tax credits in the prior quarter. Marketing expenses increased $1.2 million, or 27.7%, due to the timing of marketing campaigns. The ratio of non-performing loans and OREO to total loans and OREO decreased 1 basis point to 0.33% and delinquency decreased 6 basis points to 0.64%. Both measures continue to remain at or near historically low levels. The provision for credit losses was $13.9 million, compared to $13.2 million. The first quarter of 2024 reflected net charge-offs of $12.8 million, or 0.16% annualized of total average loans, compared to $8.2 million, or 0.10% annualized. The ACL was $406.3 million, an increase of $0.7 million, with the ratio of the ACL to total loans and leases totaling 1.25% at both March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023. The effective tax rate was 21.5%, compared to 13.1%, with the prior quarter having lower than statutory rates due to renewable energy investment tax credit benefits as part of a solar project financing transaction that closed in 2023. The prior quarter was also impacted by lower pre-tax income levels given the significant items.4 The CET1 regulatory capital ratio was 10.2% (estimated), an increase from 10.0% at December 31, 2023. Tangible book value per common share (non-GAAP) was $9.64 at March 31, 2024, an increase of $0.17 per share. AOCI reduced the current quarter-end tangible book value per common share (non-GAAP) by $0.70 compared to a reduction of $0.65 at the end of the prior quarter. 3 First quarter 2024 non-interest expense significant items of $3.0 million included $1.2 million (pre-tax) of branch consolidation costs and $4.4 million (pre-tax) of FDIC special assessment, partially offset by a ($2.6 million) (pre-tax) reduction to the previously estimated loss on the indirect auto loan sale. 4 Fourth quarter 2023 non-interest expense significant items included $29.9 million (pre-tax) of FDIC special assessment and $16.7 million (pre-tax) estimated loss on the indirect auto loan sale. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance IndicatorsTo supplement our Consolidated Financial Statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as operating net income available to common stockholders, operating earnings per diluted common share, return on average tangible equity, return on average tangible common equity, operating return on average tangible common equity, return on average tangible assets, tangible book value per common share, the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets, pre-provision net revenue (reported), operating pre-provision net revenue, operating non-interest expense, efficiency ratio, and net interest margin (FTE) to provide information useful to investors in understanding our operating performance and trends, and to facilitate comparisons with the performance of our peers. Management uses these measures internally to assess and better understand our underlying business performance and trends related to core business activities. The non-GAAP financial measures and key performance indicators we use may differ from the non-GAAP financial measures and key performance indicators other financial institutions use to assess their performance and trends. These non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplemental in nature, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. When non-GAAP financial measures are disclosed, the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Regulation G requires: (i) the presentation of the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and (ii) a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure presented and the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of non-GAAP operating measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included later in this release under the heading ""Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Indicators to GAAP."" Management believes items such as merger expenses, FDIC special assessment, realized loss on securities restructuring, loss on indirect auto loan sale, preferred deemed dividend at redemption and branch consolidation costs are not organic to run our operations and facilities. These items are considered significant items impacting earnings as they are deemed to be outside of ordinary banking activities. These costs are specific to each individual transaction and may vary significantly based on the size and complexity of the transaction. To facilitate peer comparisons of net interest margin and efficiency ratio, we use net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets (loans and investments) to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments (this adjustment is not permitted under GAAP). Taxable-equivalent amounts for the 2024 and 2023 periods were calculated using a federal statutory income tax rate of 21%.

Wintrust Financial reportó un ingreso neto récord para el primer trimestre de 2024 de $187.3 millones, con ganancias diluidas por acción aumentadas en un 55% en comparación con el trimestre anterior. Los préstamos totales y los depósitos aumentaron aproximadamente en $1.1 mil millones cada uno, mientras que los activos totales aumentaron en $1.3 mil millones. El margen de interés neto disminuyó ligeramente a 3.57%, con ingresos por intereses netos de $464.2 millones. Los ingresos no derivados de intereses fueron impactados por las ganancias de la venta de la división de Asesores de Beneficios de Jubilación y ajustes de valoración netos favorables. Sin embargo, los gastos no interesantes se vieron afectados por una provisión para evaluaciones especiales de la FDIC. La provisión para pérdidas crediticias disminuyó y las métricas de crédito permanecieron estables. En general, Wintrust Financial tuvo un trimestre fuerte con un momentum positivo y un enfoque en el valor a largo plazo. 윈트러스트 파이낸셜이 2024년 첫 분기에 1억 8730만 달러의 사상 최대 순이익을 기록했으며, 전 분기 대비 주당 수익이 55% 증가했습니다. 총 대출과 예금은 각각 약 11억 달러 증가했고, 총 자산은 13억 달러 증가했습니다. 순이자 마진은 소폭 감소하여 3.57%를 기록했으며, 순이자 수익은 4억 6420만 달러였습니다. 비이자 수익은 은퇴 혜택 고문 부문의 매각 이익과 유리한 순평가 조정에 영향을 받았습니다. 그러나 비이자 비용은 FDIC 특별 평가에 대한 충당금으로 인해 영향을 받았습니다. 신용 손실 충당금은 감소했으며 신용 지표는 안정적으로 유지되었습니다. 전반적으로 윈트러스트 파이낸셜은 긍정적인 모멘텀과 장기 가치에 중점을 둔 강력한 분기를 보냈습니다. Wintrust Financial a rapporté un bénéfice net record pour le premier trimestre de 2024 de 187,3 millions de dollars, avec des bénéfices dilués par action en hausse de 55 % par rapport au trimestre précédent. Les prêts totaux et les dépôts ont augmenté d'environ 1,1 milliard de dollars chacun, tandis que les actifs totaux ont augmenté de 1,3 milliard de dollars. La marge d'intérêt nette a légèrement diminué à 3,57 %, avec des revenus d'intérêts nets de 464,2 millions de dollars. Les revenus non liés aux intérêts ont été impactés par les gains de la vente de la division Retirement Benefits Advisors et par des ajustements de valorisation nets favorables. Cependant, les dépenses non liées aux intérêts ont été affectées par une provision pour des évaluations spéciales de la FDIC. La provision pour pertes sur crédits a diminué et les indicateurs de crédit sont restés stables. Dans l'ensemble, Wintrust Financial a connu un trimestre solide avec un élan positif et un accent sur la valeur à long terme. Wintrust Financial meldete für das erste Quartal 2024 einen Rekordnettogewinn von 187,3 Millionen Dollar, mit einem Anstieg der verwässerten Gewinn je Aktie um 55% im Vergleich zum Vorquartal. Die Gesamtkredite und Einlagen stiegen jeweils um etwa 1,1 Milliarden Dollar, während die Gesamtaktiva um 1,3 Milliarden Dollar zunahmen. Die Nettozinsmarge sank leicht auf 3,57%, mit einem Nettozinsertrag von 464,2 Millionen Dollar. Das nichtzinsabhängige Einkommen wurde durch Gewinne aus dem Verkauf der Retirement Benefits Advisors Division und günstige Netto-Bewertungsanpassungen beeinflusst. Allerdings wurden die nichtzinsabhängigen Ausgaben durch eine Rückstellung für besondere FDIC-Bewertungen beeinträchtigt. Die Vorsorge für Kreditverluste sank und die Kreditkennzahlen blieben stabil. Insgesamt hatte Wintrust Financial ein starkes Quartal mit positivem Schwung und einem Fokus auf langfristigen Wert. Positive Record first-quarter 2024 net income of $187.3 million Diluted earnings per share increased by 55% compared to the previous quarter Total loans and deposits increased by approximately $1.1 billion each Total assets increased by $1.3 billion Net interest margin decreased slightly to 3.57% Net interest income at $464.2 million Non-interest income impacted by gains from the sale of Retirement Benefits Advisors division and favorable net valuation adjustments Non-interest expenses affected by an accrual for FDIC special assessments Provision for credit losses decreased Credit metrics remained steady Strong quarter with positive momentum and focus on long-term value Negative None. Financial Analyst Wintrust Financial Corporation's Q1 report highlights a robust performance with a substantial 55% increase in diluted earnings per share over the previous quarter, signifying a strong upward trajectory for the firm. This level of earnings growth is noteworthy and likely to attract investor attention. The reported 10% annualized loan growth indicates aggressive expansion in lending activities, which could signal a bullish outlook for future revenue streams if such growth is sustainable and not accompanied by a proportional increase in default rates.Despite favorable growth metrics, investors should note the decline in net interest margin and net interest income, a key revenue source for banks. This contraction, although slight, could be indicative of narrowing profitability in the core business of interest-based earnings, potentially due to competitive pressures or shifts in deposit accounts. Furthermore, the provision for credit losses has significantly decreased from the last quarter, which could suggest either an improved credit environment or a conservative approach to potential losses. However, the increase in net charge-offs warrants scrutiny, as it could impact future provisions and capital requirements. Market Research Analyst Wintrust's strategic focus on maintaining consistent credit standards while managing expenses suggests proactive governance amidst a challenging banking environment marked by recent bank failures. The increase in total assets by 9% solidifies the company's market position. A noteworthy aspect is the sale of the Retirement Benefits Advisors division, which led to non-interest income gains. This divestiture could be a strategic move to streamline operations and reallocate resources towards more profitable avenues.Wintrust's emphasis on franchise value and diversified revenue sources, such as mortgage banking and wealth management, demonstrates a multifaceted approach to revenue generation. However, the impact of the FDIC special assessment signals broader industry headwinds that investors should monitor, as regulatory costs can materially affect future earnings. Keeping an eye on non-performing loans, which have seen a slight uptick, will be essential for evaluating the health of the loan portfolio and judging the adequacy of reserves against potential losses. 04/17/2024 - 04:20 PM ROSEMONT, Ill., April 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Wintrust Financial Corporation (“Wintrust”, “the Company”, “we” or “our”) (Nasdaq: WTFC) announced record quarterly net income of $187.3 million or $2.89 per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2024, an increase in diluted earnings per common share of 55% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Pre-tax, pre-provision income (non-GAAP) totaled a record $271.6 million, up 30% as compared to $208.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Timothy S. Crane, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Following record net income in 2023, we continued our momentum with strong results to start 2024. We leveraged our balanced, multi-faceted business model and position as Chicago’s and Wisconsin’s bank to grow deposits and loans while maintaining our consistent credit standards coupled with expense management.” Additionally, Mr. Crane noted, “The first quarter exhibited funding strong loan growth with competitively-priced deposits in accordance with the increased loan demand. Increasing our long-term franchise value and net interest income remains our focus as we consider opportunities in the markets we serve.” Highlights of the first quarter of 2024:Comparative information to the fourth quarter of 2023, unless otherwise noted Total loans increased by approximately $1.1 billion, or 10% annualized.Total deposits increased by approximately $1.1 billion, or 9% annualized.Total assets increased by $1.3 billion, or 9% annualized.Net interest margin decreased by five basis points to 3.57% (3.59% on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, non-GAAP) during the first quarter of 2024. Net interest income decreased to $464.2 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $470.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily due to one less day in the first quarter of 2024. Non-interest income was impacted by the following: Gains of approximately $20.0 million from the sale of the Company’s Retirement Benefits Advisors (“RBA”) division. This gain was partially offset by additional commissions and incentive compensation totaling $701,000 related to the sale transaction.Favorable net valuation adjustments related to certain mortgage assets totaled $2.3 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to unfavorable net valuation adjustments of $9.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Non-interest expense was negatively impacted by an accrual of $5.2 million for estimated amounts owed as a result of the FDIC special assessment on uninsured deposits in response to certain bank failures occurring in 2023. This is in addition to the related $34.4 million accrued in the fourth quarter of 2023 for the estimate of such FDIC special assessments.Provision for credit losses totaled $21.7 million in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to a provision for credit losses of $42.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2023.Net charge-offs totaled $21.8 million, or 21 basis points of average total loans on an annualized basis, in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to $14.9 million, or 14 basis points of average total loans on an annualized basis in the fourth quarter of 2023. Mr. Crane noted, “Our net interest margin for the first quarter stayed within our expected range, decreasing by five basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. The decrease in net interest margin was due primarily to certain seasonal declines in non-interest bearing deposit balances, deposit migration to interest-bearing products and competitive deposit pricing to fund quality loan growth. Loan growth during the first quarter totaled $1.1 billion, or 10% on an annualized basis. We are pleased with our diversified loan growth in the first quarter with strong loan origination activity in commercial and residential real estate portfolios, as well as growth in commercial real estate driven primarily by draws on existing loan facilities. Deposit growth in the first quarter of 2024 was utilized to fund our robust loan growth as deposits increased by approximately $1.1 billion, or 9% on an annualized basis. We continue to leverage our customer relationships and market positioning to generate deposits and build long term franchise value. Non-interest bearing deposits decreased due to seasonality during the first quarter while also experiencing some migration to interest-bearing products. Despite the slightly lower net interest income during the current period, we generated record quarterly net revenue through our diversified sources of revenue, including our mortgage banking and wealth management businesses.” Commenting on credit quality, Mr. Crane stated, “Credit metrics have remained steady, aligning with historical averages. Net charge-offs totaled $21.8 million, or 21 basis points of average total loans on an annualized basis, in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to $14.9 million, or 14 basis points of average total loans on an annualized basis, in the fourth quarter of 2023. Approximately $11.9 million of charge-offs in the current quarter were previously reserved for in the fourth quarter of 2023 Non-performing loans totaled $148.4 million, or 0.34% of total loans, at the end of the first quarter of 2024 compared to $139.0 million, or 0.33% of total loans, at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. We continue to conservatively and proactively review credit and maintain our consistently strong credit standards. The allowance for credit losses on our core loan portfolio as of March 31, 2024 was approximately 1.51% of the outstanding balance (see Table 11 for additional information). We believe that the Company’s reserves remain appropriate and we remain diligent in our review of credit.” Mr. Crane added, “Late loan growth in the first quarter creates positive revenue momentum moving forward as period-end loan balances exceeded averages. We continue to see good opportunities in the markets we serve and feel well positioned to grow deposit and loan relationships in future quarters. Our focus remains on winning business and maximizing long term franchise value.” In summary, Mr. Crane noted, “The quarter was strong, momentum remains good and we are excited about the agreement reached to acquire Macatawa Bank Corporation in Michigan (announced April 15, 2024). The ability to expand with a high quality bank with a strong low-cost core deposit base, excess liquidity, exceptional asset quality and a committed management team is a terrific fit for Wintrust.” The graphs below illustrate certain financial highlights of the first quarter of 2024 as well as historical financial performance.

Total loans increased by $1.1 billion as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase in loans was the result of diversified loan growth primarily across the commercial and residential real estate portfolios coupled with draws on existing commercial real-estate loan facilities. Total liabilities increased by $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily due to a $1.1 billion increase in total deposits. Non-interest bearing deposits as a percentage of total deposits was 21% at March 31, 2024 compared to 23% at December 31, 2023. The Company's loans to deposits ratio ended the quarter at 93.1%. For more information regarding changes in the Company’s balance sheet, see Consolidated Statements of Condition and Table 1 through Table 3 in this report. NET INTEREST INCOME For the first quarter of 2024, net interest income totaled $464.2 million, a decrease of $5.8 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. The $5.8 million decrease in net interest income in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 was primarily due to one less day during the period as well as a five basis point decrease in the net interest margin, partially offset by a $755.8 million increase in average earning assets. Net interest margin was 3.57% (3.59% on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, non-GAAP) during the first quarter of 2024 compared to 3.62% (3.64% on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, non-GAAP) during the fourth quarter of 2023. The net interest margin decrease as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 was primarily due to a 15 basis point increase in the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. This decrease was partially offset by a nine basis point increase in yield on earning assets and a one basis point increase in the net free funds contribution. The 15 basis point increase on the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 was primarily due to a 16 basis point increase in the rate paid on interest-bearing deposits. The nine basis point increase in the yield on earning assets in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 was primarily due to an 11 basis point expansion on loan yields. For more information regarding net interest income, see Table 4 through Table 7 in this report. ASSET QUALITY The allowance for credit losses totaled $427.5 million as of March 31, 2024, relatively unchanged compared to $427.6 million as of December 31, 2023. A provision for credit losses totaling $21.7 million was recorded for the first quarter of 2024 as compared to $42.9 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023. For more information regarding the allowance for credit losses and provision for credit losses, see Table 10 in this report. Management believes the allowance for credit losses is appropriate to account for expected credit losses. The Current Expected Credit Losses accounting standard requires the Company to estimate expected credit losses over the life of the Company’s financial assets as of the reporting date. There can be no assurances, however, that future losses will not significantly exceed the amounts provided for, thereby affecting future results of operations. A summary of the allowance for credit losses calculated for the loan components in each portfolio as of March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023 is shown on Table 11 of this report. Net charge-offs totaled $21.8 million in the first quarter of 2024, as compared to $14.9 million of net charge-offs in the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase in net charge-offs during the first quarter of 2024 was primarily the result of increased net charge-offs within the commercial portfolio. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average total loans were 21 basis points in the first quarter of 2024 on an annualized basis compared to 14 basis points on an annualized basis in the fourth quarter of 2023. For more information regarding net charge-offs, see Table 9 in this report. The Company’s delinquency rates remain low and manageable. For more information regarding past due loans, see Table 12 in this report. Non-performing assets totaled $162.9 million and comprised 0.28% of total assets as of March 31, 2024, as compared to $152.3 million as of December 31, 2023. Non-performing loans totaled $148.4 million, or 0.34% of total loans, at March 31, 2024. The increase in the first quarter of 2024 was primarily due to an increase in certain credits within the commercial real estate portfolio becoming nonaccrual as well as increases within the property and casualty insurance premium finance receivables portfolio, partially offset by a decrease within the commercial portfolio. For more information regarding non-performing assets, see Table 13 in this report. Though these credit metrics increased during the period, net charge-offs as a percentage of average total loans and non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans remained at historically low levels in the first quarter of 2024. NON-INTEREST INCOME Wealth management revenue increased by $1.5 million in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily due to increased asset management fees from higher assets under management during the period. Wealth management revenue is comprised of the trust and asset management revenue of The Chicago Trust Company and Great Lakes Advisors, the brokerage commissions, managed money fees and insurance product commissions at Wintrust Investments and fees from tax-deferred like-kind exchange services provided by the Chicago Deferred Exchange Company. Mortgage banking revenue increased by $20.2 million in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily due to a $5.0 million favorable valuation adjustment to the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, net of servicing hedge, in the first quarter of 2024 compared to a $16.1 million unfavorable adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2023, as well as $6.6 million higher in production revenue. This was partially offset by an unfavorable adjustment to the Company’s held-for-sale portfolio of early buy-out exercised loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, which are held at fair value, of $2.2 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to a $4.9 million favorable adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2023. The Company monitors the relationship of these assets and seeks to minimize the earnings impact of fair value changes. The Company recognized $1.3 million in net gains on investment securities in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to $2.5 million in net gains in the fourth quarter of 2023. The change from period to period was primarily the result of lower unrealized gains on the Company’s equity investment securities with a readily determinable fair value, partially offset by higher realized gains from the liquidation of an equity investment security without a readily determinable fair value in the first quarter of 2024. Fluctuations in trading gains and losses in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 were primarily the result of fair value adjustments related to interest rate derivatives not designated as hedges. Other income increased by $17.6 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily due to a $20.0 million gain recognized related to the sale of the Company’s RBA division within its wealth management business. This was partially offset by an unfavorable adjustment to the Company’s held-for-investment portfolio of early buy-out exercised loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, which are held at fair value, of $2.1 million when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, as well as lower interest rate swap fees and unfavorable foreign currency remeasurement adjustments. For more information regarding non-interest income, see Table 14 in this report. NON-INTEREST EXPENSE Salaries and employee benefits expense increased by $1.2 million in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. The $1.2 million increase is primarily related to higher commissions from increased mortgage production as well as commissions related to the sale of the Company’s RBA division within its wealth management business in the first quarter of 2024. This was partially offset by lower employee benefits as employee insurance decreased in the first quarter of 2024. Advertising and marketing expenses in the first quarter of 2024 totaled $13.0 million, which is a $4.1 million decrease as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily due to a decrease in digital advertising and sponsorships. FDIC insurance, including amounts accrued for estimated special assessments, decreased $29.1 million in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. This was primarily the result of a lower accrual recognized in the first quarter of 2024 for estimated amounts owed as a result of the FDIC special assessment on uninsured deposits in response to certain bank failures occurring in 2023. The Company recognized $5.2 million in the first quarter of 2024 for such special assessment compared to $34.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. The Company recorded OREO expense of $392,000 in the first quarter of 2024, compared to net OREO income of $1.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 related to realized gains on sales of OREO. For more information regarding non-interest expense, see Table 15 in this report. INCOME TAXES The Company recorded income tax expense of $62.7 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $41.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. The effective tax rates were 25.07% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to 25.27% in the fourth quarter of 2023. The effective tax rates were partially impacted by the tax effects related to share-based compensation which fluctuate based on the Company’s stock price and timing of employee stock option exercises and vesting of other share-based awards. The Company recorded net excess tax benefits of $4.4 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to net excess tax benefits of $53,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023 related to share-based compensation. The effective tax rates were also partially impacted due to an overall lower level of pre-tax net income in the comparable periods, primarily due to the accrual for the estimated amount owed as a result of the FDIC special assessment on uninsured deposits. The Company recorded an estimated FDIC special assessment accrual of $5.2 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to a $34.4 million accrual in the fourth quarter of 2023. BUSINESS UNIT SUMMARY Community Banking Through its community banking unit, the Company provides banking and financial services primarily to individuals, small to mid-sized businesses, local governmental units and institutional clients residing primarily in the local areas the Company services. In the first quarter of 2024, the community banking unit expanded its commercial, commercial real estate and residential real estate loan portfolios. Mortgage banking revenue was $27.7 million for the first quarter of 2024, an increase of $20.2 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily due to a $5.0 million favorable valuation adjustment to the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, net of servicing hedge, in the first quarter of 2024 compared to a $16.1 million unfavorable adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2023, as well as $6.6 million higher in production revenue. This was partially offset by an unfavorable adjustment to the Company’s held-for-sale portfolio of early buy-out exercised loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, which are held at fair value, of $2.2 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to a $4.9 million favorable adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2023. Service charges on deposit accounts totaled $14.8 million in the first quarter of 2024, which was relatively stable compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. The Company’s gross commercial and commercial real estate loan pipelines remained solid as of March 31, 2024 indicating momentum for expected continued loan growth in the second quarter of 2024. Specialty Finance Through its specialty finance unit, the Company offers financing of insurance premiums for businesses and individuals, equipment financing through structured loans and lease products to customers in a variety of industries, accounts receivable financing and value-added, out-sourced administrative services and other services. Originations within the insurance premium financing receivables portfolios were $4.6 billion during the first quarter of 2024 and average balances increased by $12.5 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. The Company’s leasing portfolio balance increased in the first quarter of 2024, with its portfolio of assets, including capital leases, loans and equipment on operating leases, totaling $3.6 billion as of March 31, 2024 as compared to $3.4 billion as of December 31, 2023. Revenues from the Company’s out-sourced administrative services business were $1.2 million in the first quarter of 2024, which was relatively stable compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Wealth Management Through four separate subsidiaries within its wealth management unit, the Company offers a full range of wealth management services, including trust and investment services, tax-deferred like-kind exchange services, asset management, and securities brokerage services. See “Items Impacting Comparative Results,” regarding the sale of the RBA division during the first quarter of 2024. Wealth management revenue totaled $34.8 million in the first quarter of 2024, increasing $1.5 million in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily due to increased asset management fees from higher assets under management during the period. At March 31, 2024, the Company’s wealth management subsidiaries had approximately $48.7 billion of assets under administration, which included $8.8 billion of assets owned by the Company and its subsidiary banks, representing an increase from the $47.1 billion of assets under administration at December 31, 2023. ITEMS IMPACTING COMPARATIVE FINANCIAL RESULTS Division Sale In the first quarter of 2024, the Company sold its RBA division and recorded a gain of approximately $20.0 million in other non-interest income from the sale. Business Combination On April 3, 2023, the Company completed its acquisition of Rothschild & Co Asset Management US Inc. and Rothschild & Co Risk Based Investments LLC from Rothschild & Co North America Inc. As the transaction was determined to be a business combination, the Company recorded goodwill of approximately $2.6 million on the purchase.

A lower ratio indicates a higher degree of efficiency.(5) Excludes mortgage loans held-for-sale. Certain returns, yields, performance ratios, or quarterly growth rates are “annualized” in this presentation to represent an annual time period. This is done for analytical purposes to better discern, for decision-making purposes, underlying performance trends when compared to full-year or year-over-year amounts. For example, a 5% growth rate for a quarter would represent an annualized 20% growth rate.

The estimated contribution to net interest margin from net free funds is calculated using the rate paid for total interest-bearing liabilities. TABLE 7: INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY As an ongoing part of its financial strategy, the Company attempts to manage the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income. Management measures its exposure to changes in interest rates by modeling many different interest rate scenarios. The following interest rate scenarios display the percentage change in net interest income over a one-year time horizon assuming increases and decreases of 100 and 200 basis points. The Static Shock Scenario results incorporate actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for balance sheet instruments following an instantaneous, parallel change in market rates based upon a static (i.e. no growth or constant) balance sheet. Conversely, the Ramp Scenario results incorporate management’s projections of future volume and pricing of each of the product lines following a gradual, parallel change in market rates over twelve months. Actual results may differ from these simulated results due to timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies. The interest rate sensitivity for both the Static Shock and Ramp Scenario is as follows: Static Shock Scenario +200 Basis Points +100 Basis Points -100 Basis Points -200 Basis PointsMar 31, 2024 1.9% 1.4% 1.5% 1.6%Dec 31, 2023 2.6 1.8 0.4 (0.7)Sep 30, 2023 3.3 1.9 (2.0) (5.2)Jun 30, 2023 5.7 2.9 (2.9) (7.9)Mar 31, 2023 4.2 2.4 (2.4) (7.3) Ramp Scenario+200 Basis Points +100 Basis Points -100 Basis Points -200 Basis PointsMar 31, 20240.8% 0.6% 1.3% 2.0%Dec 31, 20231.6 1.2 (0.3) (1.5)Sep 30, 20231.7 1.2 (0.5) (2.4)Jun 30, 20232.9 1.8 (0.9) (3.4)Mar 31, 20233.0 1.7 (1.3) (3.4) As shown above, the magnitude of potential changes in net interest income in various interest rate scenarios has continued to diminish. Given the recent unprecedented rise in interest rates, the Company has made a conscious effort to reposition its exposure to changing interest rates given the uncertainty of the future interest rate environment. To this end, management has executed various derivative instruments including collars and receive fixed swaps to hedge variable rate loan exposures and originated a higher percentage of its loan originations in longer term fixed rate loans. The Company will continue to monitor current and projected interest rates and may execute additional derivatives to mitigate potential fluctuations in the net interest margin in future years.

TABLE 16: SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES/RATIOS The accounting and reporting policies of Wintrust conform to generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States and prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios are used by management to evaluate and measure the Company’s performance. These include taxable-equivalent net interest income (including its individual components), taxable-equivalent net interest margin (including its individual components), the taxable-equivalent efficiency ratio, tangible common equity ratio, tangible book value per common share, return on average tangible common equity, and pre-tax income, excluding provision for credit losses. Management believes that these measures and ratios provide users of the Company’s financial information a more meaningful view of the performance of the Company’s interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and of the Company’s operating efficiency. Other financial holding companies may define or calculate these measures and ratios differently. Management reviews yields on certain asset categories and the net interest margin of the Company and its banking subsidiaries on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. In this non-GAAP presentation, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt interest income on an equivalent before-tax basis using tax rates effective as of the end of the period. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis is also used in the calculation of the Company’s efficiency ratio. The efficiency ratio, which is calculated by dividing non-interest expense by total taxable-equivalent net revenue (less securities gains or losses), measures how much it costs to produce one dollar of revenue. Securities gains or losses are excluded from this calculation to better match revenue from daily operations to operational expenses. Management considers the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share as useful measurements of the Company’s equity. The Company references the return on average tangible common equity as a measurement of profitability. Management considers pre-tax income, excluding provision for credit losses, as a useful measurement of the Company’s core net income.

Net income decreased by 26% in Q1 2024. Adjusted EBITDA dropped by 6% in Q1 2024. AFFO and AFFO per share showed a 10% decrease in Q1 2024. Capital expenditures in Q1 2024 were significant at $320 million. Common stock dividends remained unchanged at $1.565 per share. The company's debt maturity profile could pose risks in the future. The decline in financial metrics may impact shareholder confidence. Financial Analyst The recent financial performance of Crown Castle highlights a mix of steady dividends and a modest decline in earnings, which may suggest a stable yet challenging operational environment. Notably, the consistent common stock dividend payout underscores a solid cash flow position, but the 2% decline in site rental revenues and 10% decrease in AFFO indicate potential pressure on income streams. The reported 5% organic growth, when adjusted for Sprint cancellations, reveals resilience in core business areas despite revenue headwinds.From a balance sheet perspective, Crown Castle's strategic positioning with over 90% fixed rate debt and a long weighted average maturity signals a defensive approach to financial management. This stance is further bolstered by the substantial liquidity available under their revolving credit facility. However, investors should closely monitor the company's ability to navigate the 17% downturn in net income and its implications for future investment and strategic flexibility. Telecom Industry Analyst The 5.0% consolidated core organic growth, particularly in the context of the Sprint cancellations, signifies ongoing demand for Crown Castle's infrastructure. The current telecom landscape is increasingly reliant on small cell and fiber solutions as carriers expand their 5G networks. This demand bodes well for Crown Castle's long-term growth prospects, given its significant presence in these areas.However, the decline in straight-lined revenues and the decrease in amortization of prepaid rent suggest that there may be some volatility in future revenue projections. Investors should consider the potential impact of changing lease structures and the specific terms of Crown Castle's contracts with its customers. A deeper understanding of the underlying trends in Crown Castle's site rental billings would provide a clearer picture of the sustainability of this revenue stream. 04/17/2024 - 04:15 PM HOUSTON, April 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Crown Castle Inc.

HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE QUARTER Site rental revenues. Site rental revenues declined 2%, or $36 million, from first quarter 2023 to first quarter 2024, with an increase of approximately $17 million in Organic Contribution to Site Rental Billings, more than offset by a $24 million decrease in straight-lined revenues, and a $30 million decrease in amortization of prepaid rent. The $17 million in Organic Contributions to Site Rental Billings represents 1.2% growth, or 5.0% when adjusting for a $50 million decrease to Site Rental Billings related to the previously disclosed Sprint Cancellations.Net income.

First quarter 2024 Adjusted EBITDA was $1.04 billion compared to $1.10 billion for the first quarter 2023. The decrease in the quarter was primarily a result of the lower contribution from site rental revenues and $26 million of lower services contribution.AFFO and AFFO per share. First quarter 2024 AFFO was $749 million, or $1.72 per share, each representing a decrease from the first quarter 2023 of 10%. The decrease in the quarter was primarily a result of the lower contribution from Adjusted EBITDA and higher interest expense compared to first quarter 2023.Capital expenditures. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $320 million, comprised of $298 million of discretionary capital expenditures and $22 million of sustaining capital expenditures. Discretionary capital expenditures included approximately $259 million attributable to Fiber and $33 million attributable to Towers.Common stock dividend. During the quarter, Crown Castle paid common stock dividends of approximately $688 million in the aggregate, or $1.565 per common share, unchanged on a per share basis compared to the same period a year ago.

Non-GAAP Measures and Other Information This press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Funds from Operations (""AFFO""), including per share amounts, Funds from Operations (""FFO""), including per share amounts, Organic Contribution to Site Rental Billings, including as Adjusted for Impact of Sprint Cancellations, and Net Debt, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as alternative measures of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP"")). Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including other companies in the communications infrastructure sector or other real estate investment trusts (""REITs""). In addition to the non-GAAP financial measures used herein, we also provide segment site rental gross margin, segment services and other gross margin and segment operating profit, which are key measures used by management to evaluate our operating segments. These segment measures are provided pursuant to GAAP requirements related to segment reporting. In addition, we provide the components of certain GAAP measures, such as site rental revenues and capital expenditures. Our non-GAAP financial measures are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our business. Among other things, management believes that: Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by management (1) to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors, by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results. Management also believes Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of the communications infrastructure sector and other REITs to measure financial performance without regard to items such as depreciation, amortization and accretion, which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as a supplement to net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.AFFO, including per share amounts, is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Management believes that AFFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate our financial performance as it includes (1) the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense on our outstanding debt and dividends on our preferred stock (in periods where applicable)) and (2) sustaining capital expenditures, and excludes the impact of our (1) asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) and (2) certain non-cash items, including straight-lined revenues and expenses related to fixed escalations and rent free periods. GAAP requires rental revenues and expenses related to leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease to be recognized evenly over the life of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, if payment terms call for fixed escalations or rent free periods, the revenues or expenses are recognized on a straight-lined basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the contract. Management notes that Crown Castle uses AFFO only as a performance measure. AFFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operations or as residual cash flow available for discretionary investment.FFO, including per share amounts, is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Management believes that FFO may be used by investors or other interested parties as a basis to compare our financial performance with that of other REITs. FFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate financial performance by excluding the impact of our asset base (primarily real estate depreciation, amortization and accretion). FFO is not a key performance indicator used by Crown Castle. FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operations.Organic Contribution to Site Rental Billings is useful to investors or other interested parties in understanding the components of the year-over-year changes in our site rental revenues computed in accordance with GAAP. Management uses Organic Contribution to Site Rental Billings to assess year-over-year growth rates for our rental activities, to evaluate current performance, to capture trends in rental rates, core leasing activities and tenant non-renewals in our core business, as well as to forecast future results. Separately, we are also disclosing Organic Contribution to Site Rental Billings as Adjusted for Impact of Sprint Cancellations, which is outside of ordinary course, to provide further insight into our results of operations and underlying trends. Management believes that identifying the impact for Sprint Cancellations provides increased transparency and comparability across periods. Organic Contribution to Site Rental Billings (including as Adjusted for Impact of Sprint Cancellations) is not meant as an alternative measure of revenue and should be considered only as a supplement in understanding and assessing the performance of our site rental revenues computed in accordance with GAAP.Net Debt is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our overall debt position and future debt capacity. Management uses Net Debt in assessing our leverage. Net Debt is not meant as an alternative measure of debt and should be considered only as a supplement in understanding and assessing our leverage. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, net, (gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations, net (gain) loss on interest rate swaps, (gains) losses on foreign currency swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, interest income, other (income) expense, (benefit) provision for income taxes, net (income) loss from discontinued operations, (gain) loss on sale of discontinued operations, cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and stock-based compensation expense, net.

Additionally, Organic Contribution to Site Rental Billings as Adjusted for Impact of Sprint Cancellations reflects Organic Contribution to Site Rental Billings less payments for Sprint Cancellations, plus non-renewals associated with Sprint Cancellations. Net Debt. We define Net Debt as (1) debt and other long-term obligations and (2) current maturities of debt and other obligations, excluding unamortized adjustments, net; less cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents.

Segment services and other gross margin. We define segment services and other gross margin as segment services and other revenues less segment services and other costs of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense, net recorded in consolidated services and other costs of operations. Segment operating profit. We define segment operating profit as segment site rental gross margin plus segment services and other gross margin, less segment selling, general and administrative expenses. All of these measurements of profit or loss are exclusive of depreciation, amortization and accretion, which are shown separately. Additionally, certain costs are shared across segments and are reflected in our segment measures through allocations that management believes to be reasonable. Other Definitions Site rental billings. We define site rental billings as site rental revenues exclusive of the impacts from (1) straight-lined revenues, (2) amortization of prepaid rent in accordance with GAAP and (3) contribution from recent acquisitions until the one-year anniversary of such acquisitions. Core leasing activity. We define core leasing activity as site rental revenues growth from tenant additions across our entire portfolio and renewals or extensions of tenant contracts, exclusive of (1) the impacts from both straight-lined revenues and amortization of prepaid rent in accordance with GAAP and (2) payments for Sprint Cancellations, where applicable. Non-renewals. We define non-renewals of tenant contracts as the reduction in site rental revenues as a result of tenant churn, terminations and, in limited circumstances, reductions of existing lease rates, exclusive of non-renewals associated with Sprint Cancellations, where applicable. Discretionary capital expenditures. We define discretionary capital expenditures as those capital expenditures made with respect to activities which we believe exhibit sufficient potential to enhance long-term stockholder value. They primarily consist of expansion or development of communications infrastructure (including capital expenditures related to (1) enhancing communications infrastructure in order to add new tenants for the first time or support subsequent tenant equipment augmentations or (2) modifying the structure of a communications infrastructure asset to accommodate additional tenants) and construction of new communications infrastructure. Discretionary capital expenditures also include purchases of land interests (which primarily relates to land assets under towers as we seek to manage our interests in the land beneath our towers), certain technology-related investments necessary to support and scale future customer demand for our communications infrastructure, and other capital projects. Sustaining capital expenditures. We define sustaining capital expenditures as those capital expenditures not otherwise categorized as discretionary capital expenditures, such as (1) maintenance capital expenditures on our communications infrastructure assets that enable our tenants' ongoing quiet enjoyment of the communications infrastructure and (2) ordinary corporate capital expenditures. Sprint Cancellations. We define Sprint Cancellations as lease cancellations related to the previously disclosed T-Mobile US, Inc. and Sprint network consolidation as described in our press release dated April 19, 2023.

Cautionary Language Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This news release contains forward-looking statements and information that are based on our management's current expectations as of the date of this news release. Statements that are not historical facts are hereby identified as forward-looking statements. In addition, words such as ""estimate,"" ""see,"" ""anticipate,"" ""project,"" ""plan,"" ""intend,"" ""believe,"" ""expect,"" ""likely,"" ""predicted,"" ""positioned,"" ""continue,"" ""target,"" ""focus,"" and any variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements include our full year 2024 Outlook and plans, projections, expectations and estimates regarding (1) the value of our business model and strategy and the demand for our communications infrastructure, (2) revenue growth and its driving factors, (3) net income (loss) (including on a per share basis), (4) AFFO (including on a per share basis) and its components and growth, (5) Adjusted EBITDA and its components and growth, (6) Organic Contribution to Site Rental Billings (including as Adjusted for Impact of Sprint Cancellations) and its components and growth, (7) site rental revenues and its components and growth, (8) interest expense, (9) the impact of Sprint Cancellations on our operating and financial results, (10) services contribution, (11) the growth in our business and its driving factors, (12) discretionary capital expenditures, (13) prepaid rent additions and amortization, (14) core leasing activity, (15) site rental billings, (16) fiber strategic review and the potential impacts and benefits therefrom, and (17) the contribution from the recently appointed President and CEO. All future dividends are subject to declaration by our board of directors. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including prevailing market conditions and the following: Our business depends on the demand for our communications infrastructure (including towers, small cells and fiber), driven primarily by demand for data, and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand. Additionally, a reduction in the amount or change in the mix of network investment by our tenants may materially and adversely affect our business (including reducing demand for our communications infrastructure or services).A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of tenants, and the loss, consolidation or financial instability of any of such tenants may materially decrease revenues, reduce demand for our communications infrastructure and services and impact our dividend per share growth.The expansion or development of our business, including through acquisitions, increased product offerings or other strategic opportunities, may cause disruptions in our business, which may have an adverse effect on our business, operations or financial results.Our Fiber segment has expanded, and the Fiber business model contains certain differences from our Towers business model, resulting in different operational risks. If we do not successfully operate our Fiber business model or identify or manage the related operational risks, such operations may produce results that are lower than anticipated.Our review of potential strategic alternatives may not result in an executed or consummated transaction or other strategic alternative, and the process of reviewing strategic alternatives or the outcome could adversely affect our business. There is no guarantee that any transaction resulting from the strategic review will ultimately benefit our shareholders.Failure to timely, efficiently and safely execute on our construction projects could adversely affect our business.New technologies may reduce demand for our communications infrastructure or negatively impact our revenues.If we fail to retain rights to our communications infrastructure, including the rights to land under our towers and the right-of-way and other agreements related to our small cells and fiber, our business may be adversely affected.Our services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand, which reduces the predictability of our results.If radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our communications infrastructure are demonstrated to cause negative health effects, potential future claims could adversely affect our operations, costs or revenues.Cybersecurity breaches or other information technology disruptions could adversely affect our operations, business, and reputation.Our business may be adversely impacted by climate-related events, natural disasters, including wildfires, and other unforeseen events.As a result of competition in our industry, we may find it more difficult to negotiate favorable rates on our new or renewing tenant contracts.New wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by tenants as rapidly or in the manner projected.Our focus on and disclosure of our Environmental, Social and Governance position, metrics, strategy, goals and initiatives expose us to potential litigation and other adverse effects to our business.Failure to attract, recruit and retain qualified and experienced employees could adversely affect our business, operations and costs.Changes to management, including turnover of our top executives, could have an adverse effect on our business.Actions that we are taking to restructure our business in alignment with our strategic priorities may not be as effective as anticipated.Actions of activist stockholders could impact the pursuit of our business strategies and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, or stock price.Our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business, and the terms of our debt instruments limit our ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be in our best interests. In addition, if we fail to comply with our covenants, our debt could be accelerated.We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. In the event we do not repay or refinance such indebtedness, we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, or sell some of our assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, to meet our debt payment obligations.Sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.Certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated by-laws and operative agreements, and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party, even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.If we fail to comply with laws or regulations which regulate our business and which may change at any time, we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business.Future dividend payments to our stockholders will reduce the availability of our cash on hand available to fund future discretionary investments, and may result in a need to incur indebtedness or issue equity securities to fund growth opportunities. In such event, the then current economic, credit market or equity market conditions will impact the availability or cost of such financing, which may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations.Remaining qualified to be taxed as a Real Estate Investment Trust (""REIT"") involves highly technical and complex provisions of the Code. Failure to remain qualified as a REIT would result in our inability to deduct dividends to stockholders when computing our taxable income, thereby increasing our tax obligations and reducing our available cash.Complying with REIT requirements, including the 90% distribution requirement, may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities, including certain discretionary investments and potential financing alternatives.REIT related ownership limitations and transfer restrictions may prevent or restrict certain transfers of our capital stock. Should one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those expected. More information about potential risk factors which could affect our results is included in our filings with the SEC. Our filings with the SEC are available through the SEC website at www.sec.gov or through our investor relations website at investor.crowncastle.com. We use our investor relations website to disclose information about us that may be deemed to be material. We encourage investors, the media and others interested in us to visit our investor relations website from time to time to review up-to-date information or to sign up for e-mail alerts to be notified when new or updated information is posted on the site.

Total revenue net of interest expense rose by 13% to $4,210 million. Net income for the first quarter of 2024 was $308 million, compared to $968 million in the same period in 2023. Diluted EPS was $1.10 for the first quarter of 2024, down from $3.55 in the first quarter of 2023. Discover declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.70 per share. Expenses were elevated due to resolving a card misclassification issue. Discover is looking forward to merging with Capital One. Negative Net income decreased by 68% compared to the first quarter of 2023. Diluted EPS decreased by 69% compared to the first quarter of 2023. The total net charge-off rate increased by 220 basis points year-over-year. Expenses were up $917 million year-over-year, or 68%. The credit card net charge-off rate increased by 256 basis points from the prior year period. The 30+ day delinquency rate for credit card loans was up 107 basis points year-over-year. Financial Analyst Upon reviewing Discover Financial Services' Q1 2024 performance, a key observation is the significant year-over-year decline in net income, dropping by 68%. This decline, from $968 million to $308 million, is particularly notable given the increase in total loans by 12%, which seems to indicate an expansion in their loan portfolio. However, the total net charge-off rate surge, from 2.72% to 4.92%, is a red flag. It suggests mounting credit losses, which could be symptomatic of an aggressive credit expansion or deteriorating credit quality among borrowers.The increase in operating expenses by 68% is another concern, driven significantly by a one-off card misclassification remediation reserve. While this may be a singular event, such a sharp increase could affect future profitability if it reflects an underlying issue in operational management. On the upside, a dividend declaration of $0.70 per share indicates the board's confidence in the company's ability to generate cash flow in spite of the pressures.From an investor's perspective, the mixed results – strong loan growth against a backdrop of higher charge-offs and expenses – can be seen as a cautionary tale of the need to balance growth with credit risk management. Going forward, the focus on enhancing risk management and compliance could be a positive move, particularly as Discover anticipates its merger with Capital One, which could bring synergies and greater market capture. Credit Risk Analyst Delving into Discover's credit portfolio health, the upward trend in the net charge-off rate for credit card loans from 5.66% – a 256-basis-point increase from the previous year – indicates a potential weakening in consumer credit quality. Likewise, personal loans' net charge-off rate increasing by 208 basis points to 4.02% could be indicative of a more systemic issue in consumer debt repayment ability. The rising delinquency rates, particularly in credit card loans, which are up 107 basis points year-over-year, warrant close monitoring, as they could prelude further charge-offs.Moreover, the increase in provision for credit losses by $395 million from the previous year highlights an expectation of continued credit challenges. While the increased provision is aligned with rising net charge-offs, it might also reflect a more conservative approach to risk amidst economic uncertainties.An important consideration for investors is the potential impact of these credit trends on Discover's capital and reserve requirements, especially in the context of the upcoming merger. If the elevated charge-offs and provisions continue, it may necessitate higher capital buffers, which could constrain growth or affect capital return strategies. 04/17/2024 - 04:21 PM Board of Directors Declares Quarterly Common Stock Dividend of $0.70 Per Share RIVERWOODS, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Discover Financial Services (NYSE: DFS): First Quarter 2024 Results 2024 2023(1) YOY Change Total loans, end of period (in billions) $126.6 $112.7 12% Total revenue net of interest expense (in millions) $4,210 $3,742 13% Total net charge-off rate 4.92% 2.72% 220 bps Net income/(loss) (in millions) $308 $968 (68%) Diluted EPS $1.10 $3.55 (69%) Note(s) 1. The comparative prior quarter ended March 31, 2023 has been restated as disclosed in the Company's Financial Data Supplement on Form 8-K for the second quarter 2023 Discover Financial Services (NYSE: DFS) today reported net income of $308 million or $1.10 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2024, as compared to a net income of $968 million or $3.55 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2023. “Our first quarter results showed good loan growth, net interest margin expansion, and stabilizing delinquencies, while expenses were elevated due to our action to advance the resolution of our card misclassification issue,” said Michael Shepherd, Discover’s Interim CEO and President. “These results underscore the continued strength of our underlying operating model and our focus on enhancing our risk management and compliance foundation. We look forward to our merger with Capital One, which will create a leading banking and payments organization, grounded on commitment to an outstanding customer experience and the communities we serve."" Segment Results Digital Banking Digital Banking pretax income of $322 million for the quarter was $888 million lower than the prior year period reflecting an increase to our card misclassification remediation reserve, higher provision for credit losses and higher operating expenses, partially offset by increased revenue net of interest expense. Total loans ended the quarter at $126.6 billion, up 12% year-over-year, and down 1% sequentially. Credit card loans ended the quarter at $99.5 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Personal loans increased $1.7 billion, or 21%, and private student loans were flat. The organic student loan portfolio, which excludes purchased loans, increased $123 million, or 1% year-over-year. Net interest income for the quarter increased $355 million, or 11%, driven by higher average receivables partially offset by net interest margin compression. Net interest margin was 11.03%, down 31 basis points versus the prior year. Card yield was 15.79%, up 73 basis points from the prior year primarily driven by higher prime rate and lower payment rates, partially offset by higher interest charge-offs. Interest expense as a percent of total loans increased 120 basis points from the prior year period, primarily driven by higher funding costs. Non-interest income increased $69 million, or 13%, from the prior year period reflecting higher discount / interchange revenue from an improved volume mix and lower rewards cost, and higher loan fee income. The total net charge-off rate of 4.92% was 220 basis points higher versus the prior year period reflecting continued seasoning of recent vintages with higher delinquency trends. The credit card net charge-off rate was 5.66%, up 256 basis points from the prior year period and up 98 basis points from the prior quarter. The 30+ day delinquency rate for credit card loans was 3.83%, up 107 basis points year-over-year and down 4 basis points from the prior quarter. The student loan net charge-off rate was 1.58%, up 54 basis points from the prior year and up 6 basis points from the prior quarter. Personal loans net charge-off rate of 4.02% was up 208 basis points from the prior year and up 63 basis points from the prior quarter. Provision for credit losses of $1.5 billion increased $395 million from the prior year quarter driven by an $806 million increase in net-charge offs partially offset by a $410 million lower reserve build. Total operating expenses were up $917 million year-over-year, or 68%. Other expense was up due to a $799 million increase to the card misclassification remediation reserve. Professional fees were up due to investments in compliance and risk management and higher recovery fees. Employee compensation increased from higher technology resources and severance expense while information processing increased due to technology investments. Payment Services Payment Services pretax income of $82 million was up $35 million year-over-year primarily driven by increased PULSE revenue and first quarter 2023 net losses on equity investments. Payment Services volume was $100.3 billion, up 18% from the prior year period. PULSE dollar volume was up 21% primarily driven by increased debit transaction volume. Diners Club volume was up 11% year-over-year reflecting continued strength across most regions. Network Partners volume increased 4% from the prior year primarily reflecting higher AribaPay volume.

About Gevo Gevo’s mission is to transform renewable energy and carbon into energy-dense liquid hydrocarbons. These liquid hydrocarbons can be used for drop-in transportation fuels such as gasoline, jet fuel and diesel fuel, that when burned have potential to yield net-zero greenhouse gas emissions when measured across the full life cycle of the products. Gevo uses low-carbon renewable resource-based carbohydrates as raw materials, and is in an advanced state of developing renewable electricity and renewable natural gas for use in production processes, resulting in low-carbon fuels with substantially reduced carbon intensity (the level of greenhouse gas emissions compared to standard petroleum fossil-based fuels across their life cycle). Gevo’s products perform as well or better than traditional fossil-based fuels in infrastructure and engines, but with substantially reduced greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to addressing the problems of fuels, Gevo’s technology also enables certain plastics, such as polyester, to be made with more sustainable ingredients. Gevo’s ability to penetrate the growing low-carbon fuels market depends on the price of oil and the value of abating carbon emissions that would otherwise increase greenhouse gas emissions. Gevo believes that its proven, patented technology enabling the use of a variety of low-carbon sustainable feedstocks to produce price-competitive low-carbon products such as gasoline components, jet fuel and diesel fuel yields the potential to generate project and corporate returns that justify the build-out of a multi-billion-dollar business. Gevo believes that the Argonne National Laboratory GREET model is the best available standard of scientific-based measurement for life cycle inventory or LCI. Investor Relations ContactIR@gevo.com When will Gevo report its first quarter 2024 financial results? Gevo will report its first quarter 2024 financial results on May 2, 2024.

Home Bancorp, Inc. berichtete über die Finanzergebnisse des ersten Quartals 2024 mit einem Nettogewinn von 9,2 Millionen Dollar, ein Rückgang gegenüber dem vorherigen Quartal. Trotz einer Verringerung der Nettozinsmarge verzeichnete das Unternehmen positive Wachstumsraten bei Krediten und Einlagen. Nicht leistungsfähige Vermögenswerte stiegen aufgrund von zwei Kreditbeziehungen, werden jedoch voraussichtlich keine Verluste verursachen. Das Unternehmen kündigte eine vierteljährliche Dividende von 0,25 Dollar pro Aktie an und gab einen Aktienrückkaufplan bekannt. Positive Positive: Net income of $9.2 million for the first quarter of 2024, showing growth in loans and deposits. Negative: Nonperforming assets increased due to two loan relationships, potentially impacting asset quality. Positive: Declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, showcasing commitment to shareholder returns. Negative: Net interest margin decreased, affecting interest income and potentially profitability. Positive: Share repurchase plan in place, indicating confidence in the company's financial position. Negative Nonperforming assets increased by 111% from the previous quarter, potentially impacting asset quality. Net interest margin decreased by 5 basis points, affecting interest income and profitability. The company recorded net loan charge-offs of $217,000 during the first quarter of 2024. Financial Analyst The first quarter financial results of Home Bancorp, Inc. provide a snapshot of the company's current financial health and allow investors to gauge its performance relative to previous quarters. A decline in net income and diluted EPS could signal challenges in profitability, although the company still maintains growth in loans and deposits.The reported annualized loan and deposit growth rates are robust indicators that the bank's core businesses are expanding. This is a positive sign for investors seeking companies with solid growth trajectories. However, the decrease in net interest margin (NIM) could be a concern as it suggests that the bank is earning less from its lending activities relative to its deposit costs, which could potentially squeeze profits if the trend continues.Examining the increase in nonperforming assets is important to understand the risk level in the loan portfolio. While management does not anticipate losses, the rise in such assets might require scrutiny on credit risk management and could affect investor confidence.Another factor for investors to consider is the impact of deposit costs on net interest income. An increase in the average rate on interest-bearing deposits may reflect changing market conditions and could affect the bank's interest expense in the coming quarters. It's essential to monitor how this will play out in a varying interest rate environment. Market Research Analyst Looking at the broader market context, Home Bancorp's performance must be analyzed against the backdrop of prevailing economic conditions and interest rate trends. The bank's focus on relationship-based banking and its success in attracting new clients are strategically significant in a competitive landscape, suggesting potential for market share growth.Geographically, the strong loan growth in the Houston market indicates regional economic strengths and opportunities for the bank to deepen its presence there. Despite a solid quarter, the slight downturn in earnings could be indicative of larger industry-wide pressures that may continue to affect the bank and its peers.The bank’s balance between loan diversification and credit quality will be pivotal in maintaining stability, particularly as external economic factors, like inflationary pressures and policy changes, remain uncertain. Investors should keep an eye on these aspects to gauge long-term resilience. Investment Securities Analyst From an investment securities perspective, Home Bancorp's portfolio showed a decrease in fair value and an increase in unrealized losses, translating to a more cautious outlook on its securities holdings. The effective duration of its securities portfolio remains constant, suggesting the bank's investment strategy hasn't changed radically despite market volatility.Investor attention should also be on the bank’s liquidity management, especially given the current economic uncertainty. The company's primary and secondary sources of liquidity appear robust, which is an essential factor for mitigating risks in times of financial strain.The use of the portfolio for collateral, particularly in the Federal Reserve Bank Term Funding Program, can affect the bank's flexibility in response to changes in market rates of interest. This could have implications for investors concerned with how the bank is managing interest rate risk. 04/17/2024 - 05:14 PM LAFAYETTE, La., April 17, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Home Bancorp, Inc. (Nasdaq: ""HBCP"") (the ""Company""), the parent company for Home Bank, N.A. (the ""Bank"") (www.home24bank.com), reported financial results for the first quarter of 2024.

This increase in nonperforming assets is primarily due to two loan relationships which were classified as nonperforming in the first quarter of 2024, for which management does not anticipate any loss.Loans Loans totaled $2.6 billion at March 31, 2024, up $40.1 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2023.

The following table summarizes the changes in the Company's deposits from December 31, 2023 to March 31, 2024.

At March 31, 2024, certificates of deposit maturing within the next 12 months totaled $640.2 million. We obtain most of our deposits from individuals, small businesses and public funds in our market areas. The following table presents our deposits per customer type for the periods indicated.

Public funds in excess of the FDIC insurance limits are fully collateralized. Net Interest Income The net interest margin (""NIM"") decreased 5 basis points from 3.69% for the fourth quarter of 2023 to 3.64% for the first quarter of 2024 primarily due to an increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits, which was partially offset by an increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits increased by 28 basis points and the cost of deposits increased by $1.6 million, or 15%, in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase in deposit costs reflects the rise in market rates of interest as well as a migration to interest-bearing deposits from non-interest bearing deposits. The average loan yield was 6.18% for the first quarter of 2024, up 10 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily reflecting increased rates on variable rate loans coupled with new loan originations at higher market rates during the period. Average other interest-earning assets were $57.1 million for the first quarter of 2024, down $420,000, or 1%, from the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily due to a reallocation of certain other interest-earning assets. Loan accretion income from acquired loans totaled $525,000 for the first quarter of 2024, down $58,000, or 10%, from the fourth quarter of 2023.

The increase was related primarily to other income (up $70,000), gain on sale of loans (up $41,000) and service fees and charges (up $19,000), which were partially offset by bank card fees (down $71,000) for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Noninterest Expense Noninterest expense for the first quarter of 2024 totaled $20.9 million, up $264,000, or 1%, from the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily related to compensation and benefits expense (up $769,000) and franchise and shares tax (up $357,000), which were partially offset by other noninterest expense (down $405,000), marketing and advertising expense (down $293,000) and the absence of provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments (down $140,000) during the first quarter of 2024. Capital and Liquidity At March 31, 2024, shareholders' equity totaled $372.3 million, up $4.8 million, or 1%, compared to $367.4 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the the Company's earnings of $9.2 million during the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by increases in accumulated other comprehensive loss on available for sale investment securities, shareholder dividends and repurchases of shares of the Company's common stock. The market value of the Company's available for sale securities at March 31, 2024 decreased $3.2 million, or 7%, during the first quarter of 2024. Preliminary Tier 1 leverage capital and total risk-based capital ratios were 11.19% and 14.39%, respectively, at March 31, 2024, compared to 10.98% and 14.23%, respectively, at December 31, 2023.

The Company was allowed an initial 180-day grace period, or until April 9, 2024, (the “Compliance Period”), to regain compliance with the Rule. To regain compliance with the Rule the closing bid price of the Company’s common shares needed to be at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during the Compliance Period. On April 11, 2024, the Company received notification that it had failed to regain compliance with the Rule and is not eligible for a second 180 day compliance period because of its failure to comply with the $5 million minimum stockholders’ equity initial listing requirement for the period ended December 31, 2023. Unless the Company timely requests a hearing before an independent Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”), the Company’s securities will be subject to delisting.

The hearing request will automatically stay any suspension or delisting action pending the hearing and the expiration of any additional extension period granted by the Panel following the hearing. In that regard, pursuant to the Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Panel has the discretion to grant an additional extension period that can expire as late as October 8, 2024. At the hearing, the Company will be asked to provide a plan to regain compliance to the Panel. The Company intends to present a plan to regain compliance with the Rule and request the continued listing of its common shares on Nasdaq pending such compliance. However, there can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company’s request or that the Company will ultimately regain compliance with all applicable requirements for continued listing on Nasdaq.

Financial Analyst In a move reflecting the consolidation trend in the banking industry, one must consider the financial implications of MidFirst Bank's decision to acquire Amerant Bank's Houston operations. The addition of approximately $576 million in deposits and $529 million in loans is a significant infusion into MidFirst's balance sheet. This acquisition aligns with their aggressive growth strategy in the competitive Texas market.From a financial perspective, the deal could potentially boost MidFirst's revenue streams and offer cost synergies by eliminating overlapping operational costs. However, investors should monitor the execution of the integration process, as it could entail one-time costs that might affect short-term profitability. Furthermore, the success of retaining Amerant's client relationships post-transition will be important for projected revenue growth. Market Analyst The strategic acquisition of Amerant Bank’s Houston locations is a textbook example of a geographic expansion move. It places MidFirst in a stronger position within the Houston market, which is ripe for banking services due to robust economic growth. The market should also note MidFirst's approach to maintain all 45 Amerant Bank employees, which might favor client retention and smooth operational transition.Investors should consider the competitive landscape in Houston and how MidFirst's positioning post-acquisition could affect the market share dynamics. While the acquisition reinforces MidFirst's commitment to Texas, it is essential to assess how local and national competitors might react to this expansion, potentially impacting MidFirst's longer-term market position. Human Resources Analyst The acquisition's human capital aspect is often overlooked, yet it is vital. The retention of Amerant's experienced staff is a move that speaks to MidFirst's commitment to service continuity and cultural integration. Investors should appreciate this strategy as it can lead to a more seamless transition and retention of the acquired client base. Nevertheless, the cultural fit between the two entities and the effectiveness of assimilating Amerant's staff into MidFirst's corporate ethos will be an area to watch, as it can significantly impact employee morale and, consequently, customer service quality. 04/17/2024 - 05:05 PM Acquisition includes Houston operations and client relationships, building on MidFirst’s recent growth in Texas and the Western United States OKLAHOMA CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- MidFirst Bank (""MidFirst"" or the “Company”), the largest privately owned bank in the nation, has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the Houston, Texas banking locations of Amerant Bank, the main subsidiary of Amerant Bancorp Inc. (NYSE: AMTB). Upon closing expected later this year, MidFirst will add six Amerant Bank locations to the Company’s footprint and will gain Amerant’s Houston client relationships totaling approximately $576 million in deposits and $529 million in loans. This transaction builds on MidFirst Bank’s recent growth in Texas and accelerates the Company’s expansion strategy in the state. The additional Houston banking locations will better position MidFirst to deliver the Company’s award-winning customer service in the Houston market and invest in the local community. “Houston is a strategic market for us and the acquisition of Amerant Bank’s Houston locations supports our growth plans,” said MidFirst Bank Chairman and CEO Jeff Records. “We have many clients already in Texas, and have expanded in recent years to Houston, Dallas and San Antonio. With this acquisition, MidFirst will have a greater presence in an attractive and growing market and the ability to expand our banking services.” MidFirst Bank will gain experienced bankers covering commercial and business banking, private banking and full-service retail banking. Upon closing, all 45 Amerant Bank employees are expected to join MidFirst and be able to leverage the Company’s successful platform, which provides the financial products of a large bank with the individualized service of a community bank. MidFirst Bank Houston Market Executive Brian Heflin added, “The Amerant Bank team has built a strong reputation in Houston and shares our commitment to customer service and supporting the communities we serve. We look forward to welcoming the Amerant Houston team and their clients to MidFirst, and having the opportunity to demonstrate the quality of the banking services and culture of MidFirst.” Upon completion of the transaction, Amerant Bank locations will be operated as MidFirst Bank locations.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Lithium Americas Corp.'s proposed public offering of 55 million common shares is a fundraising effort that could potentially diversify the company’s shareholder base and infuse the company with fresh capital. The use of an underwritten public offering indicates a commitment to sell a set number of shares at a set price, thereby mitigating the risk of failing to raise the desired amount. This offering, particularly if the over-allotment option is exercised, could dilute current shareholders but also provide the company with funds to fuel growth and investment.From a financial perspective, the critical factors include the offering price, which will be determined by market conditions and could reflect investor confidence in Lithium Americas' growth prospects in the burgeoning EV market. Additionally, the performance of the Lead Underwriters, well-known entities like Evercore ISI, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and BMO Capital Markets, will be instrumental in the offering's success. Their track records may lend credibility and could possibly draw in more investors.Investors should keep an eye on the subsequent use of the proceeds. If invested wisely in projects with a high return potential or in reducing high-interest debt, it could bolster the company's long-term profitability. However, if market conditions are not favorable, or if the company fails to capitalize on the raised capital, the stock might face downward pressure in the short term. Market Research Analyst The electric vehicle (EV) industry's rapid growth trajectory is fueling demand for lithium, a key component in EV batteries. A successful capital raise through this offering could position Lithium Americas to expand its mining operations and take advantage of escalating market demand. Their strategic move to exclude Québec from the offering could be due to regulatory complexities or market strategy considerations, which is noteworthy for market observers.Additionally, investor reaction to this offering will serve as an indicator of the market's view on the long-term prospects of lithium as a commodity. Lithium prices and demand trends offer a context within which this offering takes place. A strong uptake would suggest bullish sentiment on the commodity's future and, by extension, on Lithium Americas' position within the industry.Investors may also benefit from understanding the timing of this offering. It comes at a time when EV infrastructure is expanding and government policies are increasingly supportive of clean energy initiatives. Timing the market's appetite for Lithian Americas' stock correctly could be highly beneficial for the company, but conversely, poor timing could result in less favorable terms. 04/17/2024 - 05:07 PM (All amounts in US$ unless otherwise indicated) VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lithium Americas Corp.

Financial Analyst Banco BBVA Argentina's filing of its Annual Report on Form 20-F is a disclosure of significant importance as it provides investors with a comprehensive overview of the bank's financial health and performance over the prior year. The report includes audited financial statements, which serve as a benchmark for the bank's fiscal integrity and operational efficiency. When considering investment decisions, stakeholders typically examine key financial metrics such as net income, return on equity and capital ratios, which are important in assessing the bank's ability to generate profit and withstand financial stress. Additionally, trends in loan growth and non-performing loans can signal the bank's risk management efficacy and market position. The Form 20-F also delivers insights into risks, market conditions and regulatory changes that could influence the bank's strategic direction and financial outlook. Market Research Analyst From a market research perspective, the annual filings of a financial institution like Banco BBVA Argentina are instrumental in understanding the competitive landscape of the Argentine banking sector. The document can shed light on market share evolution, customer base changes and new business lines that the bank may be exploring. This analysis contributes to a macro-level understanding of the bank's strategic initiatives and its alignment with market opportunities and challenges. Investors would do well to compare BBVA Argentina's performance with that of its peers to gauge relative strengths and weaknesses. It's particularly instructive to track the bank's operational results against the backdrop of Argentina's economic climate, which has historically been volatile. Such comparisons can illuminate the bank's resilience and agility in adapting to local economic shifts. Global Economics Analyst The filing's implications extend beyond the borders of Argentina. As a part of a global financial group, Banco BBVA Argentina's performance affects perceptions of international investors regarding the BBVA brand and its subsidiaries. Economic indicators within the report can influence foreign direct investment decisions into Argentina, reflecting on the broader economic stability and investment climate of the region. In addition, given that Argentina has faced economic challenges in recent years, including inflation and currency devaluation, the report's insights into how the bank navigates these issues are key for investors considering exposure to emerging markets. It is essential to consider not just the micro-details of the bank's financials, but also the macroeconomic factors that could shape its future performance. 04/17/2024 - 05:01 PM BUENOS AIRES, Argentina, April 17, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Banco BBVA Argentina S.A.

Cautionary Note for United States Investors The information in this news release, including any information incorporated by reference, and disclosure documents of Liberty Gold that are filed with Canadian securities regulatory authorities concerning mineral properties have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of securities laws in effect in Canada, which differ from the requirements of United States securities laws. Without limiting the foregoing, these documents use the terms “measured resources”, “indicated resources”, “inferred resources” and “probable mineral reserves”. Shareholders in the United States are advised that, while such terms are defined in and required by Canadian securities laws, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) does not recognize them. Under United States standards, mineralization may not be classified as a reserve unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made. United States investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of measured or indicated resources will ever be converted into reserves. Further, inferred resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be mined legally or economically. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of the inferred resources will ever be upgraded to a higher resource category. Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility, pre-feasibility or other technical reports or studies, except in rare cases. Therefore, United States investors are also cautioned not to assume that all or any part of the inferred resources exist, or that they can be mined legally or economically. Disclosure of contained ounces is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations; however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report resources as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures. Accordingly, information concerning descriptions of mineralization and resources contained in these documents may not be comparable to information made public by United States companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the SEC.

Pre-provision net revenue increased by $79.2 million, or 58%, sequentially, but was down $77.0 million, or 26%, compared to the first quarter of 2023. Net interest income declined by $18.4 million, or 4%, compared to the prior quarter and was down $61.9 million, or 13%, compared to the first quarter of 2023.

Negative Net interest income declined compared to the previous quarter and the first quarter of 2023. Non-interest revenue declined compared to the first quarter of 2023. Provision for credit losses increased sequentially. Headcount declined year over year. The company experienced a decline in adjusted non-interest revenue compared to the first quarter of 2023. Financial Analyst The reported decline in diluted earnings per share (EPS) from $1.32 in Q1 2023 to $0.78 in Q1 2024 immediately raises a flag regarding Synovus' profitability within the period. This 41% drop is significant, even when considering the FDIC Special Assessment's $0.07 per share impact. A decline in net interest income of 13% year-over-year, coupled with a 4% dip from the previous quarter, suggests Synovus is grappling with a tightening interest margin environment. The net interest margin compression from 3.43% in Q1 2023 to 3.04% in Q1 2024 underscores this challenge. Investors should be mindful of the effect that rising deposit costs and the decline in average earning assets may have on the company's interest income going forward. Risk Analyst From a risk perspective, the uptick in the provision for credit losses – 68% higher than in Q1 2023 – alongside an increased non-performing loan and asset ratios, indicates a potentially rising risk environment for Synovus’ loan portfolio. These factors may reflect broader economic pressures that could affect loan repayment capabilities. While the overall allowance for credit losses ratio has only slightly increased, it will be important to monitor further changes that might affect credit quality. The preliminary Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio stands at 10.38%, which represents a stronger capital position and may provide some cushion against potential future losses. Market Analyst The mixed signals in deposit and loan dynamics, with period-end loans slightly decreasing while period-end core deposits modestly increased, paint a picture of cautious optimism in Synovus' ability to attract deposits amidst challenging loan demand conditions. However, a noticeable 17% year-over-year dive in non-interest bearing deposits might suggest a shift in consumer behavior or a preference for yield-bearing accounts in a rising rate environment. This shift could influence the cost of capital and potentially squeeze margins if not managed effectively. 04/17/2024 - 05:00 PM Diluted earnings per share of $0.78 vs. $1.32 in 1Q23 Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.79 vs. $1.33 in 1Q23 $12.8 million FDIC Special Assessment reduced 1Q24 reported and adjusted EPS by $0.07 COLUMBUS, Ga.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Synovus Financial Corp. (NYSE: SNV) today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. “Our first quarter results demonstrate tangible progress on our strategic priorities, including key commercial category loan and core deposit growth, client non-interest revenue growth and excellent operating expense control. We remain focused on raising the bar on service and deepening client relationships, all while building a more risk-resilient bank, which was evidenced by our highest common equity tier 1 capital ratios in several years and an over 30% decline in wholesale funding versus last year,"" said Synovus Chairman, CEO and President Kevin Blair. First Quarter 2024 Highlights Net income available to common shareholders was $114.8 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, compared to $60.6 million or $0.41 in the fourth quarter 2023 and $193.9 million or $1.32 in first quarter 2023. An incremental $12.8 million FDIC Special Assessment reduced first quarter 2024 reported and adjusted EPS by $0.07. A $51.0 million FDIC Special Assessment impacted fourth quarter 2023 reported and adjusted EPS by $0.26. Pre-provision net revenue of $215.0 million increased $79.2 million, or 58%, sequentially and was down $77.0 million, or 26%, compared to first quarter 2023. Net interest income declined $18.4 million, or 4%, compared to the prior quarter and was down $61.9 million, or 13%, compared to first quarter 2023, primarily attributable to a decline in average earnings assets and higher funding costs. Net interest margin was 3.04% which compressed from the fourth quarter 2023 as higher deposit costs more than offset an increase in earning asset yields. Period-end loans declined $94.6 million from the fourth quarter 2023 as core commercial lending growth was more than offset by soft loan demand, higher loan paydowns and strategic declines in certain loan categories such as non-relationship syndicated lending and third-party consumer lending. Commercial and industrial loans increased $132.8 million or 1% from the prior quarter and $131.1 million or 1% from first quarter 2023. Period-end core deposits ended the quarter at $44.9 billion, an increase of $165.1 million sequentially primarily as a result of time deposit growth, partially offset by a decline in non-interest bearing deposits. Total deposit costs increased 17 basis points from the fourth quarter 2023 to 2.67%. Non-interest revenue of $118.9 million increased $67.4 million, or 131%, sequentially and declined $14.2 million, or 11%, compared to first quarter 2023. Adjusted non-interest revenue of $116.6 million fell $9.6 million, or 8%, sequentially and declined $1.0 million, or 1%, compared to the first quarter 2023. Year-over-year pressure was the result of the consumer checking program changes and GLOBALT divestiture in 2023. The company experienced year-over-year growth in core banking fees and commercial sponsorship income. On a sequential basis, non-interest expense of $322.7 million declined 9% while adjusted non-interest expense declined 10% to $318.9 million. Compared to the prior year, non-interest expense and adjusted non-interest expense was flat and increased 5%, respectively. All comparisons were significantly impacted by the FDIC Special Assessments in fourth quarter 2023 and first quarter 2024. Headcount declined 1% sequentially and 7% year over year. Excluding the first quarter 2024 FDIC Special Assessment, adjusted non-interest expense was relatively stable compared to first quarter 2023. Provision for credit losses of $54.0 million increased 19% sequentially and compares to $32.2 million in first quarter 2023. The allowance for credit losses ratio (to loans) of 1.26% was up 2 basis points from the fourth quarter 2023. The non-performing loan and asset ratios were slightly higher at 0.81% and 0.86%, respectively; the net charge-off ratio for the quarter was 0.41%, and total past dues were 0.13% of total loans outstanding. Approximately 0.17% of first quarter 2024 net charge-offs were attributable to an $18 million loss from a commercial and industrial loan relationship that is expected to be resolved later this month. The preliminary CET1 ratio rose sequentially to 10.38% as core earnings accretion more than offset the impact of $29.9 million in common stock repurchases during the first quarter 2024.

All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. You can identify these forward-looking statements through Synovus’ use of words such as “believes,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “may,” “will,” “assumes,” “should,” “predicts,” “could,” “would,” “intends,” “targets,” “estimates,” “projects,” “plans,” “potential” and other similar words and expressions of the future or otherwise regarding the outlook for Synovus’ future business and financial performance and/or the performance of the banking industry and economy in general. These forward-looking statements include, among others, our expectations regarding our future operating and financial performance; expectations on our growth strategy, expense and revenue initiatives, capital management, balance sheet management, and future profitability; expectations on credit quality and performance; and the assumptions underlying our expectations. Prospective investors are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Synovus to be materially different from the future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on the information known to, and current beliefs and expectations of, Synovus’ management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements in this press release. Many of these factors are beyond Synovus’ ability to control or predict. These forward-looking statements are based upon information presently known to Synovus’ management and are inherently subjective, uncertain and subject to change due to any number of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, the risks and other factors set forth in Synovus’ filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, under the captions “Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” and in Synovus’ quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures The measures entitled adjusted non-interest revenue, non-interest expense; adjusted revenue; adjusted tangible efficiency ratio; adjusted net income available to common shareholders; adjusted diluted earnings per share; adjusted return on average assets; adjusted return on average common equity; return on average tangible common equity; adjusted return on average tangible common equity; and tangible common equity ratio are not measures recognized under GAAP and therefore are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The most comparable GAAP measures to these measures are total non-interest revenue; total non-interest expense; total revenue; efficiency ratio-TE; net income available to common shareholders; diluted earnings per share; return on average assets; return on average common equity; and the ratio of total Synovus Financial Corp. shareholders' equity to total assets, respectively. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful additional information about Synovus to assist management and investors in evaluating Synovus’ operating results, financial strength, the performance of its business, and the strength of its capital position. However, these non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of operating results or capital position as reported under GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as additional views of the way our financial measures are affected by significant items and other factors, and since they are not required to be uniformly applied, they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures at other companies. Adjusted non-interest revenue and adjusted revenue are measures used by management to evaluate non-interest revenue and total revenue exclusive of fair value adjustment on non-qualified deferred compensation and other items not indicative of ongoing operations that could impact period-to-period comparisons. Adjusted non-interest expense and the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio are measures utilized by management to measure the success of expense management initiatives focused on reducing recurring controllable operating costs. Adjusted net income available to common shareholders, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted return on average assets, and adjusted return on average common equity are measures used by management to evaluate operating results exclusive of items that are not indicative of ongoing operations and impact period-to-period comparisons. Return on average tangible common equity and adjusted return on average tangible common equity are measures used by management to compare Synovus’ performance with other financial institutions because it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization, thereby allowing management to evaluate the performance of the business consistently. The tangible common equity ratio is used by management to assess the strength of our capital position. The computations of these measures are set forth in the tables below.

Black Stone Minerals, L.P. ha dichiarato una distribuzione di $0,375 per unità per il primo trimestre del 2024, con pagamenti previsti per il 17 maggio 2024. La riduzione della distribuzione è dovuta alla pressione sui prezzi del gas naturale, che ha portato a limitazioni della produzione e ritardi nelle perforazioni. Tuttavia, l'azienda vede opportunità di acquisizione nell'ambiente di prezzi deboli e prevede di utilizzare il contante in eccesso per acquisizioni strategiche senza incorrere in debiti significativi. La compagnia mira a riportare le distribuzioni ai livelli precedenti entro il 2026, concentrandosi su un impiego disciplinato del capitale e sulle prospettive a lungo termine del gas naturale. Black Stone Minerals, L.P. ha declarado una distribución de $0.375 por unidad para el primer trimestre de 2024, con pagos programados para el 17 de mayo de 2024. La reducción en la distribución se debe a la presión sobre los precios del gas natural, lo que ha llevado a restricciones en la producción y retrasos en la perforación. Sin embargo, la compañía ve oportunidades de adquisición en el entorno de precios bajos y planea usar el exceso de efectivo para adquisiciones estratégicas sin incurrir en deudas significativas.

Black Stone Minerals, L.P.는 2024년 첫 분기에 유닛당 $0.375의 배당을 선언했으며, 2024년 5월 17일에 지급될 예정입니다. 배당 감소는 천연가스 가격에 대한 압박으로 인해 생산 제한과 시추 지연이 발생했기 때문입니다. 그러나 회사는 약한 가격 환경에서 인수 기회를 보고 있으며, 중대한 부채를 발생시키지 않고 전략적 인수를 위해 여분의 현금을 사용할 계획입니다. 회사는 2026년까지 배당을 이전 수준으로 회복시키는 것을 목표로 하며, 자본의 규율 있는 배치와 장기적인 천연가스 전망에 중점을 두고 있습니다. Black Stone Minerals, L.P. a déclaré une distribution de $0,375 par unité pour le premier trimestre de 2024, avec des paiements prévus pour le 17 mai 2024. La réduction de la distribution est due à la pression sur les prix du gaz naturel, entraînant des restrictions de production et des retards dans le forage. Cependant, l'entreprise voit des opportunités d'acquisition dans l'environnement de prix faibles et prévoit d'utiliser l'excédent de trésorerie pour des acquisitions stratégiques sans contracter de dettes importantes. L'entreprise vise à rétablir les distributions aux niveaux antérieurs d'ici 2026, en se concentrant sur le déploiement discipliné du capital et les perspectives à long terme du gaz naturel. Black Stone Minerals, L.P. hat eine Ausschüttung von $0,375 pro Einheit für das erste Quartal 2024 bekannt gegeben, mit Zahlungen, die für den 17. Mai 2024 geplant sind. Die Reduzierung der Ausschüttung ist auf den Druck auf die Erdgaspreise zurückzuführen, was zu Produktionsbeschränkungen und Verzögerungen bei den Bohrungen geführt hat. Das Unternehmen sieht jedoch Akquisitionsmöglichkeiten in der schwachen Preissituation und plant, überschüssiges Bargeld für strategische Akquisitionen zu verwenden, ohne signifikante Schulden einzugehen. Das Unternehmen beabsichtigt, die Ausschüttungen bis 2026 auf das vorherige Niveau zurückzuführen, wobei der Schwerpunkt auf einer disziplinierten Kapitalverwendung und der langfristigen Perspektive für Erdgas liegt. Positive None. Negative The distribution reduction is a negative aspect due to pressure on natural gas prices, leading to production curtailments and delays in drilling. The weak price environment impacting the distribution is a concern, although the company plans to use excess cash for strategic acquisitions.

Distributions will be payable on May 17, 2024 to unitholders of record on May 10, 2024. The distribution reduction primarily results from continuing pressure on natural gas prices, which the Company expects to lead to production curtailments and delays in drilling and completion of new wells. But the Company believes that the weak price environment also presents additional acquisition opportunities, so the Company will preserve cash flow to continue its ongoing mineral acquisitions in its core areas. The Company expects to announce distribution coverage of approximately 1.2x for the first quarter and to deploy the excess cash to make acquisitions that build on strategic advantages associated with the unique asset base that distinguishes Black Stone from its peers, without incurring significant debt. Thomas L. Carter, Jr., Black Stone Minerals’ Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President, commented: “In the face of delays in natural gas price recovery, we are maintaining our commitment to a returns-based commercial strategy focused on disciplined capital deployment. We remain encouraged by the long-term natural gas outlook and the strength of our asset base, which combines a large, diverse portfolio of mineral, royalty and working interests across the Lower 48 with significant inventory and concentrated higher net interests in the Gulf Coast region. We believe that these assets will provide meaningful supply to support the ongoing development of infrastructure to meet growing global demand for liquefied natural gas. The Board of Directors and management team are focused on capital discipline and targeted commercial strategy that capitalizes on our asset base to return distributions to our previous high-water mark by 2026. We have set out a defined path to grow production and distributions as natural gas prices are expected to strengthen in late 2025 and beyond and look forward to providing more detail in our May 6 earnings announcement and on the May 7 earnings call.” Earnings Conference Call The Partnership is scheduled to release details regarding its results for the first quarter 2024 after the close of trading on May 6, 2024. A conference call to discuss these results is scheduled for May 7, 2024 at 9:00 a.m. Central time (10:00 a.m. Eastern time).

Real Estate Investment Analyst Rexford Industrial's latest financial statement reflects a robust industrial market in Southern California, with net income and Core FFO reflecting growth compared to the previous year. This is indicative of a healthy industrial real estate sector, further emphasized by the impressive 17.3% comparable rental rates increase on a GAAP basis, which the company has reported. Investments in acquisitions have been strategic and substantial, potentially contributing to the company's future income streams given the projected initial and stabilized yields. The focus on infill locations, a strategy that typically involves redevelopment of urban spaces, may offer less volatility in occupancy rates and can command higher rents due to limited supply. However, investors should closely monitor the company's debt levels, despite its low-leverage position, especially regarding the terms and interest rates of recent note issuances given the potential for rate hikes. Dividend payouts are a signal of confidence in ongoing cash flow, but these too must be sustainable in the long run. Financial Markets Analyst The company's operational strength, as seen in its occupancy rates and leasing activity, is a positive sign for investors looking at the industrial real estate sector. The strength in leasing spreads, both GAAP and cash, excluding the significant Tireco, Inc. lease extension, suggests strong pricing power and demand for Rexford's properties. The issuance of exchangeable senior notes demonstrates active capital management, which when coupled with the subsequent dividends announcement, balances reinvestment in growth with shareholder returns. The forward equity sale agreement is a strategic capital raising maneuver which could dilute shares but also provides capital for growth without immediate dilution. From a market perspective, the company's performance and guidance may be favorable but the sensitivity to interest rate changes and economic conditions should be closely watched as they can influence financing costs and investment yields. Equity Research Analyst Analyzing the forward-looking statements, Rexford's upward revision of its Core FFO guidance for 2024 can signal management's confidence in their operational efficiency and market conditions. The disclosure of non-cash equity compensation in the guidance is a reminder of the importance of looking at cash-based performance measures alongside GAAP figures. The increase in General and Administrative Expenses, notably tied to non-cash equity compensation, while a cost, can be a tool for aligning management with shareholder interests. However, it's important for investors to parse out these non-cash items to understand the true cash-generative capabilities of the company. The investor conference provides an opportunity for further transparency and insight into management's strategy, which can be valuable for investors as they assess the company's future performance against market expectations. 04/17/2024 - 04:15 PM LOS ANGELES, April 17, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Rexford Industrial Realty, Inc.

Forward Looking Statements: This press release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. Forward-looking statements relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as ""may,"" ""will,"" ""should,"" ""expects,"" ""intends,"" ""plans,"" ""anticipates,"" ""believes,"" ""estimates,"" ""predicts,"" or ""potential"" or the negative of these words and phrases or similar words or phrases which are predictions of or indicate future events or trends and which do not relate solely to historical matters. While forward-looking statements reflect the Company's good faith beliefs, assumptions and expectations, they are not guarantees of future performance. In addition, projections, assumptions and estimates of our future performance and the future performance of the industry in which we operate are necessarily subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk due to a variety of factors, including those described above. These and other factors could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in our estimates and beliefs and in the estimates prepared by independent parties. For a further discussion of these and other factors that could cause the Company's future results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements, see the reports and other filings by the Company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company disclaims any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, of new information, data or methods, future events or other changes. Definitions / Discussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures: Funds from Operations (FFO): We calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (""NAREIT""). FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, gains (or losses) from sales of assets incidental to our business, impairment losses of depreciable operating property or assets incidental to our business, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and amortization of above/below-market lease intangibles) and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. Management uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions, other than temporary impairments of unconsolidated real estate entities, and impairment on our investment in real estate, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of performance used by other REITs, FFO may be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. Other equity REITs may not calculate or interpret FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity and is not indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends. FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance. A reconciliation of net income, the nearest GAAP equivalent, to FFO is set forth below in the Financial Statements and Reconciliations section. ""Company Share of FFO"" reflects FFO attributable to common stockholders, which excludes amounts allocable to noncontrolling interests, participating securities and preferred stockholders. Core Funds from Operations (Core FFO): We calculate Core FFO by adjusting FFO for non-comparable items outlined in the ""Reconciliation of Net Income to Funds From Operations and Core Funds From Operations"" table which is located in the Financial Statements and Reconciliations section below. We believe that Core FFO is a useful supplemental measure and that by adjusting for items that are not considered by the Company to be part of its on-going operating performance, provides a more meaningful and consistent comparison of the Company's operating and financial performance period-over-period. Because these adjustments have a real economic impact on our financial condition and results from operations, the utility of Core FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. Other REITs may not calculate Core FFO in a consistent manner. Accordingly, our Core FFO may not be comparable to other REITs' Core FFO. Core FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance. ""Company Share of Core FFO"" reflects Core FFO attributable to common stockholders, which excludes amounts allocable to noncontrolling interests, participating securities and preferred stockholders. Reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders per Diluted Share Guidance to Company Share of Core FFO per Diluted Share Guidance: The following is a reconciliation of the Company's 2024 guidance range of net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share, the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure, to Company share of Core FFO per diluted share. 2024 Estimate Low High Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 1.17 $ 1.20 Company share of depreciation and amortization 1.17 1.17 Company share of gains on sale of real estate(1) (0.03) (0.03) Company share of Core FFO $ 2.31 $ 2.34 (1) Reflects the sale of 2360-2364 East Sturgis Road on April 16, 2024. Net Operating Income (NOI): NOI is a non-GAAP measure, which includes the revenue and expense directly attributable to our real estate properties. NOI is calculated as rental income from real estate operations less property expenses (before interest expense, depreciation and amortization). We use NOI as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate depreciation and amortization expense and gains (or losses) from property dispositions, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that NOI will be useful to investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because NOI excludes depreciation and amortization expense and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties (all of which have a real economic effect and could materially impact our results from operations), the utility of NOI as a measure of our performance is limited. Other equity REITs may not calculate NOI in a similar manner and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to such other REITs' NOI. Accordingly, NOI should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of our performance. NOI should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. NOI should not be used as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. We use NOI to help evaluate the performance of the Company as a whole, as well as the performance of our Same Property Portfolio. A calculation of NOI for our Same Property Portfolio, as well as a reconciliation of net income to NOI for our Same Property Portfolio, is set forth below in the Financial Statements and Reconciliations section. Cash NOI: Cash NOI is a non-GAAP measure, which we calculate by adding or subtracting from NOI: (i) amortization of above/(below) market lease intangibles and amortization of other deferred rent resulting from sale leaseback transactions with below market leaseback payments and (ii) straight-line rent adjustments. We use Cash NOI, together with NOI, as a supplemental performance measure. Cash NOI should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. Cash NOI should not be used as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP. We use Cash NOI to help evaluate the performance of the Company as a whole, as well as the performance of our Same Property Portfolio. A calculation of Cash NOI for our Same Property Portfolio, as well as a reconciliation of net income to Cash NOI for our Same Property Portfolio, is set forth below in the Financial Statements and Reconciliations section. Same Property Portfolio: Our 2024 Same Property Portfolio is a subset of our consolidated portfolio and includes properties that were wholly owned by us for the period from January 1, 2023 through March 31, 2024, and excludes (i) properties that were acquired or sold during the period from January 1, 2023 through March 31, 2024, and (ii) properties acquired prior to January 1, 2023 that were or will be classified as repositioning/redevelopment (current and future) or lease-up during 2023 and 2024 and select buildings in ""Other Repositioning,"" which we believe will significantly affect the properties' results during the comparative periods. As of March 31, 2024, our 2024 Same Property Portfolio consisted of buildings aggregating 37,109,867 rentable square feet at 296 of our properties. Properties and Space Under Repositioning: Typically defined as properties or units where a significant amount of space is held vacant in order to implement capital improvements that improve the functionality (not including basic refurbishments, i.e., paint and carpet), cash flow and value of that space. A repositioning is generally considered complete once the investment is fully or nearly fully deployed and the property is available for occupancy. We consider a repositioning property to be stabilized at the earlier of the following: (i) upon reaching 90% occupancy or (ii) one year from the date of completion of repositioning construction work. Net Debt to Enterprise Value: As of March 31, 2024, we had consolidated indebtedness of $3.4 billion, reflecting a net debt to enterprise value of approximately 20.9%. Our enterprise value is defined as the sum of the liquidation preference of our outstanding preferred stock and preferred units plus the market value of our common stock excluding shares of nonvested restricted stock, plus the aggregate value of common units not owned by us, plus the value of our net debt. Our net debt is defined as our consolidated indebtedness less cash and cash equivalents.

Die Entscheidung wurde getroffen, um sich auf Expansionspläne in Florida und Tampa zu konzentrieren, wobei der Abschluss der Transaktion für die zweite Hälfte des Jahres 2024 erwartet wird. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The sale of Amerant Bancorp Inc.'s Texas operations constitutes a strategic pivot focusing on the Florida market. Such a divestiture typically aims to streamline operations and allocate resources more efficiently. The deal size, with $576 million in deposits and $529 million in loans, is substantial and a significant infusion of liquidity could be anticipated. This liquidity may be earmarked for bolstering the bank's presence in South Florida and Tampa. Investors should scrutinize the transaction's terms, the impact on Amerant's balance sheet and potential changes in the company's risk profile. It's also important to consider the operational efficiency gains versus the revenue lost from the Texas operations. Market Research Analyst A focus shift to a single-state operation can reflect an attempt to solidify market share and competitive advantage in what is perceived as a more lucrative or strategically important market. However, exiting a market like Texas could mean relinquishing future growth prospects in a region known for its robust economy. One must consider the opportunity costs of exiting the Houston market and the ability of Amerant to capitalize on the Florida market sufficiently to offset this. The bank's strategy post-transaction will be crucial, as will be its ability to manage the redeployment of resources from the sale. Legal Expert Regulatory approvals are a pivotal step in bank transactions of this scale. As the transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2024, there is a significant lead time during which market conditions or regulatory landscapes could shift, potentially affecting the deal's final terms or feasibility. Investors should be aware of this timeline and the fact that such transactions are subject to intense regulatory scrutiny, which can uncover issues that could affect the agreement or the valuation of the assets being transferred. 04/17/2024 - 05:00 PM CORAL GABLES, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Amerant Bancorp Inc. (NYSE: AMTB) (“Amerant” or the “Company”) today announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Amerant Bank, N.A., entered into a definitive purchase and assumption agreement under which MidFirst Bank, based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, will acquire Amerant Bank’s banking operations and six branches in the Houston, Texas metropolitan area. The transaction includes approximately $576 million of deposits and $529 million in loans. “As part of our strategic planning process, we reviewed our current business model of operating in both Florida and Texas. While we have appreciated the opportunity to serve our customers in Houston and see the potential for growth there, we recognized that additional investment would be needed to gain the scale necessary for our Houston operations to materially contribute to future results,” said Jerry Plush, Chairman and CEO. “With the tremendous growth opportunities we see here in Florida, we believe it is prudent to focus on the execution on our ongoing expansion plans in South Florida and Tampa, and continue to work toward achieving our goal of being the bank of choice in the markets we serve.” The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, and is expected to close in the second half of 2024. Stephens Inc. served as financial adviser and Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP provided legal counsel to Amerant. Raymond James & Associates, Inc. served as financial adviser and Covington & Burling LLP provided legal counsel to MidFirst Bank. Today, April 17, 2024, Jerry Plush, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Sharymar Calderón, Executive Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer, will host a conference call at 5:30PM ET to discuss the transaction.

Financial Analyst With Serve Robotics Inc.'s move to raise capital through a public offering of shares, both the pricing and scale of the issuance are critical factors for investors to consider. The offered price of $4.00 per share has been set based on market conditions and the company's valuation. One key aspect of this offering is the participation of Postmates, a strategic partner, which signals a vote of confidence in Serve's potential. However, investors should assess whether the dilutive effect of the new shares might impact their earnings per share.The additional 15% over-allotment option granted to Aegis Capital could lead to further dilution, but also provides a buffer for additional capital, which might be favorable if the stock performs well post-listing. The uplisting to the Nasdaq Capital Market is an important milestone that could increase the stock's visibility and liquidity, potentially attracting more institutional investors.Prospective and current investors should weigh the use of the proceeds against the company's growth strategies and the potential return on investment. It is essential to evaluate Serve's financials, market position and the competitive landscape of autonomous delivery services to make an informed decision. Market Research Analyst Examining the autonomous delivery market, Serve Robotics Inc.'s uplisting and capital raise position it to capitalize on growth trends in the sector. The infusion of $40 million, potentially rising to $46 million with the over-allotment option, underwrites technology development, market expansion and may enhance its competitive stance. The participation of Uber's subsidiary, Postmates, not only brings capital but could also mean strategic collaborations that might enhance Serve's market reach and operational synergies.Yet, the industry faces challenges such as regulatory hurdles, technological complexities and consumer acceptance. Investors should look at Serve's approach to these challenges and its ability to scale operations sustainably. As the company grows, one should monitor how effectively it utilizes the raised funds to navigate through these industry-specific barriers. 04/17/2024 - 09:57 PM SAN FRANCISCO, April 17, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Serve Robotics Inc.

OSLO, Norway, April 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- CO280 and Aker Carbon Capture have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) agreement with Microsoft to explore opportunities for scaling the full physical and digital value chain of carbon removal in the US and Canada. Together the three companies have the expertise, technologies, and resources to develop this market by creating a scalable model to deploy large-scale projects quickly to meet global net zero targets. The collaboration aspires to leverage the strengths and capabilities of each partner to enable the ecosystem for the voluntary carbon market by providing traceability of data and enabling high-integrity carbon credits. The three companies will collaborate to address the technological, regulatory, and commercial challenges and opportunities for creating carbon removal, with each party playing distinct commercial roles. The parties intend to collaborate on a non-exclusive basis. Under the terms of the MoU agreement, the parties agree to explore to: Develop biogenic carbon capture project(s), including projects currently in CO280's development pipeline, as well as additional projects; Apply CO280's expertise to jointly develop a standard and efficient screening process to evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of carbon capture on pulp and paper mills, with the subsequent deployment of Aker Carbon Capture's plants, including the modularized Just Catch series; Standardize the lifecycle assessment (LCA) and measurement, verification, and reporting (MRV) systems for capture projects in pulp and paper, with the ambition to leverage Microsoft's digital capabilities, cloud computing platforms, services, and solutions; Create a digital tool to compare CO280's planned projects against Microsoft Criteria for High Quality Carbon Removal; Advocate for policies and demonstrate thought leadership to promote the pulp and paper carbon capture market, with the corresponding creation and use of high-integrity carbon removal credits.North America's pulp and paper industry represents a carbon removal opportunity of up to 130 million tons per year, due to the fact that the average mill has a CO2 emissions profile that is 80-90% biogenic. By capturing and storing these emissions permanently, negative emissions are achieved as more carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere than is being emitted from the process. CO280 is the leading developer of Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) projects in the pulp and paper industry. In partnership with pulp and paper companies, CO280 develops, finances, owns, and operates large-scale CDR projects. CO280's projects address a critical supply gap in the CDR market by supplying permanent, verifiable, and affordable CDR to corporate buyers in the voluntary market. CO280 currently has more than 10 million tons per year of permanent CDR under development. ""This commitment on the part of three best-in-class companies is exactly the kind of bold move the industry needs to unlock the enormous removal opportunity in the pulp and paper industry and scale up the CDR market. Together, we are developing the largest scale, lowest cost, permanent carbon removal projects in the world,"" said Jonathan Rhone, Chief Executive Officer of CO280. Microsoft announced its ambitious Carbon goals back in 2020: To be carbon negative by 2030 and remove the company's aggregated carbon footprint by 2050. This journey starts with reducing carbon emissions as much as possible, replacing electricity consumption with carbon-free energy, and removing the emissions that remain. Microsoft has run an open process for carbon removal since 2020 and the company has shared learnings publicly. Microsoft is committed to creating a robust market for CDRs, including by building a digital value chain that authoritatively tracks carbon attributes and generates robust credits as simply as possible. For this to happen, engaging with companies that share the same goals is essential. ""Our collaboration with Aker Carbon Capture and CO280 builds on important large-scale initiatives across asset-intensive industries including pulp and paper,"" says Darryl Willis, Corporate Vice President of Energy and Resources Industry at Microsoft. ""By leveraging the power of technology to create a digital value chain for carbon tracking and reporting, we can equip the market for high-integrity carbon removal credits and further enable the industrial sector to decarbonize."" ""It's time to move past the first-of-a-kind and the demonstration projects for carbon removal. The deployment rate needs to be accelerated by the hundreds to deliver the `net' in net zero. We have demonstrated the strength of working together in the past, and we are excited to expand our collaboration with Microsoft and CO280 to further deliver impact,"" says Egil Fagerland, CEO of Aker Carbon Capture. Aker Carbon Capture is dedicated to enabling carbon removal and reduction and the company's proven Just Catch modular solutions enable industries to deploy their capture technology at speed and at scale. The company is currently delivering seven carbon capture units: five Just Catch 100 units to Ørsted, one Just Catch 100 unit to Twence and a Big Catch delivery to Heidelberg Materials at Brevik. Accelerating the large-scale deployment of carbon dioxide removals (CDR) is critical to the net-zero transition. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that more than one gigaton of CO2 per year will need to be captured by 2030, scaling up to more than six gigatons per year by 2050.

The 2024 ISG Provider Lens™ Microsoft Cloud Ecosystem report for Singapore and Malaysia finds more enterprises in the region are embracing Microsoft’s expanding lineup of platforms and seeking services for Microsoft 365, Azure (including SAP on Azure), Dynamics 365, Power Platform and Copilot. Companies are moving to the cloud for lower costs, greater agility and faster innovation as well as for better user experiences. To achieve these aims, they are engaging providers for managed services such as DevOps and containerization, ISG says. “More enterprises in Singapore and Malaysia now recognize the potential to grow by going cloud native,” said Michael Gale, partner and regional leader, ISG Asia Pacific. “Using DevOps and other tools helps them introduce new features and revenue streams.” At the same time, the market for cloud services in Singapore and Malaysia is growing more competitive as local players begin to challenge larger rivals, ISG says. This trend is likely to continue over the next five years. Though some employees are now returning to offices in these countries, remote and hybrid work are becoming part of long-term enterprise strategies, the report says. A growing number of companies are using Microsoft cloud platforms, especially Teams and Viva, to foster a sense of connection among employees and enable better internal and external collaboration. Enterprises in the region are also improving the experience of frontline workers by identifying and providing appropriate devices, applications and connectivity, ISG says. Microsoft Viva employee experience tools are central to these efforts, while companies also explore non-intrusive ways to engage with employees, including cognitive virtual assistants that perform routine tasks so workers can focus on critical work. Microsoft’s Copilot AI companions are beginning to democratize access to AI within enterprises, with new platforms allowing employees to automate workflows and tailor them to their own needs, the report says. AI and Copilot are powering initiatives to boost productivity, tap into employees’ creativity and retain top talent. “Copilots may become a killer app that creates a new universe of applications and marketplaces,” said Jan Erik Aase, partner and global leader, ISG Provider Lens Research. “Providers are helping clients reach the technical readiness to use Copilots in their own environments.” The report also explores other Microsoft cloud platform trends affecting Singapore and Malaysia, including GenAI projects advancing from experimentation to deployment and the rising use of AI to counter cybersecurity threats. For more insights into the Microsoft cloud-related challenges facing enterprises in these countries, including the difficulty of delivering better customer and employee experiences and the sometimes confusing array of providers to choose from, plus advice for addressing these issues, see the ISG Provider Lens™ Focal Points briefing here. The 2024 ISG Provider Lens™ Microsoft Cloud Ecosystem report for Singapore and Malaysia evaluates the capabilities of 29 providers across five quadrants: Managed Services for Azure, Microsoft 365 Services, SAP on Azure Services, Power Platform Services and Generative AI Services for Microsoft Clouds.

Financial Analyst The initiation of Centuri's IPO at $21.00 per share and its entry on the NYSE under the symbol CTRI is a strategic move that aims to raise capital for debt repayment and general corporate purposes. The offering size and the participation of entities affiliated with Carl Icahn, an influential investor, suggest strong market confidence. From an investor's perspective, the pricing of the IPO should be evaluated against industry comparables and growth prospects. The underwriters' over-allotment option provides a buffer for potential excess demand, indicating a positive outlook. However, it's important to consider the post-IPO performance, as it may differ from the initial excitement. Monitoring the actual use of the net proceeds and its impact on Centuri's financials is essential for evaluating the success of this corporate action. Market Research Analyst The choice of joint lead book-running managers—UBS Investment Bank, BofA Securities and J.P. Morgan—shows a robust underwriting team, potentially enhancing investor confidence. The energy and utilities sector, where Centuri operates, often requires significant capital for operations and growth, making the IPO a key financial milestone. Market trends toward sustainable and efficient energy solutions could also shape investor perceptions of Centuri's market position. The inclusion of a private placement alongside the IPO is a strategic maneuver to secure additional funding, possibly at lower transaction costs compared to the public market. The performance of Centuri's stock post-IPO will be a important indicator of the market's valuation of the company's future growth trajectory. 04/17/2024 - 06:15 PM LAS VEGAS and PHOENIX, April 17, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc.

Financial Analyst The closing of a $9.8 million registered direct offering by Bridger Aerospace is a strategic move to reinforce its financial position. The participation of directors and executive officers in the acquisition of over 808,080 shares demonstrates a strong vote of confidence in the company's potential and aligns management's interests with those of the shareholders. For retail investors, the direct offering indicates that Bridger is actively seeking to raise capital, potentially diluting existing shares but also possibly providing the company with the necessary funds to fuel its projected record growth in 2024. The use of net proceeds for working capital suggests a focus on short-term operational needs, which could help smooth out cash flow and support day-to-day business activities. It's essential to monitor how this capital is allocated and whether it translates into the anticipated growth and operational efficiency. Market Research Analyst Bridger Aerospace's direct offering comes at a time when the aerospace sector is experiencing significant technological changes and increasing competitive pressures. The capital infusion will potentially allow Bridger to invest in areas critical to maintaining its competitive edge. Given the CEO's mention of the 'earliest fleet deployment in Company history,' it's reasonable to infer that Bridger is expanding its operational capacity. For an investor, the timing of the capital raise is crucial, as it reflects the company's strategic planning capabilities and offers insights into its growth trajectory. Analyzing industry benchmarks, Bridger's move to secure funding ahead of a pivotal year could set a precedence for other companies in the sector. It's prudent to evaluate how Bridger's growth metrics compare post-financing to peers to gauge the effectiveness of the capital utilization. 04/17/2024 - 06:35 PM BELGRADE, Mont., April 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bridger Aerospace Group Holdings, Inc.

Cal Water developed and installed treatment for the contaminant in its impacted water systems in Dixon, Oak Hills (Salinas), Las Lomas (Salinas), and Willows when the same chromium-6 MCL, which was subsequently vacated for administrative reasons, was originally set in 2014. In fact, Cal Water’s treatment system design was used as a model for other water utilities. After the MCL was vacated, Cal Water continued to treat those wells to protect customer health and safety. Cal Water plans to install treatment at a newer well that was brought online in Oak Hills, as well as at another well in Dixon that currently does not serve customers but could, if needed, within the two- to four-year compliance timeline. All other active wells above the MCL in these service areas are already being treated. “We take our responsibility to protect our customers’ health and safety very seriously; that’s why we continued to treat impacted water systems after the chromium-6 MCL was temporarily vacated,” said Martin A. Kropelnicki, Cal Water Chairman & CEO. “We remain committed to meeting all state and federal standards set to protect public health and safety.” Beyond removing chromium-6 from its affected water sources, Cal Water works to be a responsible steward of the environment. The utility sends the chromium-6 removed through the treatment process to be recycled for use by other industries.

Positive Great Southern Bancorp, Inc. reported a net income of $13.4 million for the first quarter of 2024, with earnings of $1.13 per diluted common share. The company's net interest income decreased by approximately 15.7% to $44.8 million compared to the same period last year. Total outstanding loans decreased slightly by 0.1% to $4.59 billion at the end of March 2024. Non-performing assets and potential problem loans increased to $28.7 million, mainly due to a single loan relationship in the other residential loan category. The company's capital position remained strong, exceeding regulatory thresholds, with a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of 11.0% and a Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 11.9% as of March 31, 2024. Negative Net interest income decreased by approximately 15.7% in the first quarter of 2024. Total outstanding loans decreased slightly by 0.1% at the end of March 2024. Non-performing assets and potential problem loans increased to $28.7 million, mainly due to a single loan relationship in the other residential loan category. Financial Analyst Analyzing Great Southern Bancorp's earnings report, the reduced net income from $20.5 million to $13.4 million highlights a drop in profitability. The decline in net interest income by $8.4 million or 15.7% is noteworthy. This could be attributed to the rising deposit costs and the intense competition, which are squeezing margins. Also, with the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes, it's evident that banks' funding costs will rise, affecting their net interest margins.The dip in loan origination volume is concerning, as it suggests a potential slowdown in the bank's core revenue-generating activities. However, total non-interest expenses being generally unchanged year over year provides a silver lining of controlled operational costs. Investors should consider the bank's capital ratios, which remain robust and exceed regulatory thresholds, indicating a strong capital buffer. Credit Analyst From a credit perspective, the increase in non-performing assets from $19.1 million to $28.7 million is significant. This could indicate deteriorating loan quality and warrants close monitoring. It's particularly important to understand the specifics of the single loan relationship that led to a substantial part of this increase. While the overall percentage of non-performing assets is still relatively low (0.4% of total assets), any upward trend could impact investor confidence and the bank's ability to lend.The uninsured deposit level, at 15% of total deposits, suggests a moderate risk, since these funds could be more sensitive to market conditions and potentially lead to liquidity strains. Market Analyst Great Southern Bancorp's situation reflects broader market trends, with many banks navigating higher interest rates and competitive deposit markets. The overall economic uncertainty mentioned by the CEO resonates with the current environment, where consumer and investment behaviors are shifting. The company's strategy to manage these headwinds is important for investors. However, the reimbursement for marketing costs from their debit card brand provider is a positive note, indicating the potential for strategic partnerships to offset expenses.The company's liquidity reserves, with significant borrowing capacity at the FHLBank and Federal Reserve Bank, provide a cushion which enables flexibility amidst market volatility. This should be reassuring for investors focused on the bank's ability to manage short-term obligations. 04/17/2024 - 06:00 PM Preliminary Financial Results and Other Matters for the Quarter Ended March 31, 2024: Significant or Non-Recurring Items: During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recorded the following significant or non-recurring items:(1) an expense in Legal and Professional Fees totaling $929,000 related to training and implementation costs for the core systems conversion and professional fees to consultants that were engaged to support the Company in its transition of core and ancillary software and information technology systems.(2) the Company received an annual marketing and card expense reimbursement for qualifying expenditures from its debit card brand provider of $423,000; this was used to offset marketing and advertising costs that included this branding.Liquidity: The Company had secured borrowing line availability at the FHLBank and Federal Reserve Bank of $1.23 billion and $391.9 million, respectively, at March 31, 2024. In addition, at March 31, 2024, the Company had unpledged securities with a market value totaling $344.7 million, which could be pledged as collateral for additional borrowing capacity at either the FHLBank or Federal Reserve Bank, if needed or desired. The Company estimates that its uninsured deposits, excluding deposit accounts of the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries, were approximately $710.2 million (15% of total deposits) at March 31, 2024. The Company believes it has ample sources of liquidity.Capital: The Company’s capital position remained strong as of March 31, 2024, significantly exceeding the thresholds established by regulators. On a preliminary basis, as of March 31, 2024, the Company’s Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 11.0%, Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 11.9%, Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 12.4%, and Total Capital Ratio was 15.1%.

Net interest income and net interest margin in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $45.1 million and 3.30%, respectively. Competition for deposits and higher market interest rates, along with a shift in the funding mix, resulted in increased funding costs in the first quarter of 2024.Total Loans: Total outstanding loans, excluding mortgage loans held for sale, decreased $3.4 million, or 0.1%, from $4.59 billion at December 31, 2023 to $4.59 billion at March 31, 2024.

The increase in non-performing assets was mainly related to a single loan relationship in the other residential (multi-family) loan category. See “Asset Quality” section for additional information regarding the changes to non-performing assets. SPRINGFIELD, Mo., April 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Great Southern Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:GSBC), the holding company for Great Southern Bank, today reported that preliminary earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2024, were $1.13 per diluted common share ($13.4 million net income) compared to $1.67 per diluted common share ($20.5 million net income) for the three months ended March 31, 2023. For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, annualized return on average common equity was 9.36%, annualized return on average assets was 0.93%, and annualized net interest margin was 3.32%, compared to 14.88%, 1.43% and 3.99%, respectively, for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. Great Southern President and CEO Joseph W. Turner said, “Our first quarter performance was steady as we continue to operate in an uncertain and challenging economic environment. Great Southern earned $1.13 per diluted common share ($13.4 million) for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $1.67 per diluted common share ($20.5 million) for the first quarter of 2023, and $1.11 per diluted common share ($13.1 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023. Reflective of current market interest rate and credit conditions, key drivers of our performance included continued moderate increases in deposit costs, significant competition for deposits and lower loan origination volume. Total non-interest expense compared to the year ago first quarter was generally unchanged. Total non-interest expense decreased significantly from the fourth quarter of 2023; as we highlighted previously, there were some significant non-recurring expenses that we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023. “Like many other banks, we experienced overall higher deposit costs during the first quarter of 2024, primarily due to current market interest rates and competitive pressures. While deposit interest expenses increased, the pace of the increase has moderated compared to the last few quarters. These higher funding costs drove a decrease in net interest income – approximately $8.4 million lower in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023, and about $331,000 lower compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Higher funding costs in the first quarter of 2024 were partially caused by a moderate amount of time deposits maturing at rates which are a bit lower than current replacement rates and due to some deposits shifting from non-interest-bearing accounts to interest-bearing deposit products. In addition to the higher funding cost of deposits, net interest income was negatively affected compared to the year-ago quarter by the Company’s interest rate swaps (two of which began net settlements in May 2023). During the first quarter of 2024 and fourth quarter of 2023, these two interest rate swaps combined to reduce interest income by $2.8 million in each of those two quarters. These swaps had no impact in quarters prior to the second quarter of 2023. Another interest rate swap contractually terminated March 1, 2024, which reduced interest income by $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $2.2 million in the same period in 2023. With this termination, there will be no further financial impact from this swap.” Turner added, “As anticipated, total outstanding loan balances decreased slightly since the end of 2023. The decreases primarily occurred in commercial business loans and commercial real estate loans, partially offset by an increase in other residential (multi-family) loans. Much of the increase in other residential loans was the movement of completed projects from the construction loan category. At the end of March 2024, the pipeline of loan commitments and unfunded lines increased slightly to $1.2 billion, including $680 million in the unfunded portion of construction loans. Overall credit quality metrics remained strong during the quarter, although non-performing assets did increase. Non-performing assets to total assets were 0.37% at March 31, 2024 versus 0.20% at December 31, 2023. Compared to the end of 2023, non-performing assets increased $9.5 million to $21.3 million at the end of March 2024. The majority of this increase was in the other residential (multi-family) loans category and was due to the unique circumstances of one distinct credit relationship. Delinquencies in our loan portfolio remained at low levels and net charge-offs were not significant in the first quarter of 2024. “The Company’s capital and liquidity positions remain strong. Total stockholders’ equity was $565.2 million as of March 31, 2024, decreasing by $6.7 million from the end of 2023. Our capital remains substantially above regulatory well-capitalized thresholds. Our tangible common equity ratio was 9.6% at the end of the first quarter of 2024. The Company declared a $0.40 per common share dividend and continued to repurchase shares of its common stock, with approximately 112,000 shares repurchased at an average price of $51.44 during the first quarter of 2024. “In terms of liquidity, the Company had available secured funding lines through the Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve Bank, along with on-balance sheet liquidity totaling approximately $2.1 billion as of March 31, 2024. Great Southern’s deposit base remained diverse in terms of customer type and geography, with a relatively low level of uninsured deposits as of March 31, 2024 (approximately 15% of total deposits, excluding internal subsidiary accounts).” Selected Financial Data: (In thousands, except per share data)Three Months EndedMarch 31, 2024 2023 Net interest income$44,816 $53,192 Provision for credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments 630 674 Non-interest income 6,806 7,889 Non-interest expense 34,422 34,463 Provision for income taxes 3,163 5,488 Net income$13,407 $20,456 Earnings per diluted common share$1.13 $1.67 NET INTEREST INCOME Net interest income for the first quarter of 2024 decreased $8.4 million to $44.8 million, compared to $53.2 million for the first quarter of 2023. Net interest margin was 3.32% in the first quarter of 2024, compared to 3.99% in the same period of 2023, a decrease of 67 basis points. Net interest margin was 3.30% in the fourth quarter of 2023. In comparing the 2024 and 2023 first quarter periods, the average yield on loans increased 37 basis points, the average yield on investment securities increased 14 basis points and the average yield on other interest earning assets increased 71 basis points. The margin contraction primarily resulted from increasing interest rates on all deposit types due to higher market interest rates and increased competition for deposits. The average rate on interest-bearing demand and savings deposits, time deposits and brokered deposits increased 90 basis points, 186 basis points and 72 basis points, respectively, in the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. The average interest rate spread was 2.66% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to 3.53% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2.65% for the three months ended December 31, 2023. The ratio of average interest-earning assets to average interest-bearing liabilities decreased from 133.3% in the three months ended March 31, 2023, to 127.4% in the three months ended March 31, 2024. In October 2018, the Company entered into an interest rate swap transaction as part of its ongoing interest rate management strategies to hedge the risk of its floating rate loans. The notional amount of the swap was $400 million with a contractual termination date in October 2025. As previously disclosed by the Company, on March 2, 2020, the Company and its swap counterparty mutually agreed to terminate this swap, effective immediately. The Company was paid $45.9 million, including accrued but unpaid interest, from its swap counterparty as a result of this termination. This $45.9 million, less the accrued to date interest portion and net of deferred income taxes, is reflected in the Company’s stockholders’ equity as part of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) and is being accreted to interest income on loans monthly through the original contractual termination date of October 6, 2025. The Company recorded $2.0 million of interest income related to the swap in each of the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company currently expects to have a sufficient amount of eligible variable rate loans to continue to accrete this interest income ratably in future periods. If this expectation changes and the amount of eligible variable rate loans decreases significantly, the Company may be required to recognize this interest income more rapidly. In March 2022, the Company entered into another interest rate swap transaction as part of its ongoing interest rate management strategies to hedge the risk of its floating rate loans. The notional amount of the swap was $300 million, with a contractual termination date of March 1, 2024. Under the terms of the swap, the Company received a fixed rate of interest of 1.6725% and paid a floating rate of interest equal to one-month USD-LIBOR (or the equivalent replacement USD-SOFR rate once USD-LIBOR rate ceased to be available). The floating rate was reset monthly and net settlements of interest due to/from the counterparty also occurred monthly. To the extent that the fixed rate exceeded one-month USD-LIBOR/SOFR, the Company received net interest settlements, which were recorded as loan interest income. If one-month USD-LIBOR/SOFR exceeded the fixed rate of interest, the Company paid net settlements to the counterparty and recorded those net payments as a reduction of interest income on loans. The Company recorded a reduction of loan interest income related to this swap transaction of $1.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to a reduction of $2.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023. The Company recorded a reduction of loan interest income related to this swap transaction of $2.9 million in the three months ended December 31, 2023. As this interest rate swap has reached its contractual termination date, there will be no further interest income impacts related to this swap. In July 2022, the Company entered into two additional interest rate swap transactions as part of its ongoing interest rate management strategies to hedge the risk of its floating rate loans. The notional amount of each swap is $200 million with an effective date of May 1, 2023 and a termination date of May 1, 2028. Under the terms of one swap, the Company receives a fixed rate of interest of 2.628% and pays a floating rate of interest equal to one-month USD-SOFR OIS. Under the terms of the other swap, the Company receives a fixed rate of interest of 5.725% and pays a floating rate of interest equal to one-month USD-Prime. In each case, the floating rate resets monthly and net settlements of interest due to/from the counterparty also occur monthly. To the extent the fixed rate of interest exceeds the floating rate of interest, the Company receives net interest settlements, which are recorded as loan interest income. If the floating rate of interest exceeds the fixed rate of interest, the Company pays net settlements to the counterparty and records those net payments as a reduction of interest income on loans. The Company recorded a reduction of loan interest income related to these swap transactions of $2.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to no reduction of interest income in the 2023 period. At March 31, 2024, the USD-Prime rate was 8.50% and the one-month USD-SOFR OIS rate was 5.32240%. The Company’s net interest income was negatively impacted in the first quarter of 2024 by the high level of competition for deposits due to asset growth across the industry and the lingering effects of liquidity events at several banks in March 2023. The Company also had a substantial amount of time deposits maturing at relatively low rates after the first quarter of 2023, and these time deposits either renewed at higher rates or left the Company, in turn requiring their replacement with other funding sources at then-current higher market rates. As of March 31, 2024, time deposit maturities over the next 12 months were as follows: within three months -- $368.5 million with a weighted-average rate of 4.31%; within three to six months -- $419.6 million with a weighted-average rate of 4.47%; and within six to twelve months -- $390.9 million with a weighted-average rate of 4.17%. Based on time deposit market rates in March 2024, replacement rates for these maturing time deposits are likely to be approximately 4.00-4.50%. For additional information on net interest income components, see the “Average Balances, Interest Rates and Yields” tables in this release. NON-INTEREST INCOME For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, non-interest income decreased $1.1 million to $6.8 million when compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2023, primarily as a result of the following items: Overdraft and Insufficient funds fees: Overdraft and Insufficient funds fees decreased $607,000 compared to the prior year quarter. This decrease was primarily due to a continuation of a multi-year trend whereby our customers are choosing to forego authorizing payments of certain items which exceed their account balances, resulting in fewer overdrafts in checking accounts and related fees.Point-of-sale and ATM fees: Point-of-sale and ATM fees decreased $518,000 compared to the prior year quarter. This decrease was primarily due to a portion of these transactions now being routed through channels with lower fees to us, which we expect will continue in future periods, and slightly lower usage of debit cards by our customers.Other income: Other income decreased $465,000 compared to the prior year quarter. In the 2024 period, the Company recorded $404,000 related to activity incentives for debit card usage, compared to $799,000 in the 2023 period. NON-INTEREST EXPENSE For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, non-interest expense decreased $41,000 to $34.4 million when compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2023, primarily as a result of the following items: Advertising: Advertising fees decreased $297,000 from the prior year quarter, to $350,000. In the 2024 period, the Company received an annual marketing and card expense reimbursement for qualifying expenditures from its debit card brand provider of $423,000; this was used to offset marketing and advertising costs that included this branding. In the previous year period, $321,000 of this annual reimbursement was applied to marketing and advertising expenses.Legal, Audit and Other Professional Fees: Legal, audit and other professional fees decreased $256,000 from the prior year quarter, to $1.7 million. In the 2023 period, the Company expensed a total of $1.3 million related to legal expenses and training and implementation costs for the core systems conversion and professional fees to consultants engaged to support the Company’s transition of core and ancillary software and information technology systems. In the 2024 period, this expense was $929,000.Salaries and employee benefits: Salaries and employee benefits increased $453,000 from the prior year quarter. A majority of this increase related to normal annual merit increases in various lending and operations areas.Insurance: Insurance expense increased $277,000 from the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to increases in deposit insurance rates for the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund, which went into effect in 2023. The Company’s efficiency ratio for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, was 66.68% compared to 56.42% for the same quarter in 2023. The Company’s ratio of non-interest expense to average assets was 2.39% and 2.42% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Average assets for the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased $57.8 million, or 1.0%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase in net loans receivable and interest bearing cash equivalents, partially offset by a decrease in investment securities. INCOME TAXES For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s effective tax rate was 19.1% and 21.2%, respectively. These effective rates were near or below the statutory federal tax rate of 21%, due primarily to the utilization of certain investment tax credits and the Company’s tax-exempt investments and tax-exempt loans, which reduced the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company’s effective tax rate may fluctuate in future periods as it is impacted by the level and timing of the Company’s utilization of tax credits, the level of tax-exempt investments and loans, the amount of taxable income in various state jurisdictions and the overall level of pre-tax income. State tax expense estimates continually evolve as taxable income and apportionment between states is analyzed. The Company’s effective income tax rate is currently generally expected to remain at or below the statutory federal tax rate due primarily to the factors noted above. The Company currently expects its effective tax rate (combined federal and state) will be approximately 18.5% to 20.5% in future periods, primarily due to additional investment tax credits expected to be utilized beginning in 2024. CAPITAL As of March 31, 2024, total stockholders’ equity and common stockholders’ equity were each $565.2 million (9.8% of total assets), equivalent to a book value of $48.31 per common share. Total stockholders’ equity and common stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2023, were each $571.8 million (9.8% of total assets), equivalent to a book value of $48.44 per common share. At March 31, 2024, the Company’s tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 9.6%, compared to 9.7% at December 31, 2023. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Included in stockholders’ equity at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, were unrealized losses (net of taxes) on the Company’s available-for-sale investment securities totaling $45.9 million and $40.5 million, respectively. This change in net unrealized loss during the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily resulted from increasing intermediate-term market interest rates, which generally decreased the fair value of investment securities. In addition, included in stockholders’ equity at March 31, 2024, were realized gains (net of taxes) on the Company’s terminated cash flow hedge (interest rate swap), totaling $9.5 million. This amount, plus associated deferred taxes, is expected to be accreted to interest income over the remaining term of the original interest rate swap contract, which was to end in October 2025. At March 31, 2024, the remaining pre-tax amount to be recorded in interest income was $12.3 million. The net effect on total stockholders’ equity over time will be no impact as the reduction of this realized gain will be offset by an increase in retained earnings (as the interest income flows through pre-tax income). Also included in stockholders’ equity at March 31, 2024, was an unrealized loss (net of taxes) on the Company’s two outstanding cash flow hedges (interest rate swaps) totaling $16.0 million. Increases in market interest rates since the inception of these hedges have caused their fair values to decrease. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, decreasing forward swap rates resulted in increasing fair values of these hedges. However, during the three months ended March 31, 2024, increasing forward swap rates resulted in decreasing fair values of these hedges. As noted above, total stockholders’ equity decreased $6.7 million, from $571.8 million at December 31, 2023 to $565.2 million at March 31, 2024. Stockholders’ equity decreased due to repurchases of the Company’s common stock totaling $5.8 million and dividends declared on common stock of $4.7 million. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss increased $10.0 million (decrease to stockholders’ equity) during the three month ended March 31, 2024, primarily due to changes in the market value of available-for-sale securities and changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges. Partially offsetting these decreases were net income of $13.4 million for the three month ended March 31, 2024 and an increase of $692,000 due to stock option exercises. The adoption of a new accounting standard (ASU 2023-02) in the first quarter of 2024 also decreased equity by $223,000. The Company had unrealized losses on its portfolio of held-to-maturity investment securities, which totaled $25.6 million at March 31, 2024, that were not included in its total capital balance. If these held-to-maturity unrealized losses were included in capital (net of taxes), they would have decreased total stockholder’s equity by $19.3 million at March 31, 2024. This amount was equal to 3.4% of total stockholders’ equity of $565.2 million. On a preliminary basis, as of March 31, 2024, the Company’s Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 11.0%, Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 11.9%, Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 12.4%, and Total Capital Ratio was 15.1%. On March 31, 2024, and on a preliminary basis, the Bank’s Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 11.5%, Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 13.0%, Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 13.0%, and Total Capital Ratio was 14.2%. In December 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to one million shares of the Company’s common stock. At March 31, 2024, a total of approximately 615,000 shares remained available under our stock repurchase authorization. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company repurchased 112,362 shares of its common stock at an average price of $51.44 and declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per common share, which, combined, reduced stockholders’ equity by $10.5 million. LIQUIDITY AND DEPOSITS Liquidity is a measure of the Company’s ability to generate sufficient cash to meet present and future financial obligations in a timely manner. Liquid assets include cash, interest-bearing deposits with financial institutions and certain investment securities and loans. As a result of the Company’s ability to generate liquidity primarily through liability funding, management believes that the Company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its depositors’ requirements and meet its borrowers’ credit needs. The Company’s primary sources of funds are customer deposits, FHLBank advances, other borrowings, loan repayments, unpledged securities, proceeds from sales of loans and available-for-sale securities and funds provided from operations. The Company utilizes some or all of these sources of funds depending on the comparative costs and availability at the time. The Company has from time to time chosen not to pay rates on deposits as high as the rates paid by certain of its competitors and, when believed to be appropriate, supplements deposits with less expensive alternative sources of funds. At March 31, 2024, the Company had the following available secured lines and on-balance sheet liquidity: March 31, 2024Federal Home Loan Bank line $1,227.2 millionFederal Reserve Bank line 391.9 millionCash and cash equivalents 171.4 millionUnpledged securities – Available-for-sale 317.9 millionUnpledged securities – Held-to-maturity 26.8 million During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company’s total deposits increased $51.7 million. Interest-bearing checking balances increased $79.3 million (about 3.6%), primarily in money market accounts, while non-interest-bearing checking balances decreased $18.8 million (about 2.1%). Brokered deposits increased $24.0 million. Time deposits generated through the Company’s banking center and corporate services networks decreased $29.7 million. At March 31, 2024, the Company had the following deposit balances: March 31, 2024Interest-bearing checking $2,295.7 millionNon-interest-bearing checking 876.7 millionTime deposits 915.5 millionBrokered deposits 685.5 million LOANS Total net loans, excluding mortgage loans held for sale, decreased $3.4 million, or 0.1%, from December 31, 2023, to $4.59 billion at March 31, 2024. This decrease was primarily in commercial business loans ($58.6 million decrease), commercial real estate loans ($18.4 million decrease), construction loans ($11.8 million decrease) and one- to four-family residential loans ($10.2 million decrease), significantly offset by an increase in other residential (multi-family) loans ($98.2 million increase). The pipeline of loan commitments increased slightly in the first quarter of 2024. The unfunded portion of construction loans remained significant, but declined, in the first quarter of 2024. As construction projects were completed, the related loans were either moved from the construction category to the appropriate permanent loan categories or paid off. For further information about the Company’s loan portfolio, please see the quarterly loan portfolio presentation available on the Company’s Investor Relations website under “Presentations.” Loan commitments and the unfunded portion of loans at the dates indicated were as follows (in thousands): March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021Closed non-construction loans with unused available lines Secured by real estate (one- to four-family)$206,992$203,964$199,182$175,682Secured by real estate (not one- to four-family) — — — 23,752Not secured by real estate – commercial business 120,387 82,435 104,452 91,786 Closed construction loans with unused available lines Secured by real estate (one-to four-family) 103,839 101,545 100,669 74,501Secured by real estate (not one-to four-family) 680,149 719,039 1,444,450 1,092,029 Loan commitments not closed Secured by real estate (one-to four-family) 20,410 12,347 16,819 53,529Secured by real estate (not one-to four-family) 50,858 48,153 157,645 146,826Not secured by real estate – commercial business 9,022 11,763 50,145 12,920 $1,191,657$1,179,246$2,073,362$1,671,025 PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES Management estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level or term, as well as for changes in economic conditions, including but not limited to changes in the national unemployment rate, commercial real estate price index, consumer sentiment, gross domestic product (GDP) and construction spending. Challenging or worsening economic conditions from higher inflation or interest rates, COVID-19 and subsequent variant outbreaks or similar events, global unrest or other factors may lead to increased losses in the portfolio and/or requirements for an increase in provision expense. Management maintains various controls in an attempt to identify and limit future losses, such as a watch list of problem loans and potential problem loans, documented loan administration policies and loan review staff to review the quality and anticipated collectability of the portfolio. Additional procedures provide for frequent management review of the loan portfolio based on loan size, loan type, delinquencies, financial analysis, ongoing correspondence with borrowers and problem loan workouts. Management determines which loans are collateral-dependent, evaluates risk of loss and makes additional provisions to expense, if necessary, to maintain the allowance at a satisfactory level. During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Company recorded provision expense of $500,000 on its portfolio of outstanding loans, compared to a $1.5 million provision recorded for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. Total net charge-offs were $83,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to net recoveries of $7,000 in the three months ended March 31, 2023. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recorded a provision for losses on unfunded commitments of $130,000, compared to a negative provision of $826,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Total unfunded commitments decreased significantly during 2023, resulting in a lower required reserve, while total unfunded commitments did not change significantly in the three months ended March 31, 2024. General market conditions and unique circumstances related to specific industries and individual projects contribute to the level of provisions and charge-offs. The Bank’s allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.40% and 1.39% at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Management considers the allowance for credit losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the Bank’s loan portfolio at March 31, 2024, based on recent reviews of the Bank’s loan portfolio and current economic conditions. If challenging economic conditions were to last longer than anticipated or deteriorate further or management’s assessment of the loan portfolio were to change, additional credit loss provisions could be required, thereby adversely affecting the Company’s future results of operations and financial condition. ASSET QUALITY At March 31, 2024, non-performing assets were $21.3 million, an increase of $9.5 million from $11.8 million at December 31, 2023. Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets were 0.37% at March 31, 2024, compared to 0.20% at December 31, 2023. As a result of changes in loan portfolio composition, changes in economic and market conditions and other factors specific to a borrower’s circumstances, the level of non-performing assets will fluctuate. Compared to December 31, 2023, non-performing loans increased $9.6 million to $21.3 million at March 31, 2024. The majority of this increase was in the non-performing other residential (multi-family) loans category, which increased $9.6 million from December 31, 2023. Activity in the non-performing loans categories during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, was as follows: BeginningBalance,January 1 Additionsto Non-Performing Removedfrom Non-Performing Transfersto PotentialProblemLoans Transfers toForeclosedAssets andRepossessions Charge-Offs Payments EndingBalance,March 31 (In thousands) One- to four-family construction$—$—$— $—$—$— $— $—Subdivision construction — — — — — — — —Land development 384 — — — — — — 384Commercial construction — — — — — — — —One- to four-family residential 722 68 (148) — — — (16) 626Other residential (multi-family) — 9,572 — — — — — 9,572Commercial real estate 10,552 461 — — — — (401) 10,612Commercial business 31 — — — — (31) — —Consumer 59 41 — — — (8) (15) 77Total non-performing loans$11,748$10,142$(148)$—$—$(39)$(432)$21,271 At March 31, 2024, the non-performing commercial real estate category included five loans, two of which were added during the current quarter. The largest relationship in the category, which totaled $7.9 million, or 74.7% of the total category, was added to non-performing loans during the second quarter of 2023 and is collateralized by an office building in Missouri. Another loan totaling $2.2 million, which was a purchased participation loan originally obtained through an FDIC-assisted acquisition, was included in non-performing loans at December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024. This loan is collateralized by a low-income assisted living facility in Wisconsin. During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, material terms were changed on this loan, including the Company purchasing the lead participant’s $220,000 interest in this note. The other residential (multi-family) category of non-performing loans included one loan, which totaled $9.6 million and was added during the current quarter. The Company purchased a participation interest in this loan in 2018, and was not the lead lender for the relationship. This loan was collateralized by a student housing project in Texas and was foreclosed upon in April 2024. The Company does not currently expect any material charge-off on this foreclosed asset. The non-performing one- to four-family residential category included three loans, one of which was added during the current quarter. The largest relationship in the category totaled $529,000, or 84.4% of the category. The non-performing land development category consisted of one loan added during the first quarter of 2021, which totaled $384,000 and is collateralized by unimproved zoned vacant ground in southern Illinois. The non-performing consumer category included eight loans, five of which were added during the current quarter. Potential problem loans increased $16,000 from December 31, 2023. The increase during the quarter was primarily due to multiple loans totaling $109,000 added to potential problem loans, partially offset by $72,000 in loan payments and $21,000 in charge offs. Activity in the potential problem loans category during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, was as follows: BeginningBalance,January 1 Additions toPotentialProblem RemovedfromPotentialProblem Transfersto Non-Performing Transfers toForeclosedAssets andRepossessions Charge-Offs Loan Advances (Payments) EndingBalance,March 31 (In thousands) One- to four-family construction$—$—$—$—$—$— $— $— Subdivision construction — — — — — — — — Land development — — — — — — — — Commercial construction — — — — — — — — One- to four-family residential 158 25 — — — — (62) 121 Other residential (multi-family) 7,162 — — — — — — 7,162 Commercial real estate — — — — — — — — Commercial business — 13 — — — — — 13 Consumer 54 71 — — — (21) (10) 94 Total potential problem loans$7,374$109$—$—$—$(21)$(72)$7,390 At March 31, 2024, the other residential (multi-family) category of potential problem loans included one loan, which totaled $7.2 million and was added to potential problem loans in the fourth quarter of 2023. This loan is collateralized by an apartment and retail project in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. This loan was fully paid off in April 2024. The one- to four-family residential category of potential problem loans included two loans, one of which was added during the current quarter. The largest relationship in this category totaled $98,000, or 81.0% of the total category. The commercial business category of potential problem loans included one loan, which totaled $13,000, and was added during the current quarter. The consumer category of potential problem loans included nine loans, six of which were added during the current quarter.

BUSINESS INITIATIVES Since early 2022, Great Southern has been preparing to convert to a new core banking platform (New System) to be delivered by a third-party vendor. As previously disclosed, the migration to the New System, originally scheduled for the third quarter of 2023, was delayed to mid-2024. The migration to the New System has now been put on hold. As also previously disclosed, certain contractual disputes have arisen between Great Southern and the third-party vendor. While discussions have been ongoing between the parties for an extended period of time, to date, there has been no meaningful progress in resolving the contractual disputes. There is no assurance that a resolution with the vendor will be achieved, or that a migration to the New System can be successfully completed, which may prompt Great Southern to take additional action to protect its interests. In the meantime, Great Southern expects to continue operations with its current core banking provider, which will allow Great Southern to offer its full array of products and services. A retail banking center in Springfield, Missouri, was consolidated into a nearby banking center in January 2024. The office at 600 W. Republic Road was consolidated into the Great Southern banking center located at 2945 W. Republic Road, a short distance away. This property is under contract to sell, with closing scheduled in April 2024. The Company announced that its 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders will be held at 10 a.m. Central Time on May 8, 2024, and will be held in a virtual format.

The Company’s ability to predict results or the actual effects of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain, and the Company’s actual results could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to: (i) expected revenues, cost savings, earnings accretion, synergies and other benefits from the Company’s merger and acquisition activities might not be realized within the anticipated time frames or at all, and costs or difficulties relating to integration matters, including but not limited to customer and employee retention, might be greater than expected; (ii) changes in economic conditions, either nationally or in the Company’s market areas; (iii) the remaining effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on general economic and financial market conditions and on public health; (iv) fluctuations in interest rates, the effects of inflation or a potential recession, whether caused by Federal Reserve actions or otherwise; (v) the impact of bank failures or adverse developments at other banks and related negative press about the banking industry in general on investor and depositor sentiment; (vi) slower economic growth caused by changes in energy prices, supply chain disruptions or other factors; (vii) the risks of lending and investing activities, including changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and write-offs and changes in estimates of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses; (viii) the possibility of realized or unrealized losses on securities held in the Company’s investment portfolio; (ix) the Company’s ability to access cost-effective funding and maintain sufficient liquidity; (x) fluctuations in real estate values and both residential and commercial real estate market conditions; (xi) the ability to adapt successfully to technological changes to meet customers’ needs and developments in the marketplace; (xii) the possibility that security measures implemented might not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of a cyber-attack or cyber theft, and that such security measures might not protect against systems failures or interruptions; (xiii) legislative or regulatory changes that adversely affect the Company’s business; (xiv) changes in accounting policies and practices or accounting standards; (xv) results of examinations of the Company and Great Southern Bank by their regulators, including the possibility that the regulators may, among other things, require the Company to limit its business activities, change its business mix, increase its allowance for credit losses, write-down assets or increase its capital levels, or affect its ability to borrow funds or maintain or increase deposits, which could adversely affect its liquidity and earnings; (xvi) costs and effects of litigation, including settlements and judgments; (xvii) competition; and (xviii) natural disasters, war, terrorist activities or civil unrest and their effects on economic and business environments in which the Company operates.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This document contains certain financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). This non-GAAP financial information includes the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio. In calculating the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets, we subtract period-end intangible assets from common equity and from total assets. Management believes that the presentation of this measure excluding the impact of intangible assets provides useful supplemental information that is helpful in understanding our financial condition and results of operations, as it provides a method to assess management’s success in utilizing our tangible capital as well as our capital strength. Management also believes that providing a measure that excludes balances of intangible assets, which are subjective components of valuation, facilitates the comparison of our performance with the performance of our peers. In addition, management believes that this is a standard financial measure used in the banking industry to evaluate performance. This non-GAAP financial measurement is supplemental and is not a substitute for any analysis based on GAAP financial measures. Because not all companies use the same calculation of non-GAAP measures, this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures as calculated by other companies.

Great Southern Bancorp, Inc. reported earnings of $1.13 per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2024. How did the company's net interest income change in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period last year? The company's net interest income decreased by approximately 15.7% to $44.8 million in the first quarter of 2024. What was the total outstanding loans amount at the end of March 2024? Total outstanding loans amounted to $4.59 billion at the end of March 2024. Why did non-performing assets and potential problem loans increase in the first quarter of 2024? The increase was mainly due to a single loan relationship in the other residential loan category. What were the company's capital ratios as of March 31, 2024? The company had a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of 11.0% and a Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 11.9% as of March 31, 2024."

(OTCQB: MNTR), a classic energy company, in its 2023 10-K, reported cash of $0.10 per share with no net debt versus today’s share price of $0.04 per share. During 2023, the Company announced that the theoretical cash breakup value of the business may exceed the price of the stock. In support and response, three directors, including the CEO, purchased a total of 2,128,117 Mentor common shares. Commencing in June 2023, the Company initiated and soon thereafter completed the stock repurchase of the final 255,252 of a 300,000 share repurchase plan. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a second stock repurchase plan authorizing the Company to repurchase up to 3,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. The second stock repurchase is anticipated to start during the spring of 2024. On October 4, 2023, Mentor sold its interest in a subsidiary unit in a $6,000,000 transaction comprised of $5,000,000 in cash and a $1,000,000 one-year note. The cash proceeds of the sale were used to increase Mentor Capital’s energy investments in Exxon Mobil Corp., Occidental Petroleum Corp., Chevron Corp., Cameco Corp., a uranium investment, and Arch Resources, Inc., a coal investment, which together now total the majority of the Company’s non-cash assets. At year-end, substantially all debts and liabilities of the Company were retired including significant accumulated benefits owed to the CEO from over a large number of years. The meeting fees to directors were increased to $2,500, and the CEO’s annual salary was increased to $208,000 per year to adjust for inflation. Finally, the assignable Series D warrants were reset to 2 cents per share for original owners and for assignees after a 10 cent redemption fee is paid. There are currently 4,250,000 Series D warrants outstanding. The Company reports that for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, Mentor had net income of $3,157,658 with a resulting basic gain of 13.7 cents per share, or 12.2 cents on a diluted basis. On December 31, 2023 and currently, the Company has 24,686,105 common shares and 11 Series Q convertible preferred shares outstanding.

Excluding one-time expenses in fourth quarter, EPS would have been $0.27 per share, resulting in an increase of $0.04 per share during first quarter when compared to core earnings from prior quarter. Highlights Net interest margin increased to 3.31%, compared to 3.19% in the prior quarter Tangible book value per share increased to $14.05, compared to $13.86 in the prior quarter Loan portfolio increased by 5.91% compared to year-end 2023 Deposits grew by 0.92% compared to year-end 2023 People’s Bank started the year strong with loan growth of $30.5 million, or 5.91%, over year-end. The new loans booked during the quarter assisted with improving the bank’s net interest margin versus the prior quarter. Credit quality remains strong, with classified assets remaining steady over the last two quarters. Nonperforming assets decreased slightly to 0.08% of total loans from 0.14% at year-end. “While the Bank has observed some weakness in the trucking industry during the first quarter, the balance of the portfolio is performing as expected,” reported Julia Beattie, President & CEO. The first quarter was also significant as it was the first quarter with growth in deposits since Q4 2021, with deposits up $5.8 million, or 0.92%. “With the challenging rate environment over the past two years, our team has worked hard to retain and grow deposits,” noted Beattie. “Deposit growth has been one of our strategic initiatives and we are pleased to see a positive trend for the first quarter,” added Beattie. The investment portfolio decreased 3.7% to $148.6 million during first quarter of 2024 from $154.2 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. The decrease was driven by monthly principal reductions on the MBS portfolio and matured investments. The average life of the portfolio was 4.0 years at the end of the first quarter, versus 4.2 years at the prior quarter-end. Securities income was $0.68 million during the quarter, with a yield of 1.64%, versus $0.77 million, and a yield of 1.67% for the fourth quarter of 2023. As of March 31, 2024, the net after tax unrealized loss on the investment portfolio increased to $14.5 million versus $13.8 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in market interest rates from the prior quarter which negatively affects the prices on outstanding investments. As of the first quarter 2024, liquid assets to total assets were 13.3%, including the market value of the investment portfolio less pledged investments. First quarter 2024 non-interest income totaled $2.0 million, a decrease of $315 thousand from the fourth quarter of 2023. During fourth quarter 2023, the bank recognized $183 thousand in mortgage revenue and $174 thousand from a loan prepayment penalty, both of which were non-recurring. Factoring revenue was flat over the prior quarter. Non-interest expenses totaled $5.4 million in the first quarter, down $7.5 million from the previous quarter. Fourth quarter non-interest expense was exacerbated by the one-time costs of a partial liquidation of the bank’s investment portfolio and closure of the mortgage division. As of March 31, the Tier 1 Capital Ratio for PBCO Financial Corporation was 11.38% with total shareholder equity of $78.6 million, versus a Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 11.54% and total shareholder equity of $77.6 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in the capital ratio is directly attributed to a larger increase in assets than capital augmentation via earnings during the quarter. The Tier 1 Capital Ratio for the Bank was 13.18% at quarter-end, down from 13.39% as of December 31, 2023. Tangible Capital was $74.9 million, or 9.49% as of March 31, 2024, versus fourth quarter of 2023 at $73.8 million, or 9.73%, which increased due to improvement in earnings.

The celebration comes less than one week after the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated its maximum contaminant level (MCL) of PFAS in drinking water and emphasizes Aqua’s ongoing commitment to providing safe and reliable drinking water to its customers. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240417823172/en/Aqua New Jersey President Natalie Chesko and other company leaders are joined by Lawrence Township Mayor Patricia Hendricks Farmer and representatives from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection to cut the ribbon on a new PFAS treatment facility in Lawrence Township.(Photo: Business Wire) “Long before the EPA’s announcement last week, Aqua took a leadership role in addressing PFAS,” said Aqua New Jersey President Natalie Chesko. “This well has been offline for nearly 18 months as we’ve worked to ensure the most effective solution in the absence of consistent regulations. With the EPA rule now in effect, we’re well-prepared to continue leading the way in testing and removal. This facility exemplifies Aqua’s ongoing investment in infrastructure and testing across our entire service area. I’m incredibly proud of our team’s dedication to safeguarding water security for all our communities.” The facility, which will be fully operational on May 1, will provide an extra layer of filtration to approximately 8,000 people in Lawrence Township through ion exchange treatment, which removes PFAS contamination from drinking water to levels compliant with the new EPA regulations. On April 10, the EPA announced its final maximum contaminant level for PFAS “forever chemicals.” PFAS refers to a group of toxic chemicals used for a wide range of items, from non-stick cookware to upholstery manufacturing to firefighter training. In some areas, these chemicals have been sprayed on the ground or dumped by manufacturers and are now being found in watersheds and groundwater wells. “We're grateful for Aqua's unwavering commitment to the safety and reliability of our drinking water, not just here in Lawrence Township, but across the state,” said Lawrence Township Mayor Patricia Hendricks Farmer. ""Our residents have peace of mind knowing their water is filtered for PFAS thanks to Aqua's proactive planning and swift action.” Aqua has been a leader in PFAS remediation through transparent communication and proactive treatment planning. Recognizing the severity of the problem, Aqua immediately began testing for and addressing PFAS more than seven years ago. In the absence of federal guidelines, the company set its own PFAS standard in 2020 and is progressing with plans to comply with the new EPA ruling across its service territory.

The First Bancorp (Nasdaq: FNLC) gab seine Finanzergebnisse für das erste Quartal 2024 bekannt. Es wurde eine Gesamtsumme der Aktiva von 2,98 Milliarden Dollar erreicht, ein Anstieg um 31,5 Millionen.

Positive Total assets increased to $2.98 billion, up by $31.5 million Non-Performing Assets to Total Assets ratio stood at 0.09% Loan balances grew by 8.4% to $2.17 billion Total deposits decreased to $2.55 billion Net income for Q1 2024 was $6.0 million Quarterly shareholder dividend of $0.35 per share declared Negative None. Financial Analyst Reviewing the earnings report for The First Bancorp, the recorded $6.0 million net income represents a significant year-over-year decline from $8.0 million, which may raise a flag for investors. A closer look at the figures shows that increased loan balances, which grew by 8.4% annually, suggest a healthy demand for the bank's lending services. However, a decrease in total deposits by $50.7 million also indicates a potential area of concern regarding liquidity management and deposit retention strategies.Despite the reduced net income, the company's declaration of a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share demonstrates a commitment to shareholder returns and confidence in ongoing stability. This strategy, while possibly attractive in the short term for income-seeking shareholders, should be evaluated alongside the bank's ability to sustain dividends in the context of decreased earnings and potential future funding cost increases. Market Research Analyst Analyzing the operational aspects, the mention of a diversified loan portfolio with comfortable commercial real estate (CRE) positions indicates a strategic mitigation of concentration risk. This diversification, coupled with low non-performing assets at 0.09%, portrays a stable risk profile, which could be attractive to investors seeking stability in a financial institution. However, the decreased bottom line amidst a period of loan growth prompts questions about the bank's interest margin and efficiency in translating growing assets into net income.The financial environment has been challenging for banks due to higher funding costs and The First Bancorp's experience is reflective of broader industry trends. Investors would do well to monitor the bank's subsequent quarters for evidence of improved efficiency or margin compression, which could significantly influence the investment thesis over the medium to long term. 04/17/2024 - 04:15 PM 2024 Q1 Results Driven by Loan Growth and Strong Asset Quality FIRST QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Total assets were $2.98 billion, an increase of $31.5 million for the period Very strong asset quality with a ratio of Non-Performing Assets to Total Assets of 0.09% Loan balances grew at an annualized rate of 8.4% to $2.17 billion Total deposits decreased $50.7 million to $2.55 billion, in-line with seasonal expectations Net Income was $6.0 million A quarterly shareholder dividend of $0.35 per share was declared. DAMARISCOTTA, Maine--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The First Bancorp (Nasdaq: FNLC), parent company of First National Bank, today announced operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Unaudited net income for the period was $6.0 million as compared to net income of $8.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, and net income of $6.7 million for the prior quarter ended December 31, 2023. Diluted earnings per share were $0.54, $0.72 and $0.60 for those same periods, respectively. CEO COMMENTS ""The first quarter of 2024 was in many ways a continuation of the primary themes and challenges we saw throughout 2023,"" commented Tony C. McKim, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer. ""We responsibly grew our balance sheet, and enjoyed strong asset quality, capital, and liquidity positions, while higher funding costs negatively impacted our bottom line. ""First National Bank originated $127 million in new loans during the first quarter of 2024, resulting in net growth for the period of $44.3 million. Activity was spread throughout the portfolio, led by commercial real estate, commercial & industrial, and multifamily lending. Loan pipelines remain steady and we continue to see qualified, relationship-oriented opportunities within our footprint. Our lending process is disciplined, focused upon making loans to quality borrowers at interest rates and terms that reflect the current market."" Mr. McKim continued, ""Asset quality continues to be excellent. The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 0.12% as of March 31, 2024, while the ratio of non-performing assets to total assets was just 0.09%, both measures being very much in line with outcomes over the past year. The level of past due loans was very low, at 0.09% of total loans. Our loan portfolio is well diversified with CRE positions comfortably below regulatory guidance limits, and very limited exposure in sectors frequently mentioned as potential problems, such as office space. ""Our first quarter earnings continue to reflect the challenges brought about by an extended period of yield curve inversion. Intense competition for deposits, both locally and in national markets, again increased our funding costs and further tightened our net interest margin. Net interest income fell 6.1% from the last quarter, leading to a 9.9% decrease in net income period-to-period."" Mr. McKim concluded, ""First National Bank will observe its 160th anniversary in 2024. We are proud of our long tradition of serving customers and supporting communities throughout our footprint, and believe we are well positioned to carry on that tradition for many years to come."" FINANCIAL CONDITION Total assets at March 31, 2024, were $2.98 billion, up $31.5 million in the first quarter and up $166.4 million from a year ago. Earning assets increased $33.1 million during the quarter comprised primarily of an increase in loans of $44.3 million and a decrease in investment balances of $10.8 million. As compared to March 31, 2023, earning assets have increased by $167.6 million centered in loan growth of $190.9 million, and a decrease in investment balances of $24.1 million. Loan growth in the first quarter was led by commercial credit. Commercial real estate balances increased $19.3 million, multifamily loan balances increased $7.9 million, and commercial and industrial balances increased $6.8 million. Growth was also present in municipal and residential lending, up $3.3 million and $5.7 million, respectively, in the quarter. Total deposits at March 31, 2024 were $2.55 billion, down $50.7 million during the period, and up $82.3 million or 3.3% from March 31, 2023. The first quarter balance change was in line with management's estimates based on seasonal deposit patterns. Low-cost deposit categories led the quarterly change, collectively down $61.7 million, while Money Market balances grew by $15.9 million. Borrowings increased $85.1 million during the period to $154.8 million, including a $61.9 million increase in FHLB advances, and a $25.0 million advance under the Bank Term Funding Program, both at rates more favorable than other funding alternatives. Uninsured deposits as of March 31, 2024, were estimated at 15% of total deposits, and 82% of uninsured deposits were fully collateralized. Available day-one liquidity was $592 million, sufficient to cover 155% of estimated uninsured deposits. The Company’s regulatory capital position remained strong as of March 31, 2024, with an estimated total risk-based capital ratio of 13.64%, as compared to the total capital ratios of 13.66% as of December 31, 2023, and 13.72% as of March 31, 2023. The Company's leverage capital ratio was an estimated 8.67% as of March 31, 2024, as compared to the 8.61% and 8.75% reported as of December 31, 2023, and as of March 31, 2023, respectively. The Company's tangible book value per share was $19.03 as of March 31, 2024, down modestly from $19.12 at December 31, 2023, the decrease resulting from an increase in unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities during the period. Similarly, the Tangible Common Equity ratio was 7.19% as of March 31, 2024, down from 7.28% as of December 31, 2023. ASSET QUALITY & PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES Asset quality continues to be very strong. As of March 31, 2024, the ratio of non-performing assets to total assets was 0.09%, up slightly from 0.07% as of December 31, 2023, and 0.06% as of March 31, 2023. Recoveries in the first quarter of prior period loan charge-offs outpaced current period charge-offs, resulting in a net addition to the allowance for credit losses on loans. Past due loans remain low at 0.09% of total loans as of March 31, 2024, a decrease from the ratios of 0.18% and 0.10% of total loans as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively. A provision for credit losses on loans of $99,000 was recorded in the first quarter of 2024, compared with provision expense of $911,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $550,000 for the first quarter of 2023. The effects of improved economic projections and strong asset quality offset the effects of loan growth and other factors in the first quarter model, resulting in lower provision expense for the current period as compared to the prior periods. The Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) on Loans stood at 1.11% of total loans as of March 31, 2024, as compared to an ACL of 1.13% and 1.18% of total loans as of December 31, 2023, and March 31, 2023, respectively. OPERATING RESULTS - First Quarter of 2024 vs. Fourth Quarter of 2023 Net Income for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was $6.0 million, a decrease of $659,000 or 9.9% from the three months ended December 31, 2023.

Non-interest expense totaled $11.8 million, an increase of 5.1% focused in employee salaries and benefits.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Certain information in this release contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Management uses these “non-GAAP” measures in its analysis of the Company's performance (including for purposes of determining the compensation of certain executive officers and other Company employees) and believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide a greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhance comparability of results with prior periods and with other financial institutions, as well as demonstrating the effects of significant gains and charges in the current period, in light of the disclosure practices employed by many other publicly-traded financial institutions. The Company believes that a meaningful analysis of its financial performance requires an understanding of the factors underlying that performance. Management believes that investors may use these non-GAAP financial measures to analyze financial performance without the impact of unusual items that may obscure trends in the Company's underlying performance. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. In several places net interest income is calculated on a fully tax-equivalent basis. Specifically included in interest income was tax-exempt interest income from certain investment securities and loans. An amount equal to the tax benefit derived from this tax-exempt income has been added back to the interest income total which, as adjusted, increased net interest income accordingly. Management believes the disclosure of tax-equivalent net interest income information improves the clarity of financial analysis, and is particularly useful to investors in understanding and evaluating the changes and trends in the Company's results of operations. Other financial institutions commonly present net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis. This adjustment is considered helpful in the comparison of one financial institution's net interest income to that of another institution, as each will have a different proportion of tax-exempt interest from its earning assets. Moreover, net interest income is a component of a second financial measure commonly used by financial institutions, net interest margin, which is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets. For purposes of this measure as well, other financial institutions generally use tax-equivalent net interest income to provide a better basis of comparison from institution to institution. The Company follows these practices. The following table provides a reconciliation of tax-equivalent financial information to the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. A 21.0% tax rate was used in both 2024 and 2023.

The GAAP-based efficiency ratio is non-interest expenses divided by net interest income plus non-interest income from the Consolidated Statements of Income. The non-GAAP efficiency ratio excludes securities losses and other-than-temporary impairment charges from non-interest expenses, excludes securities gains from non-interest income, and adds the tax-equivalent adjustment to net interest income.

The difference between these two measures is the Company's intangible assets, specifically goodwill from prior acquisitions. Management, banking regulators and many stock analysts use the tangible common equity ratio and the tangible book value per common share in conjunction with more traditional bank capital ratios to compare the capital adequacy of banking organizations with significant amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets, typically stemming from the use of the purchase accounting method in accounting for mergers and acquisitions.

Shareholders should note, however, that if the Fund's aggregate net investment income and net realized capital gains are less than the amount of the distribution level, the difference will be distributed from the Fund's assets and will constitute a return of the shareholder's capital. You should not draw any conclusions about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the Fund’s Managed Distribution Plan. The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund’s investment performance and should not be confused with ‘yield’ or ‘income’. The Fund provides this estimate of the sources of its distributions: Distribution Estimates April 2024 (MTD) Fiscal Year-to-Date (YTD) (1) (Sources) Per Share Amount Percentage of Current Distribution Per Share Amount Percentage of Current Distribution Net Investment Income $ - 0.0 % $ - 0.0 % Net Realized Short-Term Capital Gains - 0.0 % - 0.0 % Net Realized Long-Term Capital Gains - 0.0 % - 0.0 % Return of Capital (or other Capital Source) 0.180 100.0 % 0.540 100.0 % Total Distribution $ 0.180 100.0 % $ 0.540 100.0 % (1) Fiscal year started February 1, 2024.

Engaged in various investment and financing activities, including acquisitions and debt fund launch. Received multiple ESG awards, showcasing sustainability efforts. Negative None. Real Estate Financial Analyst The shift from a net loss to a net income per share signals a notable improvement in SL Green Realty Corp's financial health. A net income of $13.1 million this quarter, opposed to last year's net loss of $39.7 million, represents a substantial turnaround. Such a change can potentially reflect improved operational efficiency, asset performance, or favorable market conditions. These figures, especially the increase in FFO from $1.53 to $3.07 per share, would typically be viewed favorably by investors as they suggest strong underlying property performance and cash flow generation, providing grounds for a stable or increased dividend payout.The upsurge in FFO is particularly bolstered by gains on discounted debt extinguishments. It's essential to understand that these gains are non-recurring and can skew investors' perception of the company's ongoing profitability. The real litmus test for sustainability will be in organic growth metrics such as same-store NOI, which the report indicates a slight decrease of 1.2% when excluding lease termination income. This decrease could raise concerns about the company's ability to increase rental income, which is a key driver of long-term value for REIT investors.The guidance upgrade for the 2024 FFO range, rising by $1.45 per share at the midpoint, is another positive sign, but investors should remain cautious. They must differentiate between one-off gains and enduring operational improvements, as the former can lead to short-term spikes in share prices, whereas the latter is more indicative of sustainable growth. Additionally, the increase in Manhattan office occupancy projections to over 91.5% by year-end might suggest a bullish outlook on the demand for office space despite the current market's move towards remote work. Real Estate Market Analyst The report intimates a strategic divestment from retail assets and a consolidation of interest in office properties such as the acquisition of equity in 2 Herald Square. This could reflect an intentional pivot towards office real estate, a move that could be scrutinized in light of the evolving dynamics of the post-pandemic work environment. However, the sale of the retail condominium at 717 Fifth Avenue for $963.0 million and the subsequent debt repayment from the proceeds is indicative of prudent capital management.Furthermore, the leasing metrics provided, with a slight downturn in mark-to-market rent, may spur concerns about the softening of rent growth. The company's ability to sign new leases at decreased rates points to possible market adjustments or increased competition, which could affect revenue streams and valuations. While SL Green's active leasing and expected increase in occupancy rates are encouraging, it's important for investors to monitor these trends closely as they can significantly influence the REIT's long-term performance.Additionally, the launch of the $1.0 billion opportunistic debt fund represents a strategic initiative to exploit market dislocations. The success of this fund will depend on the prevailing credit market conditions and the company's ability to seize high-yielding investment opportunities, which could yield significant returns if managed effectively. Sustainability and ESG Analyst Recognition for sustainability efforts, like the ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Sustained Excellence Award, underscores the company's commitment to environmental stewardship. Given the increasing investor focus on ESG factors, these accolades may enhance the company's reputation and could appeal to a broader investor base, particularly those prioritizing responsible investment. However, investors should look beyond awards and seek tangible impacts such as reduced operational costs through energy efficiency, which directly benefits the bottom line.SL Green's high ranking on ESG measures could also serve as a risk mitigator, potentially lowering the cost of capital in a market that increasingly favors sustainable business practices. This positioning can be advantageous for long-term value creation, but it should be one of many factors that investors consider in the context of the company's overall financial and operational performance. 04/17/2024 - 04:15 PM Increases 2024 Earnings GuidanceFinancial and Operating Highlights Net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.20 per share for the first quarter of 2024 as compared to net loss of $0.63 per share for the same period in 2023.Funds from operations, or FFO, of $3.07 per share for the first quarter of 2024, inclusive of $141.7 million, or $2.02 per share, of gain on discounted debt extinguishment at 2 Herald Square and $5.1 million, or $0.07 per share, of positive non-cash fair value adjustments on a mark-to-market derivative.

DISCLOSURES Funds from Operations (FFO) FFO is a widely recognized non-GAAP financial measure of REIT performance. The Company computes FFO in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not compute FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, or that interpret the NAREIT definition differently than the Company does. The revised White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in April 2002, and subsequently amended in December 2018, defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of properties, and real estate related impairment charges, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The Company presents FFO because it considers it an important supplemental measure of the Company’s operating performance and believes that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, particularly those that own and operate commercial office properties. The Company also uses FFO as one of several criteria to determine performance-based compensation for members of its senior management. FFO is intended to exclude GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets, which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time. Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate, gains and losses from property dispositions, and real estate related impairment charges, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indication of the Company’s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company’s liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the Company’s cash needs, including the Company's ability to make cash distributions. Funds Available for Distribution (FAD) FAD is a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated as FFO plus non-real estate depreciation, allowance for straight line credit loss, adjustment for straight line operating lease rent, non-cash deferred compensation, and pro-rata adjustments for these items from the Company's unconsolidated JVs, less straight line rental income, free rent net of amortization, second cycle tenant improvement and leasing costs, and recurring capital expenditures. FAD is not intended to represent cash flow for the period and is not indicative of cash flow provided by operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP. FAD is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure with respect to liquidity because the Company believes it provides useful information regarding the Company’s ability to fund its dividends. Because all companies do not calculate FAD the same way, the presentation of FAD may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. FAD does not represent cash flow from operating, investing and finance activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indication of the Company’s financial performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), or as a measure of the Company’s liquidity. Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate (EBITDAre) EBITDAre is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company computes EBITDAre in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, which may not be comparable to EBITDAre reported by other REITs that do not compute EBITDAre in accordance with the NAREIT definition, or that interpret the NAREIT definition differently than the Company does. The White Paper on EBITDAre approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in September 2017 defines EBITDAre as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP), plus interest expense, plus income tax expense, plus depreciation and amortization, plus (minus) losses and gains on the disposition of depreciated property, plus impairment write-downs of depreciated property and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, plus adjustments to reflect the entity's share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated joint ventures. The Company presents EBITDAre because the Company believes that EBITDAre, along with cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities, provides investors with an additional indicator of the Company’s ability to incur and service debt. EBITDAre should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indication of the Company’s financial performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), or as a measure of the Company’s liquidity. Net Operating Income (NOI) and Cash NOI NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated as operating income before transaction related costs, gains/losses on early extinguishment of debt, marketing general and administrative expenses and non-real estate revenue. Cash NOI is also a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated by subtracting free rent (net of amortization), straight-line rent, and the amortization of acquired above and below-market leases from NOI, while adding operating lease straight-line adjustment and the allowance for straight-line tenant credit loss. The Company presents NOI and Cash NOI because the Company believes that these measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures and reconciliations, provide investors with meaningful information regarding the operating performance of properties. When operating performance is compared across multiple periods, the investor is provided with information not immediately apparent from net income that is determined in accordance with GAAP. NOI and Cash NOI provide information on trends in the revenue generated and expenses incurred in operating the Company's properties, unaffected by the cost of leverage, straight-line adjustments, depreciation, amortization, and other net income components. The Company uses these metrics internally as performance measures. None of these measures is an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) and same-store performance should not be considered an alternative to GAAP net income performance. Coverage Ratios The Company presents fixed charge and debt service coverage ratios to provide a measure of the Company’s financial flexibility to service current debt amortization, interest expense and operating lease rent from current cash net operating income. These coverage ratios represent a common measure of the Company’s ability to service fixed cash payments; however, these ratios are not used as an alternative to cash flow from operating, financing and investing activities (determined in accordance with GAAP).

Alcoa a rapporté ses résultats pour le premier trimestre de 2024, incluant l'acquisition d'Alumina et diverses améliorations opérationnelles. Le chiffre d'affaires s'élevait à 2,6 milliards de dollars, avec une perte nette de 252 millions de dollars. Alcoa a initié la vente potentielle du complexe de San Ciprián, achevé le redémarrage d'une ligne de production à Warrick Operations et annoncé la réduction de l'activité de la raffinerie de Kwinana en Australie. La société a également versé un dividende trimestriel en espèces de 0,10 dollar par action et a terminé le trimestre avec un solde de trésorerie de 1,4 milliard de dollars. Alcoa hat die Ergebnisse des ersten Quartals 2024 bekannt gegeben, einschließlich der Übernahme von Alumina und verschiedenen betrieblichen Verbesserungen. Der Umsatz betrug 2,6 Milliarden Dollar, mit einem Nettoverlust von 252 Millionen Dollar. Alcoa hat den potenziellen Verkauf des San Ciprián-Komplexes eingeleitet, den Neustart einer Produktionslinie bei den Warrick-Betrieben abgeschlossen und die Drosselung der Kwinana-Raffinerie in Australien angekündigt. Das Unternehmen zahlte außerdem eine vierteljährliche Dividende von 0,10 Dollar pro Aktie und beendete das Quartal mit einem Kassenbestand von 1,4 Milliarden Dollar. Positive Alcoa reported a net loss of $252 million in the first quarter of 2024. The company initiated the potential sale of the San Ciprián complex during the quarter. Alcoa completed the restart of a potline at Warrick Operations in the first quarter of 2024. The company announced the curtailment of the Kwinana refinery in Australia to be completed in the second quarter of 2024. Alcoa finished the first quarter of 2024 with a cash balance of $1.4 billion. Negative The net loss for the first quarter of 2024 was $252 million. The potential sale of the San Ciprián complex may impact the company's operations. The curtailment of the Kwinana refinery could have financial implications for Alcoa. The restart of the potline at Warrick Operations may not fully offset other operational challenges. Alcoa's cash balance of $1.4 billion may not be sufficient to address all financial needs. Financial Analyst The acquisition of Alumina Limited by Alcoa Corporation represents a significant strategic maneuver that could reshape the company's market positioning. By integrating Alumina Limited's operations, Alcoa not only simplifies its corporate structure but also potentially enhances its operational flexibility. The move may lead to improved economies of scale and cost efficiencies. However, investors should be mindful of the execution risks inherent in any large-scale acquisition, including the integration of different corporate cultures and systems.Given the reported net loss and the adjusted net loss figures, stakeholders might be concerned about the company's profitability in the short term. The losses may be a reflection of broader market forces and operational challenges such as the curtailment of the Kwinana refinery, which incurred significant charges. On the upside, lower energy and raw material costs have positively contributed to the adjusted EBITDA, indicating some level of cost management success.The cash position bolstered by the green bond issuance provides Alcoa with a liquidity cushion, which is essential for both ongoing operations and the implementation of its new productivity and competitiveness program. While the commitment to a $100 million savings target is commendable, it remains to be seen how these cost-saving measures will materialize in financial performance. Investors should watch for the realization of these savings and their impact on the bottom line in future quarters. Market Analyst Alcoa's forward guidance for 2024 suggests stability in Alumina segment production and shipments, which is a vital indicator of steady supply chain management. However, the discrepancy between production and shipments due to the Kwinana curtailment introduces an element of uncertainty regarding supply dynamics. Investors should monitor how Alcoa navigates the balance of fulfilling customer contracts with externally sourced alumina.Additionally, the outlook for Aluminum segment production and shipments reflects consistency, but the expected unfavorable impacts of increased seasonal maintenance and other costs in the Alumina segment, as well as the unfavorable alumina costs in the Aluminum segment, could pressure margins. The anticipated rise in interest expense due to the green bond issuance could also weigh on net income.Alcoa's focus on decarbonization and water management projects funded by the green bond proceeds aligns with a growing investor appetite for environmentally responsible corporate practices. This could potentially enhance Alcoa's appeal to ESG-focused investors, adding a dimension of strategic value to its investment profile. Energy Sector Analyst Alcoa's performance is closely tied to the energy markets due to the significant power requirements of aluminum production. The reported favorable raw material prices and production costs in the Aluminum segment, offset by higher energy costs, underscore the volatility and impact of energy prices on operational efficiency. Investors should take note of the company's energy management strategies and how they adapt to fluctuating energy prices, especially given the reported unfavorable impacts of higher energy costs in the next quarter.The company's involvement in renewable energy, as indicated by the green bond issuance for climate change mitigation expenditures, suggests a strategic pivot towards sustainable energy use. This transition may offer long-term benefits, such as reduced energy costs and enhanced regulatory compliance, but it also entails significant upfront investments. Shareholders should weigh these factors when considering Alcoa's future financial health and its ability to maintain competitive energy costs amidst global shifts towards sustainable practices. 04/17/2024 - 04:10 PM PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Alcoa Corporation (NYSE: AA) today reported results for the first quarter 2024, a period that included the announced acquisition of Alumina Limited and continued action on near-term improvements. Financial Results and Highlights M, except per share amounts 1Q24 4Q23 1Q23 Revenue $2,599 $2,595 $2,670 Net loss attributable to Alcoa Corporation $(252) $(150) $(231) Loss per share attributable to Alcoa Corporation $(1.41) $(0.84) $(1.30) Adjusted net loss $(145) $(100) $(41) Adjusted loss per share $(0.81) $(0.56) $(0.23) Adjusted EBITDA excluding special items $132 $89 $240 Entered into binding agreement to acquire Alumina Limited in all-stock transaction Initiated process for the potential sale of the San Ciprián complex Completed restart of one potline at Warrick Operations Announced curtailment of Kwinana refinery in Australia to be completed in the second quarter 2024 Implemented productivity and competitiveness program Paid quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share of common stock, totaling $19 million Finished the first quarter 2024 with cash balance of $1.4 billion, includes $737 million in net proceeds from March 2024 green bond issuance “In the first quarter of 2024, we finalized the terms of our acquisition of Alumina Limited, which will bring strategic, operational, and financial flexibility,” said Alcoa President and CEO William F. Oplinger. “Raw material prices and markets are improving, and we are implementing near-term improvements to further strengthen Alcoa for the future.” First Quarter 2024 Results Production: Alumina production decreased 4 percent sequentially to 2.67 million metric tons on lower production from the Australia refineries. In Aluminum, Alcoa produced 542,000 metric tons, consistent with the fourth quarter’s strong output. Shipments: In the Alumina segment, third-party shipments of alumina increased 6 percent sequentially primarily due to increased trading. In Aluminum, total shipments decreased 1 percent sequentially. Revenue: The Company’s total third-party revenue of $2.6 billion was consistent with the prior quarter. In the Alumina segment, third-party revenue increased 6 percent due to the higher average realized third-party price for alumina and higher shipments. In the Aluminum segment, third-party revenue decreased 3 percent due to the lower average realized third-party price for aluminum, driven by the unfavorable sequential impact of the Alumar smelter restart hedge program which ended in December 2023 and timing of shipments. Net loss attributable to Alcoa Corporation was $252 million, or $1.41 per share. Sequentially, the results reflect lower average realized third-party prices for aluminum and higher production costs, partially offset by lower energy and raw material costs. Additionally, the results include a charge of $197 million related to the curtailment of the Kwinana refinery, and reflect the non-recurrence of a charge to tax expense of $152 million to record a valuation allowance on Alcoa World Alumina Brasil Ltda. (AWAB) deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter 2023. Adjusted net loss was $145 million, or $0.81 per share, excluding the impact from net special items of $107 million. Notable special items include $197 million related to the curtailment of the Kwinana refinery discussed above, partially offset by tax and noncontrolling interest impacts of $117 million. Adjusted EBITDA excluding special items was $132 million, a sequential increase of $43 million primarily due to lower energy and raw material costs, partially offset by lower average realized third-party price for aluminum and higher production costs. Production costs increased primarily due to the non-recurrence of the full year benefit of $36 million for the credit related to Section 45X of the Inflation Reduction Act recorded in the fourth quarter 2023. Cash: Alcoa ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.4 billion. Cash used for operations was $223 million. Cash provided from financing activities was $754 million primarily related to the net proceeds from the debt issuance of $737 million. Cash used for investing activities was $117 million primarily related to capital expenditures of $101 million. Working capital: For the first quarter, Receivables from customers of $0.9 billion, Inventories of $2.0 billion and Accounts payable, trade of $1.6 billion comprised DWC working capital. Alcoa reported 47 days working capital, a sequential increase of eight days. The increase is primarily due to typical first quarter increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in accounts payable. Key Actions Strategic Alumina Limited: On March 11, 2024, Alcoa announced that it entered into a binding Scheme Implementation Deed with Alumina Limited (ASX: AWC), under which Alcoa will acquire Alumina Limited in an all-scrip, or all-stock, transaction. The acquisition of Alumina Limited will enhance Alcoa’s position as a leading pure play, upstream aluminum company globally, while simplifying the Company’s corporate structure and governance, resulting in greater operational flexibility and strategic optionality. Operational San Ciprián complex: During the first quarter of 2024, Alcoa completed the restart of approximately 6 percent of pots at the smelter in compliance with the February 2023 updated viability agreement. Although both energy and API prices improved during the quarter, the improvements are insufficient for the long-term viability of the complex for Alcoa. Additionally, near-term government support remains unlikely. While continuing to optimize the smelter and refinery operations and preserve cash, and as part of Alcoa's efforts to find a long-term solution for the complex, Alcoa initiated a process for the potential sale of the complex during the first quarter of 2024 and anticipates completing the bid process by June 2024. Warrick Operations: During the first quarter 2024, the Company completed the restart of one potline (54,000 mtpy) that was curtailed in July 2022. Kwinana refinery: On January 8, 2024, the Company announced the decision to curtail the Kwinana refinery in Australia to be completed in the second quarter of 2024. Financial Green bond issuance: On March 21, 2024, the Company closed an offering of $750 million aggregate principal amount of 7.125 percent senior notes due in 2031. This was the Company’s first notes issuance under its new Green Finance Framework, which prioritizes climate change mitigation expenditures related to circular or low carbon products, pollution prevention technologies, renewable energy, and water management. Net proceeds from the issuance, which can be allocated to qualifying expenditures on a two year look back and three year look forward, are expected to cover expenses associated with both new and existing decarbonization and water management projects, research and development, renewable energy, and the production of low carbon alumina and aluminum products. The Company does not expect to allocate part of the net proceeds to significant capital investments in breakthrough technologies as those are not expected to occur in the remainder of this decade. Productivity and competitiveness program: In January 2024, the Company initiated a productivity and competitiveness program across its global operations and functions. The program is part of the Company’s objective to improve overall competitiveness and profitability and includes a target to save approximately 5 percent of operating costs, exclusive of raw materials, energy and transportation costs, which are already under active management and cost control programs. Total savings are expected to approximate $100 million on a run rate basis and to be achieved by the first quarter of 2025. 2024 Outlook The following outlook does not include reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income, including transformation, intersegment eliminations and other corporate Adjusted EBITDA; operational tax expense; and other expense; each excluding special items, to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures because it is impractical to forecast certain special items, such as restructuring charges and mark-to-market contracts without unreasonable efforts due to the variability and complexity associated with predicting the occurrence and financial impact of such special items. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results. Alcoa expects 2024 total Alumina segment production and shipments to remain unchanged from the prior projection, ranging between 9.8 and 10.0 million metric tons, and between 12.7 and 12.9 million metric tons, respectively. The difference between production and shipments reflects trading volumes and externally sourced alumina to fulfill customer contracts due to the curtailment of the Kwinana refinery. Alcoa expects 2024 total Aluminum segment production and shipments to remain unchanged from the prior projection, ranging between 2.2 and 2.3 million metric tons, and between 2.5 and 2.6 million metric tons, respectively. Within second quarter 2024 Alumina Segment Adjusted EBITDA, the Company expects sequential unfavorable impacts of $20 million related to higher seasonal maintenance and other mining costs for the Australia operations. Within second quarter 2024 Aluminum Segment Adjusted EBITDA, the Company expects favorable raw material prices and production costs to be fully offset by higher energy costs. Alumina costs in the Aluminum segment are expected to be unfavorable by $15 million sequentially. Alcoa expects Interest expense to approximate $145 million for the year, an increase from the prior projection as a result of the green bond issuance. Other expenses for the first quarter of 2024 included unfavorable impacts of approximately $20 million related to foreign currency losses that may not recur. Based on current alumina and aluminum market conditions, Alcoa expects second quarter operational tax expense to approximate $40 million to $50 million, which may vary with market conditions and jurisdictional profitability.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures This release contains reference to certain financial measures that are not calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). Alcoa Corporation believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors because such measures provide both additional information about the operating performance of Alcoa Corporation and insight on the ability of Alcoa Corporation to meet its financial obligations by adjusting the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the impact of, among others, “special items” as defined by the Company, non-cash items in nature, and/or nonoperating expense or income items. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be a substitute for, and should not be considered in isolation from, the financial measures reported in accordance with GAAP. Certain definitions, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and additional details regarding management’s rationale for the use of the non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the schedules to this release.

(1) Alcoa Corporation’s definition of Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) is net margin plus an add-back for depreciation, depletion, and amortization. Net margin is equivalent to Sales minus the following items: Cost of goods sold; Selling, general administrative, and other expenses; Research and development expenses; and Provision for depreciation, depletion, and amortization. The Adjusted EBITDA presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. (2) Transformation includes, among other items, the Adjusted EBITDA of previously closed operations. (3) Corporate expenses are composed of general administrative and other expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities, as well as research and development expenses of the corporate technical center. (4) Other includes certain items that are not included in the Adjusted EBITDA of the reportable segments. Alcoa Corporation and subsidiaries Calculation of Financial Measures (unaudited) (in millions, except per-share amounts) Adjusted Income (Loss) Income Diluted EPS(4) Quarter ended Quarter ended March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 March 31, 2023 March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 March 31, 2023 Net loss attributable to Alcoa Corporation $ (252 ) $ (150 ) $ (231 ) $ (1.41 ) $ (0.84 ) $ (1.30 ) Special items: Restructuring and other charges, net 202 (11 ) 149 Other special items(1) 22 (2 ) 25 Discrete and other tax items impacts(2) — 102 2 Tax impact on special items(3) (60 ) 1 6 Noncontrolling interest impact(3) (57 ) (40 ) 8 Subtotal 107 50 190 Net loss attributable to Alcoa Corporation – as adjusted $ (145 ) $ (100 ) $ (41 ) $ (0.81 ) $ (0.56 ) $ (0.23 ) Net loss attributable to Alcoa Corporation – as adjusted and Diluted EPS – as adjusted are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes these measures are meaningful to investors because management reviews the operating results of Alcoa Corporation excluding the impacts of restructuring and other charges, various tax items, and other special items (collectively, “special items”). There can be no assurances that additional special items will not occur in future periods. To compensate for this limitation, management believes it is appropriate to consider Net loss attributable to Alcoa Corporation and Diluted EPS determined under GAAP as well as Net loss attributable to Alcoa Corporation – as adjusted and Diluted EPS – as adjusted. (1) Other special items include the following: for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, an adjustment to the gain on sale of the Warrick Rolling Mill in Evansville, Indiana for additional site separation costs ($11), a net unfavorable change in mark-to-market energy derivative instruments ($4), external costs related to portfolio actions ($4), costs related to the restart process at the Warrick Operations site in Indiana ($3), costs related to the restart process at the San Ciprián, Spain smelter ($2), and a net benefit for other special items ($2); for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, a net favorable change in mark-to-market energy derivative instruments ($7), costs related to the restart process at the Warrick Operations site ($3), and net charges for other special items ($2); and, for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, a net favorable change in mark-to-market energy derivative instruments ($23), costs related to the restart process at the Alumar, Brazil smelter ($19), an adjustment to the gain on sale of the Warrick Rolling Mill for additional site separation costs ($17), costs related to the closure of the Intalco, Washington smelter ($16), and a net benefit for other special items ($4). (2) Discrete and other tax items are generally unusual or infrequently occurring items, changes in law, items associated with uncertain tax positions, or the effect of measurement-period adjustments and include the following: for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, a charge to record a valuation allowance on AWAB's deferred tax assets due to cumulative losses ($104) and a net benefit for other discrete tax items ($2); and, for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, net charge for discrete tax items ($2). (3) The tax impact on special items is based on the applicable statutory rates in the jurisdictions where the special items occurred. The noncontrolling interest impact on special items represents Alcoa’s partner’s share of certain special items. (4) In any period with a Net loss attributable to Alcoa Corporation (GAAP or as adjusted), the average number of shares applicable to diluted earnings per share exclude certain share equivalents as their effect is anti-dilutive.

Net margin is equivalent to Sales minus the following items: Cost of goods sold; Selling, general administrative, and other expenses; Research and development expenses; and Provision for depreciation, depletion, and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes this measure is meaningful to investors because Adjusted EBITDA provides additional information with respect to Alcoa Corporation’s operating performance and the Company’s ability to meet its financial obligations. The Adjusted EBITDA presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. (1) Special items include the following (see reconciliation of Adjusted Income above for additional information): for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, external costs related to portfolio actions ($4), costs related to the restart process at the Warrick Operations site in Indiana ($3), costs related to the restart process at the San Ciprián, Spain smelter ($2), and a benefit for other special items ($1); for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, the mark-to-market contracts associated with the Portland smelter generated losses ($9) in Other expenses (income), net which economically increase the cost of power recorded in Cost of goods sold. This non-GAAP reclass presents the total cost of power within Cost of goods sold. This was partially offset by costs related to the restart process at the Warrick Operations site ($3) and net charges for other special items ($3); and, for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, costs related to the restart process at the Alumar, Brazil smelter ($19), costs related to the closure of the Intalco, Washington smelter ($16), and net cost of power associated with the Portland smelter ($3). Alcoa Corporation and subsidiaries Calculation of Financial Measures (unaudited), continued (in millions) Free Cash Flow Quarter ended March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 March 31, 2023 Cash (used for) provided from operations $ (223 ) $ 198 $ (163 ) Capital expenditures (101 ) (188 ) (83 ) Free cash flow $ (324 ) $ 10 $ (246 ) Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes this measure is meaningful to investors because management reviews cash flows generated from operations after taking into consideration capital expenditures, which are necessary to maintain and expand Alcoa Corporation’s asset base and are expected to generate future cash flows from operations. It is important to note that Free Cash Flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since other non-discretionary expenditures, such as mandatory debt service requirements, are not deducted from the measure.

Management believes this measure is meaningful to investors because management assesses Alcoa Corporation’s leverage position after considering available cash that could be used to repay outstanding debt. When cash exceeds total debt, the measure is expressed as net cash.

Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors because management assesses Alcoa Corporation’s leverage position after considering available cash that could be used to repay outstanding debt. When cash exceeds total debt, the measure is expressed as net cash. Adjusted net debt and proportional adjusted net debt are also non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that these additional measures are meaningful to investors because management also assesses Alcoa Corporation’s leverage position after considering available cash that could be used to repay outstanding debt and net pension/OPEB liability, net of the portion of those items attributable to noncontrolling interest (NCI).

Management believes that these measures are meaningful to investors because management uses its working capital position to assess Alcoa Corporation’s efficiency in liquidity management. (1) Days working capital is calculated as DWC working capital divided by the quotient of Sales and number of days in the quarter.

(Nasdaq: DMAC), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel treatments for neurological disorders and cardio-renal disease, today announced the first patient being dosed in DiaMedica’s relaunch of its pivotal Phase 2/3 ReMEDy2 Trial of DM199 for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. The company continues to work closely with its contract research organization (CRO), on re-engaging with study sites for the ReMEDy2 Trial. The trial is intended to enroll approximately 350 patients at up to 100 sites globally. The majority of the U.S. sites are expected to be activated by the end of the third quarter of 2024. With the support of the Canadian Stroke Consortium, the activation of study sites in Canada is expected to begin in the third quarter of 2024. In Australia, the Company has received provisional endorsement from the Australian Stroke Trials Network (ASTN) and Australian site activation is expected to commence in the fourth quarter of 2024. Initial steps are also being taken to expand ReMEDy2 into the United Kingdom, Spain, and select other European countries. “We are thrilled to resume enrollment as this marks a major milestone towards continuing our study of DM199 as a potential treatment for ischemic stroke patients,” commented Rick Pauls, DiaMedica’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Site activation momentum continues to build, and we anticipate a significant ramp-up in the United States over the next six months,"" commented Lorianne Masuoka, DiaMedica’s Chief Medical Officer. ""Furthermore, we are highly encouraged by the quality of the sites we have already activated and those planned for activation in the coming months. These sites have historically been high enrollers in stroke studies.” About ReMEDy2 Trial The ReMEDy2 trial is an adaptive design, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial studying the use of the Company’s product candidate, DM199, to treat acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. Patients enrolled in the trial will be treated for three weeks with either DM199 or placebo, beginning within 24 hours of the onset of AIS symptoms, with the final follow-up at 90 days. The trial excludes patients treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and/or mechanical thrombectomy. DiaMedica believes that the proposed trial has the potential to serve as a pivotal registration study of DM199 in this patient population. About DM199 DM199 is a recombinant (synthetic) form of human tissue kallikrein-1 (rKLK1; rinvecalinase alpha). rKLK1 is identical to naturally produced KLK1, a serine protease enzyme that plays an important role in the regulation of diverse physiological processes via a molecular mechanism that increases production of nitric oxide and prostacyclin. In the case of ischemic stroke, the administration of DM199 is intended to enhance blood flow to the infarction site and boost neuronal survival in the ischemic penumbra by dilating arterioles surrounding the site of the infarction and inhibition of apoptosis (neuronal cell death) while also facilitating neuronal remodeling through the promotion of angiogenesis. KLK1 deficiency may play a role in multiple vascular and fibrotic diseases such as stroke, chronic kidney disease, retinopathy, vascular dementia, and resistant hypertension where current treatment options are limited or ineffective. DiaMedica is the first company to have developed and clinically studied rKLK1. Non-recombinant, tissue extracted KLK1, produced from the pancreas of pigs and human urine, has been approved for decades for patients in Japan, China and South Korea with a variety of ischemic conditions such as AIS, chronic renal disease, retinopathy and hypertension. DM199/rKLK1 is currently being studied in patients with AIS. In September 2021, the FDA granted Fast Track Designation to DM199 for the treatment of AIS. About DiaMedica Therapeutics Inc. DiaMedica Therapeutics Inc. is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from serious diseases with a focus on acute ischemic stroke. DiaMedica’s lead candidate DM199 is the first pharmaceutically active recombinant (synthetic) form of the KLK1 protein, an established therapeutic modality in Asia for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke and other vascular diseases.

Negative None. Financial Analyst The narrowing of Brandywine Realty Trust's FFO guidance from $0.90-$1.00 to $0.90-$0.97 per diluted share signals a restrained outlook. Such a reduction often reflects management’s revised expectations due to market conditions or internal factors. The issuance of the $400 million unsecured bond at a higher interest rate of 8.875% might raise concerns about increased interest expenses affecting future profitability. However, the proactive management of debt maturities, with no bond maturities until November 2027, suggests a strategic approach to improving the company’s debt profile. The payout ratio of 62.5% also provides insight into the sustainability of dividends, where a figure under 100% is typically seen as a good sign for dividend stability. Real Estate Market Analyst Examining Brandywine's leasing and occupancy rates offers insights into the real estate market's conditions. The reported increase in rental rates by 16.9% on an accrual basis highlights strong pricing power or possibly a favorable sub-market dynamics. However, the negative absorption of (49,000) square feet could be indicative of challenges in retaining or attracting tenants. While the core portfolio occupancy is relatively high at 87.7%, investor focus should remain on tenant retention and absorption rates moving forward, as they are critical indicators of the underlying health of the portfolio. Investment Strategy Analyst Investors might perceive the first quarter's net loss of ($16.7) million as a red flag, but it's essential to consider Funds from Operations (FFO) as a more accurate measure of a REIT's performance since it excludes the effects of depreciation and certain non-cash items. The reported FFO of $41.2 million, despite being lower year-over-year, still provides the company with a buffer to cover its dividend payments. When evaluating Brandywine, one must balance the current quarter's losses with the overall strategy, which includes debt management and the positive mark-to-market rental increases. 04/17/2024 - 04:05 PM PHILADELPHIA, April 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Brandywine Realty Trust (NYSE:BDN) today reported its financial and operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Management Comments “During the first quarter, we made excellent progress on our 2024 business plan highlighted by achieving 98% of our speculative revenue target based on the midpoint of our guidance,” stated Jerry Sweeney, President and Chief Executive Officer of Brandywine Realty Trust. “We continue to experience positive mark-to-market rental rate increases of 16.9% and 3.3% on an accrual and cash basis as well. In early April, we further strengthened our balance sheet and liquidity position by issuing a $400 million five-year unsecured bond at 8.875%. The bond proceeds are being used to retire the $335 million outstanding balance on our unsecured bond maturing in October 2024 and the outstanding balance on our line of credit. Once these bonds are retired, we have no bond maturities until November 2027 and no outstanding balance on our $600 million line of credit. With the bond issuance occurring earlier than anticipated in our 2024 business plan, we are narrowing our FFO range from $0.90 to $1.00 per share to $0.90 to $0.97 per share.” First Quarter 2024 Highlights Financial Results Net loss allocated to common shareholders: ($16.7) million, or ($0.10) per share.Funds from Operations (FFO): $41.2 million, or $0.24 per diluted share.

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such forward-looking statements can generally be identified by our use of forward-looking terminology such as “will,” “strategy,” “expects,” “seeks,” “believes,” “potential,” or other similar words. Because such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and contingencies, actual results may differ materially from the expectations, intentions, beliefs, plans or predictions of the future expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements, including our 2024 guidance, the expected use of proceeds from the offering of our 2029 Notes, the completion of the tender or redemption of our outstanding 2024 Notes and the progress of our projects under development, are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of our management and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are difficult to predict and not within our control. Such risks, uncertainties and contingencies include, among others: risks related to the impact of other potential future outbreaks of infectious diseases on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and those of our tenants as well as on the economy and real estate and financial markets; reduced demand for office space and pricing pressures, including from competitors, that could limit our ability to lease space or set rents at expected levels or that could lead to declines in rent; uncertainty and volatility in capital and credit markets, including changes that reduce availability, and increase costs, of capital or that delay receipt of our planned debt financings and refinancings; the effect of inflation and interest rate fluctuations, including on the costs of our planned debt financings and refinancings; the potential loss or bankruptcy of tenants or the inability of tenants to meet their rent and other lease obligations; risks of acquisitions and dispositions, including unexpected liabilities and integration costs; delays in completing, and cost overruns incurred in connection with, our developments and redevelopments; disagreements with joint venture partners; unanticipated operating and capital costs; uninsured casualty losses and our ability to obtain adequate insurance, including coverage for terrorist acts; additional asset impairments; our dependence upon certain geographic markets; changes in governmental regulations, tax laws and rates and similar matters; unexpected costs of REIT qualification compliance; and costs and disruptions as the result of a cybersecurity incident or other technology disruption. The declaration and payment of future dividends (both timing and amount) is subject to the determination of our Board of Trustees, in its sole discretion, after considering various factors, including our financial condition, historical and forecast operating results, and available cash flow, as well as any applicable laws and contractual covenants and any other relevant factors. Our Board’s practice regarding declaration of dividends may be modified at any time and from time to time. Additional information on factors which could impact us and the forward-looking statements contained herein are included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We assume no obligation to update or supplement forward-looking statements that become untrue because of subsequent events except as required by law. Non-GAAP Supplemental Financial Measures We compute our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Although FFO and NOI are non-GAAP financial measures, we believe that FFO and NOI calculations are helpful to shareholders and potential investors and are widely recognized measures of real estate investment trust performance. At the end of this press release, we have provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Funds from Operations (FFO) We compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not compute FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, or that interpret the NAREIT definition differently than us. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (loss) before non-controlling interests and excluding gains (losses) on sales of depreciable operating property, impairment losses on depreciable consolidated real estate, impairment losses on investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures and extraordinary items (computed in accordance with GAAP); plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. Net income, the GAAP measure that we believe to be most directly comparable to FFO, includes depreciation and amortization expenses, gains or losses on property sales, extraordinary items and non-controlling interests. To facilitate a clear understanding of our historical operating results, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as presented in the financial statements included elsewhere in this release. FFO does not represent cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) and should not be considered to be an alternative to net income (loss) (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our financial performance or to be an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions to shareholders. We generally consider FFO and FFO per share to be useful measures for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO and FFO per share can help investors compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance of other companies. Net Operating Income (NOI) NOI (accrual basis) is a financial measure equal to net income available to common shareholders, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, plus corporate general and administrative expense, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, non-controlling interest in the Operating Partnership and losses from early extinguishment of debt, less interest income, development and management income, gains from property dispositions, gains on sale from discontinued operations, gains on early extinguishment of debt, income from discontinued operations, income from unconsolidated joint ventures and non-controlling interest in property partnerships. In some cases we also present NOI on a cash basis, which is NOI after eliminating the effects of straight-lining of rent and deferred market intangible amortization. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs that define NOI differently. NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of the Company's liquidity or its ability to make distributions. We believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our properties, as it excludes certain components from net income available to common shareholders in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property's results of operations. We use NOI internally to evaluate the performance of our operating segments and to make decisions about resource allocations. We concluded that NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations, as it reflects only the income and expense items incurred at the property level, as well as the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unlevered basis. Same Store Properties In our analysis of NOI, particularly to make comparisons of NOI between periods meaningful, it is important to provide information for properties that were in-service and owned by us throughout each period presented. We refer to properties acquired or placed in-service prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by us through the end of the latest period presented as Same Store Properties. Same Store Properties exclude properties placed in-service, acquired, repositioned, held for sale or in development or redevelopment after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented. Accordingly, it takes at least one year and one quarter after a property is acquired for that property to be included in Same Store Properties. Core Portfolio Our core portfolio is comprised of our wholly-owned properties, excluding any properties currently in development, re-development, re-entitlement or recently completed and not stabilized.

Viking Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel first-in-class or best-in-class therapies for the treatment of metabolic and endocrine disorders, with three compounds currently in clinical trials. Viking's research and development activities leverage its expertise in metabolism to develop innovative therapeutics designed to improve patients' lives. The company's clinical programs include VK2809, a novel, orally available, small molecule selective thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist for the treatment of lipid and metabolic disorders, which is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2b study for the treatment of biopsy-confirmed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis. In a Phase 2a trial for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and elevated LDL-C, patients who received VK2809 demonstrated statistically significant reductions in LDL-C and liver fat content compared with patients who received placebo. The company is also developing VK2735, a novel dual agonist of the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors for the potential treatment of various metabolic disorders. Data from a Phase 1 and a Phase 2 trial evaluating VK2735 (dosed subcutaneously) for obesity demonstrated an encouraging safety and tolerability profile as well as positive signs of clinical benefit. The company is also evaluating an oral formulation of VK2735 in a Phase 1 trial. In the rare disease space, the company is developing VK0214, a novel, orally available, small molecule selective thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist for the potential treatment of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD). VK0214 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with the adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) form of X-ALD. The company holds exclusive worldwide rights to a portfolio of five therapeutic programs, including VK2809 and VK0214, which are based on small molecules licensed from Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated.
