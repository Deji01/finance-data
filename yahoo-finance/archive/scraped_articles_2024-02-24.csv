Motley Fool,Better AI Stock: Nvidia or Super Micro Computer?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-ai-stock-nvidia-super-183000828.html,Nvidia and Super Micro Computer have been two of the hottest AI investments this year.,"While artificial intelligence (AI) is widely considered a software program, it requires hardware to develop and power it. This leads to investors looking for ""pick-and-shovel"" style investments, as these companies sell the tools needed to power these processes (similar to how many businesses sold picks and shovels to gold miners during the various gold rushes throughout U.S. history).Two of the top ""pick-and-shovel"" plays in the AI market are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI). Both stocks have been rocket ships since the start of 2023, with Nvidia and Super Micro Computer's (often called Supermicro) stocks up 437% and 1,000%, respectively.But which one is the better buy now? Let's find out.Nvidia and Super Micro Computer are complementary businessesWhile both companies could be considered ""pick-and-shovel"" investments, in reality, Nvidia makes the shovel and pick heads, while Supermicro assembles the tools and sells them to end users.Nvidia makes the graphics processing units (GPUs) to handle the complex workloads that AI models require. These hardware pieces have been around for a long time and were originally used to process gaming graphics, but have since expanded their usage to engineering simulations, drug discovery, and AI model training.When companies want to build a supercomputer to harness the power of data through AI, they don't just buy one or two GPUs; they buy hundreds or thousands. To get the most use out of them, they must also be strategically placed and connected to a server, which is where Supermicro comes in.Supermicro builds these servers for clients and offers highly configurable models that can be tailored to end-use and computing power expectations. They work closely with Nvidia to ensure they're squeezing every ounce of performance out of their servers, which benefits users in the long run.But as to which makes more sense to invest in, there's a clear choice.Story continuesNvidia is the superior investment at these pricesSupermicro is heavily dependent on Nvidia for business. If Nvidia chooses to fulfill GPU orders to other clients or the relationship sours, Supermicro's business will be crushed. These two companies have been partners for a while, so I don't see this happening, but it is something to keep in mind.Furthermore, Supermicro has fierce competition from other server builders like Hewlett-Packard and IBM, while Nvidia's AI GPUs are in a class of their own.This heavily skews the bias toward Nvidia, but another factor is also at play.Both stocks were undervalued entering 2023, but Supermicro's stock was unbelievably cheap at just over six times forward earnings.NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) ChartThat's why Supermicro has outperformed Nvidia's stock over the past year, but that will likely stop soon. Now that Supermicro is more expensive than Nvidia, buying it doesn't make a ton of sense, especially if they're growing at the same pace.Nvidia's business model is far superior because it controls the primary product, giving it an advantage when assessing profit margins.NVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) ChartNvidia is far more profitable than Supermicro, and if you give me a choice between two stocks that are evenly priced and growing around the same pace, then I'll choose the more profitable one every single time.While both companies will succeed as the AI buildout continues, I'm more excited about Nvidia due to its superior margins and control over the primary product. Super Micro Computer may be a solid company to invest in, but you're better off picking Nvidia at these prices.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Roku Stock Is Crashing: What's Wrong With This Video Streaming Giant?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/roku-stock-crashing-whats-wrong-180900099.html,Investors are getting impatient over the company's lack of profitability.,
Motley Fool,Better Comeback Stock: Alibaba vs. Peloton,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-comeback-stock-alibaba-vs-173800767.html,Which of these beaten-down stocks is a better turnaround play?,"Alibaba Group (NYSE: BABA) and Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ: PTON) have both frustrated plenty of investors over the past few years. Alibaba's stock hit its all-time high in October 2020 as the bulls embraced the Chinese e-commerce and cloud leader, but it subsequently sank more than 75% as it faced fierce macro, regulatory, and competitive headwinds.Peloton's stock closed at its record high in January 2021 as its sales of connected bikes and subscriptions accelerated throughout the pandemic. But it then shed roughly 97% of its value as its growth stalled out amid broad economic reopening. Could either of these beaten-down stocks be a worthwhile turnaround play for patient investors?Image source: Peloton.Alibaba's high-growth days are overAlibaba's downfall started when China's antitrust regulators levied a record $2.75 billion fine against its e-commerce business in 2021. Alibaba was then barred from locking in its merchants with exclusive deals, using aggressive loss-leading promotions, and making big investments or acquisitions without the government's permission.Those restrictions eroded Alibaba's defenses against its top competitors, PDD Holdings and JD.com. China's unpredictable zero-COVID lockdowns and other macro issues also exacerbated its slowdown.As Alibaba's Chinese e-commerce marketplaces cooled off, its cloud business struggled to grow as companies reined in their spending to cope with the macro headwinds. It also lost ByteDance's TikTok as a major customer as it shifted the personal data of its overseas users to Oracle's cloud platform in 2022.All of that pressure caused Alibaba's revenue to grow just 2% in fiscal 2023 (which ended last March), compared to its 19% growth in fiscal 2022 and 41% growth in fiscal 2021.That slowdown convinced the bears that Alibaba's high-growth days were over, but it's expanding its higher-growth overseas e-commerce business -- which houses its Southeast Asian marketplace Lazada, its Turkish marketplace Trendyol, and its cross-border marketplace AliExpress -- to offset that slowdown. Its other major growth engine is its Cainiao logistics division, which it's expanding as a standalone business to provide more services for third-party customers.Story continuesFrom fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect Alibaba's revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8% as its Chinese e-commerce and cloud businesses stabilize. However, they also expect its net income to rise at a CAGR of 24% as it reins in its spending and spins off some of its units as fresh IPOs. Based on those expectations, its stock looks dirt cheap at 11 times forward earnings.Peloton is slowing resolving its biggest issuesPeloton's business started to crumble when gyms reopened and cheaper competitors entered the market. It expanded its business with a connected treadmill and other products, but its revenue still dropped 11% in fiscal 2022 (which ended in June 2022) and 22% in fiscal 2023. It expects another 3% decline in fiscal 2024.As Peloton's growth stalled out, it laid off thousands of employees, outsourced its production to a Taiwanese manufacturer, and started selling its products on Amazon to expand its reach beyond its first-party website and showrooms.Peloton also reduced its equipment prices to keep pace with its cheaper competitors, but it raised its subscription fees to offset its lower gross margin. It believes the expansion of its higher-margin subscription business will ultimately reduce its dependence on its lower-margin sales of bikes, treadmills, and other equipment.Those strategies enabled it to expand its margins and narrow its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) losses. Analysts expect its adjusted EBITDA to turn positive in fiscal 2025, but it's also expected to stay unprofitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis for the foreseeable future. On the bright side, analysts expect its revenue to finally rise 5% in fiscal 2025 and 7% in fiscal 2026 as it ""rightsizes"" its business.Peloton's stock looks cheap at a price-to-sales ratio of 1, but there's no guarantee that it will survive. It only served 718,000 paid app subscribers at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2024 -- compared to 2.97 million at the end of fiscal 2022 -- and it could run out of room to grow its revenue per subscriber before its entire business model implodes.The obvious winner: AlibabaAlibaba lost its mojo over the past few years, but I believe it's still worth owning as a slow-growth e-commerce and cloud stock. Its stock is cheap, it generates plenty of cash, and it's constantly buying back its shares. Peloton won't go bankrupt this year, but it still needs to stabilize its core business before it can be considered a worthwhile investment.Should you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?Before you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alibaba Group wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Will CrowdStrike Be a Trillion-Dollar Stock by 2040?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crowdstrike-trillion-dollar-stock-2040-170100665.html,The cloud-based cybersecurity company still has a bright future.,"CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) has generated big gains since its public debut in June 2019. The cybersecurity company went public at $34 with a valuation of $6.7 billion, and it now trades at about $300 with a market cap of $70 billion.The bulls loved CrowdStrike because it was disrupting older cybersecurity companies with its cloud-native services, which locked its customers into sticky subscriptions and eliminated the need for on-site appliances. From fiscal 2020 (which ended in Jan. 2020) to fiscal 2023, its annual revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 67% as its total number of subscription customers more than quadrupled from 5,431 to 23,019.Those breakneck growth rates are impressive, but could CrowdStrike continue expanding and become a trillion-dollar company by 2040? Let's review its business model to see if it has a shot at joining the four-comma club.Image source: Getty Images.CrowdStrike's hypergrowth days could be overAnalysts expect CrowdStrike's revenue to rise 36% in fiscal 2024, 29% in fiscal 2025, and 26% in fiscal 2026. We should take those estimates with a grain of salt, but they suggest its business is maturing as it faces more competitors.For example, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: PANW) is expanding into the cloud security market with Prisma, Microsoft is rolling out more first-party cybersecurity services for its cloud-based ecosystem, Cisco is integrating more cybersecurity services into its own networking equipment, and its smaller challenger SentinelOne is trying to automate the entire threat detection process with AI algorithms across a hybrid mix of on-site appliances and cloud-based services.The cloud-native network security market could expand at a CAGR of 14% from 2024 to 2029, according to Global Market Estimates. Mordor Intelligence expects the cloud endpoint security market -- where CrowdStrike's Falcon mainly operates -- to grow at a CAGR of only 12% during the same period.CrowdStrike might continue to grow faster than the broader industry as it expands its ecosystem and gobbles up its smaller competitors, but it probably can't replicate its hypergrowth rates from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2023. That gradual slowdown could be worrisome for a stock that already trades at 23 times next year's sales.Story continuesHow fast will CrowdStrike grow over the next 16 years?If CrowdStrike grows its top line at a CAGR of 20% from 2023 to 2040, its annual revenue will rise from $2.2 billion to $50 billion. If it's still trading at 20 times sales by then, its market cap could hit $1 trillion. That said, it would need to play its cards nearly perfectly to maintain that high growth rate and premium valuation.With a more conservative CAGR of 15% -- which seems more realistic as it faces tougher competitive challenges and unpredictable macro headwinds -- its revenue would reach $24 billion by 2040. If it's trading at a more reasonable 10 times sales, which would be comparable to Palo Alto Networks' current price-to-sales ratio, it could be worth about $240 billion.Focus on these core growth metrics insteadSimply put, CrowdStrike has a narrow but viable path toward hitting a trillion-dollar valuation by 2040 -- but it could easily fall short of that lofty target as its growth cools off.So instead of wondering if CrowdStrike will ever become a trillion-dollar company, investors should focus on its growth in customers and their increased adoption of its cloud modules instead. In its latest quarter, 42% of its customers were using at least six of its modules, compared to 36% of its customers a year ago. It's also remained profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis for three consecutive quarters as it reined in its spending and stock-based compensation.Those fundamental improvements indicate its ecosystem is sticky and that it still has plenty of pricing power in the crowded cybersecurity market. So as a long-term investor in CrowdStrike, I believe it could still easily generate more multibagger gains over the next two decades -- and I'm not concerned about its ability to join the 12-zero club in the distant future.Should you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?Before you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and CrowdStrike wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,3 Things You Must Know Before Buying Symbotic Stock,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-things-must-know-buying-162700809.html,This growing warehouse automation company has a few hidden weaknesses.,"Symbotic (NASDAQ: SYM) attracted a lot of attention when it went public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) on June 8, 2022. The warehouse automation company's shares started trading at $10.54, rallied over the following year, and closed at a record high of $63.54 on July 31, 2023.The bull case for Symbotic was easy to understand. Its autonomous robots processed pallets and cases more efficiently than human workers, and it claimed that a $50 million investment in just one of its modules (which bundle together its robots and software) could generate $250 million in lifetime savings over 25 years.Image source: Getty Images.Symbotic was also backed by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank (OTC: SFTB.Y), which owned the SPAC it merged with, and Walmart (NYSE: WMT), which took an 11% stake in the company. From fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2023 (which ended last September), the company's revenue rose at a stunning compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 116% -- and analysts expect it to continue growing at a CAGR of 44% from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026.Symbotic's stock has pulled back to about $40 as of this writing, but it's still notched a gain of roughly 280% in less than two years. It might still have room to run, but investors should keep these three things in mind before joining the bulls.1. Walmart is its biggest customerIn fiscal 2023, Symbotic generated 88% of its revenue from its Master Automation Agreement (MAA) with Walmart. That deal will last until 2034 and aims to automate all 42 of Walmart's U.S. regional distribution centers.Walmart's stake in Symbotic also gives it a lot of power over the company's decisions. Walmart can designate one of its senior employees to attend all of Symbotic's board meetings in a nonvoting capacity, while Symbotic is obligated to notify Walmart if it explores any deals that impact more than 25% of its total voting power. Walmart's partnership also bars Symbotic from ever providing its services to an unnamed ""specified company"" -- which sounds a lot like its top competitor, Amazon.Story continuesSymbotic serves other customers, like Target, Albertsons, and C&S Wholesale, but its overwhelming dependence on Walmart can't be ignored. If it doesn't meaningfully expand its customer base beyond Walmart before it finishes automating all its domestic warehouses, its sales growth will abruptly stall out.2. It just ""created"" its other major customerLast year, Symbotic formed a warehouse-as-a-service joint venture with SoftBank called GreenBox. Symbotic owns 35% of GreenBox, while SoftBank's subsidiary owns the remaining 65%. GreenBox will exclusively purchase its systems from Symbotic through a $7.5 billion contract that started in fiscal 2024 and will last six years.Symbotic believes GreenBox's modules could generate more than $500 million in annual recurring revenue once fully installed. That would be equivalent to about 14% of its projected revenue for fiscal 2026.That sounds like a promising step toward diversifying its top line away from Walmart, but Symbotic is still relying on SoftBank -- its other top investor -- to accomplish that. Symbotic's own exposure to GreenBox as an investment could also backfire if the joint venture fails to carve a meaningful niche with its automated warehouse services.3. Its dual-class shares inflate its valuationAt first glance, Symbotic's enterprise value of $2.97 billion looks cheap at 1.7 times this year's sales. However, its dual-class structure -- which grants founder Rick Cohen a 75% stake -- inflates its actual market cap to $22.9 billion.Based on that market cap, Symbotic's stock doesn't look like a bargain at 13 times this year's sales. But it also isn't too expensive if you believe more companies will automate their warehouses with Symbotic's modules. Precedence Research expects the global warehouse automation market to expand at a CAGR of 16% from 2023 to 2032.Is it the right time to buy Symbotic?Symbotic's customer concentration issues, lack of profits on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, and high valuation make it a risky stock to own. That's probably why its insiders sold about 7 times as many shares as they bought over the past three months and why 10% of its outstanding shares were still being shorted at the end of January.That said, Symbotic could eventually evolve into a more diversified warehouse automation company and generate stable long-term growth if it expands its customer base beyond Walmart and SoftBank. As economies of scale kick in, its profitability could improve, making it a more reliable growth stock. In other words, Symbotic's stock is still a decent speculative play -- but investors shouldn't be too surprised if it gets cut in half before it doubles.Should you invest $1,000 in Symbotic right now?Before you buy stock in Symbotic, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Symbotic wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Is This Small Chip Stock Better Than AMD and Intel?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/small-chip-stock-better-amd-154900600.html,"Lattice Semiconductor is tiny compared to giants AMD and Intel, but it has been outperforming them on one key metric.","Over the last decade, various players in the semiconductor industry have been getting acquired in bids to consolidate the market. One specific type of chip drew significant attention: field programmable gate arrays, or FPGAs -- a chip type with growing relevance because it's used in the semiconductor design process, artificial intelligence (AI) system designs in data centers, and in industrial and consumer electronics.Software also features prominently in FPGAs, since it is used to program (or customize) those chips for the specific uses customers require.In 2015, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) acquired Altera, a major FPGA player, for nearly $17 billion. And in 2022, AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) purchased FPGA pioneer and leader Xilinx for nearly $50 billion in an all-stock deal that completely transformed its business.Those two mega-mergers effectively left just one FPGA pure-play company standing: Lattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ: LSCC). Lattice is going through some struggles right now, but its shares have outperformed Intel in grand fashion over the last five years. And up until AMD's most recent AI-fueled surge, Lattice was outperforming it, too. There's one key reason it could be a far better long-term investment right now.Lattice is in a cyclical downturn, but for how long?Lattice had a really strong few years, especially after CEO James Anderson (formerly an executive at AMD) came aboard and started implementing strategies aimed at new product introductions. Data centers, industrial automation, and the digitalization of cars in the wake of the pandemic helped fuel its growth.LSCC Revenue (TTM) ChartBut downturns have come for some of these end markets, and Lattice is being hit, along with peers that also sell ample numbers of chips to industrial and automotive customers.The problem? After several years of chip shortages, slowing industrial demand has led to a period of chip oversupply. Lattice is now undersupplying FPGAs to help customers work through excess inventory. Some of these customers have delayed implementing a few of the company's newest chip designs and accompanying software for the time being as well.Story continuesThe end result is that the company is experiencing a cyclical downturn in revenue for the first time in quite a while. On its Q4 earnings call this month, Anderson and his team talked at length about why the first quarter of 2024 is going to be ugly. Revenue is expected to be down as much as 30% from the year prior to a range of $130 million to $150 million, but Lattice does expect its business conditions to improve in the second half of 2024 as customer inventory levels normalize.While that big unwinding of its recent revenue advances is unsettling, Lattice's upbeat commentary about the second half of 2024 at least jibes with what other industrial chipmakers and hardware designers have been saying.Lattice has one key advantageIts financials are poised to get worse before they get better, but Lattice holds a key advantage as it deals with its downturn that not even AMD and Intel have: durable profitability.Anderson and company think Lattice will remain highly profitable in the coming quarters. Even at the bottom end of its first-quarter guidance range, the company forecasts adjusted operating profit margins of at least 26%.That's rock-solid for a sizable cyclical downturn. When AMD and Intel were in the throes of their cyclical downturns of the last year and a half, their profitability all but dried up.INTC Free Cash Flow ChartOf course, the chipmaker will need to prove it. There's always a chance that this cyclical downturn will get worse and last longer than expected. But at the onset of the coming decline, small and nimble Lattice looks like a best-in-class provider of FPGAs, at least from a business model standpoint.Shares of this small chip designer and software provider do trade for a premium of about 40 times trailing-12-month earnings per share and trailing-12-month free cash flow. But if it can continue to outperform its much larger peers and return to highly profitable sales growth later this year, its stock might be worthy of consideration alongside some of the top names in the semiconductor industry.Should you invest $1,000 in Lattice Semiconductor right now?Before you buy stock in Lattice Semiconductor, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lattice Semiconductor wasn’t one of them.
