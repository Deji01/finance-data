Yahoo Finance,"This week in Bidenomics: Dow 40,000?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/this-week-in-bidenomics-dow-40000-191728391.html,"The stock market is booming, and President Biden has started to brag a little. Expect him to get bolder.","President Biden did something out of character recently: He bragged about the stock market.His timing was good. On Feb. 10, Biden tweeted, “The stock market going strong is a sign of confidence in America’s economy.” Stocks have gone up even more since then, with the Dow Jones and S&P 500 indexes hitting record highs, and the Nasdaq coming close. Wall Street analysts are now anticipating the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting 40,000 for the first time ever, which would only take another 1.8% gain.There’s nothing special about round numbers in any stock index, except that they tend to capture public attention. Biden probably figures that’s a good thing. Voters are giving him little to no credit for an economy with low unemployment, record job creation, and growth that has held up better than most economists expected.It’s no secret why voters remain dyspeptic: Inflation has cut into their purchasing power. Inflation is down from its 2022 peak, and likely heading back to normal, yet Biden’s approval rating remains mired near the low point of his presidency.So Biden, clearly needing some momentum in his reelection bid, is stretching beyond his customary reach to convince voters the economy is doing well and he deserves another term. There are obvious risks to bragging about the stock market. For one, Biden fashions himself a working-class hero and ordinary Joes don’t really want to hear about how wealthy investors are racking up gains. Second, stocks can turn on a dime and wreck your narrative — as President Donald Trump learned in 2020.Trump, while president, talked about the stock market on a weekly basis. Since it mostly went up during his first three years in office, he took credit and claimed his policies were responsible. He boasted repeatedly of stocks “smashing one record after another” and adding trillions of dollars in new wealth.President Joe Biden speaks to the National Governors Association during an event in the East Room of the White House, Friday, Feb. 23, 2024, in Washington. (Evan Vucci/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Drop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.Story continuesThen came the 2020 COVID pandemic. Stocks plunged by 34% in two months, erasing most of the gains during Trump’s term. Trump clammed up about the stock market for a while. Then stocks recovered, thanks largely to massive amounts of fiscal stimulus and dramatic monetary easing by the Federal Reserve, which drove interest rates to record lows. Trump, by then, was busy defending his spotty handling of the COVID outbreak, blaming health officials for shutting down the economy — and battling COVID, himself.Trump is bragging about the stock market once again, claiming stocks are up under Biden because investors think Trump will win the presidency again in November. That’s ridiculous, given that a hypothetical event eight months in the future almost never moves markets. Election odds could move markets in the days or weeks beforehand, as investors try to guess how the outcome will affect tax policy, government spending, and other economic issues. For now, however, what’s moving markets is corporate earnings, inflation expectations, and the likelihood of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.Still, Biden may figure he can’t let Trump take credit for a market boom while he stays silent. If the market holds up, Biden will soon enjoy bragging rights over Trump. Through Feb. 22 of each president’s fourth year in office, Trump holds an edge in stock market performance. The S&P 500 index is up 34% under Biden so far, while it was up 47% at the same point in Trump’s presidency.The chart above, however, shows how stocks yo-yoed in Trump’s fourth year. If the market simply holds steady for the next couple of months, Biden will soon be able to say stocks are doing better under his watch. And why wouldn’t he? Stock gains do generate a ""wealth effect"" that makes a lot of people better off, including ordinary workers with retirement plans. The percentage of Americans with some level of stock ownership has hit 61%, and that has to include some of the key swing voters Biden needs in November.By Election Day in 2020, stocks under Trump had basically recovered their COVID losses. But the total gain under Trump, 46%, was roughly the same as it had been nine months earlier, before COVID struck. Much more important at the time was the pandemic itself, since vaccines still weren’t available and many restrictions were still in place.Nobody knows what the stock market will do in the nine months until Election Day 2024. Some analysts say stocks are overbought and due for a tumble, while others think the rally has legs. If Biden wants to take credit for gains, he should proceed cautiously, since the stock market isn’t the real economy and it can quickly reverse, anyway.But if the Dow does hit 40,000, why not celebrate a little?Rick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

Yahoo Finance,Wall Street is pushing back its interest rate cut hopes,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-is-pushing-back-its-interest-rate-cut-hopes-185232260.html,"Amid stronger-than-expected inflation data and cautious commentary from Federal Reserve officials, markets have slashed their rate cut expectations for 2024 in half.","Investors were bullish late last year on when, and how quickly, the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates in 2024. New inflation data along with cautious comments from Fed officials have prompted markets to pull back expectations.Markets are now pricing in three interest rate cuts for 2024, in line with the Fed's most recent forecast and down from a former consensus of six cuts seen back in December, per Bloomberg data. Among those pushing back projections for cuts is Goldman Sachs. The firm said Thursday that it now sees four cuts this year instead of its previous projection of five. It expects the first interest rate cut to come in June.Read more: What the Fed rate decision means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards""Comments this week from Fed officials and the minutes to the January FOMC meeting suggest that the first rate cut is unlikely to come as early as our previous forecast of the May meeting,"" Goldman Sachs' economics team led by chief economist Jan Hatzius wrote on Thursday night.In Goldman's new forecast, Hatzius referenced comments from Fed Governor Christopher Waller who said on Thursday that ""another couple"" of months of inflation data are needed to decide whether January's hotter-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) report was a ""speed bump or a pothole."" Waller's comments came one day after minutes from the Federal Reserve's January meeting showed most officials were concerned about the risks of ""moving too quickly"" when lowering interest rates.These comments provided two takeaways for Goldman and other economists who recently spoke with Yahoo Finance. For one, the central bank appears confident the economy is on solid footing with few signs of labor market weakness or a downturn in economic growth. This, economists said, could give the Fed confidence it can keep interest rates high without sending the economy into recession.Story continuesThere is also a growing consensus that despite Fed Chair Jay Powell highlighting six-month progress on inflation at the central bank's most recent meeting, the Fed will simply want to see more data before lowering rates, as it has said. This, economists said, is why many now expect cuts to come later once more economic data is available.In sum, the conclusions have created a new market consensus that EY chief economist Gregory Daco believes is warranted given how aggressive market pricing was following the Fed's December meeting. He noted that since the Fed was late in tightening policy as inflation surged to its highest level in four decades, it will likely be more cautious about cutting too soon.""That is something that markets have not perceived,"" Daco said. ""They've now come to that view.""He added: ""Markets were anticipating too early and too rapid of a rate cutting cycle, and that just was unlikely to materialize unless the economic landscape shifted materially, unless we saw a notable slowdown in economic activity and an even faster slowdown in inflation.""Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference following the release of the Fed's interest rate policy decision at the Federal Reserve in Washington, Jan. 31, 2024. (Evelyn Hockstein/REUTERS/File Photo) (REUTERS / Reuters)But Daco, who still sees the Fed cutting four times this year beginning in May, thinks markets may have now gone too far the other way. He warned against reading too far into January economic data, which he described as ""noisy"" because the data told too many different stories.At large, Daco believes the January data showed stronger-than-expected labor market activity, but consumer spending, industrial production, and housing activity were weaker than projected. Typically, a strong labor market would support growth in those other parts of the economy.""We had a month of January where, if I had the choice, I would essentially take all the data, put it in a bag, and put it aside because I think there was very little signal in the January data,"" Daco said.Even with markets more bearish on cuts there has been a silver lining. Deutsche Bank chief US economist Matthew Luzzetti told Yahoo Finance the financial market's resilience despite a ""tremendous"" repricing in rate cut expectations was a welcome sign.He pointed to stocks holding up — both the Dow Jones and S&P 500 touched fresh intraday highs during Friday's trading session — while also noting volatility has remained low despite a rise in Treasury yields.Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Motley Fool,Here's Why Sleep Number Stock Skyrocketed Today,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-sleep-number-stock-181414948.html,"If the company stays on track, shares could keep climbing.","Shares of premium mattress brand Sleep Number (NASDAQ: SNBR) skyrocketed on Friday after the company reported financial results for 2023 and gave financial guidance for 2024. As of 10:50 a.m. ET, Sleep Number stock was up an eye-popping 39%.Sleep Number is hanging in thereTake Sleep Number's stock gains today with a grain of salt -- the stock is still down 90% from its all-time high and shares are flat year to date after this morning's gain. That said, the market is responding to a relative stabilization in consumer demand and a promising profit outlook.Sleep Number takes orders and customer deposits regularly but doesn't recognize revenue until mattresses are delivered. Therefore, there's a lag between current consumer demand and revenue -- revenue now is a reflection of past demand.Sleep Number's net sales were down 11% in 2023 -- not great. But demand in the fourth quarter was only down ""low-single digits."" And the company expects roughly the same drop in demand in 2024.However, Sleep Number prepared for the slowdown by restructuring its business to save money. Therefore, while it had negative free cash flow of $66 million in 2023, it expects to generate between $60 million and $80 million in positive free cash flow in 2024 -- a dramatic improvement.More upside ahead?It's evident that Sleep Number's financial results aren't great. But it's important to note how depressed this stock was. Even after today's jump, the market cap is only around $330 million. Therefore, the stock still only trades at around 5 times its free-cash-flow guidance -- shares could still double from here without looking expensive.The caveat to that takeaway is that Sleep Number has a heavy debt load with $540 million on its revolving credit line -- it doesn't keep cash on hand but rather uses this credit line. And the balance increased by about $80 million in 2023.In conclusion, Sleep Number stock is dirt cheap but the company isn't in a position of financial strength. If business conditions unexpectedly weaken, the company could be fighting an uphill battle.Story continuesShould you invest $1,000 in Sleep Number right now?Before you buy stock in Sleep Number, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Sleep Number wasn’t one of them.

This Fund Says It Cracked the CodeUS Lands on Moon in Historic Feat for Private SpacecraftAT&T Outage Triggered by Company Work on Network ExpansionA feat of multiple records in the world’s biggest equity market drove the S&P 500 briefly above the historic 5,100 mark. Most members of the “Magnificent Seven” group of megacaps came under pressure. Nvidia Corp.’s advance moderated, with the chipmaker hovering near $2 trillion in value.“The speed of the tech rally has left investors wondering whether to take profits,” said Mark Haefele at UBS Global Wealth Management. “While we see merit in rebalancing portfolios, we believe that retaining strategic exposure to US large-cap technology is important, and the rise in tech stocks could go further still.”A rally in AI and optimism about economic growth at a time of easing monetary policy are the ingredients of a “magic sauce” to drive more gains in equity markets, according to Bank of America Corp.’s Michael Hartnett. The strategist — who has taken a more neutral tone on stocks this year after remaining bearish through 2023 — said that a “baby bubble” in AI was “growing up.The S&P 500 edged up slightly and was poised for a weekly win. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 underperformed. Treasury 10-year yields fell seven basis points to 4.25%. Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said the economy is headed in the right direction, and it will likely be appropriate to cut rates later this year.“We expect the momentum to continue and for markets to melt-up in the short run, but the story of the stock market for this year will eventually be about the economy and the Federal Reserve,” said Chris Zaccarelli at Independent Advisor Alliance. “As long as the economy keeps expanding, it’s really hard to interrupt a bull market.”Story continuesThe “tug of war” between bulls and bears is currently being dominated by the bulls — as the technical tailwinds converge with positive fundamental developments, according to Mark Hackett at Nationwide.“We have had a powerful rally and there is still a lot of momentum in the market,” said David Donabedian at CIBC Private Wealth US. “Anyone who goes against it – taking positions that the market will go in the other direction – will be sorry. You do not want to bet against this market in the short term.”The surge in Nvidia’s shares on Thursday left short sellers with about $3 billion in paper losses, according to an analysis by S3 Partners LLC — which called it an “AI generated nightmare” for bearish traders.The mark-to-market losses are another blow for contrarians who argued that Nvidia’s sky-high valuations and speculative fever had all the makings of a market bubble about to pop. The chipmaker is the third-largest US short with $18.3 billion of shares that have been borrowed and sold, according to S3.While the rally in US tech behemoths has sparked some concern about a potential bubble, the price action is aligned with earnings fundamentals, according to Barclays Plc strategists.As long as stocks move in tandem with profit outlook, the “fear of missing out” will continue to prevail for the tech/AI space and investors will give the benefit of the doubt to lofty valuations, the team led by Emmanuel Cau wrote.“There will likely be pullbacks and volatility over the next few months and we are supportive of the buy-the-dip mentality when it comes to big tech,” said Greg Marcus at UBS Private Wealth Management.As hard as the S&P 500 rallied Thursday, the advance lacked an important component — strong participation of its constituents.As investors cheered blowout results from Nvidia — only 73% of the S&P 500’s members advanced. That’s the lowest participation for an up day of this magnitude since the immediate aftermath of the 2020 election, when the index gained 2.2% while only 47% of its members went up. Since then, 2% up days have been accompanied by an upward move in 92% of its stocks, on average, data compiled by Bloomberg show.“Even though market breadth is still narrow, it’s wider than it was last year, with more and more stocks this year outperforming the S&P 500,” Marcus added.To Matt Maley at Miller Tabak + Co., while earnings out of Nvidia sparked another strong advance, it was disappointing to see a “very narrow” rally — which hasn’t hurt the market yet.However, Maley points to a significant “valuation divergence” between Nvidia and the other AI-related stocks that has been developing for some time now.“This should have important implications for how these stocks should be weighted in one’s portfolio — even when an inevitable correction takes place at some point in the future,” he noted.Marcus at UBS says that if the Fed starts cutting interest rates, that will likely help spark wider breadth in the market.“While we expect a continued resilience in tech stocks, we also expect a less dramatic — albeit still heavy — focus on the ‘Magnificent 7’,” Marcus added. “Rate cuts are also likely to help support the broader market.”Meantime, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economists have pushed back their view on when the Fed will begin cutting interest rates to June after parsing recent comments from the central bank and minutes of its January meeting.The US investment bank has dropped its forecast for a May cut and now expects four reductions this year, versus five previously, with moves in June, July, September and December. It now sees four more cuts next year, versus a prior three, leaving the same terminal rate of 3.25%-3.5%, economists including Jan Hatzius wrote.And interest-rate strategists at JPMorgan Chase & Co. raised their year-end forecasts for Treasury yields “to reflect greater risk premium and a longer QT runway than previously expected,” a team led by Jay Barry said. The 10-year yield forecast rose to 3.80% from 3.65%.While “yields have room to decline from their current levels in the coming months” based on “markets pricing in a less dovish path than our forecast” for Fed policy — which is for 25bp rate cuts at every meeting this year beginning in June — uncertainty over the Fed’s path is likely to persist, they noted. “And Treasury yields will likely stay more elevated with a higher risk premium to reflect higher probability of fewer cuts over time.”Corporate Highlights:Jeff Bezos, Nvidia Corp. and other big technology names are investing in a business that’s developing human-like robots, according to people with knowledge of the situation, part of a scramble to find new applications for artificial intelligence.Warner Bros.
