Motley Fool,Why CarMax Stock Was Pumping the Brakes Today,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-carmax-stock-pumping-brakes-193500129.html,Shares of the used car dealer fell after a disappointing earnings report and a delay in hitting a sales target.,"Shares of CarMax (NYSE: KMX) were pulling back today after the country's largest retailer of used cars, both online and in-store, posted disappointing results in its fourth-quarter earnings report.As of 3:30 p.m. ET, the stock was down 9.5%.Image source: Getty Images.CarMax hits a bumpy roadIt's been a tough market for used car dealers as high interest rates have significantly raised monthly payments for buyers, and prices have come down from pandemic-era peaks after chip shortages and pandemic-driven demand sent prices skyrocketing.In the fourth quarter, CarMax revenue fell 1.7% to $5.63 billion, which missed estimates of $5.79 billion.Retail unit sales rose 1.3%, while comparable store unit sales ticked up 0.1% as the company continues to open new locations. Wholesale units, which make up a minority of the business, were down 4%.Margins were mostly steady as gross profit per retail used unit was $2,251, down 1% from the quarter a year ago, however higher sales, general, and administrative expenses rose modestly, and earnings per share slipped from $0.44 to $0.32, which fell well short of expectations at $0.49.CEO Bill Nash gave the performance a positive spin, saying, ""We are encouraged by the performance of our business during the fourth quarter,"" and noted growth in total used unit sales and comps.However, CarMax's guidance indicates the company sees more trouble ahead.CarMax dials back long-term expectationsWhat also weighed on the stock was CarMax's delay in its goal of selling 2 million units annually, which it said would now happen sometime between fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2030. The company's fiscal year ends in February.The company did say it expected to achieve its $33 billion annual revenue target sooner than its units goal, but the delay shows broader headwinds are impacting its growth.It's not a surprise to see the stock down given the weak results and the delay in its unit sales target.Should you invest $1,000 in CarMax right now?Before you buy stock in CarMax, consider this:Story continuesThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and CarMax wasn’t one of them.

Yahoo Finance,Stock market today: 'Magnificent 7' power stock surge after CPI-fueled sell-off,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-today-magnificent-7-power-stock-surge-after-cpi-fueled-sell-off-161315938.html,"Investors were bracing for a wholesale inflation print, after a surprise uptick in CPI shook markets and undermined bets on interest-rate cuts.","US stocks rose on Thursday as Big Tech stocks led a rebound from a sell-off fueled by Wednesday's surprise uptick in consumer prices.The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose almost 1%, coming off a rout that saw the major gauges drop about 1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the way, gaining roughly 1.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) had a more modest advance, rising about 0.3%.Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) traded around 4.56%, steadying after surging to touch its highest level since November on Wednesday.Members of the ""Magnificent 7"" tech stocks helped lead the rally: Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) were both up more than 3%, while Amazon (AMZN) gained more than 1.5% to hit a new intraday record high.The inflation front produced a slightly better picture for investors on Thursday: Producer Price Index in March rose 0.2% from the previous month, a lower rate of growth than economists had forecast. Year-over-year growth of 2.1% was also below estimates. However, that annual growth represented the fastest jump in producer prices in nearly a year.Stocks pulled back and bond yields soared after a hotter-than-expected March CPI report prompted investors to reassess expectations for Federal Reserve policy. The market is now pricing in just two rate cuts in 2024, to come later in the year than foreseen.Read more: What the Fed rate decision means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards.Against that backdrop, hopes are that first-quarter corporate results can provide momentum to stocks, given limited signs that high borrowing costs are slowing earnings. As reports trickle in, investors are bracing for quarterly updates from some of America's biggest banks, including JPMorgan (JPM), to usher in the season in earnest on Friday.Live12 updatesThu, April 11, 2024 at 12:34 PM PDT Josh SchaferMortgage rates hit nearly 7.4%Mortgage rates are on the rise once again as the prospect for higher for longer interest rates proliferates through markets.Yahoo Finance's Gabriela-Cruz Martinez reports:Homebuyers are feeling whiplashed by surging mortgage rates, and the outlook just turned grim.The average rate on the 30-year mortgage increased to 7.37% on Thursday, a steep climb from 7.11% at the beginning of the week, according to Mortgage News Daily. The quarter-point increase comes as rattled investors respond to a hotter-than-expected inflation reading.At the same time, a separate measure tracking weekly average rates rose to 6.88%, up from 6.82% the week prior, Freddie Mac found.Elevated rates have left would-be buyers in a pinch, causing both repeat and first-time buyers to step away from any purchase plans. For many, any shift in rates means losing more of their purchasing power.With inflation still running hot this past month, the results haven’t been favorable for mortgage borrowers, housing industry experts said.“March inflation figures were very bad, which also means bad news for interest rates,” said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors.Thu, April 11, 2024 at 11:46 AM PDT Josh SchaferApple stock is having its best day in 11 monthsApple (AAPL) stock was up nearly 4% in afternoon trade, pacing for its best one-day gain in nearly a year.The move came after Bloomberg reported the tech giant is preparing to enhance its Mac computers with a new group of in-house processors focused on artificial intelligence. Bloomberg wrote this would be an effort for Apple to ""boost sluggish computer sales.""Apple's rise on Thursday comes after a tough run for the stock, which recently hit its lowest levels of 2024 amid concerns of overall slowing demand for its suite of tech products.Thu, April 11, 2024 at 11:08 AM PDT Josh SchaferDeutsche Bank, Bank of America now see Fed cutting rates in DecemberInvestors hoping for interest rate cuts may have to wait for an early holiday season present from the Federal Reserve.After further signs that inflation's decline has slowed while economic growth remains resilient, the economics teams at Bank of America and Deutsche Bank both pushed back their projections for Fed interest rate cuts this year.Both economics teams, which had previously seen easing starting in the early summer, now believe the Fed will cut for the first time in December, meaning just one total cut for 2024.""We no longer think policymakers will gain the confidence they need to start cutting in June,"" Bank of America US economist Michael Gapen wrote in a research note on Thursday. ""We expect inflation to remain relatively firm in the near term. We are forecasting 0.25% m/m for core PCE in March and April. This will make a cut as early as June or September unlikely absent clear signs of labor market deterioration.""Deutsche Bank Chief US Economist Matthew Luzzetti wrote in a new research note that recent developments, including hotter-than expected inflation prints, solid labor market data and easing financial conditions have ""have clearly diminished the case for commencing rate cuts.""Luzzetti wrote that more challenging year-over-year comparisons for inflation readings later in the year, as well as the prospect of cutting rates near the election only based on more positive inflation data, could limit the Fed's willingness to cut prior to December.Luzzetti added that risks to this stance are ""two-sided.""""Further disappointing inflation data or an election outcome that delivers fiscal stimulus and / or policies that could lift inflation (e.g., trade or immigration policies) would argue for no rate cuts this year and into 2025,"" Luzzetti wrote. ""Conversely, higher-for-longer raises the risks of financial stability events or a more aggressive tightening of financial conditions that could trigger a sharper slowdown in the economy that eventually necessitates more significant policy easing.""Thu, April 11, 2024 at 10:19 AM PDT Josh SchaferLatest data shows investors should be ready for 'inflation volatility' A hotter-than-expected consumer prices reading sent markets into a tizzy on Wednesday as investors pushed back expectations for interest rate cuts amid fears inflation's decline may be slowing.On Thursday, wholesale price increases told a slightly different story. The latest Producer Price Index (PPI) showed core prices, which excludes the volatile food and energy categories, increased 0.2% month-over-month in March, down from a 0.3% increase seen in February.Notably, the month-over-month PPI number was lower than 0.4% increase seen in Wednesday's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report. ""After another sizzling CPI report, producer prices offer some relief for Fed officials who may view the recent price reports as too hot to consider rate cuts in the immediate future,"" Oxford Economics US economist Matthew Martin wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.To Charles Schwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon, the conflicting data from the last two days provides a clear takeaway for investors.""Volatile inflation is the reality for the next several years,"" Gordon told Yahoo Finance. ""One month you go back into, you know, core goods inflation, the next month, meaning March you go back into core goods deflation, and everybody's pointing at these different drivers of what was what was sending inflation higher each month.""He added: ""In terms of positioning for that, it tends to, all else equal , be more supportive o the value oriented parts of the market.""Thu, April 11, 2024 at 9:30 AM PDTInes FerréTrending tickers ThursdayRent the Runway (RENT) Shares of the clothes-rental platform soared during Thursday's trading session after the company shared an upbeat outlook for the year ahead.

That said, supply has been scarce and cost remains an issue as customers scale their models and applications. Customers have asked us to push the envelope on price-performance for AI chips, just as we have with Graviton for generalized CPU chips. As a result, we’ve built custom AI training chips (named Trainium) and inference chips (named Inferentia). In 2023, we announced second versions of our Trainium and Inferentia chips, which are both meaningfully more price-performant than their first versions and other alternatives. This past fall, leading foundation model-maker, Anthropic, announced it would use Trainium and Inferentia to build, train, and deploy its future foundation models. We already have several customers using our AI chips, including Anthropic, Airbnb, Hugging Face, Qualtrics, Ricoh, and Snap.Jassy's super long read can be found here.Thu, April 11, 2024 at 3:00 AM PDTBrian SozziThe day after the CPI sell-offYesterday was one of those shock moments in markets.We have all lived through worse sessions for stocks and seen more eye-opening economic reports, so it wasn’t shocking in that context.
