Motley Fool,"Palo Alto Networks Stock Has 26% Upside, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/palo-alto-networks-stock-26-192900878.html,"Palo Alto stock performed well when it was a growth stock, but what about now, since the growth has slowed?","Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: PANW) stock is in a funk. Two months ago, the cybersecurity company reported powerful earnings -- but slashed guidance, causing the stock to sell off. Palo Alto hasn't recovered much since.This might change. On Thursday, KeyBanc analyst Michael Turits lowered his price target on Palo Alto, as TheFly.com reports. Turits did say the stock is still worth about $355 per share, however, and he still rates Palo Alto Networks ""overweight.""But as a Palo Alto shareholder myself, I must admit: Turits' optimism stands on pretty weak legs.Is Palo Alto Networks stock a buy?Consider: KeyBanc's proprietary Value-Added Reseller (VAR) survey for the first quarter of 2024 revealed that half of the corporate IT departments that Palo Alto sells to are spending below their budgeted amounts on cybersecurity this year. Turits calls this number the ""lowest quarterly reading since the heart of the pandemic."" Multiple other surveys back up this view -- and indeed suggest the situation is getting worse, not better, for cybersecurity vendors like Palo Alto.Turits' conclusion: This is now ""a trend,"" and not a good one for Palo Alto stock. But if that's the case, then why recommend buying Palo Alto stock today?That's an excellent question, because the more I look at this stock (which I own), the less I like it.It's priced at nearly 40 times earnings, and the collective wisdom of the nearly four dozen analysts who follow Palo Alto is that it will grow earnings only 18.5% annually over the next five years. That works out to a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 2.1 -- whereas most value investors aim to buy for a PEG of less than 1.0.Given the rich valuation, that makes the chances of Palo Alto stock outperforming the market over the next five years look pretty slim. Add in the near-term risk of Palo Alto trying to sell cybersecurity in a historically weak IT market, and now seems like a bad time to get into Palo Alto Networks stock.Should you invest $1,000 in Palo Alto Networks right now?Before you buy stock in Palo Alto Networks, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palo Alto Networks wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Could Netflix Stock Help You Become a Millionaire?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-netflix-stock-help-become-192100569.html,The streaming video giant hasn't stopped growing yet.,"Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) has minted a lot of millionaires since its public debut in 2002. A $10,000 investment in its initial public offering (IPO) would be worth a whopping $5.4 million today. But it wasn't a smooth ride. Netflix's stock endured some steep declines over the past two decades as it repeatedly transformed its business model, yet it has consistently proved the bears wrong.Some investors might argue that Netflix is running of room to grow. After all, it already owns the world's top premium streaming video platform with 269.6 million paid subscribers and has a market capitalization of $260 billion. But could this streaming video giant still generate more millionaire-making gains from a fresh $10,000 investment today?Image source: Getty Images.Netflix is still growingBack in April 2022, Netflix's stock sank to its lowest levels in more than four years. That decline was triggered by its first sequential loss of subscribers in over a decade in the first quarter of 2022.It attributed some of that decline to the Russo-Ukrainian war and users sharing their passwords, but management also admitted that the company faced stiff competition and said it would roll out a cheaper ad-supported tier to gain new users. Those strategies suggested Netflix was running out of room to grow, and that it still needed to ramp up its spending on fresh content to lock in more viewers. It suffered another sequential loss of subscribers in the second quarter of 2022.However, Netflix gained subscribers sequentially in the third quarter of 2022, and its year-over-year growth in subscribers accelerated over the past year. It also started generating double-digit revenue growth again over the past two quarters.MetricQ1 2023Q2 2023Q3 2023Q4 2023Q1 2024Paid subscribers (millions)232.50238.39247.15260.28269.60Subscriber Growth (YOY)4.9%8%10.8%12.8%16%Revenue (billions)$8.16$8.19$8.54$8.83$9.37Revenue Growth (YOY)3.7%2.7%7.8%12.5%14.8%Data source: Netflix. YOY = Year over year.Netflix attributed its accelerating growth to the expansion of its new paid-sharing plans, price hikes for its existing subscribers, currency exchange tailwinds, and robust viewership numbers for hit shows like Griselda, 3 Body Problem, and Avatar: The Last Airbender. Its number of ad-supported memberships also grew nearly 70% sequentially in the third and fourth quarters of 2023, then rose another 65% sequentially in the first quarter of 2024.For 2024, Netflix expects its revenue to rise between 13% and 15% and for its operating margin to expand from 21% to 25%. Those expanding margins reinforce its reputation as the only major streaming platform that can generate consistent profits. Walt Disney, which served nearly 150 million paid Disney+ subscribers in its last quarter, believes its direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming unit can finally turn profitable by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ends this September).Story continuesBut how much larger can it grow?Netflix is still expanding, but it recently surprised investors by saying it would stop disclosing its paid subscriber and average revenue per member (ARM) metrics in 2025. It insists those changes reflect the expansion of its pricing tiers and the introduction of new revenue streams like advertising and paid sharing plans. However, the elimination of those key metrics could make it much harder to gauge Netflix's growth while masking the lumpier expansion of its global audience.For now, analysts expect Netflix's revenue to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12% as its earnings per share (EPS) increases at a CAGR of 28%. But at $580, Netflix's stock doesn't look particularly cheap at 34 times this year's earnings. That's because it's still being valued as a higher-growth tech stock, rather than a slower-growth media stock.Let's assume Netflix hits those targets and grows its EPS at a respectable CAGR of 20% through 2034. If that happens and Netflix still trades at about 30 times earnings, its stock might be trading at around $3,300 per share in 10 years.That would represent a near-sixfold gain from its current price -- but it would fall woefully short of turning a $10,000 investment into $1 million. Netflix is still a solid play on the secular growth of the streaming media market, but investors shouldn't expect it to replicate its millionaire-making gains from the past two decades.Should you invest $1,000 in Netflix right now?Before you buy stock in Netflix, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Netflix wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,He Was the Brains Behind Turning Stanley Tumblers Into a National Sensation. Now He's Joining Forces With a Hot Growth Stock That's Up More Than 300% in the Last 5 Years.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brains-behind-turning-stanley-tumblers-183800278.html,A headwind could become a tailwind if things go right.,"Just months ago, shoppers were camping out all night in front of Target to be the first to get their hands on limited edition Stanley Tumblers. However, a few years ago, Stanley -- founded in 1913 -- was just a stodgy brand from years gone by. But in 2020, the company brought in Terence Reilly as president, and it hasn't been the same since.Stanley reportedly went from about $70 million in sales in 2019 to $750 million in 2023, riding the coattails of its tumbler cups' success. But the difference for Stanley was clearly Reilly, not the tumblers themselves.Consider that Stanley Tumblers launched in 2016 and flopped. But under Reilly's leadership, the brand brought the cups back and used social media influence to market to an entirely new female demographic. This included swapping 100-year-old brand colors for new pastel colors. The plan clearly worked.As it turns out, Stanley wasn't Reilly's first rodeo. Previously, he was one of the architects who turned clog-style shoe company Crocs (NASDAQ: CROX) into a popular brand. So clearly Reilly has a gift when it comes to marketing products. The good news for Crocs' shareholders is that he's now back with the company and tasked with leading what's perhaps the company's largest opportunity.Crocs' virtuoso comes homeOn April 16, Crocs announced that it had appointed Terence Reilly as its president for its HEYDUDE shoe brand. In the press release, CEO Andrew Rees said: ""I am confident he is the right person to lead the HEYDUDE Brand into its next phase of growth.""Crocs acquired the HEYDUDE brand in February 2022 for $2.5 billion, taking on a $2 billion loan to do it. It hasn't necessarily been a bad acquisition per se, but it hasn't exactly been a resounding success either.In 2021, HEYDUDE generated around $600 million in annual revenue. In 2023, the brand had revenue of $949 million. Therefore, it's grown under Crocs' umbrella. That said, HEYDUDE's revenue slipped 4% year over year in 2023 (on a pro forma basis), which is concerning.The slip in HEYDUDE's revenue is concerning for another reason. One of the reasons Crocs stock is up more than 300% in the last five years is because the company has some of the best operating profit margins in the shoe business. In 2023, the adjusted operating margin for the Crocs brand took another step forward, from 33% in 2022 to over 36% in 2023. In contrast, HEYDUDE's adjusted operating margin fell from 31% to 25%.Therefore, not only are sales falling for HEYDUDE, it's also getting less profitable. This could suggest that the brand is losing its place in the market, and it's consequently not able to price its products where it wants.Story continuesThis is a huge opportunity for CrocsThere have been more devastating failed acquisitions than I can count among public companies during the last several years. Fortunately, Crocs' acquisition of HEYDUDE won't be that bad even in a worst-case scenario. In fact, the company repaid nearly $700 million of its debt in 2023 alone because it still generates tons of cash flow, even with the HEYDUDE headwind.Therefore, HEYDUDE won't be an insurmountable setback for Crocs if things go wrong. But on the flip side, this could be an enormous opportunity if Reilly can reinvigorate the brand, as he did with Stanley.Even after the huge gains for Crocs stock, it still trades firmly in value territory at less than 10 times its trailing earnings.CROX PE Ratio ChartThe Crocs brand generates roughly three times as much annual revenue as HEYDUDE. If, hypothetically, Reilly can help grow HEYDUDE into something that rivals Crocs over the next five years or so, then the company's overall profits would be significantly higher.Crocs has a cheap valuation today, which mitigates downside risk for investors right now. But the Crocs brand is still growing, and the HEYDUDE brand is now helmed by someone capable of orchestrating a viral-growth story. Both of these factors provide investors with ongoing upside opportunity.This is exactly why I believe Crocs stock is still a buy today: The downside is likely limited, but the upside potential could very well be better than the average performance for the S&P 500.Should you invest $1,000 in Crocs right now?Before you buy stock in Crocs, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Crocs wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,"Opinion: These 2 ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks Will Be the Largest Companies in the World by 2030",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/opinion-2-magnificent-seven-stocks-183700185.html,"There is still a lot of growth left for these technology giants, despite their immense size.","Making long-term predictions is difficult. Who would have guessed 10 years ago that Nvidia would be one of the largest companies by market cap in the world? Very few.Despite this uncertain future, I still believe it is useful for investors to look out five to 10 years and think about what companies could be much larger than they are today. Otherwise, you are just making shots in the dark and should probably buy index funds instead.While not a certainty, I think ""Magnificent Seven"" giants Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) will be the two largest companies in the world by 2030. Here's why.1. Amazon: Put everything in the cloudAmazon's culture of innovation has allowed it to win in multiple large product categories. Most of us know it as the dominant e-commerce platform in North America, which brings in hundreds of billions in annual sales. But it is not the most profitable segment for Amazon today: That distinction goes to Amazon Web Services (AWS).AWS is the largest cloud infrastructure provider worldwide, bringing in $91 billion in revenue and just under $25 billion in operating income last year. Its major competitors are Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and other smaller providers, but AWS has remained the largest cloud service since its inception around two decades ago, with around 31% market share.Even though AWS is already large, there is still plenty of room for the cloud to gain market share versus legacy computing solutions. Analysts expect the industry to grow at a 19% rate through 2030. If AWS can maintain its market share and profit margin profile, that will lead to the division to grow its earnings at 19% a year and hit over $90 billion in 2030. Add in the monster e-commerce division, international expansion in places such as India, and moonshots like the Project Kuiper internet service, and I think Amazon has a good chance of being one of the two largest companies in the world by 2030.2. Alphabet: Multiple levers for growthAnd who will the other be? Well, all we need to do is look at one of Amazon's cloud computing competitors.GOOG Operating Income (TTM) ChartAlphabet is the parent company of Google Search, YouTube, Google Cloud, and other projects like self-driving company Waymo. Google Cloud should see the same growth benefits as AWS, growing from a $36 billion annualized revenue rate at the end of 2023 to close to $100 billion in revenue by 2030. That should generate a lot of value for Alphabet, but it's not the only ace up its sleeve.First, we need to highlight Google Search and how much revenue it generates. The dominant search engine worldwide generated $48 billion in revenue just in the fourth quarter of 2023 and should do $200 billion in annual sales within a few years. As the key advertising engine for many industries like travel, insurance, and financial services, Google Search revenue should grow along with global GDP as more of the world starts using smartphones and the internet.Story continuesLet's not forget YouTube. Alphabet owns the largest video platform worldwide, which generated $9.2 billion in advertising revenue last quarter. YouTube has billions of users around the world and is the most popular streaming video service on TVs in the United States. Yes, that is TVs in the United States, not all devices.YouTube is a growing entertainment mainstay for people around the world. I think it will be even more dominant in 2030.Last year, Alphabet generated $85.7 billion in operating earnings. With so many growth levers to pull, it seems likely that the company will continue growing its earnings over the next few years. By 2030, I think this will lead the Magnificent Seven giant to pass the likes of Apple and Microsoft and become one of the two largest companies in the world alongside Amazon.Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) Productivity Tools Could Be a $13 Trillion Market, According to Cathie Wood. Here Is 1 Stock That Could Dominate.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/artificial-intelligence-ai-productivity-tools-182200494.html,Artificial intelligence (AI) can help significantly increase output for office workers.,"Breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) are advancing so quickly, it's getting harder to imagine a world in which the technology isn't impacting just about every facet of daily life.While much of the chatter surrounding AI has revolved around areas such as accelerated computing and healthcare, there's another use case that's piqued my interest. Integrating artificial intelligence into the corporate workforce represents a unique and compelling long-term opportunity.Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood has declared that AI software has the ability to significantly increase productivity in the workplace. In a recent report, Wood suggests that AI automation software could be a $13 trillion market in 2030.Believe it or not, there are a host of companies focusing on building more efficient workplace environments through the power of technology. UiPath (NYSE: PATH) is a leading player in AI-powered automation tools, and I think it could be the best investment option in this pocket of the AI realm.Let's break down how AI can redefine workplace dynamics and assess why UiPath is a compelling long-term opportunity.Workplace productivity is ripe for disruptionBringing efficiencies to basic tasks is not a new idea. In many cases, technology has been the key to unlocking these gains.In Ark Invest's Big Ideas 2024 report, Wood presents some interesting case studies related to robotics and how they've enhanced completing mundane and administrative aspects of labor.For example, Wood says that the advent of the washing machine cut down the average time to do laundry by 87%. Similarly, integrating assembly lines into factories significantly reduced the time needed to manufacture a car.These ideas have been applied to the workplace for decades. For example, sales and marketing leaders have relied on customer relationship management (CRM) tools from the likes of Salesforce for many years.Moreover, enterprise resource planning (ERP) suites from SAP and Oracle have facilitated some of the largest businesses in the world when it comes to aggregating financials, analyzing operating metrics, and more.According to Wood, by automating tasks through artificial intelligence, the average worker's productivity could increase by 4.5x. If all of the potential software vendors captured just 10% of the productivity gain, Wood posits, these companies could reap $13 trillion in combined revenue.This scenario implies that UiPath has a greenfield opportunity as it relates to the intersection of AI and workplace productivity. Let's dive into how the company is actually performing, and how it stacks up against the competition.Story continuesImage source: Getty Images.UiPath is leading the chargeUiPath operates in the robotic processing automation (RPA) market. Essentially, the company's software helps automate administrative tasks and boost workflow processes.UiPath ended last year with over 2,000 customers spending at least $100,000 per year on its platform. Moreover, UiPath increased its customer count by 26% year over year for those spending at least $1 million per year on its software suite. This highlights UiPath's deep penetration in both small and midsize enterprises (SMEs) as well as larger corporate accounts.The accelerated customer adoption isn't entirely surprising given how much demand for AI has risen over the last year. The company increased revenue by 24% last year to $1.3 billion. Meanwhile, adjusted free cash flow was $309 million. By comparison, the company was essentially breakeven on a free-cash-flow basis during the prior year.With an impressive partner ecosystem that includes SAP, IBM, Accenture, PwC, and Deloitte, I think UiPath's growth story is just getting started.A compelling valuation narrativeThe chart below benchmarks UiPath against a cohort of other enterprise software platforms that offer workplace productivity solutions. With a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 8.4, investors can see that UiPath is positioned right in the middle of this peer set.PATH PS Ratio ChartWhat I find most interesting about the analysis above is that UiPath is valued more in line with the larger tech behemoths operating in the RPA space -- with Microsoft being the lone exception. Given the success Microsoft has demonstrated through its CoPilot platform, it's not entirely surprising to see it trading at such a noticeable premium among this peer set.Keep in mind that UiPath ended last year with about $2 billion of cash and equivalents on its balance sheet. Although the company is cash-flow-positive, one item to consider is how the company will allocate its resources. In order to compete with big tech behemoths at scale, UiPath will likely need to increase spending.While that would impact the company's bottom line, it could be a worthwhile strategy. I'm optimistic about the efficiencies that AI can bring to the workplace in the long run, and am aligned with Wood's theory that the market opportunity is enormous.So far, UiPath has proven that it can compete in the RPA market against larger and better-capitalized enterprises. Given how fast AI is impacting other important end markets, I think it'll be sooner rather than later that the technology will begin to make serious impacts on workplace environments.I think now is a good time to consider scooping up shares in UiPath as productivity becomes more of a focal point for businesses of all sizes.Should you invest $1,000 in UiPath right now?Before you buy stock in UiPath, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and UiPath wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Will Oracle Be a Trillion-Dollar Stock by 2030?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-trillion-dollar-stock-2030-180600889.html,"This tech sector stalwart has received a nice boost of late thanks to AI, but how big a winner could it become in the long run?","Shares of Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) have underperformed the broader market in the past year, rising a modest 25% while the tech-laden Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index has clocked gains of almost 45%. However, the provider of database and cloud services provider has shot into the limelight of late thanks to artificial intelligence (AI).Last month, investors cheered Oracle's results from its fiscal 2024 third quarter, which ended Feb. 29. The database specialist not only delivered better-than-expected numbers, but also revealed a solid improvement in its revenue pipeline thanks to the growing demand for its AI solutions. However, will Oracle be able to capitalize on the AI opportunity, beat the broader stock market in the long run, and become a trillion-dollar company by 2030?AI could accelerate Oracle's growthIn Oracle's fiscal 2018, it reported $39.8 billion in revenue. The company is expected to finish fiscal 2024 in a few months with a total revenue of $53.2 billion. That translates into a six-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.6%. For the current fiscal year, Oracle is expecting a 6.6% increase in revenue.However, Oracle's top-line growth rate is expected to improve over the next couple of years, hitting 10% in its fiscal 2026.ORCL Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year ChartThe growing adoption of cloud-based enterprise AI applications could help accelerate Oracle's growth beyond fiscal 2026. That's because the market for cloud-based AI services is set to grow rapidly from an estimated revenue of $43 billion in 2022 to a forecast $887 billion in 2032, according to researchers at Valuates Reports. The good news for Oracle investors is that this market has started moving the needle in a nice way for the company.In its fiscal third quarter, Oracle generated $9.96 billion in revenue from its cloud services business -- an increase of 12% from the prior-year period. The segment now accounts for 75% of the company's total revenue compared to 72% in the year-ago quarter. However, this business's growth pace looks poised to accelerate, as Oracle's remaining performance obligations were up an impressive 28% year over year to $80 billion.Oracle attributed this sharp increase to the ""[l]arge new cloud infrastructure contracts"" it signed during the quarter for its AI-focused Gen2 cloud infrastructure. It is worth noting that Oracle is witnessing stronger-than-expected demand for its Gen2 AI cloud infrastructure. That rising demand, which is outstripping its capacity, explained CEO Safra Catz in the earnings release, is why the company is ""opening new and expanding existing cloud datacenters very, very rapidly.""Story continuesOracle's focus on building and expanding its data center infrastructure should eventually help it make the most of the cloud-based AI market in the long run. But will that be enough to lift Oracle into the trillion-dollar club?What the long-term picture may look likeAs mentioned, Oracle's revenue is expected to increase to $63.6 billion in its fiscal 2026, with the company exiting that year with a growth rate of just over 10%. Assuming Oracle's revenue continues accelerating and it can clock a CAGR of 12% over the five fiscal years that follow, its top line would jump to just over $112 billion in its fiscal 2031, which will end in mid-2030.The companies in the U.S. technology sector average a price-to-sales ratio of 7.1. Assuming Oracle trades at a similar multiple in 2030, its market cap would then be about $796 billion. Now, that would be short of the $1 trillion market cap milestone, but it also suggests that Oracle stock could rise by 140% from current levels in that time frame. Moreover, if Oracle manages to clock faster growth thanks to its AI-related businesses, it could get closer to $1 trillion, or even exceed it.Finally, as the company is trading at 6.5 times sales right now -- a discount to the tech sector's average -- buying this AI stock looks like a no-brainer. Oracle seems built for robust long-term upside thanks to its improving AI credentials.Should you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now?Before you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Oracle wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,"1 Unstoppable Stock That Turned $10,000 Into $75,000 in the Last 10 Years: Time to Buy?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-unstoppable-stock-turned-10-180500677.html,This business demonstrates how fantastic returns can be achieved by buying boring stocks.,"In the past decade, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite index have produced total returns, including dividends, of 225% and 323%, respectively. These gains prove that investing in the stock market is a fantastic way of building wealth.Unsurprisingly, some companies have fared much better. Your mind might immediately go to the dominant ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks, which is understandable.But it might shock you to learn that O'Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ: ORLY), a leading aftermarket auto parts retailer, has seen its shares skyrocket 657% in the past 10 years, turning a $10,000 investment into more than $75,000 today (as of April 17). Should you hop on the bandwagon and buy this winning stock?Creating value for shareholdersInvestors will find no shortage of reasons why O'Reilly Automotive is such a wonderful company. There's no doubt that these positive attributes have contributed to its stock's performance.For starters, the business continues to benefit from meaningful expansion opportunities. O'Reilly currently has 6,157 stores after opening 186 in 2023. The plan is to open 195 more this year. The industry is extremely fragmented, giving the company plenty of opportunity to lean on its scale and brand to gain market share.There are two other powerful industry trends that will keep propelling O'Reilly. One is the fact that each and every year, the number of cars on the road goes up. Moreover, these vehicles are getting older, which leads to greater demand for O'Reilly's products and services.Speaking of demand dynamics, investors will appreciate how recession-resilient this company is. Consumers need their cars to work no matter what, whether we're in good or bad economic times. This situation drastically adds stability and predictability to the business model.From a financial perspective, O'Reilly has been able to steadily increase its top and bottom lines. In the past 10 years, revenue and diluted earnings per share have risen at compound annual rates of 9% and 20%, respectively. Given the factors I just outlined, there's a good chance this kind of performance can continue for the foreseeable future.Even after investing capital toward opening more stores, O'Reilly generates more cash than it knows what to do with. That's why management aggressively repurchases shares, spending $3.2 billion to buy back the stock in 2023. In the past five years, the outstanding share count has been reduced by a jaw-dropping 26%. This means longtime investors constantly see their ownership stakes rise over time. Story continuesWhat about the valuation?After a business puts up an outstanding 657% return in the past decade, investors are right to wonder if the shares still present a compelling buying opportunity. It's best when a stock is purchased below its intrinsic value, as the potential for outsized forward returns is still present and expectations haven't gotten too frothy.As of this writing, shares of O'Reilly trade at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28.4. This is about as expensive as the stock has been in the last eight or so years. And it represents a sizable premium to the trailing five- and 10-year average P/E multiples. So you can make a valid argument that shares are overvalued right now.Investors might be persuaded to wait for a much better entry price. That makes sense as a rational way of thinking, but perhaps the best strategy if you're bullish on this business is to dollar-cost average in the stock over several months. This will allow you to buy at multiple entry points.Given the superior quality of O'Reilly, it could be a winner in your portfolio over the next several years.Should you invest $1,000 in O'Reilly Automotive right now?Before you buy stock in O'Reilly Automotive, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and O'Reilly Automotive wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Is SoundHound AI the Next Millionaire-Maker Tech Stock?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/soundhound-ai-next-millionaire-maker-180000472.html,"Shares in SoundHound AI are up over 80% so far this year, trouncing the major indexes.","Artificial intelligence (AI) has many different applications. One budding area in the AI realm that big tech firms are exploring right now is voice-recognition software.""Magnificent Seven"" members Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Nvidia are all investing heavily in AI-powered speech.Yet despite big tech's pursuit of this technology, a smaller player has made headlines this year. SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) specializes in voice-recognition software for the restaurant, automobile, and smart home industries.Earlier this year, shares of SoundHound AI soared following news that Nvidia is an investor with the company.Although the stock has retreated from its peak levels, it's still up over 80% year to date. When you compare that to the 3% return of the Nasdaq Composite, you might be wondering if SoundHound AI can be a million-dollar opportunity.AI-powered voice technology is an enormous marketThe market for voice-recognition technology could reach $50 billion by 2029, according to Statista. Considering this tech can be integrated into vehicles, smart-home appliances, and various business settings, it's easy to see why so many of the world's largest enterprises are pursuing the technology.Moreover, venture capital investor Chamath Palihapitiya recently posted on X (formerly Twitter) that voice represents the ""front door"" to the next phase of the AI revolution.Palihapitiya could be onto something here. Over the last year or so, the world has become captivated by the rise of ChatGPT. Its creator, OpenAI, recently announced the company is exploring applications in AI-powered speech.Given the potential size of the market and the number of high-profile companies competing, it's intriguing that such a small-scale player like SoundHound is receiving so much attention.SoundHound AI is in the spotlight but ...Though Nvidia published the 13F filing disclosing its investment in SoundHound in February, it has been an investor with the company since 2017. This was before SoundHound went public, and it was raising funds from venture capital firms and prominent tech giants.In 2023, SoundHound AI grew revenue 47% to $45.9 million. Moreover, the company reduced its operating losses by 51% -- reporting negative adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $35 million.The growth is attractive, but it doesn't fully explain the triple-digit gains the stock has seen at various points in 2024.Can investing in the company make you a millionaire?For illustrative purposes, I'll assume SoundHound sustains its 2023 growth rate through 2030 to project future sales. By doing so, the company would generate roughly $680 million of revenue by 2030.Story continuesThe stock also trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of about 18 as of this writing. Considering there is a lot of competition entering the voice-recognition market, and the company's path to profitability is unproven, I'll trim its long-term P/S multiple in half to 9.These assumptions result in a future market capitalization of $6.1 billion for the stock. This is roughly 5.5 times its current market cap of $1.1 billion, which means you'd have to invest more than $180,000 to get to $1 million.Not only is that a lot of money for any single position, but there are risks for SoundHound that make any significant investment particularly dicey.The table below breaks down consensus analyst estimates for SoundHound's revenue through 2025:Category2025 Estimate2024 Estimate2023 ActualRevenue$102.8 million$69.5 million$45.9 millionData source: Yahoo FinanceOn the surface, the growth trends in the table above are in line with the assumptions I made above. However, alarm bells went off when I noticed a change in terminology on SoundHound's reported financials.Specifically, management updated how the company accounts for its backlog, which now includes ramped-up deals with clients that aren't guaranteed. The details in company filings further indicate that SoundHound is recognizing sources of non-recurring revenue in any given quarter, but management is classifying these transactions as royalties and subscriptions in its financials.This makes it hard to get a sense of SoundHound AI's true, normalized revenue profile. Therefore, forecasting the company's growth is an even more daunting exercise.Given the risks around hyped-up, small, and unprofitable companies, I think the stock is more of a momentum play. Long-term investors should beware of momentum stocks. Rather, if you're interested in the voice-recognition market and its proliferation across the AI spectrum, investors have no shortage of other opportunities in much more established, proven businesses.Should you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?Before you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoundHound AI wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,"1 Stock That Turned $10,000 Into More Than $1.3 Million",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-stock-turned-10-000-175000407.html,Costco has come to dominate its industry over the past few decades.,"Over long periods of time, investing in stocks can lead to magnificent gains. That's exactly what Costco (NASDAQ: COST) has done for its investors.In the past 30 years, shares have returned 13,300%, including dividends. That gain would have turned a $10,000 investment into more than $1.3 million today (as of April 16). This performance absolutely crushes the S&P 500.To gain a better appreciation for what Costco has accomplished for investors, it's worthwhile to look at its history. Then, with a fresh perspective, we can determine if this unstoppable retail stock makes for a no-brainer buy right now.Scaling up the businessCostco's business model hasn't changed over the years. About 30 years ago, the company operated 200 warehouse locations, generating $15 billion of net sales in fiscal 1993. Costco currently has 876 warehouses open, raking in $238 billion in net sales in fiscal 2023.This has been a story about a business that has scaled up its operations in a tremendous fashion. Three decades ago, the company's executive team figured out that low prices on high-quality merchandise in a no-frills shopping environment are what every customer wanted. So, they invested aggressively in expanding domestically and internationally. It's a repeatable and proven playbook that is still in force today.The result of this strategy has been rising sales and earnings. This business is consistently profitable, giving it the ability to pay one-time special dividends every few years. The most recent payout of $15 per share was announced last December, boosting investor returns.Costco is currently the world's third biggest retailer, behind only Walmart and Amazon. It has 73 million member households that pay annual fees to have the right to shop at the company's warehouses. This helps generate a predictable and recurring high-margin revenue stream.A company that has become as dominant as Costco benefits from some competitive strengths. In this case, the business possesses a powerful scale advantage. Because it buys merchandise in such massive quantities, it is able to obtain favorable pricing on goods, savings that are constantly passed on to customers.Even with the rise of online shopping, Costco has been able to open new locations, grow revenue and net income, and add new members. This makes me believe that the company's competitive position is insulated from the threat of disruption, whatever that may look like.Past results don't resemble forward returnsAs of this writing, Costco carries a market cap of $316 billion, which makes it the world's 29th most valuable business. Add this to its monster sales base, and I'm positive that forward returns aren't going to come anywhere near what they've reached in the past.Story continuesThere's still growth potential. Costco was able to open 23 net new warehouses in fiscal 2023, with management expecting 28 more in the current fiscal year. According to Wall Street consensus analyst estimates, the company is projected to grow revenue at 6% per year on average over the next three years.These would still be healthy gains. But it's safe to say that Costco's expansion potential isn't as large as it once was.The valuation is also worrying. Shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 46.6. They've rarely been more expensive in the last 20 years. While the business has a dominant position in the retail sector, the stock is likely to disappoint going forward given its nosebleed price tag.It would be easy to argue that paying that type of valuation makes sense. However, that's only if you believe Costco will be able to grow at a faster clip in the next five to 10 years than it did in the past. I just don't think that's a probable outcome. Therefore, I'm not a buyer of the stock right now.Should you invest $1,000 in Costco Wholesale right now?Before you buy stock in Costco Wholesale, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Costco Wholesale wasn’t one of them.
