Motley Fool,Super Micro Computer Stock Is Rising Again Today. Is It Still a Good Buy?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/super-micro-computer-stock-rising-193741231.html,Several insiders -- and the company itself -- are taking advantage of the stock's massive gains.,
Motley Fool,"MongoDB Stock Has 34% Upside, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mongodb-stock-34-upside-according-193700562.html,"Should you buy MongoDB before it reports earnings? Citi says ""yes.""","MongoDB (NASDAQ: MDB) is due to report fourth-quarter earnings after close of trading on Thursday -- and Wall Street is nervous. Analysts following the database are expecting strong sales growth for the quarter -- more than 20% -- but a steep falloff in earnings, which could plunge 17% to $0.47 per share.Or perhaps I should say most analysts are nervous.On Wednesday morning, before earnings even come out, Citigroup analyst Tyler Radke decided to double down on his ""buy"" rating on MongoDB stock -- and raise his target price to $550 per share, implying 34% upside in MongoDB stock.Is MongoDB stock a buy?This is not to say that Radke has zero qualms about MongoDB. Writing in a note covered by TheFly.com on Wednesday, the analyst notes that peer tech stocks Elastic and Snowflake both disappointed with their guidance last week, which didn't live up to (perhaps irrationally exuberant) expectations, leading Citi to ""temper"" its optimism. Deal sizes being recorded in the sector, noted Radke, are still ""healthy,"" albeit trending smaller in January.So why raise the price target if Citi isn't 100% certain that MongoDB is going to wow us? Honestly, I'm not sure. Despite raising its price target (implying it thinks the stock is worth more than its current $411 share price), Radke advised investors to wait for even steeper ""pullbacks"" in the shares before buying -- which sounds kind of contradictory.It also might be the right call.Consider: With negative profit by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and only $89 million in trailing free cash flow (FCF), MongoDB stock costs well over 320 times FCF going into earnings. Granted, investors have high hopes that this growth stock will grow into its pricey valuation. (Long-term growth rates are estimated at 50%.) But like Radke said, these are high hopes ... that might need to be tempered.If MongoDB misses on earnings Thursday, or even just disappoints on guidance, that might be exactly what happens: MongoDB stock could get ""tempered"" ... with a vengeance.Story continuesShould you invest $1,000 in MongoDB right now?Before you buy stock in MongoDB, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and MongoDB wasn’t one of them.

TipRanks,"These 2 ‘Strong Buy’ Penny Stocks Could Surge Over 200%, Say Analysts",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-strong-buy-penny-stocks-192536680.html,"Risk and reward are the watchwords of all investing, and that’s especially true in the stock markets. Business cycles turn up and down, economies rise and fall, companies succeed or fail on idiosyncratic grounds – it takes a special kind of risk tolerance to try and read the tea leaves scattered on Wall Street. But the savvy investor knows that tolerating risk is the key to success – and that few stock segments offer a better reward potential, for the risk involved, than the penny stocks. These","Risk and reward are the watchwords of all investing, and that’s especially true in the stock markets. Business cycles turn up and down, economies rise and fall, companies succeed or fail on idiosyncratic grounds – it takes a special kind of risk tolerance to try and read the tea leaves scattered on Wall Street.But the savvy investor knows that tolerating risk is the key to success – and that few stock segments offer a better reward potential, for the risk involved, than the penny stocks. These shares, priced under $5 each, can offer an attractive combination of low cost of entry and solid potential for high-percentage returns, and triple-digit share appreciation is not uncommon. The risk – if these shares turn south, the losses can be just as heavy.Still, for the risk-friendly investors, the ‘pennies’ are a popular choice, and that brings these low-cost shares onto the analysts’ radar screens. In fact, two in particular have caught the experts’ eyes – for their potential to surge over 200%. Furthermore, according to the TipRanks database, each has earned a “Strong Buy” consensus rating from the analyst community.Clearside Biomedical (CLSD)We’ll start with Clearside Biomedical, a medical research firm focused on ocular health. Specifically, Clearside is working on the development of new treatments for serious diseases that affect the back of the eye. The company describes its goal as restoring and preserving vision, and has developed a patented suprachoroidal space (SCS) microinjector, a novel delivery mechanism that can direct the therapeutic agent directly to the back of the eye.Clearside currently has one product, Xipere, approved for use in the US. This is the firm’s first commercial product, and the first approved therapeutic agent designed specifically for SCS delivery. The drug is a treatment for macular edema associated with uveitis, the first such therapy on the market, and has been licensed to Bausch + Lomb for commercialization in the US and Canada.Story continuesIn addition, the company is working on a pipeline of small-molecule drug candidate compounds suitable for the SCS microinjector system, designed to take maximum advantage of that novel pathway in the treatment of eye diseases. The most notable of these, CLS-AX, is a treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD. CLS-AX, or axitinib, has the high-potency and pan-VEGF attributes of TKI axitinib, combined with the specialized use of the targeted SCS microinjector delivery. The drug candidate’s small molecule suspension allows for enhanced durability.CLS-AX is undergoing a Phase 2b ODYSSEY trial, a test of the drug as delivered by the SCS microinjector in the treatment of wet AMD. The company is progressing with the trial, and recently reported that randomization has been completed. Topline data is expected from this clinical trial in 3Q24.The ODYSSEY trial, and the potential inherent in the CLS-AX drug candidate, caught the attention of JMP’s Jonathan Wolleben, a 5-star analyst rated in the top 3% of the Street’s stock pros.“We continue to recommend CLSD shares ahead of its ODYSSEY data, which we think have a high likelihood of showing improved durability vs. Eylea. While ODYSSEY is not powered for noninferiority on its primary BCVA endpoint, management expects CLS-AX will have similar results to Eylea, with all CLS-AX treated patients going >/=4 months before requiring rescue, and the majority lasting six months. ODYSSEY enrolled quickly and exceeded the 60-patient target, reflecting wet AMD patients’ enthusiasm for CLS-AX… We believe CLSD has the most room for upside in the group and is worth investors taking a look before the company reports [the] Phase 2 data in 3Q24,” Wolleben opined.To this end, Wolleben rates CLSD an Outperform (i.e. Buy) along with a $5 price target. This implies shares could soar ~268% in the next year. (To watch Wolleben’s track record, click here)Wolleben is not the only analyst to see a solid upside here; all three of this stock’s recent reviews are positive, resulting in a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock is trading at $1.39, and with an average price target of $5.67, the upside potential amounts to approximately 317%. (See CLSD stock forecast)Accuray Inc. (ARAY)Next up is Accuray, a radio-oncology company that develops and manufactures medical devices for the delivery of accurate radiotherapy doses for cancer treatments. Targeted radiation doses have long been used in cancer treatments, to kill tumor cells and other malignancies; the key to success is as much in the precision of the targeting as in the type of radiation used, to avoid or minimize damage to and effects on healthy cells and tissue. Accuray has developed a line of products to deliver radiation treatments for a wide range of patient needs and has built up a global base of customers in the medical field.Some numbers will tell the story. Accuray has installed more than 1,000 systems overall and has activities ongoing in more than 60 countries. The company’s total revenues in fiscal year 2023 came to $447.6 million – and the firm was able to reinvest 12% of that revenue back into research and development projects, to maintain its radiotherapy systems at the cutting edge of both technology and current medical practice.The company’s two leading products are the CyberKnife and Radixact. The first is a treatment unit designed to deliver stereotactic radiosurgery and stereotactic body radiation therapy with ‘robotic precision’ to any part of the patient’s body. The unit is AI-driven and offers real-time motion synchronization. Radixact is an integrated 3D kVCT and megavoltage CT imaging system, designed to provide the advanced imaging needed for image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy and for 3D conformal radiation therapy. In short, improving precision is in Accuray’s DNA.Also of note for investors, Accuray announced last October that its Tomo C system, a radiation therapy system for the Type B market, has been approved by the Chinese National Medical Products Administration for use in that country. The new system is made in China and represents an advance in the use of radiotherapy for cancer treatments. Tomo C is based on a platform that features helical imaging and radiation delivery.The Tomo C system is targeted at emerging markets, particularly in China where it is manufactured. Accuray is also working on the launch of Helix, a similar system scheduled to launch in FY25 in India. Helix will also use a helical delivery system and will be manufactured by Accuray in Madison, Wisconsin.In Accuray’s last earnings report, released on January 31 for fiscal 2Q24, the company reported revenues of $107.2 million. This was down 6.6% from the prior year, but slightly beat the forecast by about half a million dollars. The company’s earnings, at a 10-cent per share loss by GAAP measures, missed expectations by 5 cents per share.Despite the earnings miss, Roth Capital analyst Jason Wittes likes this stock. He notes especially the company’s moves into emerging markets, citing both China and India, and predicts sound growth in the long term. Wittes says of Accuray, “ARAY has about 10% market share in the radiation oncology space and is now reliably generating cash. Expansion into the value priced segment with Tomo C (first installs in June FY4Q24) in China and Helix in India in FY25 positions ARAY to compete more effectively in faster growing emerging markets. This expansion should boost revenue growth from low-mid-single digits to at least mid-high-single digits, warranting investor attention and a higher valuation.”Looking ahead, Wittes rates ARAY shares a Buy and his $9 price target indicates confidence in a robust 260% upside for the next 12 months. (To watch Wittes’ track record, click here)Overall, the analyst consensus here is a Strong Buy, based on 3 positive ratings set in recent weeks. The shares are currently trading for $2.52 and their $9.67 average price target implies a one-year upside potential of ~287%, somewhat higher than analyst Witte allows.

Motley Fool,Palantir Technologies Stock Surged Again Today. Is It Too Late to Buy the Red-Hot Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stock?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/palantir-technologies-stock-surged-again-192516507.html,Palantir Technologies stock is up more than 200% over the past year. Can investors still profit from this AI stock?,"Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) jumped again on Wednesday, adding to its growing win streak. The stock was up as much as 12.3% in early trading and as of 1:50 p.m. ET was still up 11%.While the upward trajectory of the broader market no doubt helped fuel the gains, the clear catalyst that sent the data mining and artificial intelligence (AI) specialist higher was news the company beat out the competition for a major Army contract.Palantir was awarded a contract worth $178.4 million to deliver 10 Tactical Intelligence Targeting Access Node, or TITAN systems, which use sensor data to locate targets. However, the contract could be much more lucrative. As my colleague Lou Whiteman pointed out, the initial 10 systems could lead to 100 to 150 more.The company has a long history of providing AI solutions to the U.S. government and its allies, so this is just the latest in a long line of contract wins.Is Palantir Technologies stock still a buy?While this news is welcome, investors should be more excited about another aspect of Palantir's business. The company adapted its existing AI systems to serve the needs of enterprise businesses. The ability of AI to detect patterns buried deep in data has vast implications for large companies. It can help manage inventory levels, suggest product revisions, or detect troubling trends in customer service calls, among many other applications.The advent of generative AI is right up Palantir's alley, and the company quickly developed a solution to address the increasing demand. In the fourth quarter, this boosted results, as U.S. commercial revenue grew 70% year over year, while its total contract value soared 107%.Palantir Technologies stock has gained a whopping 215% over the past year and is already up 55% year to date. As a result, traditional valuation metrics look stretched. The stock is selling for 80 times forward earnings and 22 times forward sales, but that doesn't factor in Palantir's impressive growth. Using the more appropriate forward price/earnings-to-growth ratio reveals a valuation of less than 1, the standard for an undervalued stock.Story continuesIf the demand for AI continues to grow, and I believe it will, Palantir's experience in the field could reap big rewards for the company -- and its investors.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

A report from The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday said the lender is considering raising cash through the sale of stock in order to shore up confidence in it.NYCB officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Such moves can strengthen a bank’s balance sheet, but they can also send a signal that frightens investors and customers. Last year, the banking industry saw how quickly a run can begin in this new era where customers can spread worries quickly through chatrooms and pull their money through a mobile banking app without having to go to a branch. That led to the collapses of several banks, including Signature Bank.NYCB's share price had plummeted last month following news of a quarterly loss, seeding fears about regional banks.Shares of troubled New York Community Bancorp plunged Wednesday to below $2.NYCB acquired many assets of Signature BankNYCB acquired much of Signature Bank’s assets, and the resulting increase in its size meant it had to face increased regulatory scrutiny. That’s been one of the bank’s challenges, which have been rattling investors.NYCB said this year that it found significant weakness in how it internally reviews loans, caused by ineffective oversight, risk assessment and monitoring activities. Many of those issues are being tied to Signature, which put the bank into a new regulatory class with stricter oversight. It also replaced its longtime chief executive officer.More: Fed Chair Powell says interest rate cuts won’t start until inflation reaches this levelSeveral financial analysts still say NYCB’s troubles appear relatively unique to the bank and downplayed the risk of contagion in the banking sector. But weakness in commercial real estate is a looming challenge for all kinds of banks, as changes in how people work following the pandemic leave many office buildings with more vacancies.This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: New York Community Bancorp shares sink"

Maxwell Marlow, research boss of the Adam Smith Institute, said:Despite being one of the greatest issues facing our country today, housing was a sideshow in today’s budget. We have a deficit of 4.2m homes, coupled with a totally unsuitable planning regime for growth, blocking new factories, research labs and data centres.Currently, the Treasury is juicing demand, disincentivising landlords from participating in the rental market, and throwing money at developments. It would be far more efficient, and far less expensive, to ... permissive planning system.Story continues06:26 PM GMTHow much extra child benefit you can claim from the threshold change?Middle income families will be able to claim thousands of pounds extra in state support after the Chancellor announced changes to the child benefit system. Ben Butcher and Madeleine Ross have the details - and a calculator you can use:Middle income families will be able to claim thousands of pounds extra in state support after the Chancellor announced changes to the child benefit system.Currently, if either parent earns £50,000 or more the amount of child benefit a family is able to claim is reduced gradually. Once either parent earns more than £60,000 the entire child benefit is clawed back via the “high income child benefit charge”.From April, the threshold where child benefit begins to be clawed back will rise, to £60,000, and at £80,000 it is lost entirely.Use our calculator, below, to see how much more money you’ll be able to claim as a result of the changes.

She writes:The Chancellor has obviously heard of the Laffer Curve. He actually made an explicit reference to it in the Budget speech. And he went on at some length about the need to incentivise paid employment: to “make work pay”. So he gets it.Not only does he understand that lowering tax rates can actually increase tax revenue (as Arthur Laffer has demonstrated) but that people are much less likely to work if the state is confiscating too much of their pay.He said that too in clear terms: the earnings that people receive for their labour do not belong to the state. They are entitled to regard their pay as their own money, by legal and moral right.You might have expected that what would follow from these unequivocal statements of faith would be a serious programme of lowering the outrageous levels of tax now being levied on work.What we got was the heavily-trailed 2pc cut in National Insurance.The grounds for reducing NICS rather than income tax is supposedly to confine the advantage to working people rather than non-working ones who pay income tax but not National Insurance.Has he overlooked the fact that people who are beyond retirement age but still working do not pay NICS so will receive no benefit at all?But even more to the point, can he really not see that what is most outrageous in the current tax system is the diabolical freeze on thresholds which brings those on very low earnings into the income tax net and penalises those whose higher earnings come from greater productivity and enterprise?Read her full article here.Jeremy Hunt does a TV interview during a visit to a builders merchant this afternoon - Kirsty Wigglesworth/PA05:32 PM GMTNext government faces ‘very tight indeed’ financesThe Government’s financial breathing room has been squeezed further and whoever wins the election will face very little scope to spend extra money, the head of the Institute for Fiscal Studies said on X.NI cuts are big, ""paid for"" by squeezing fiscal headroom further and raising some small taxes. Big picture hasn't changed: - debt high & stable, not on a downward path - taxes overall up a lot over this parliament - spending plans for next parliament look v tight indeed. https://t.co/yJH3sWJnI0— Paul Johnson (@PJTheEconomist) March 6, 202405:25 PM GMTUK shares close higher today after Budget measuresUK shares closed higher on Wednesday, with the domestically-focused FTSE 250 midcap index at a two-month peak, as the Government bet on tax cuts to revive its election chances.The blue-chip FTSE 100 ended up 0.4pc, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 rose 1.1pc to its highest level since early January.Jeremy Hunt’s pre-election Budget revealed an annual economic growth forecast of 0.8pc, and said that the Bank of England’s 2pc inflation target would be achieved in a few months.Despite a one year extension on windfall levies on energy firms’ profits, the sector added 1.5pc and was the biggest boost to the main index as crude prices gained over 2pc.Adding to the cheer, the investment banking and brokerage services sector rose 0.8pc as Mr Hunt also outlined plans to reform tax-free savings accounts to boost investments into London-listed firms.The reform “is a crucial step in starting to recapitalise British businesses, and make the UK listing regime the global capital of capital”, said Mike O’Shea, the chief executive of Premier Miton Investors.05:19 PM GMTBoost for landlords as capital gains tax slashedLandlords and second homeowners will benefit from an investment profits tax cut designed to free up more houses, write Ruby Hinchliffe and Tom Haynes:The higher rate of capital gains tax (CGT) on property will be cut from 28pc to 24pc from April 2024 in a move the Government said would “fire up” the residential property market.The Treasury said in the Budget: “This will encourage landlords and second homeowners to sell their properties, making more available for a variety of buyers including those looking to get on the housing ladder for the first time.”The rate changes will be legislated in the Finance Bill and come into effect on April 6. The lower rate of capital gains tax will remain at 18pc.It means a higher-rate taxpayer making a gain of £20,000 on their second home will save £680 in tax, accountants said.However, second home owners who let their properties out to holiday makers will be hit with a string of tax rises.Read the full story here.The higher rate of capital gains tax on property will be cut - Getty Images05:17 PM GMTHow to make sure you don’t overpay taxHouseholds are paying record levels of tax to HMRC as frozen thresholds continue to leave individuals with higher bills.Marc Shoffman has put together a guide on how to benefit from the reliefs that could reduce your tax bill.05:15 PM GMTJeremy Hunt ‘has just stuck two fingers up at pensioners’The Chancellor’s headline 2p National Insurance cut is a veiled insult to heavily taxed retirees, says The Telegraph’s Ben Wilkinson. He writes:The Chancellor’s headline 2p National Insurance (NI) cut is said to be all about rewarding graft and ensuring that work pays in Tory Britain.But in reality, it is a veiled insult to the retirees who have worked hard all their lives and are now drawing income from their private pensions – and paying more tax than any previous retired generation.The cut will save the average worker £450 and comes after NI was reduced by two percentage points at the start of the new year.Those aged 66 and over do not pay NI, and as a result they have been left empty-handed twice now following this Budget and last year’s Autumn Statement. That’s around £900 of personal taxation giveaways that pensioners have missed out on in the past six months.The Chancellor went further on Wednesday and made it clear that the party wanted to “continue to cut” NI, suggesting pensioners will continue to miss out.Read the full article here.05:12 PM GMTPM and Chancellor visit builders’ merchant in London this afternoonRishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt look in good spirits after the Budget.Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt centre have a drink as they speak with with employees during a visit to a builders' warehouse in London this afternoon - Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP05:02 PM GMTDid Jeremy Hunt’s Budget make you richer or poorer?Jeremy Hunt’s Budget contained broad tax cuts for the working age population – and for landlords selling up additional properties, writes Florin Bratescu.Use our calculator, made in association with accountants Blick Rothenberg, to work out whether you are richer or poorer as a result.You don’t have to fill in all the fields, but the more information you give us, the more accurately we can show what your tax bill will be.04:59 PM GMTVaping tax will earn Treasury £1bn in three years, say accountantsThe Treasury’s receipts from a new tax on vaping products will generate £945m in the first three years after their introduction, according to accountancy group UHY Hacker Young.Nikhil Oza, a partner at UHY Hacker Young, said:This move by the Chancellor might disappoint some but it is not surprising given that the amount that HMRC collects from sin taxes has been declining as a share of all taxes.04:50 PM GMTWhy Jeremy Hunt’s focus on NHS productivity is so vitalThe Chancellor today announced plans to fund improvements to NHS productivity.

Currently, parents start paying back child benefit once one parent earns more than £50,000. Once earnings exceed £60,000 all the benefit is lost.It would mean an average saving of £1,260 for about half a million working families, the Government said.It is the first time the threshold has been raised since 2013, when it was introduced.Read how the Chancellor’s announcement aims to fix a perverse quirk of the current system.04:23 PM GMTFuel duty freeze is ‘relief’ for motoristsMotoring groups have welcomed Jeremy Hunt’s decision to freeze fuel duty, which means the 5p per litre cut implemented in March 2022 will be retained for another 12 months.Fuel duty will not increase in line with inflation, saving the average car driver £50 next year and bringing “total savings since the 5p cut was introduced to around £250”, Mr Hunt said.Government figures show the average cost of a litre of petrol and diesel at UK forecourts is around £1.45 and £1.55 respectively.Simon Williams, the RAC’s head of policy, said:With a general election looming, it would have been a huge surprise for the Chancellor to tamper with the political hot potato that is fuel duty in today’s Budget.But, while it’s good news that fuel duty has been kept low, it’s unlikely drivers will be breathing a collective sigh of relief as we don’t believe they’ve fully benefited from the cut that was introduced just two years ago due to retailers upping margins to cover their ‘increased costs’.Jack Cousens, the AA’s head of roads policy, said: “Even with the intense pressure to balance the UK’s books, now is not the time to rev up motoring costs for workers and families who rely on their cars to go about their daily lives, and stoke inflation.”We are extending the temporary 5p cut in fuel duty rates for a further 12 months & have cancelled the planned inflation increase.Supporting motorists across the country with rising prices, saving an average of £250 per car since the cut was introduced in 2022. pic.twitter.com/8jCHOqlW4Y— HM Treasury (@hmtreasury) March 6, 202404:20 PM GMTHunt battles to reclaim Tories’ low tax mantleTelegraph columnist Jeremy Warner says that, contrary to the impression given, the tax burden is set to rise sharply under the Chancellor’s plans. He writes:This is mainly because of the “fiscal drag” of the already pre-announced freeze in tax allowances, which means that the proportion of income paid in tax steadily increases as earnings increase.But there were also some quite hefty additional tax increases, including a new tax on vaping, additional duty on tobacco and on air travel and an extension on the windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas.The flagship cut in National Insurance was welcome enough, but given that it had been comprehensively briefed beforehand, as indeed did much of the rest of the Budget was, its announcement was flat.This was hardly the showstopper that Tory backbenchers might have hoped for, and leaves one thinking that perhaps Downing Street is planning an additional fiscal event closer to the election, when the economy might look better and there could be more freedom for pyrotechnics.Read the full article here.04:13 PM GMTNorth Sea hasn’t received a windfall to justify a special tax, says analystThe windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas will reduce long-term revenue for the Treasury, an energy analyst has claimed.Andy Mayer of the Institute of Economic Affairs took aim at the assertion that there had been a windfall to producers caused by the war in Ukraine:Before the invasion the oil price was around $80 a barrel. Today it is around $80 a barrel. [That is] within the normal range for this commodity, not a windfall.The wisest regime for the North Sea would be in line with the USA, low and aligned with other business taxes. Second best would be Norway, high stable taxes with investment reliefs. Third would be a clear and stable windfall regime with tiered rates transparently linked to prices.We have instead high unstable rates with complex reliefs that change every year.

It will receive this data under what is called the Common Reporting Standard.Given the recent surge in Bitcoin and other crypto values, we would expect the under paid tax in this area would be far more.Many UK investors in crypto assets don’t understand that they owe tax or deliberately avoid paying the tax they owe on capital gains. Many UK investors also think that the crypto assets they hold offshore are not traceable by HMRC.04:04 PM GMTNon-dom tax changes makes Britain uncompetitive, claims law firmA law firm has said the changes to non-dom tax are “a missed opportunity to make the UK’s regime for new arrivals more effective and competitive”.Edward Hayes, of Burges Salmon, said:A status that lasts for only four years lags well behind those offered by several other European countries [Italy offers 15 years and France 8 for example].In practice it will be less than four years for many because of the way the UK tax year runs from April 6 to April 5, whereas most other countries track the calendar year.04:03 PM GMTHigh paid workers to save £1,323 a year from National Insurance tax cutsWorkers earning more than £60,000 will save £1,323 a year after the Chancellor’s newly-announced cuts to National Insurance.Jeremy Hunt confirmed a 2p cut in National Insurance for employees and the self-employed as the centrepiece of a Budget which sought to persuade voters to stick with the Conservatives rather than give Sir Keir Starmer the keys to No 10.The measure will improve the take-home pay of higher paid earners the most, according to analysis by EY, added together with the sums saved with the 2p cut that was announced during the Autumn Statement in November.Meanwhile, workers with a gross salary of £20,000 a year will save just £415 in total.03:56 PM GMTChancellor boosts support for wind farms, ‘but not enough to meet target’The Government is to offer record support for new offshore wind farms after an auction last year failed to attract any bidders for offshore wind projects with developers deeming the guaranteed prices offered too low.The next auction round will be worth more than £1bn, government budget documents have shown.The government has set targets for major increases in renewable power to help increase Britain’s energy security and meet climate targets.To help ensure projects are built, it holds annual auctions offering renewable power developers a guaranteed price for their electricity.“The government is providing clarity and certainty for investment into the UK’s renewables sector ... setting the largest ever budget for a single round of over £1bn”, the Budget document said.The auction, which will be the sixth of its type, will open to bidders from March 27, a separate document published by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said.Analysts at Aurora Energy Research said some 14GW of offshore wind capacity was expected to be eligible to bid in the auction, but that even with the higher budget, it was unlikely to all be successful.“This budget pushes the ambition of delivering 50GW of offshore wind by 2030 even more out of reach,” said Aurora’s Ashutosh Padelkar.A man walks his dogs on the beach in front of Teesside Wind Farm in Redcar last year - Phil Noble/Reuters03:47 PM GMTPM recused from non-dom policy talks before BudgetRishi Sunak was recused from policy talks on the scrapping of the non-dom tax status to avoid any conflict of interest arising from his wife being a non-domiciled resident, Downing Street has said.A No 10 spokesman said:There are established processes whereby arrangements can be put in place to mitigate against potential or perceived conflicts of interest.The Prime Minister was recused from all policy development and was only sighted on the policy once final decisions had been taken.03:37 PM GMTUK debt to top £3 trillion for first timeThe national debt will hit £3 trillion for the first time in the next five years despite improvements in official forecasts for economic growth.The UK’s spending watchdog the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicted the public sector’s debt pile will hit the unprecedented level in the 2028-29 fiscal year, despite also improving its growth forecasts.However, debt will begin to fall as a percentage of GDP.Mr Hunt said: “Underlying debt, which excludes Bank of England debt, will be 91.7pc in 2024-25 according to the OBR, then 92.8pc, 93.2pc, 93.2pc before falling to 92.9pc in 2028-29.”03:33 PM GMTFTSE stocks leap after Hunt unveils Great British IsaThe FTSE 250 has jumped higher amid increasing hopes that a British Isa will revive the fortunes of UK stocks.The midcap index, which is more focused on UK companies, has gained as much as 1.4pc today after Jeremy Hunt unveiled the plans in his Budget.The Chancellor confirmed a new British Isa will allow an extra £5,000 of tax-free investment in UK assets.Fiona Cincotta, a senior analyst at City Index, said the British Isa would “likely see more money pour into London listed stocks”, while Mike O’Shea, the chief executive of Premier Miton Investors, called the plan a “crucial step in starting to recapitalise British businesses”.03:27 PM GMTBudget lacked pro-growth drive, says Institute of Economic AffairsJeremy Hunt’s Budget did not do enough to promote economic growth, the Institute of Economic Affairs has claimed. Tom Clougherty, the free-market organisation’s boss, said:There’s no getting away from the fact that raising living standards in the long run depends on generating faster economic growth. And that means prioritising tax reforms with genuine pro-growth impact, fixing our broken planning system so that we can build more of everything, and accepting that we need to couple spending restraint with major reforms to public services.As always, there are good and bad things in this Budget. But if we take a broader view of economic policy, it hasn’t really moved us any closer to where we need to be.03:24 PM GMTPub chains rise today amid alcohol duty freezeIt’s been a good day for pub chains today on the stock market amid favourable news from the Budget. Mitchells and Butlers has jumped 3.31pc, while JD Wetherspoon is up 1.57pc. Marston’s, the brewer and pub chain, is up 2.24pc.Susannah Streeter, the head of money and markets at broker Hargreaves Lansdown, said:Pub chains largely hung onto earlier gains, sparked by hopes of the cut to National Insurance, helped by the freezing of alcohol duty.But hospitality businesses have been crying out for a cut in VAT, amid evidence that people are simply dining in at home to save cash, as pubs, bars and restaurants have been forced to hike prices due to rising costs.So, the freeze is unlikely to provide much respite overall.A bartender pours a pint at The Knights Templar in London, 2011 - Simon Dawson/Bloomberg03:13 PM GMTLaw firm warns of risks to NHS patients in artificial intelligence pushThe Chancellor promised to improve productivity in the NHS by cutting form-filling through the use of artificial intelligence. But the use of AI has risks, a leading law firm has warned.Alexander Amato-Cravero, the head of the emerging technology group at Herbert Smith Freehills, said:There is ample evidence to suggest that, if properly employed, artificial intelligence can increase efficiency and productivity in the NHS and other public [and private] sector organisations, delivering tangible benefits to doctors and patients.However, as was noted at the recent Government-led AI Safety Summit, artificial intelligence must be ‘used in a manner that is safe, in such a way as to be human-centric, trustworthy and responsible’.The Government must now take heed of its own advice and ensure it addresses all potential risks when adopting AI technology in the NHS, maintaining at all times the protection, privacy, and confidentiality of patient data.03:04 PM GMTTim Wallace: National debt will top £3 trillion for first timeOfficial forecasts show the economic picture is looking rosier for Jeremy Hunt but the Government’s books remain heavily in the red.Our deputy economics editor Tim Wallace has just filed this analysis:03:02 PM GMTLondon’s growth curbed after Transport for London misses out, claims business lobby groupJohn Dickie,of BusinessLDN, which lobbied for the creation of the Elizabeth Line in London, says the failure to give Transport for London a proper funding deal will be bad for growth. He said:The package of reforms for pension funds and savers was a bright spot that will help unlock a much-needed capital boost into British business.But the failure to provide Transport for London with a multi-year funding deal on a par with other city regions was a missed opportunity to spur growth both in the capital and across its UK-wide supply chain.02:58 PM GMTBudget measures leave just £8.9bn of wriggle room, says OBRThe Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said the Chancellor’s latest Budget means he is meeting his rule of having national debt falling as a share of GDP in 2028-29.However, his package of tax cuts mean he is doing so by an “historically modest margin” of just £8.9bn.The £8.9 billion margin in our central forecast against the debt falling target is lower than the average of £26.1 billion that Chancellors have set aside against their fiscal rules since 2010, and is a small fraction of the risks around any fiscal forecast.#Budget2024 pic.twitter.com/OEHaW4nZ9Y— Office for Budget Responsibility (@OBR_UK) March 6, 202402:55 PM GMTDo you have a question for The Telegraph’s consumer champion?If the Budget has left your head spinning, our consumer champion Katie Morley is on hand to answer your questions.Just fill in the form below with your query, and Katie will take a look.

What’s more, the UK market is heavily weighted towards oil and gas - further investment into UK equities could disrupt schemes’ existing sustainable investment strategies. Pension schemes will not thank Mr Hunt for his announcements today. Their responsibility must be to their members, not changing with the winds of Government policy or party.02:41 PM GMTNew vaping tax is not a ‘sin tax’ but a ‘saint tax’, claims think tankDuring the Budget, the Chancellor said he wanted to “discourage non-smokers from taking up vaping” by imposing a duty on vapes from October 2026.But he said that “vapes can also play a positive role in helping people quit smoking”, so would “introduce a one-off increase in tobacco duty at the same time to maintain the financial incentive to choose vaping over smoking”.Brendan Canavan, of the University of Nottingham, said:Taxing vapes is likely to be highly effective overall. Experience in Australia, New Zealand, as well as the UK, relating to traditional tobacco products, shows significant declines in smoking rates in line with tax increases.Regulation also needs to look at restricting marketing of vapes. Products sold in plain packaging and unable to emphasise product attributes such as flavour, or make cultural references such as towards lifestyles, would likely appeal less to new and young consumers.Again, evidence from various parts of the world is that marketing restrictions make traditional tobacco products less visible in day-to-day life, and hence combat smoking as a normalised activity.But in a forthright response to the Budget from the Instiute of Economic Affairs, Christopher Snowdon, a lifestyle economics specialist, said:This is a deeply cynical cash grab from the Chancellor. Forget sin taxes, this is a saint tax. Vapers did what the government wanted and gave up smoking. They are now being punished for it.The Government wants to discourage vaping, unless it helps people giving up smoking - Nicholas T.

It was previously on track to hit 37.7pc.Tax measures in #Budget2024 reduce the tax take by 0.2 per cent of GDP by the end of the forecast, but it is still expected to rise to close to the post-war high by 2028-29. pic.twitter.com/8ygpl3UHXU— Office for Budget Responsibility (@OBR_UK) March 6, 202402:29 PM GMTFree-marketeers urge more radicalism next timeThe Adam Smith Insitute, which has Nadhim Zahawi, the former Chancellor, as a patron, welcomed much of the Budget, but urged the Government to go further in the future. Maxwell Marlow, a research chief, said:It’s encouraging that the Government understands the overwhelming need to cut taxes from the current record high, and the benefits that doing so brings to individuals, families and businesses. The Adam Smith Institute welcomes the cut to national Insurance, as well as the Chancellor’s commitment to even greater tax cuts in the future.Ideally, these would be both soon and include the abolition of entire taxes, like the immoral death tax, and even scrapping National Insurance itself. This would end the farce of double taxation on income by merging income tax and National Insurance for good.02:28 PM GMTUK already out of recession, says OBRThe Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said the UK economy was already out of recession after shrinking in the second half of 2023.Our economics editor Szu Ping Chan has the latest:It predicts the economy will grow by 0.2 pc in the first three months of 2024, helping the economy to expand by 0.8pc in 2024, slightly higher than November’s prediction of 0.7pc.Growth is expected to bounce back further in 2025 to 1.9pc and 2pc in 2026.Mr Hunt said inflation was now expected to fall below the Bank of England’s 2pc target “in just a few months”, and continue falling to 1.1pc by the start of 2025.The OBR said the fall would be driven by sustained “falls in global energy prices” which are predicted to push down energy bills further in the coming months. 02:24 PM GMTLondon retailers say budget misses opportunity to improve growthRetailers in the main shopping area of central London are unhappy that they are facing increased minimum wages and business rates, while struggling to attract foreign tourists because of the lack of tax-free shopping. Dee Corsi, of New West End Company, which represents 600 stores in London, said:[The lack of tax-free stopping] comes against the backdrop of what is already a perfect storm for larger retail businesses in particular, who face both a costly end to business rates relief and an imminent increase to the national living wage in the months ahead.It is concerning that, whilst our EU counterparts actively leverage tax-free shopping as a means to supercharge growth, we are unable to see the policy’s potential – not just for retail, but for hospitality, leisure and cultural attractions across the nation.Put simply, the Chancellor has missed yet another opportunity to inject some growth into the UK at a time when we need it most, and it is British businesses, and their employees, who will feel the impact most.Luxury stores on New Bond Street in central London, 2023 - Betty Laura Zapata/Bloomberg02:20 PM GMTUK economy to grow more than expected in next two years, says OBRThe UK economy is set to grow more than expected over the next two years as it rebounds from recession, according to the UK fiscal watchdog.But it predicted growth would ease back earlier than previously forecast in the longer-term.New economic predictions also showed that UK inflation is set to drop below the Government’s 2pc target rate within a “few months” after interest rate hikes by the Bank of England.The Chancellor said in Parliament that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has estimated that the UK gross domestic product (GDP) will grow 0.8pc this year.In November, the official forecaster had previously predicted growth of 0.7pc.The OBR also upgraded its growth forecast for next year, increasing it from 1.4pc to 1.9pc.GDP growth in 2023 was weaker than expected in our November EFO.

What Crisis?” attitude.01:57 PM GMTPound steady after Hunt’s BudgetThe pound was little changed after the Chancellor’s speech, remaining up 0.2pc on the day at $1.27.Bond prices have improved a little while the FTSE 100 is 0.4pc higher.01:50 PM GMTTax burden to hit highest level since 1948The OBR has published its latest forecasts for the economy and it is not pretty for the tax burden:Tax burden still predicted to rise to 37.1% in 2028-29, highest since 1948 (when it was 37.2%). BUT still 4 pp above pre-pandemic level of 33.1%of GDP in 2019-20. pic.twitter.com/S10hJL2vKL— Szu Ping Chan (@szupingc) March 6, 202401:48 PM GMTChancellor removed ‘out of date’ non-dom statusPaul Johnson, the IFS director, has praised the Chancellor’s abolishment of the non-dom system that lets foreign nationals avoid paying UK tax on money made overseas.Mr Johnson posted:Wow - *abolishing* non dom regime. Removing outdated concept of ""domicile"" and replacing with residence based system. Good. Lots of detail to see here.— Paul Johnson (@PJTheEconomist) March 6, 2024Mr Johnson also described Mr Hunt’s changes to child benefit charges as “radical”.He said: “Radical change this - allowing HMRC to collect household level information so as to reform high income child benefit charge,” he posted. “In short term threshold raised from £50k to £60k. Lose all child benefit only at £80k. This doubles period over which taper works so cuts marginal tax rates.”01:44 PM GMTHunt to abolish levy on oil and gas profitsDuring the Budget, Mr Hunt said he wanted to “encourage investment in the North Sea so we will retain generous investment allowances for the sector”.He extended the oil and gas windfall tax for one more year, but said that the Energy Profits Levy would be abolished “should market prices fall to their historic norm for a sustained period of time”.01:39 PM GMTNational Insurance cut to get 200,000 more people in workChancellor Jeremy Hunt confirmed a further 2p National Insurance cut, from 10pc to 8pc from April 6, with self-employed National Insurance being slashed from 8pc to 6pc.More NI cuts to come when affordable says Hunt...— Szu Ping Chan (@szupingc) March 6, 202401:39 PM GMTHunt attacks Labour on the economyJeremy Hunt finished the Budget with a robust attack on the Labour Party’s economic policies. He said:We stick to our plan with a Budget for Long Term Growth. It delivers more investment. More jobs. Better public services. And lower taxes.But dynamism in an economy doesn’t come from ministers in Whitehall.It comes from the grit and determination of people who take risks, work hard and innovate.Not government policies but people power.It is to unleash that people power that we have today put this country back on the path to lower taxes.A plan to grow the economy vs no plan.A plan for better public services vs no plan.A plan to make work pay vs no plan. Growth up, jobs up and taxes down. I commend this Statement to the House.01:38 PM GMT‘Effective’ personal taxes lower than America, France or Germany, claims HuntJeremy Hunt said that the “effective” personal tax rates are now lower than any other G7 country. He said:The OBR say, when combined with the autumn reduction, our National Insurance cuts will mean the equivalent of 200,000 more people in work – filling one in five vacancies and adding 0.4pc to our GDP and 0.4pc to our GDP per head.This is the second fiscal event where we have reduced employee and self-employed national insurance.We have cut it by one third in six months without increasing borrowing and without cutting spending on public services.That means the average earner in the UK now has the lowest effective personal tax rate since 1975 – and one that is lower than in America, France, Germany or any G7 country.01:36 PM GMTNational Insurance cutNational Insurance (NI) is being cut for employees by another 2p, from 10pc to 8pc.Self-employed NI will drop form 8pc to 6pc.Mr Hunt said:It means an additional £450 a year for the average employee or £350 for someone self-employed. When combined with the autumn reductions, it means 27 million employees will get an average tax cut of £900 a year and two million self-employed a tax cut averaging £650. Changes that make our system simpler and fairer. And changes that grow our economy by rewarding work.01:33 PM GMTChild benefit charge threshold raised to £60,000The way that the Government treats child benefit in the tax system is “confusing and unfair”, Mr Hunt claimed. He said:It’s a lifeline for many parents because it helps with the additional costs associated with having children. And when it works, it’s good for children, it’s good for parents, and it’s good for the economy because it helps people into work.But we currently withdraw child benefit when one parent earns over £50,000 a year.That means two parents earning £49,000 a year receive the benefit in full but a household earning a lot less than that does not if just one parent earns over £50,000.Today I set out plans to end that unfairness. Doing so requires significant reform to the tax system including allowing HMRC to collect household level information ...I confirm that from this April the High-Income Child Benefit Charge threshold will be raised from £50,000 to £60,000.And we will raise the top of the taper at which it is withdrawn to £80,000.That means no one earning under £60,000 will pay the charge, taking 170,000 families out of paying it altogether.01:31 PM GMTAbolishing non-dom status will raise £2.7bn a year, says ChancellorThe Chancellor said that non-doms can make a significant contribution to the economy, so he said he would “put in place transitional arrangements for those benefitting from the current regime”. He added:That will include a two-year period in which individuals will be encouraged to bring wealth earned overseas to the UK where it can be spent and invested here – a measure that will attract onshore an additional £15bn of foreign income and gains and generate more than £1bn of extra tax.Overall, abolishing non-dom status will raise £2.7bn a year by the end of the forecast period.01:30 PM GMTChancellor replaces ‘non-dom’ tax regimeThe Chancellor is changing the tax regime for non-doms. He said:From April 2025, new arrivals to the UK will not be required to pay any tax on foreign income and gains for their first four years of UK residency, a more generous regime than at present and one of the most attractive offers in Europe.But after four years, those who continue to live in the UK will pay the same tax as other UK residents. Recognising the contribution many of these individuals have made to our economy, we will put in place transitional arrangements for those benefitting from the current regime.01:27 PM GMTChancellor abolishes Multiple Dwellings ReliefJeremy Hunt has abolished Multiple Dwellings Relief, which was supposed to increase investment in the private rented sector. He said:I have also been looking at the stamp duty relief for people who purchase more than one dwelling in a single transaction, known as Multiple Dwellings Relief. [It was] intended to support investment in the private rented sector.However, an external evaluation found no strong evidence that it had done so and that it was being regularly abused. So I am going to abolish it.01:26 PM GMTChanges to how holiday lettings are taxedJeremy Hunt said that he had been looking at the Furnished Holiday Lettings tax regime. He said:I am concerned that this tax regime is creating a distortion, meaning that there are not enough properties available for long-term rental by local people. So, to make the tax system work better for local communities, I am going to abolish the Furnished Holiday Lettings regime.01:26 PM GMTCamilla Tominey: Hunt’s jibes at Labour come as tax burden hits historic high01:25 PM GMTMore resources for tax collectorsHe said that the Government will raise more tax revenues by giving HMRC more resources.01:24 PM GMTTax hike on business class flightsJeremy Hunt sounds like he’s hiking taxes on business class flights. He said:I will make a one-off adjustment to rates of Air Passenger Duty on non-economy flights only to account for high inflation in recent years.01:23 PM GMTLower taxed economies have ‘more energy’Jeremy Hunt made a moral case for lower taxes:We believe that in a free society the money you earn doesn’t belong to the government. It belongs to you.01:22 PM GMTNew special educational needs schools to be createdMr Hunt pledged £105m over the next four years to build 15 new special free schools “to create additional high quality places and increase choice for parents”.01:22 PM GMTHunt announces plan to improve public sector productivityChancellor Jeremy Hunt said there is a need for a “more productive state not a bigger state” as he launched his public sector productivity plan. He said:I am keeping the planned growth in day-to-day spending at 1pc in real terms. But we are going to spend it better.So today I am announcing a landmark public sector productivity plan that restarts public service reform and changes the Treasury’s traditional approach to public spending.On the NHS, Mr Hunt said the systems that support its staff are “often antiquated” before adding on the long-term workforce plan: “I wanted better care for patients, better value for taxpayers and more rewarding work for its staff. Making changes on the scale we need is not cheap. The investment needed to modernise NHS IT systems so they are as good as the best in the world costs £3.4bn.The move has been welcomed by economists:Very sensible public sector productivity reform plan. You cant have a chart like this (even though it is something of an apple and pears comparison) and get political consensus for real terms, per capita funding increases. pic.twitter.com/cPCz87KXZL— Simon French (@Frencheconomics) March 6, 202401:21 PM GMTGovernment pledges cash to fight knife crimesMr Hunt said that the Government was spending money to target knife crime and increase police response times. He said:Violence Reduction Units and hot spot policing have prevented an estimated 136,000 knife crimes and other violent offences as well as over 3,000 hospital admissions since funding began in 2019.Every crime costs money - so we will provide £75m to roll that model out in England and Wales.Police officers waste around eight hours a week on unnecessary admin – with higher productivity, we could free up time equivalent to 20,000 officers over a year.So we will spend £230m rolling out time and money saving technology, which speeds up police response time by allowing people to report crimes by video call and, where appropriate, use drones as first responders.01:20 PM GMTChancellor claims NHS England boss is supportive of Government’s spendingJeremy Hunt said that the official who runs NHS England is supportive of the level of spending the Government is giving to the NHS. He said:The head of the NHS Amanda Pritchard today says that this investment shows the Government continues to back the NHS. She says that, as a result of it, the NHS can commit to delivering 1.9pc annual labour productivity growth over the next parliament, more than double the average productivity growth in public services between 2010 and 2019.01:19 PM GMTKatie Morley: Isas devil will be in the detail after past ‘stringent’ restrictionsOur consumer champion Katie Morley outlines what to look out for with the new British Isa:01:18 PM GMTHunt gives NHS an extra £2.5bn to help cut waiting listsMr Hunt said that he would spend an additional £2.5bn on the NHS in the coming year. He said:This will allow the NHS to continue its focus on reducing waiting times and brings the total increase in NHS funding to 13pc in real terms.01:17 PM GMTHunt spends on NHS ITJeremy Hunt increases the amount of cash the NHS is spending on technology, including artificial intelligence. He said:We will slash the 13 million hours lost by doctors and nurses every year to outdated IT systems.We will use AI to cut down and potentially cut in half form filling by doctors.We will digitise operating theatre processes allowing the same number of consultants to do an extra 200,000 operations a year.We will fund improvements to help doctors read MRI and CT scans more accurately and quickly, speeding up results for 130,000 patients every year and saving thousands of lives ...We will improve the NHS app so that it can be used to confirm and modify all appointments, reducing up to half a million missed appointments annually and improving patient choice.01:16 PM GMTHunt spends on NHS productivityThe Chancellor is spending money on the modernisation of NHS IT systems to raise productivity. He said:When we published the NHS Long Term Workforce Plan, I asked the NHS to put together a plan to transform its efficiency and productivity.I wanted better care for patients, better value for taxpayers and more rewarding work for its staff. Making changes on the scale we need is not cheap.The investment needed to modernise NHS IT systems so that they are as good as the best in the world costs £3.4bn. But it helps unlock £35bn of savings, ten times that amount.So in today’s Budget for long-term growth, I have decided to fund the NHS productivity plan in full.01:16 PM GMTGB Isa ‘crucial step’ for British businessesMike O’Shea, the chief executive of Premier Miton Investors, said:We’re pleased the Chancellor and the Government have announced the introduction of the Great British Isa in the Budget statement today.Premier Miton Investors began calling for the GB Isa in September last year because ensuring companies have access to the capital they need will encourage them to scale up and list here in the UK.The GB Isa is a crucial step in starting to recapitalise British businesses, and make the UK listing regime the global capital of capital. We look forward to further details on the new Isa wrapper in due course.01:14 PM GMT‘Antiquated’ systems and form-filling damaging NHSThe Chancellor said:The NHS is, rightly, the biggest reason most of us are proud to be British.But the systems that support its staff are often antiquated. Doctors, nurses and ward staff spend hours every day filling out forms when they could be looking after patients. When patients don’t show up or one member of a team is ill, operating theatres are left empty despite long waiting lists.01:13 PM GMTNot fair to ask taxpayers to pay more when public sector productivity is so low, says HuntMr Hunt is introducing a Public Sector Productivity Plan:It’s not fair to ask taxpayers to pay for more when public service productivity has fallen. Nor would it be wise to reduce that funding given the pressures that public services face. So I am keeping the planned growth in day to day spending at 1pc in real terms. But we are going to spend it better.01:12 PM GMTPension regulator to get powers to ensure ‘better value’ for investorsChancellor Jeremy Hunt said new powers will be given to the Pensions Regulator and Financial Conduct Authority to ensure “better value” from defined contribution schemes by “judging performance on overall returns not cost”.He said:But I remain concerned that other markets such as Australia generate better returns for pension savers with more effective investment strategies and more investment in high quality domestic growth stocks.So I will introduce new requirements for DC and local government pension funds to disclose publicly their level of international and UK equity investments. I will then consider what further action should be taken if we are not on a positive trajectory towards international best practice.Mr Hunt said he will proceed with a retail sale for part of the Government’s remaining NatWest shares this summer at the earliest, subject to market conditions and value for money.Great to see @Jeremy_Hunt announcing pension funds will have to disclose returns net of fees - people should know when their cash isn't working hard for them.As detailed in my @ukonward report, Pension Power, UK pension returns are often far lower than international comparators pic.twitter.com/1rlRnze0Q7— Zachary Spiro (@zacspiro) March 6, 202401:12 PM GMTPublic sector productivity is too lowJeremy Hunt has raised the problem of public sector productivity:Although spending has continued to rise every year, public sector productivity remains below pre-pandemic levels – by nearly 6pc. This demonstrates that the way to improve public services is not always more money or more people – we also need to run them more efficiently.01:12 PM GMTChancellor bigs up the Government’s recordJeremy Hunt is talking about public services:Burglaries and violent crime have halved over the last 14 years and we invested in 20,000 more police officers. Our Armed Forces remain the most professional and best funded in Europe, with defence spending already more than 2pc of GDP. We are providing more military support to Ukraine than nearly any other country and our spending will rise to 2.5pc as soon as economic conditions allow.The NHS is still recovering from the pandemic but has 42,000 more doctors and 71,000 more nurses than it did under Labour – that is 250 more doctors and 400 more nurses for every month we’ve been in office.01:10 PM GMTChancellor ‘guarantees’ rates to childcare providersMr Hunt said that a year ago he announced the “biggest ever expansion of childcare”. He added:Today, in order to support the childcare sector make the new investments it now needs, I am guaranteeing the rates that will be paid to childcare providers to deliver our landmark offer for children over nine months old for the next two years.01:10 PM GMTFuel duty subsidy runs ‘counter’ to net zero goals, says economistBen Caswell, a NIESR senior economist, said:The Chancellor has decided to extend the 5p cut in fuel duty for a further 12 months.This continues to exert additional downward pressure on fuel prices at the pump by 6pc, and acts as an implicit subsidy in favour of non-renewables which runs counter to the government’s mandate of net zero by 2050.01:09 PM GMT‘Those who can work should’It would be wrong to fill Britain’s vacancies with just immigration, said Mr Hunt:One of the biggest barriers to investment is businesses not being able to hire the staff they need. The economy today has around 900,000 vacancies. It would be easy to fill them with higher migration – but with over 10 million adults of working age not in work that would be economically and morally wrong.01:08 PM GMTMillions for Cancer Research UKJeremy Hunt pledged £45m cash for medical charities into diseases such as dementia, cancer and epilepsy. He is giving £3m to Cancer Research UK.01:07 PM GMTTax relief for cultureIn a measure aimed at orchestras, museums, galleries and theatres that is apparently backed by Lord Lloyd Webber, Mr Hunt said:In the pandemic we introduced a higher 45pc and 50pc level of tax relief which were due to end in March 2025. It has been a lifeline for performing arts across the country. Today in recognition of their vital importance to our national life I can announce I am making those tax reliefs permanent at 45pc for touring and orchestral productions and 40pc for non-touring productions.01:06 PM GMTPinewood a winner from the BudgetMr Hunt continued the benefits to the film industry, saying:Having worked closely with the Culture Secretary and listened carefully to representations from companies like Pinewood, Warner Brothers and Sky Studios, we will provide eligible film studios in England with 40% relief on their gross business rates until 2034.He also pledged £26m for the National Theatre to improve its stages.01:05 PM GMTBigger tax benefits of TV and film industryMr Hunt said he will “increase the rate of tax credit by 5pc and remove the 80pc cap for visual effects costs in the Audio-Visual Expenditure Credit”.01:04 PM GMT£120m more to the Green Industries Growth AcceleratorThe Chancellor pledged the cash to “build supply chains for new technology ranging from offshore wind to carbon capture and storage”.01:04 PM GMTGovernment to push ahead with small nuclear power stations advocated by Rolls-RoyceJeremy Hunt recommitted to Small Modular Reactors. He said:We want nuclear to provide up to a quarter of our electricity by 2050. As part of that, I want the UK to lead the global race in developing cutting-edge nuclear technologies. I can therefore announce that Great British Nuclear will begin the next phase of the Small Modular Reactor selection process, with companies now having until June to submit their initial tender responses.01:02 PM GMTGreat British Isa will take placeThe Great British Isa is going to happen, Mr Hunt said:I will reform the Isa system to encourage more people to invest in UK assets. After a consultation on its implementation, I will introduce a brand new British Isa which will allow an additional £5,000 annual investment for investments in UK equity with all the tax advantages of other Isas.01:02 PM GMT‘Tell Sid’ NatWest sale pledgedMr Hunt said:We will proceed with a retail sale for part of the Government’s remaining NatWest shares this summer at the earliest, subject to supportive market conditions and value for money.01:02 PM GMTCamilla Tominey: Prominent backbenchers lobbied Hunt to do more for businessesChancellor Jeremy Hunt has announced the VAT registration threshold will be increased from £85,000 to £90,000 from the start of April, saying it would help “tens of thousands of businesses”.Our associate editor Camilla Tominey has this context to the decision:01:01 PM GMTHunt wants more stock market support of Britain’s Silicon ValleyJeremy Hunt addressed the problem that it’s difficult for technology companies to gain investment from the London markets. He said:I want our brilliant technology entrepreneurs not just to start here but to stay here, including when the time comes for a stock market listing. So we will build on the Edinburgh and Mansion House reforms to unlock more pension fund capital. We will give new powers to The Pensions Regulator and Financial Conduct Authority to ensure better value from Defined Contribution schemes by judging performance on overall returns not cost...But I remain concerned that other markets, such as Australia, generate better returns for pension savers with more effective investment strategies and more investment in high quality domestic growth stocks. So I will introduce new requirements for [defined contribution] and local government pension funds to disclose publicly their level of international and UK equity investments. I will then consider what further action should be taken if we are not on a positive trajectory towards international best practice.12:59 PM GMTChancellor wants Cambridge to be ‘world’s leading scientific powerhouse’Jeremy Hunt spoke about Cambridge - home of the global microprocessor giant. He said:I am pleased to announce the next steps for Cambridge to reach its potential to be the world’s leading scientific powerhouse. I confirm there will be a long-term funding settlement for the future Development Corporation in Cambridge at the next spending review, with over £10m invested in the coming year to unlock delivery of crucial local transport and health infrastructure.12:58 PM GMTMore money for nations outside EnglandMr Hunt said he was increasing money for parts of the country outside England. He said:As a result of the decisions we take today, the Scottish Government will receive nearly £300m in Barnett consequentials, with nearly £170m for the Welsh Government and £100m for the Northern Ireland Executive.12:57 PM GMTMoney pledged for ‘levelling up’Mr Hunt promised more cash for levelling up. He said:[We are] allocating £100m of levelling up funding to areas including High Peak, Dundee, Conwy, Erewash, Redditch and Coventry to support cultural projects in these communities, alongside support for capital projects across the country including in Bingley ...We are expanding the long-term plan for towns to 20 new places including Darlington – home of the Treasury’s fantastic Darlington Economic Campus - Coleraine, Peterhead, Runcorn, Harlow, Eastbourne, Arbroath and Rhyl, providing each with £20m of funding to invest in community regeneration over the next decade.We’ll provide £15m in new funding to the West Midlands Combined Authority to support culture, heritage and investment projects on the recommendation of our go-getting Mayor Andy Street ...And we’ll allocate £5m to renovate hundreds of local village halls across England so they can remain at the heart of their communities.12:55 PM GMTNew ‘levelling up’ measures announcedMr Hunt said that he would push ahead with economic devolution, following the creation of 13 investment zones and 12 freeports:I can announce the North-East trailblazer devolution deal, providing a package of support for the region potentially worth over £100m.I will devolve powers to Buckinghamshire, Warwickshire and to the most beautiful county in England, Surrey.12:54 PM GMTCamilla Tominey: Quite a lot of banter in the CommonsOur associate editor Camilla Tominey has this insight on the atmosphere inside the Commons chamber.12:53 PM GMTVAT threshold raisedMore microbusinesses will be exempt from having to register for VAT. Mr Hunt said:I will reduce the administrative and financial impact of VAT by increasing the VAT registration threshold from £85,000 to £90,000 from April 1st – the first increase in seven years. This will bring tens of thousands of businesses out of paying VAT altogether and encourage many more to invest and grow.12:52 PM GMTHunt takes ‘further steps to boost investment’He said that Full Expensing, confirmed as a permanent policy last autumn, was welcomed by over 200 business leaders. He said he now wanted to extend this idea further:Today I take further steps to boost investment. Having listened to calls from the CBI and Make UK, we will shortly publish draft legislation for full expensing to apply to leased assets, a change I intend to bring in as soon as it is affordable. We will also help small businesses, something close to my own heart.12:51 PM GMTBusiness investment is going up, says HuntMr Hunt referred to investments by Nissan, Microsoft and Google, saying that investment is going up under the Conservatives:Economists say that stimulating investment is the most effective way to raise productivity. Since 2010, we have been doing just that. Business investment has risen from an average of 9.3pc of GDP under Labour to 9.9pc under the Conservatives. This year it will be 10.6pc of GDP – generating £30bn more in business investment than if it had continued at Labour levels. And it is still going up.In fact, since 2010, greenfield foreign direct investment has been higher than anywhere else in Europe. And for the last three years we have been the third highest in the world after the United States and China. And we’re not stopping there.12:50 PM GMTUK debt pile ‘very similar’ to Autumn StatementOur economics editor Szu Ping Chan says:Debt profile very similar to last time. 91.7% of GDP in 24/25. Rises to 93.2% in 26/27 and 27/28 before falling to 92.9% (slightly higher than last time)— Szu Ping Chan (@szupingc) March 6, 202412:50 PM GMT‘They don’t have a growth plan’Jeremy Hunt claimed that Labour “don’t have a growth plan”. He said:Inflation has halved ... Debt is falling in line with our fiscal rules ... And growth is fully 1.5 percentage points higher than predicted.But as growth returns, our plan is for economic growth not sustained through migration but one that raises wages and living standards for families. Not just higher GDP but higher GDP per head. And that means sticking to our plan with a Budget for Long Term Growth – more investment, more jobs, better public services and lower taxes.12:49 PM GMTHunt justifies Government’s economic recordJeremy Hunt bigged up the Government’s economy record. He said:Since 2010, we have grown faster than Germany, France and Italy, the three largest European economies, and, according to the IMF, we will continue to grow faster than all three of them in the next five years as well. Surveys by Lloyds and Deloitte show business confidence is returning. In other words, because we have turned the corner on inflation, we will soon turn the corner on growth.12:48 PM GMTHunt attacks Labour’s green policiesMr Hunt took aim at Labour’s pledge to “decarbonise” faster than the Government, saying it would prevent borrowing from being cut. He said:None of that would be possible if Labour implemented their pledge to decarbonise the grid five years early by 2030. Their own calculations said that costs £28bn a year to do. But last month, after flipflopping for months and months, they said they’re not going to spend the £28bn after all…but somehow they will meet their pledge. Somehow, Madam Deputy Speaker, that can only mean one thing: tax rises on working families.12:48 PM GMT‘Yet another fuel duty freeze’Yet another fuel duty freeze. Yet no doubt we will continue the fiction that the ""temporary"" 5p cut will be reinstated and duty will rise with inflation from next year. Not doing so will cost another £6bn on top of £14bn annual cost of freezes since 2010— Paul Johnson (@PJTheEconomist) March 6, 202412:47 PM GMTGovernment ‘bringing down borrowing so we can start to reduce our debt’Jeremy Hunt said the government continues to have the second-lowest level of government debt in the G7. He claimed that this was lower than Japan, France and the United States. He said:Ahead of my first Autumn Statement in 2022, the OBR forecast headline debt would rise to above 100pc of GDP. Today they say it will fall in every year to just 94.3pc by 2028-29. Underlying debt, which excludes Bank of England debt, will be 91.7pc in 2024-25 according to the OBR, then 92.8pc, 93.2pc, 93.2pc before falling to 92.9pc in 2028-29 with final year headroom against debt falling of £8.9bn. Our underlying debt is therefore on track to fall as a share of GDP, meeting our fiscal rule.12:45 PM GMTHunt justifies spending restraintMr Hunt said there was no disconnect between spending restrictions and being compassionate. He said:An economy based on sound money does not pass on its bills to the next generation. When it comes to borrowing, some believe there is a trade off between compassion and fiscal responsibility. They are wrong. It is only because we responsibly reduced the deficit by 80pc between 2010 and 2019 that we could provide £370bn to help families and businesses in the pandemic.12:44 PM GMTFuel and alcohol duty freezes will cut inflation, Hunt saysJeremy Hunt said that duty freezes would help inflation. He said:[The fuel duty cut] will save the average car driver £50 next year and bring total savings since the 5p cut was introduced to around £250.Taken together with the alcohol duty freeze, this decision also reduces headline inflation by 0.2 percentage points in 2024-25 allowing us to make faster progress towards the Bank of England’s 2pc target.12:43 PM GMTHunt freezes fuel duty for 12 monthsJeremy Hunt says that he will freeze fuel duty:Another cost that families and businesses worry about is fuel. The shadow chancellor complained about the freeze on fuel duty and Labour has opposed it at every opportunity. The Labour Mayor of London wants to punish motorists even more with his ULEZ plans. But lots of families and sole traders depend on their car. If I did nothing fuel duty would increase by 13pc this month.12:42 PM GMTAlcohol duty is frozenMr Hunt said:I have decided to extend the alcohol duty freeze until February 2025. This benefits 38,000 pubs all across the UK – and on top of the £13,000 saving a typical pub will get from the 75% business rates discount I announced in the Autumn. We value our hospitality industry and we are backing the great British pub.12:42 PM GMTChancellor extends household support fundJeremy Hunt has extended the Household Support Fund that the Government says is “aimed at anyone who’s vulnerable or cannot pay for essentials”. Mr Hunt explained:It was set up on a temporary basis and due to conclude at the end of this month. Having listened carefully to representations from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the Trussell Trust and the Hon Members for East Ham, Colchester, Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner and Suffolk Coastal among others, I have decided that – with the battle against inflation still not over – now is not the time to stop the targeted help it offers. We will therefore continue it at current levels for another six months.12:41 PM GMTChancellor abolishes charge for debt relief orderThe Chancellor is abolishing a charge made for people who want to use a scheme to get out of debt:For some people the best way to resolve debts is through a debt relief order. But getting one costs £90, which can deter the very people who need them the most. So having listened carefully to representations from Citizens Advice, I today relieve pressure on around 40,000 families every year by abolishing that £90 charge completely.12:40 PM GMTChancellor promises to help poorer householdsThe Chancellor is making a change to advance loans for people on Universal Credit:The OBR predicted real household disposable income per person would fall by 2% in the last year – instead after this support it is on track to rise by 0.8%. Today I take further steps to help families with cost-of-living pressures starting with measures to help the poorest families. We have already abolished higher charges for electricity paid by those on pre-payment meters, increased the local housing allowance and raised benefits by double the expected inflation ...Nearly one million households on Universal Credit take out budgeting advance loans to pay for more expensive emergencies like boiler repairs or help getting a job. To help make such loans more affordable, I have today decided to increase the repayment period for new loans from 12 months to 24 months.12:39 PM GMTInflation to fall below 2pc in a few monthsMr Hunt said he would deliver “more investment, more jobs, better public services and better taxes in a long-term Budget for growth”.He pointed out that the OBR predicts inflation will fall below the 2pc target in just a few months time, “nearly a whole year earlier than expected”.He said: “That didn’t happen by accident.”12:36 PM GMTHunt: Growth larger than every large European economyJeremy Hunt said Conservatives know that lower taxes mean higher growth.The deputy speaker interrupted proceedings to say the Chancellor has “hardly said anything” amid raucous calls in the Commons.12:38 PM GMTChancellor accuses Labour of imposing burdens on businessJeremy Hunt said Labour would damage employment:Their plans destroy jobs with 70 new burdens on employers ... reduce opportunities by halving new apprenticeships ... and risk family finances with spending that pushes up tax.12:37 PM GMTChancellor says immigration is not the answer to growthJeremy Hunt suggested the country should focus on building a high skill economy rather than growth through unlimited immigration:If we want ... growth to lead to higher wages and higher living standards for every family in every corner of the country, it cannot come from unlimited migration. It can only come by building a high wage, high skill economy. Not just higher GDP but higher GDP per head.12:36 PM GMTPermanent cuts in taxes promisedThe Chancellor said:Of course, interest rates remain high as we bring down inflation. But because of the progress we’ve made ... because we are delivering the Prime Minister’s economic priorities ... we can now help families not just with temporary cost of living support ... but with permanent cuts in taxation.12:35 PM GMTChancellor says lower taxes mean higher growthThere was some jeering from the Opposition benches to this statement.12:34 PM GMTChancellor gives £1m to remember muslims who died in world warsJeremy Hunt began by talking about Muslim contributors to the fight for freedom in the world wars. He said:I start today by remembering the Muslims who died in two world wars in the service of freedom and democracy. We need a memorial to honour them, so following representations from the Rt Hon Member for Bromsgrove and others, I have decided to allocate £1m towards the cost of building one. Whatever your faith or colour or class, this country will never forget the sacrifices made for our future. In recent times, the UK economy has dealt with a financial crisis, a pandemic and an energy shock caused by war in Europe.12:33 PM GMTJeremy Hunt begins Budget speechAnd we’re off. Jeremy Hunt, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, has begun his Budget speech.He began the speech by talking of the need to “fight extremism,” remembering Muslims who died in the two world wars.He has announced funding for a memorial.12:26 PM GMTPM asked if he is proud of presiding over ‘highest tax burden’A stinging question from Dame Angela Eagle, who asked the Prime Minister which of his economic policies he is most proud of.She said is it “presiding over the highest tax burden” or the “slowest wage growth since the Napoleonic war?”Mr Sunak quickly replied that it is “saving 10m jobs in the pandemic with the furlough scheme”.12:21 PM GMTPound ticks up ahead of Budget speechA quick glance at the markets before the Chancellor gets up to deliver his Budget speech shows the pound is up 0.2pc against the dollar to $1.27.Bond yields have drifted higher, with the 10-year gilt yield at 4.04pc.Britain’s flagship stock market, the FTSE 100, has risen 0.3pc today to 7,671.30.12:14 PM GMTChancellor is in his seatJeremy Hunt is in the chamber, sitting next to Allister Jack. the Scottish Secretary, and Laura Trott, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, ahead of his speech.Jeremy Hunt waits to deliver his Budget speech during Prime Minister's Questions12:11 PM GMTHow taxes have soared to a record high under 14 years of Tory ruleAs Jeremy Hunt prepares to deliver what may be his final pre-election Budget, the message will be that Conservatives know that lower taxes means higher growth. However, he faces an inconvenient fact.Our senior economics reporter Eir Nolsøe has this analysis:Although the average worker will enjoy a £450 annual boost to their earnings if he unveils an expected 2p cut to national insurance, the tax burden will still be on track to hit a post-war high.Since 2010-2011, the Government’s income from taxes relative to the size of the economy has risen from 33.2pc to 36.2pc.The Office for Budget Responsibility, which scrutinises government spending plans, predicts that by 2028-29 it will hit an all-time high of 37.7pc.This means the tax burden will be higher than at any time since records began in 1948.Read how as Jeremy Hunt prepares to deliver his Budget, he faces an inconvenient legacy.Since 2010-2011, the Government's income from taxes relative to the size of the economy has risen from 33.2pc to 36.2pc - Justin Tallis/AFP12:07 PM GMTPrime Minister’s Questions beginsNot long now until the Budget speech. First we have the small task of Prime Minister’s Questions.The session begins in earnest with Sir Keir Starmer, the leader of Labour, asking Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister, about the murder of Sarah Everard and how such serious failures in police vetting by the Metropolitan Police were allowed to happen.Mr Sunak said he is “sure all members of the House will have been thinking about Sarah Everard” and “the abuse of power” that lead to her murder.He said the Government had instigated the “largest ever screening of all serving officers and staff”.11:49 AM GMTBudget must focus on long-term to trigger growth, say economistsThe Chancellor has been urged to resist the temptation for pre-election giveaways and instead focus on long-term economic growth.Paula Bejarano Carbo, an economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said:Today’s Spring Budget is taking place against a backdrop of low economic growth, as seen most notably by GDP per head being lower in the last quarter of 2023 than just before the pandemic (2019 Q4).While increasing real wages have improved conditions for many households in recent months, long-term economic prospects will remain weak without growth-enhancing fiscal policies, such as a commitment to increasing public investment.We therefore hope today’s Budget focuses on the long-term, rather than pre-election giveaways.11:44 AM GMTTax burden to hit record levels by end of decade, economists warnExperts said that a 2p reduction in National Insurance contributions would not be enough by itself to stop the tax burden reaching record levels by the end of this decade.The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the measure would not prevent taxes rising to about 37pc of GDP by 2028-29.The Resolution Foundation think tank said the biggest net beneficiaries of the National Insurance cut, combined with threshold freezes, are those earning £50,000, while those earning £19,000 or less will actually be worse off.Mr Hunt has said he will not pay for tax cuts with borrowing, meaning a combination of spending cuts and tax rises elsewhere will be necessary.Tax rises could include a levy on vapes, a tax raid on owners of short-term holiday lets, and the scaling back of non-dom tax relief - a policy previously advocated by Labour and opposed by ministers.Mr Hunt could shave more off his post-election public spending plans to fund giveaways, reducing overall departmental spending - currently pencilled in to rise by 1pc per year in real terms after 2025 - to 0.7pc.11:33 AM GMTHunt: We must stick to the plan to bring down taxesJeremy Hunt insisted his plan to get the economy on the path to “healthy growth” and “bringing down taxes” was working as he prepared for the Budget.The Chancellor briefed the Cabinet on the contents of the statement, which is expected to include a 2p cut to National Insurance to ease the tax burden on workers.In a promotional video released by the Treasury, Mr Hunt pleaded with the UK to back him and not “throw away” the work done to repair the economy.The economy slipped into a technical recession at the end of 2023 and the Tories are around 20 points behind in the polls, meaning that Mr Hunt is under pressure to revive both growth and the Conservatives’ election prospects.Pleading with the public to back his plan, he said:We’ve worked so hard to get through the really challenging period that we’ve come through. Don’t throw it away.We can see now the economy is set for healthy growth. We’re putting more money into our public services and we’re bringing down taxes. Stick to the plan.We're sticking to the plan. pic.twitter.com/kJefyMKndc— HM Treasury (@hmtreasury) March 6, 202411:19 AM GMTListen: Ben Riley-Smith on Tory dreams for tax-cutting Budget11:15 AM GMT2p National Insurance cut: how much you would saveThe average employee earning £35,000 will save £785 a year thanks to National Insurance being cut by a further 2p in today’s spring Budget.“Class 1” National Insurance was charged at a rate of 12pc in April 2023, but following successive cuts will now be 8pc for the next year. It has already fallen to 10pc from January.Jeremy Hunt has decided to cut NI after deciding a cut to income tax would be too expensive.Government sources said the average worker would save £450 as a result of the latest cut to NI.Use our calculator here to see how much you’ll save both from this cut, and the previous one that took effect in January this year.11:07 AM GMTTruss mini-Budget ‘casts long shadow’ over Hunt’s choices, says economistThe fallout from the Liz Truss mini-Budget will mean Jeremy Hunt is likely to try to avoid any announcements that could shock debt markets, according to an economist.Simon French, the chief economist at Panmure Gordon, told Sky News “there is still a long shadow being cast by the mini Budget”.Back then the Government announced £45bn in unfunded tax cuts. Mr French said:When you are doing something that the debt market is not anticipating, you always run the risk that the investors on whom you rely in terms of funding what is a £2.5 trillion debt burden, and a deficit of around £100bn a year, you always worry there will be some indigestion - or quite significant indigestion as was seen back in September [2022, at the mini-Budget].That is not a reason not to do it but I do think it’s a reason, if you’re going to take a very different path to what the market expects, to warm them up to expect that rather than surprise them on the day.10:58 AM GMTHunt could ‘gamble’ on borrowing to trigger growth, says economistJeremy Hunt could be tempted to borrow more to fund growth in Britain’s economy in a calculated “gamble” aimed at imitating policies in the United States, according to a leading economist.Simon French, the chief economist at Panmure Gordon, acknowledged that it is “very unlikely” the Treasury would try to borrow to fund tax cuts, which is what led to the downfall of the Liz Truss government after the ill-fated mini-Budget.However, he said that the Government could be casting “jealous looks” at growth figures for the US economy, which is being powered by vast borrowing for green subsidies.Bond traders have been nervy in morning trading as they wait to see if Mr Hunt will try to pull a rabbit out of the hat in his Budget speech, with yields on UK gilts edging higher.Mr French told Sky News:One of the problems global economies are currently grappling with is that a major economic neighbour - the biggest economy in the world, the United States - is pursuing a much looser fiscal stance with much more borrowing and is growing at a very rapid rate.There will be some jealous looks from the Treasury across at those growth figures and perhaps wondering again whether that is a gamble worth taking given the success of the US economy over the last few years.10:33 AM GMTUK bond market wavers ahead of Chancellor’s speechBond traders have been nervy in morning trading as they wait to see if Jeremy Hunt will try to pull a rabbit out of the hat in his Budget speech.The Chancellor is widely expected to announce a 2p cut to National Insurance but onlookers are keen to see if he will try to announce another eye-catching pre-election policy.However, it comes as Mr Hunt has faced a squeeze on the amount of space he has within his fiscal rules to announce tax cuts.It is barely 18 months since money markets were sent into turmoil after Liz Truss’s government announced unfunded spending cuts in the ill-fated mini-Budget.Today, the yield on 10-year UK gilts - the return the Government promises to pay buyers of its debt - edged higher to 4.04pc, rising higher than most comparable European bonds.10:24 AM GMTWhat time is the Budget speech today?The Chancellor will deliver his speech at about 12.30pm, shortly after the end of Prime Minister’s Questions, which begins at noon.Here is what to expect.Jeremy Hunt speaks during a Cabinet meeting today - Simon Walker/No 10 Downing Street10:18 AM GMTChancellor has to stimulate growth without inflation ‘spike up’One of the major challenges facing the Chancellor is delivering the tax cuts he believes will stimulate the economy without triggering a fresh rise in inflation.The pace of annual price rises have dropped from 11.1pc in October 2022 to 4pc last month but sweeping tax cuts risk reigniting inflation if it gives households more capacity to buy up limited numbers of goods, sending prices higher.However, the Chancellor wants to get Britain’s economy growing again after it fell into recession at the end of last year.Daniela Hathorn, a senior market analyst at Capital.com, said:There is positivity that there’s going to be fiscal steps to aid the suffering in the UK economy.But at the same time, and this is what the Bank of England has been trying to do, is making sure that enabling consumers to have more purchasing power doesn’t spike up inflation.10:02 AM GMTPictured: Hunt addresses ministers ahead of BudgetRishi Sunak appears to be paying close attention as Chancellor Jeremy Hunt briefs ministers during a pre-Budget meeting of the Cabinet:Jeremy Hunt speaks during the pre-Budget Cabinet meeting -

Peter Nicholls/Getty Images09:51 AM GMTGovernment sells-off more NatWest sharesThe Government has sold off more of its stake in NatWest as onlookers ponder whether the Treasury’s stake in the bank may become a focal point in the Budget.The taxpayer’s stake in NatWest has dropped from 32.88pc to 31.85pc after the sale on Tuesday, which has just been disclosed.Jeremy Hunt channeled Margaret Thatcher’s “Tell Sid” campaign to get British people buying shares during his Autumn Statement in November.The Chancellor said the Treasury would “explore options” for a potential NatWest share offer in the next 12 months, but said it would be “subject to supportive market conditions” and “value for money”.He added: “It’s time to get Sid investing again.”The Government has sold off more of its stake in NatWest - Hollie Adams/Bloomberg09:44 AM GMTUK-only Isa could help revive ‘undervalued’ British stocksSome of the chatter ahead of the Budget was around whether the Chancellor will use his Budget speech to encourage voters to invest in UK stock markets.A so-called “Great British Isa” would allow savers investing exclusively in British stocks to invest an extra £5,000 a year in Isas tax free, taking their annual limit to £25,000.Dan Squires, from investment platform Saxo, said products like Isas are popular with investors and a UK-only Isa would help revive British stocks that are “undervalued”.09:33 AM GMTFind out what the Budget means for you with Katie Morley and Camilla TomineyJeremy Hunt’s spring Budget promises to be one of the most consequential in years.So later, you can join The Telegraph’s consumer champion Katie Morley and associate editor Camilla Tominey online as they discuss what it means for your money and the future of the Government.You can pre-submit your questions to be answered in a live Q&A and find out if you’ll be better or worse off as Katie explains how the Chancellor’s tax tweaks and other announcements will affect your personal finances.Camilla will delve into whether the Budget can save the Conservative Party – or whether it will hand Labour an easy ride to power.All the details here.Our consumer champion Katie Morley and associate editor Camilla Tominey will answer your questions after the Budget09:14 AM GMTPound edges up as Hunt prepares to deliver BudgetThe pound has edged higher as money markets appear relatively settled in the run-up to Jeremy Hunt’s Budget speech.Sterling inched up 0.1pc against the dollar to more than $1.27 but was flat against the euro, which is worth 85p.The pound has risen for four consecutive days in the lead up to the Chancellor’s speech.Analysts think that run could continue if Mr Hunt reveals plans to stimulate the economy, even if the Bank of England cuts interest rates as expected later this year.Chris Turner, the head of FX strategy at ING, said: “Some decent fiscal stimulus should only delay the Bank of England easing cycle and support sterling.”09:04 AM GMTSocial care ‘crisis point’ requires pre-election plan, say bossesSocial care bosses are not hopeful for any support in the Budget but have called for a “credible” plan going into the election to save a sector at “crisis point”.Sam Monaghan, the chief executive of the UK’s largest charity care provider MHA, said:There’s a gaping chasm between government funding for social care and the cost of providing care. In reality, we’re not expecting this shortfall to be addressed when the Chancellor outlines his Spring Budget.But what we do want is for all political parties to present a credible, sustainable plan to put to voters ahead of the next General Election. This is why we’ve been asking our supporters to write to their local MP, to ensure social care remains high on the agenda.The sector has reached a crisis point. There are nearly half a million people waiting to be assessed and an estimated 152,000 staff vacancies in the sector. Local authorities are falling into bankruptcy, NHS waiting lists are growing and older people are too often not getting the choice and quality of care they deserve.We know that fixing these problems will require significant investment and that whoever forms the next government will need to increase funding in an affordable and manageable way. But this does not prevent the main political parties from demonstrating that they understand the sector’s needs and are willing to tackle its issues head on. We’ll wait and see what the statement brings.08:51 AM GMTFTSE 100 higher ahead of Budget speechUK shares have edged higher as investors await the Budget.The blue-chip FTSE 100 was up 0.3pc, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 added 0.6pc.Investors will remain focused on Jeremy Hunt presenting his pre-election Budget, in which he is expected to provide tax cuts, despite the economy facing its biggest debt burden since the 1960s.However, the FTSE 100 was held back from further gains by Legal & General, which slid 4pc to lead losses on the index after it missed expectations for 2023 operating profit.08:46 AM GMTUK on ‘path to lower taxes,’ says senior Tory MPBritain is on a “path to lower taxes,” a senior MP has said ahead of the Budget speech.Harriet Baldwin, the chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, said the Chancellor “continues to want to see lower taxes” but had been constrained by money spent on furlough during the pandemic and on support with energy bills after the beginning of the war in Ukraine.She told GB News: “What you’re seeing now is a path to lower taxes - to being able to hand some of that money back to taxpayers.”She added that official forecaster the OBR felt that cutting National Insurance would be less of a threat to inflation than cutting income tax.08:26 AM GMTBond yields tick up ahead of BudgetIt has been about a year and a half since Liz Truss’s mini-Budget triggered a crisis in bond markets after the announcement of unfunded tax cuts.Perhaps understandably then, yields are creeping up ahead of the Chancellor’s speech.The benchmark 10-year gilt yield - the return the Government promises to pay buyers of its debt - has ticked up three basis points to 4.04pc in early trading, ahead of other major European economies.08:12 AM GMTHunt: Great Budgets change historyJeremy Hunt said “great budgets changed history” as he outlined how he would “stick to the plan” on the economy.The Treasury has released a video of the Chancellor analysing his announcements in the November Autumn Statement.He said: “Great budgets change history. The bit of history I want to change is to show people it is possible if we stick to a plan through all the ups and downs, through all the challenges, it’s possible to have healthy growth, good public services and to bring down taxes.”We're sticking to the plan. pic.twitter.com/kJefyMKndc— HM Treasury (@hmtreasury) March 6, 202408:07 AM GMTUK markets subdued ahead of BudgetIt was a quiet start for stock markets in London this morning as traders wait to see whether the Chancellor will pull any rabbits out of his hat during his Budget speech.The FTSE 100 was little changed at 7,644.04, although the midcap FTSE 250 gained 0.2pc to 19,314.18.07:58 AM GMTWhat to expect in Jeremy Hunt’s Budget: NI cuts confirmedA 2p cut in National Insurance contributions looks certain in today’s Budget after government sources confirmed the move, writes Richard Evans.The Chancellor is said to have decided on the NI reduction because a cut in income tax would be too expensive.The reduction will be worth £450 for the average worker. When combined with the 2p cut in NI announced in November last year, which took effect in January, the latest move will save the average worker £900.A rise in duty on petrol and diesel appears to have been all but ruled out.Read everything you need to know about today’s Budget announcement.The Chancellor's red box in No 11 Downing Street - Kirsty O'Connor/HM Treasury07:53 AM GMTReeves: Budget should be ‘final chapter’ for ConservativesThe Labour shadow chancellor has said “nothing Jeremy Hunt says or does today” will change Britain being “worse off” under the Conservatives:Today's Budget should be the final chapter of fourteen years of Tory economic failure.

Should it be tax cuts? Should it be tax cuts for businesses? Should it be business rates? Of course that would be nice but we have to be realistic.We all know as business leaders that there is no magic money tree and we have to get revenue into the country in order to be able to fund more projects.07:24 AM GMTNational Insurance cut will prompt future tax rises, Hunt warnedA 2p cut to National Insurance in today’s Budget will eventually lead to more tax rises, economists have warned.Adam Corlett, the principal economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank, said there were “huge questions” about the need for tax cuts this year, given the outlook for public spending and the need to reduce our national debt.Jeremy Hunt is expected to announce that he has chosen to cut National Insurance, rather than a more expensive reduction in income tax, in a move that will save workers £900 a year when combined with the cut announced last autumn.The cut is expected to be partly paid for by a series of tax increases, potentially on business class airfares, vapes and an extension to the windfall tax on oil and gas producers.Mr Corlett said: “While this is going to be a tax-cutting election year, it is sandwiched between significant past and future tax rises, with the budget likely to only add to the number of tax increases coming in after the election.”07:18 AM GMTGood morningThanks for joining me for your live Budget updates. Jeremy Hunt’s plan to cut 2p off National Insurance will eventually lead to a number of tax increases after the next election, economists have warned.Adam Corlett, the principal economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank, said the tax cut - announced in November and worth £900 to the average worker when combined with NI reductions - will “only add to the number of tax increases coming in after the election”.5 things to start your day1) Hunt’s inheritance tax ‘stealth’ raid has cost families £1.5bn | Pressure mounts on Chancellor to unfreeze ‘nil-rate band’ allowance as Budget looms2) Jeremy Hunt to cut 2p off National Insurance rather than ‘inflationary’ income tax | Government will bring forward legislation next week to enable the reduction, worth £450 for average worker, to come into effect in April3) 2p National Insurance cut: how much you would save | Work out how much Jeremy Hunt’s reduction will benefit you4) Ambrose Evans-Pritchard: Britain is living beyond its means | But slashing public investment is the worst thing to do | The UK must not succumb to policy defeatism5) Jeremy Warner: The cause of Britain’s housing woes has been staring the Tories in the face | Having failed to control immigration, the Conservatives have also failed to provide for itWhat happened overnightThe Chancellor will deliver his Budget at an exuberant time for markets.
