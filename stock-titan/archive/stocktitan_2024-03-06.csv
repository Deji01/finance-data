UMC Reports Sales for February 2024,2024-03-06T08:00:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) reports unaudited net sales for February 2024 with a 3.07% year-over-year increase. However, the January-February period shows a slight decrease of 0.15% compared to the previous year.","UMC Reports Sales for February 2024 Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) reports unaudited net sales for February 2024 with a 3.07% year-over-year increase. However, the January-February period shows a slight decrease of 0.15% compared to the previous year. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported unaudited net sales for United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) show a moderate year-over-year (Y/Y) increase for February 2024, at 3.07%. This uptick, albeit slight, is indicative of a stable demand for UMC's semiconductor products. However, the combined figures for January and February indicate a marginal decrease of 0.15% compared to the same period in the previous year.Investors should consider the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, which can be influenced by factors such as global demand for electronics, innovation cycles and inventory adjustments. The reported sales figures suggest that UMC is maintaining its market position, but the slight Y/Y decline over the two-month period could signal a need for cautious optimism.It's important to note that semiconductor sales can be volatile and are sensitive to global economic conditions. Therefore, the reported figures should be contextualized within broader market trends and economic indicators to assess their potential impact on UMC's financial performance and stock valuation. Market Research Analyst UMC's financial performance must be analyzed against the backdrop of the global semiconductor market. The industry is currently facing challenges such as supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tensions and shifts in consumer demand. The modest growth in February, contrasted with the slight decline over the two-month period, could reflect these broader market dynamics.Furthermore, the semiconductor industry is heavily influenced by technological advancements and the adoption of new technologies. UMC's ability to innovate and align its product offerings with market demands is crucial for its long-term success. Investors should monitor not only sales figures but also R&D investments and product pipeline updates to gauge UMC's competitive edge.Additionally, the Taiwanese Dollar's exchange rate fluctuations can affect reported revenue figures, as UMC's financials are presented in NT$. Currency impacts should be considered when interpreting the company's performance, especially for international investors. Economist The semiconductor industry is a key indicator of economic activity, given its role in the production of a wide range of consumer and industrial electronics. UMC's reported sales provide insights into not only the company's performance but also the health of the technology sector and broader economic trends.An increase in sales, even modest, could suggest resilience in the face of economic headwinds. However, the slight Y/Y decrease for the initial two months of the year warrants a careful analysis of economic factors that could be at play, such as consumer spending patterns, industrial production rates and international trade conditions.Long-term implications for stakeholders, including investors and employees, hinge on the company's ability to navigate the complex interplay of supply and demand, technological innovation and economic cycles. UMC's sales figures should be considered alongside macroeconomic indicators to forecast industry trends and potential shifts in the company's strategic direction. 03/06/2024 - 03:00 AM TAIPEI, Taiwan--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- United Microelectronics Corporation (NYSE: UMC; TWSE: 2303) (“UMC”), today reported unaudited net sales for the month of February 2024.

In addition, Ecora's near-term development royalties are poised for significant de-risking events in the year ahead.Producing royaltiesVoisey's Bay (Operator: Vale)Vale announced that the Voisey's Bay underground project was more than 90% complete as of December 2023. Vale continues to anticipate ore mined at the underground Reid Brook and Eastern Deeps ore bodies to ramp-up during the course of 2024, with the Eastern Deeps main production start-up expected to occur in the second half of this year. Ecora continues to expect to receive between 12 and 16 deliveries of cobalt during 2024 (each delivery is 20 tonnes of which 70% is attributable to Ecora).Mantos Blancos (Operator: Capstone Copper)Production for the full year is forecast to be in line with Ecora's expectations at 49-57kt. Capstone stated that during the first half of 2024 it intends to install the necessary equipment to remove bottlenecks between major components of the Mantos Blancos processing circuit.

Capstone is targeting a final investment decision to construct the Santo Domingo project in H2 2025.West Musgrave (Operator: BHP)The West Musgrave project's economics remain robust, with BHP stating that the operation could generate reasonable returns despite a weak nickel price environment and assuming lower forward prices for nickel. However, as BHP studies a potential move into care and maintenance for Nickel West, it will consider the merits of phasing the remaining West Musgrave construction capital expenditure. The West Musgrave project is currently 21% complete, and first copper and nickel production had previously been targeted between Q4 2025 and calendar year 2026.Piauí (Operator: Brazilian Nickel)Brazilian Nickel Limited continues to progress construction financing workstreams, including debt and equity funding.

We will achieve this through building a diversified portfolio of scale over high quality assets that drives low volatility earnings growth and shareholder returns.The mining sector has an essential role to play in the energy transition, with commodities such as copper, nickel and cobalt - key materials for manufacturing batteries and electric vehicles. Copper also plays a critical role in our electricity grids. All these commodities are mined and there are not enough mines in operation today to supply the volume required to achieve the energy transition.Our strategy is to acquire royalties and streams over low-cost operations and projects with strong management teams, in well-established mining jurisdictions. Our portfolio has been reweighted to provide material exposure to this commodity basket and we have successfully transitioned from a coal orientated royalty business in 2014 to one that by 2026 will be materially coal free and comprised of over 90% exposure to commodities that support a sustainable future.

Kosmos Energy Ltd. Prices Upsized Offering of $350 Million 3.125% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2030,2024-03-06T07:00:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Kosmos Energy Ltd. (KOS) announces a private offering of $350 million convertible senior notes due 2030, with an option for an additional $50 million.

The offering is expected to close on March 8, 2024, and the net proceeds are estimated to be approximately $340.4 million.","Kosmos Energy Ltd. Prices Upsized Offering of $350 Million 3.125% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2030 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Kosmos Energy Ltd. (KOS) announces a private offering of $350 million convertible senior notes due 2030, with an option for an additional $50 million. The notes will have an initial conversion price of $7.02 per share, representing a 30.0% premium. The offering is expected to close on March 8, 2024, and the net proceeds are estimated to be approximately $340.4 million. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The issuance of $350 million in convertible senior notes by Kosmos Energy Ltd. represents a significant capital raising activity that could have implications for the company's financial structure and stock performance. The increase in offering size from the initially announced $300 million to $350 million, with an option for an additional $50 million, suggests strong market demand or a greater need for capital than initially projected. Convertible notes are hybrid securities offering both debt and potential equity conversion, which can be attractive to investors seeking both fixed income and the possibility of capital appreciation.The 3.125% interest rate on these notes is relatively low, reflecting the current interest rate environment and potentially Kosmos Energy's creditworthiness. However, the conversion premium of approximately 30% over the recent closing stock price indicates the company's optimism about its future stock performance. This conversion premium is a critical metric as it can influence investor sentiment regarding the company's growth prospects. The capped call transactions associated with the offering aim to minimize potential dilution from the conversion of the notes and are indicative of proactive management of shareholder interests.For stakeholders, the immediate use of proceeds to repay existing debt could improve the company's leverage ratios and interest expense, potentially leading to a more favorable credit rating. However, the potential dilution of common stock upon conversion could impact existing shareholders if the company's stock price exceeds the conversion threshold. The market's reaction to these transactions will likely depend on the balance between the perceived benefits of debt reduction and the potential risks associated with future dilution. Market Research Analyst Kosmos Energy's decision to enter into capped call transactions indicates a strategic approach to managing the potential impact of the convertible notes on the company's stock. The cap price of $10.80, which is 100% above the current stock price, sets an upper limit on the price at which the notes can be converted into equity. This cap serves as a hedge against excessive dilution and reflects management's confidence in the company's potential for stock price appreciation.The timing of this offering and the associated hedging activities by the option counterparties could influence Kosmos Energy's stock volatility in the near term. The company's stock price may experience increased trading activity as the option counterparties adjust their hedge positions. Investors and existing shareholders should monitor these market dynamics closely, as they could affect the stock's liquidity and price movements.Long-term, the conversion features of the notes and the associated capped call transactions could align the interests of bondholders and shareholders. If the company performs well and the stock price appreciates beyond the conversion price, bondholders may convert their notes into stock, participating in the company's equity upside. This could ultimately lead to a more shareholder-friendly capital structure, assuming the dilution is managed effectively and does not outweigh the benefits of potential stock price appreciation. 03/06/2024 - 02:00 AM DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Kosmos Energy Ltd. (NYSE/LSE: KOS) (“Kosmos” or the ""Company""), announced today that it has priced a private offering of $350 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.125% convertible senior notes due 2030 (the ""notes""), which represents a $50 million increase in principal amount from the previously announced offering size. The Company also granted the initial purchasers an option to purchase up to an additional $50 million aggregate principal amount of notes, for settlement within a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the date on which the notes are first issued. The offering is expected to close on March 8, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of the Company. The notes will rank pari passu with the Company’s existing senior notes and the Company’s revolving credit facility. The notes will be guaranteed (i) on a senior, unsecured basis by certain of the Company’s existing subsidiaries that guarantee on a senior basis the Company’s revolving credit facility and the Company’s existing senior notes, and (ii) on a subordinated, unsecured basis by certain of the Company’s existing subsidiaries that borrow under or guarantee the Company’s commercial debt facility and guarantee on a subordinated basis the Company’s revolving credit facility and the Company’s existing senior notes. Upon conversions of the notes, the Company will satisfy its conversion obligation by paying cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted, and paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock, at the Company’s election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of its conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted. The notes will have an initial conversion rate of 142.4501 shares of the Company’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances). This is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $7.02 per share. The initial conversion price represents a premium of approximately 30.0% to the $5.40 per share closing price of the Company’s common stock on The New York Stock Exchange on March 5, 2024. The notes will accrue interest at an annual rate of 3.125%, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2024. The notes will mature on March 15, 2030, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Prior to December 15, 2029, the notes will be convertible at the option of the holders only upon the occurrence of specified events, and thereafter until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, the notes will be convertible at any time. In the event of certain tax law changes, the Company may redeem the notes in whole, but not in part. In addition, the Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the notes (subject to a partial redemption limitation), at the Company’s option, on or after March 22, 2027 and prior to the 41st scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, if the last reported sale price per share of the Company's common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price for a specified period of time. The redemption price will be equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. The Company estimates that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $340.4 million (or approximately $389.0 million if the initial purchasers exercise in full their option to purchase additional notes), after deducting discounts payable to the initial purchasers. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to (i) repay a portion of outstanding indebtedness under the Company’s commercial debt facility; (ii) pay the cost of the capped call transactions described below, using net proceeds of approximately $43.6 million; and (iii) pay fees and expenses related to the offering. In connection with the pricing of the notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain of the initial purchasers of the notes or their respective affiliates and certain other financial institutions (the “option counterparties”). The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon any conversion of the notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. The cap price of the capped call transactions will initially be $10.80, which represents a premium of 100.0% above the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock on The New York Stock Exchange on March 5, 2024, and is subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. If the initial purchasers of the notes exercise their option to purchase additional notes, the Company expects to enter into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties and use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the additional notes to pay the cost of such additional capped call transactions. In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the Company expects the option counterparties or their respective affiliates to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the Company’s common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes, and may unwind these various derivative transactions and purchase the Company’s common stock in open market transactions shortly after the pricing of the notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of the Company’s common stock or the notes at that time. In addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to the Company’s common stock and/or purchasing or selling the Company’s common stock or other securities of the Company in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of the Company’s common stock or the notes, which could affect the ability of noteholders to convert the notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the notes, it could affect the number of shares and value of the consideration that noteholders will receive upon conversion of the notes. The offering is being made to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""). The offer and sale of the notes, the guarantees and any shares of the Company's common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, or under any state securities laws, and the notes and such shares may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.

The Fi SW dyke strikes over at least 1.1 km on surface with an average outcropping width of approximately 20 m. The dyke dips between 60°-80° to the east-southeast and trends towards the north-northeast. Drilling of Fi SW show that it ranges from a single 20-40 m wide dyke to 2-3 dykes of similar cumulative width within a 50-70 m wide corridor. YLP-0200 tested the Fi SW pegmatite approximately 250 m from its northern mapped extent and 50 m below the surface, and in between sections located 50 m north and 50 m south that, from 2023 drilling, returned intersections of 1.0-1.5% Li2O over 20-25 m to approximately 200 m depth. New drilling intersected a single 26 m pegmatite that returned 1.31% Li2O over 19 m (Table 1 & 2, Figures 2 & 3). Figure 2 – Plan view showing the surface expression of the Fi Southwest pegmatite with diamond drill hole reported in this press release. Figure 3 – Cross-section illustrating YLP-0200 with results as shown in the Fi Southwest pegmatite dyke with a 19 m interval of 1.31% Li2O. Echo Pegmatite The Echo pegmatite complex comprises a steeply dipping, northwest-trending, feeder dyke that splits into a fanning splay of moderate- to gently dipping dykes at its northwest end. The dyke complex has a total strike length of over 1.0 km with individual dykes up to 25 m wide. The holes described below were collared on the fanning splay part of the complex that consists of several subparallel moderate to shallow dipping dykes. YLP-0202 tested the northwestern fanning splay of the Echo complex, within 100 m of its mapped extent, <25 m below the surface, as well as 50 and 100 m along strike from YLP-0203 and 0205 respectively (see below) and 200 m along strike from previously released YLP-0128 (1.24% Li2O over 10 m and 0.69% Li2O over 12 m). Drilling intersected a 10 m dyke flanked by 1-3 m wide dykes for cumulative 14 m pegmatite over 25 m of core. Assays returned composites of 0.90% Li2O over 3 m and 0.50% Li2O over 7 m, the latter including a 2 m interval that returned 1.32% Li2O. YLP-0203 was collared 50 m east of YLP-0202 to test the same dyke system at 25-50 m below the surface. Drilling intersected a 15 m dyke and a 10 m dyke separated by 16 m of country rock, with the upper and thickest dyke returning an assay composite of 1.24% Li2O over 13 m. The lower dyke returned a wall-to-wall composite of 0.21% Li2O over 10 m that includes one metre of 0.51% Li2O. YLP-0205 was collared halfway between YLP-0202 and YLP-0128 to test the Echo dyke fan at 50 m beneath the surface. Drilling intersected two clusters of dykes that are separated by ~20 m of country rock; the upper group consists of four dykes between 2-8 m in width for cumulative 25 m of pegmatite in 56 m of core whereas the lower group consists of two dykes that are each 2 metres wide and separated by 6 m of country rock. Assays from the upper group of dykes returned composites of 1.39% Li2O over 8 m, 0.96% Li2O over 7 m, and 0.73% Li2O over 8 m for a combined 23 m of pegmatite at 1.03% Li2O. The lower group returned negligible grades (Table 1 & 2, Figures 4 & 5). Figure 4 – Plan view showing the surface expression of the Echo pegmatite with diamond drill holes reported in this press release. Figure 5 – Cross-section of YLP-0203 which intersected the Echo pegmatite dyke with a 13 m interval of 1.24% Li2O. Nite Pegmatite The Nite pegmatite complex comprises a north-northeast trending corridor of parallel-trending dykes that is exposed for at least 1.4 km of strike length and dips approximately 50°-70° to the east. The northern part of this complex consists of a main dyke flanked by one or more thinner dykes whereas the southern part comprises a fanning splay of 5-10 thinner dykes that is up to 200 m wide. YLP-0193 explored the Nite pegmatite approximately 700 m from its northern end and 150 m beneath the surface, as well as 100 m downdip of previously released YLP-0138 (1.51% Li2O over 12 m) and 100 m up-dip of YLP-0195 (1.00% Li2O over 15 m). Drilling intersected two groups of dykes separated by 30 m of country rock; an upper group of two dykes summing to 6 m of pegmatite over 9 m of core and a lower group of five dykes totaling 24 m of pegmatite over 44 m. Notable assays were returned for 3 of 5 dykes in the lower group, including 1.01% Li2O over 8 m, 0.72% Li2O over 1 m, and 0.56% Li2O over 1 m. YLP-0196 was drilled on a section 100 m north of YLP-0193 to test the Nite pegmatite 50 m beneath the surface and 100 m up-dip of YLP-0198 (described below). Drilling intersected three dykes between 5-10 m in width for cumulative 21 m of pegmatite over 40 m of drill core. The upper-most and widest of these dykes returned 0.51% Li2O over 10 m that includes two higher-grade intervals of 1.0-1.1% Li2O over 2 m. The two lower dykes returned 0.70% Li2O over 6 m (including 1.12% Li2O over 3 m) and 0.59% Li2O over 1 m. YLP-0198 was drilled 100 m downdip of YLP-0196 (see above) and intersected three 2-10 m wide dykes spaced 8-11 m apart for cumulative 22 m of pegmatite over 38 m of core. The two lower dykes each returned composites of 0.4-0.7% Li2O over 10 m that also each includes a 3 m interval of 1.1-1.2% Li2O (Table 1 & 2, Figures 6 & 7). Figure 6 – Plan view showing the surface expression of the Nite pegmatite with diamond drill holes reported in this press release. Figure 7 – Cross-section of YLP-0193 which intersected the Nite pegmatite dyke with an 8 m interval of 1.01% Li2O. BIG West Pegmatite The BIG West pegmatite complex comprises a northeast-trending corridor of parallel-trending dykes that is exposed for at least 1.5 km along strike and is steeply west dipping to subvertical. The complex is bound by two relatively continuous dyke structures that are 50-100 m apart in the northern half of the corridor and 150 m apart in the south. These dykes are here referred to as the east- (EB) and west-bounding (WB) dykes. Three of the holes reported here are the most northerly drilled on this complex. YLP-0188 was collared on the transition between more widely and closely spaced EB and WB dykes, approximately 600 m from the southern mapped extent of the BIG West complex. Drilling was designed to test the BIG West corridor at 50-100 m beneath the surface and intersected three groups of 1-9 m wide pegmatite spaced 29-36 m apart. Assay results are generally negligible except a sample from one of the middle group dykes that returned 1.02% Li2O over 1 m (Table 1 & 2, Figure 8).

Drill core was transported from the drill platform to the core processing facility where it was logged, photographed, and split by diamond saw prior to being sampled. Samples were then bagged, and blanks and certified reference materials were inserted at regular intervals. Field duplicates consisting of quarter-cut core samples were also included in the sample runs. Groups of samples were placed in large bags, sealed with numbered tags in order to maintain a chain-of-custody, and transported from LIFT’s core logging facility to ALS Labs (“ALS”) laboratory in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. Sample preparation and analytical work for this drill program were carried out by ALS. Samples were prepared for analysis according to ALS method CRU31: individual samples were crushed to 70% passing through 2 mm (10 mesh) screen; a 1,000-gram sub-sample was riffle split (SPL-21) and then pulverized (PUL-32) such that 85% passed through 75-micron (200 mesh) screen. A 0.2-gram sub-sample of the pulverized material was then dissolved in a sodium peroxide solution and analysed for lithium according to ALS method ME-ICP82b. Another 0.2-gram sub-sample of the pulverized material was analysed for 53 elements according to ALS method ME-MS89L. All results passed the QA/QC screening at the lab, all inserted standards and blanks returned results that were within acceptable limits.

Negative The offering of the notes is not contingent upon the repurchase of the 2025 notes. The notes and shares of common stock upon conversion have not been registered under the Securities Act or state securities laws, limiting their sale in the United States without registration or exemption. Financial Analyst The announcement by Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc. regarding the upsized offering of convertible senior notes is a significant financial move that warrants attention from investors and market analysts. The increase from $250 million to $275 million, with an additional option for purchasers to acquire up to $41.25 million more, indicates a strong demand for the company's debt instruments, which may reflect positively on investor confidence in Tandem's financial health and future prospects.Convertible notes are a hybrid financial instrument offering both the benefits of debt and the potential upside of equity conversion. The interest rate of 1.50% is relatively low, suggesting that Tandem is able to borrow at favorable terms, possibly due to a solid credit standing. This strategic financial maneuver allows Tandem to manage its capital structure efficiently by repurchasing existing 2025 notes, which could be a move to reduce interest expenses or to avoid dilution from those notes converting to equity.The use of proceeds to repurchase common stock is also noteworthy. This action can be interpreted as the company signaling that its stock is undervalued or as a method to provide support to its stock price. However, the impact on the stock's market price and the dilutive effect of the conversion of these new notes into equity are critical factors to consider. The capped call transactions are designed to offset potential dilution, yet they introduce a level of complexity to the company's financial strategy that requires careful analysis. Legal Expert The legal implications of Tandem's offering, being conducted as a private placement under Rule 144A, are particularly relevant for institutional investors. This rule allows for the sale of securities to qualified institutional buyers without the need for a public offering, thus streamlining the process and potentially reducing regulatory overhead. However, it also limits the liquidity of the notes, as they cannot be immediately sold to the general public.Furthermore, the convertible notes are being issued as unsecured obligations, which means they do not have collateral backing and are subordinate to secured debt in case of liquidation. This presents a higher risk for note holders, which is typically compensated by a higher interest rate, though in this case, the rate is low, potentially due to Tandem's creditworthiness.The conversion feature and the associated capped call transactions are complex legal arrangements that require thorough understanding to assess their implications for both the company and the note holders. These mechanisms are put in place to manage the potential dilution of equity and to stabilize the company's capital structure, but they also add layers of legal and financial complexity that must be navigated with expertise. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Tandem's actions could be interpreted as a strategic pivot to optimize its capital allocation and to prepare for future growth initiatives. The repurchase of the 2025 notes and common stock indicates a proactive approach to managing the company's debt profile and equity base. This could be a response to market conditions or part of a broader strategic initiative to strengthen the balance sheet.The timing and size of the offering, as well as the decision to enter into capped call transactions, suggest that Tandem is looking to minimize the impact of equity dilution on existing shareholders while still taking advantage of the current market conditions to secure long-term financing. The repurchase of common stock in conjunction with the offering could be seen as a move to consolidate ownership and could potentially be a positive signal to the market about the company's valuation.It is also important to consider the potential market impact of the hedging and unwinding activities by the option counterparties and note holders. Such activities can lead to increased volatility in the company's stock price, which stakeholders should monitor closely. The overall market reaction to this news will depend on investor sentiment regarding Tandem's growth prospects and the perceived risk of the newly issued convertible notes. 03/06/2024 - 12:46 AM SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc. (NASDAQ: TNDM), a global insulin delivery and diabetes technology company, announced today the pricing of $275.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (the “notes”) in a private placement (the “offering”) to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The offering was upsized from the previously announced offering size of $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of notes. Tandem also granted the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase, within the 13-day period beginning on, and including, the first date on which the notes are issued, up to an additional $41.25 million aggregate principal amount of notes from Tandem. The sale of the notes is expected to close on March 8, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. The notes will be general unsecured obligations of Tandem and will accrue interest payable semiannually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2024, at a rate of 1.50% per year. The notes will mature on March 15, 2029, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. Tandem estimates that the net proceeds from the offering will be approximately $266.3 million (or approximately $306.4 million if the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes in full), after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by Tandem. Tandem expects to use the net proceeds from the offering, together with cash on hand, to (i) pay the approximately $13.8 million cost of the capped call transactions that it entered into as described below, (ii) repurchase for cash approximately $246.7 million in aggregate principal amount of its 1.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the “2025 notes”) in privately negotiated transactions entered into concurrently with the pricing of the notes in the offering and (iii) repurchase approximately $30.0 million of common stock in privately negotiated transactions entered into concurrently with the pricing of the notes in the offering through one of the initial purchasers or its affiliate from purchasers of the notes in the offering. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, Tandem expects to use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the additional notes to enter into additional capped call transactions and the remainder for general corporate purposes, which may include additional repurchases of the 2025 notes from time to time following the offering, or the repayment at maturity, of the 2025 notes. Before December 15, 2028, holders will have the right to convert their notes only upon the satisfaction of specified conditions and during certain periods. On or after December 15, 2028 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their notes at any time. Upon conversion, Tandem will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at its election. The conversion rate for the notes will initially be 28.9361 shares of Tandem’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $34.56 per share of Tandem’s common stock). The initial conversion price represents a premium of approximately 27.5% over the last reported sale price of $27.105 per share of Tandem’s common stock on March 5, 2024. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued or unpaid interest. Tandem may not redeem the notes prior to March 22, 2027. Tandem may redeem for cash all or any portion of the notes (subject to certain limitations), at its option, on or after March 22, 2027 if the last reported sale price of Tandem’s common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price for the notes then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which Tandem provides notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. However, Tandem may not redeem less than all of the outstanding notes unless at least $75.0 million aggregate principal amount of notes are outstanding and not called for redemption as of the time Tandem sends the related notice of redemption. No sinking fund is provided for the notes. If Tandem undergoes a “fundamental change” (as defined in the indenture that will govern the notes), then, subject to certain conditions and limited exceptions, holders may require Tandem to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date or if Tandem delivers a notice of redemption, Tandem will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such a corporate event or convert its notes called (or deemed called) for redemption in connection with such notice of redemption, as the case may be. In connection with the pricing of the notes, Tandem entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates and certain other financial institutions (the “option counterparties”). The capped call transactions cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of Tandem’s common stock initially underlying the notes. The capped call transactions are expected to offset the dilution to Tandem’s common stock as a result of any conversion of the notes, with such offset subject to a cap. The cap price of the capped call transactions relating to the notes will initially be $42.0128, which represents a premium of approximately 55.0% over the last reported sale price of Tandem’s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market on March 5, 2024, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the capped call transactions. In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, Tandem expects that the option counterparties or their respective affiliates will enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Tandem’s common stock and/or purchase shares of Tandem’s common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes, including with, or from, certain investors in the notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Tandem’s common stock or the notes at that time. In addition, Tandem expects that the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to Tandem’s common stock and/or purchasing or selling shares of Tandem’s common stock or other securities of Tandem in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so during the observation period relating to any conversion of the notes on or after December 15, 2028 that is not in connection with a redemption, or, to the extent Tandem elects to unwind a portion of the capped call transactions, following any repurchase, redemption, exchange or early conversion of the notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of Tandem’s common stock or the notes, which could affect a noteholder’s ability to convert its notes and, to the extent the activity occurs following conversion or during any observation period related to a conversion of notes, it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that a noteholder will receive upon conversion of such notes. Concurrently with the pricing of the notes in the offering, Tandem entered into privately negotiated transactions with certain holders of the 2025 notes to repurchase, for approximately $246.1 million in cash, approximately $246.7 million aggregate principal amount of its 2025 notes, excluding accrued and unpaid interest on the 2025 notes, on terms negotiated with each holder (each, a ""note repurchase transaction""). This press release is not an offer to repurchase the 2025 notes, and the offering of the notes is not contingent upon the repurchase of the 2025 notes. In connection with any note repurchase transaction, Tandem expects that holders of the 2025 notes who agree to have their 2025 notes repurchased and who have hedged their equity price risk with respect to such notes (the “hedged holders”) will unwind all or part of their hedge positions by buying Tandem’s common stock and/or entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to Tandem’s common stock. The amount of Tandem’s common stock to be purchased by the hedged holders or in connection with such derivative transactions may have been substantial in relation to the historical average daily trading volume of Tandem’s common stock. This activity by the hedged holders could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Tandem’s common stock, including concurrently with the pricing of the notes, and may have resulted in a higher effective conversion price of the notes. Additionally, in connection with the issuance of the 2025 notes, Tandem entered into capped call transactions (the “existing option transactions”) with certain financial institutions (the “existing option counterparties”). In connection with the note repurchase transactions, Tandem entered into agreements with the existing option counterparties to terminate a portion of the existing option transactions in a notional amount corresponding to the amount of 2025 notes repurchased (such terminations, the “unwind transactions”). In connection with such terminations of the existing option transactions, Tandem expects such existing option counterparties and/or their respective affiliates will unwind various derivatives with respect to Tandem’s common stock and/or sell shares of Tandem’s common stock concurrently with or shortly after pricing of the notes. This activity could decrease (or reduce the size of any increase in) the market price of Tandem’s common stock at that time and could decrease (or reduce the size of any increase in) the market value of the notes. As discussed above, Tandem also intends to use approximately $30.0 million of the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase shares of its common stock. Tandem expects to repurchase such shares from purchasers of notes in the offering in privately negotiated transactions with or through one of the initial purchasers or its affiliate concurrently with the pricing of the offering (the “share repurchases”) at a purchase price per share of Tandem’s common stock equal to the closing price per share of Tandem’s common stock on March 5, 2024, which was $27.105 per share. These share repurchases could increase, or reduce the size of any decrease in, the market price of Tandem’s common stock, including concurrently with the pricing of the notes, and could have resulted in a higher effective conversion price for the notes. This press release is not an offer to repurchase Tandem’s common stock, and the offering of the notes is not contingent upon the repurchase of Tandem’s common stock. The notes and any shares of Tandem’s common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, any state securities laws or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and other applicable securities laws. This press release is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any of these securities nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification thereof under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.

The study indicates enhanced pancreatic islet function with no serious adverse events. The Expansion Phase is enrolling patients for extended treatment periods, aiming to deepen the drug's impact. Biomea plans to present further data at the Q4 2023 Earnings Release. Positive None. Negative None. Endocrinologist The data indicating that BMF-219 may lead to durable glycemic control and potentially enhance pancreatic islet function is of particular interest from an endocrinological perspective. In type 2 diabetes, progressive beta-cell failure and reduced insulin sensitivity are the central pathophysiological components. A therapeutic that sustains glycemic control post-treatment suggests a potential shift in the disease's natural history. This could mean a reduction in the need for chronic medication, lessening the burden on patients and the healthcare system. However, the long-term effects and safety profile will need continued monitoring, especially since diabetes management requires a balance to avoid hypoglycemia, a common risk with diabetes treatments. Medical Research Analyst An analysis of the pharmacokinetic data and biomarkers such as HbA1c, HOMA-B and C-peptide is crucial to understanding the drug's efficacy and mechanism. BMF-219's ability to proliferate beta cells could represent a significant breakthrough in diabetes treatment, addressing a root cause rather than just managing symptoms. The selection of 100mg and 200mg dose levels for the Expansion Phase indicates a positive dose-response relationship observed during the Escalation Phase. However, it is essential to note that these findings are preliminary and the long-term safety and efficacy data, expected in the second half of 2024, will be pivotal for regulatory approval and commercial viability. Biotech Market Analyst From a market perspective, the progress of COVALENT-111's clinical trials and the anticipation of COVALENT-112 study updates could impact Biomea Fusion's stock performance. Investors often react to clinical trial milestones, especially when a novel mechanism of action is involved that could disrupt current treatment paradigms. The lack of serious adverse events reported is a positive signal for investor confidence. However, the true market potential of BMF-219 hinges on the completion of the Expansion Phase and subsequent regulatory approval. The diabetes treatment market is highly competitive and Biomea's success will depend on demonstrating clear advantages over existing therapies. 03/06/2024 - 03:04 AM Three Clinical Data Sets from the Dose Escalation Phase of COVALENT-111 to be Presented at the 17th Annual ATTD Conference Highlighting BMF-219’s Novel Mechanism of Action in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Patients in COVALENT-111 are displaying improved glycemic control while off therapy out to Week 26 following the 28-day treatment with BMF-219, supporting enhanced pancreatic islet function as the mechanism of actionBMF-219 was generally well tolerated with no serious adverse events and no adverse event-related study discontinuations, and no symptomatic or clinically significant hypoglycemia100mg and 200mg dose levels have been selected for the first 3 Arms of the Expansion Phase, which will dose patients up to 12 weeks (compared to 4 weeks in the Escalation Phase) and extended follow-up to Week 52The Expansion Phase of COVALENT-111 is currently enrolling on schedule with initial 26-week data expected during 2H24Biomea Fusion to announce an update on the first two patients with Type 1 Diabetes, from the COVALENT-112 Study, in the Q4 2023 Earnings Release REDWOOD CITY, Calif., March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biomea Fusion, Inc. (“Biomea”) (Nasdaq: BMEA), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering and developing oral covalent small molecules to treat and improve the lives of patients with metabolic diseases and genetically defined cancers, today announced three poster presentations presenting long-term 26 week follow-up data from patients treated with BMF-219, enrolled in the escalation portion of the ongoing Phase II clinical study (COVALENT-111), at the 17th International Conference on Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes (ATTD) taking place in Florence, Italy from March 6-9, 2024. This clinical data from all dosing cohorts initiated to date as of February 12, 2024 from the Escalation Phase of COVALENT-111 will be featured during a Poster Discussion Presentation and two Poster Viewing Presentations at ATTD. Biomea will showcase the following three e-poster presentations: Durable Glycemic Control with BMF-219 During Off-Treatment Period at Week 26: A Phase 1/2 Trial of BMF-219 in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes (COVALENT-111) (Poster Discussion Session, March 7th, 10-10:30 am CET.)Case Studies from COVALENT-111, A Phase 1/2 Trial of BMF-219, a Covalent Menin Inhibitor, in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes (Poster Viewing Session)Key Observations from the Dose Escalation Portion of COVALENT-111, a Phase 1/2 Trial of the Covalent Menin Inhibitor BMF-219 in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes (Poster Viewing Session) All e-Posters will be available for viewing through the conference virtual platform once the conference commences. Please find a link here to our website where the poster presentations and discussion will be available. “We aim to cure diabetes and believe we are on the path to do so. Notably, after receiving a short, 4-week course of BMF-219, patients with type 2 diabetes are displaying durable glycemic control, and in some cases displaying continued improvement in glycemic control while off therapy. The Escalation Phase of our first in human study was quite successful, generating strong clinical data with a novel mechanism of action and importantly providing us with proof-of-concept data to support the design of the Expansion Phase which is now enrolling. The Expansion Phase will dose patients for longer treatment periods with the goal of broadening and deepening BMF-219’s effect across the type 2 patient population. As presented at the ATTD conference, we believe the observations from biomarkers including HbA1c, HOMA-B, and C-peptide analysis for responders vs. non-responders, together with pharmacokinetic dose response data all point to strong evidence that BMF-219 is specifically proliferating beta cells in pancreatic islets of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes patients,” said Thomas Butler, Biomea Fusion’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. “I am also excited about the potential this pathway may provide patients with type 1 diabetes. We are enrolling our open label arm (n=40) of our Phase II COVALENT-112 study in adults with stage 3 type 1 diabetes first which will give us initial response data before embarking on a larger, potentially registrational study.” Data Highlights from ATTD Presentations Efficacy Findings Patients in COVALENT-111 are displaying improved glycemic control while off therapy, supporting improved pancreatic function following BMF-219 treatment. Patients who demonstrated the greatest HbA1c reduction at Week 26 (22 weeks off treatment), had the greatest improvement in beta cell function as measured by HOMA-B and C-peptide.In patients failing current standard of care medications, at Week 26, following a 28 day dose cycle of BMF-219, a general dose response was observed with placebo adjusted mean percent changes of HbA1c of -0.04% (50mg QD*), -0.2% (100mg QD with food), -0.8% (100mg), -0.4% (200mg QD), -0.4% (100mg BID), and -1.4% (200mg with food) (*50mg data out to Week 20, latest data cut).The efficacy seen in the 200mg with food cohort is highlighting the direct benefits of an enhanced PD effect with higher blood glucose and higher exposure, as seen in the human islet studies with BMF-219 (presented at WCIRD Dec. 2023).A higher proportion of patients treated with 200mg QD achieved a clinically significant reduction in HbA1c compared to 100mg QD dosing. A durable glycemic response (≥1.0% HbA1C reduction) was seen in 20% and 36% of patients in once daily 100 mg and 200 mg cohorts, respectively.Across 100mg QD, 200mg QD, and 100mg BID cohorts (N=40), 38% of patients had ≥0.5% HbA1c reduction (with a mean HbA1c reduction of 1.2%), and 23% of patients had ≥1.0% HbA1c reduction (with a mean HbA1c reduction of 1.5%) at Week 26.Patients with >7 years duration of diabetes and failing dual- or triple-agent therapy (including GLP1 RA and/or SGLT2i) (n=2) also demonstrated improved glycemic control (HbA1c -0.4%, -1.1%, and -1.1% at Weeks 4, 12, and 26, respectively) with BMF-219 dosed at 200mg with food.Increase in HOMA-B and C-peptide generally correlated with glycemic control, consistent with BMF-219's core mechanism of action: beta-cell proliferation and improved beta-cell function. Safety and Tolerability Findings BMF-219 was generally well tolerated with no serious adverse events and no adverse event-related study discontinuations, and no symptomatic or clinically significant hypoglycemia. Next Steps The Expansion Phase of COVALENT-111 is designed to further explore BMF-219’s potential for long-term glycemic control by dosing BMF-219 for up to 12 weeks at various dosing levels with follow-up of 26 and 52 weeks. The Expansion Phase is currently enrolling on schedule with initial data expected in the second half of 2024.A PK study further assessing the optimal use of BMF-219 to ensure minimal variability of exposure is currently under way.Biomea is currently awaiting the read out and analysis of an additional 400 mg cohort, which will also help inform further inclusion into the Expansion Phase. About COVALENT-111 COVALENT-111 is a multi-site, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase I/II study. In the completed Phase I portion of the trial, healthy patients were enrolled in single ascending dose cohorts to evaluate safety at the prospective dosing levels for type 2 diabetic patients. Phase II consists of multiple ascending dose cohorts and includes adult patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled by standard of care medicines. Once the Escalation Phase of COVALENT-111 completes, the study advances into an Expansion Phase (n>200) consisting of multiple cohorts dosing type 2 diabetes patients for longer dose durations. Additional information about the Phase I/II clinical trial of BMF-219 in type 2 diabetes can be found at ClinicalTrials.gov using the identifier NCT05731544. About COVALENT-112 COVALENT-112 is a multi-site, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II study in adults with stage 3 type 1 diabetes. This stage describes the period following clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes when symptoms are present due to significant beta cell loss. COVALENT-112 will be a multi-arm trial comparing two different doses of BMF-219 to placebo control (1:1:1) to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of BMF-219 in persons with type 1 diabetes. Approximately 150 patients will be enrolled in the trial and will receive either BMF-219 or placebo for 12 weeks, followed by a 40 week “off-treatment” period. This trial will also include an open label portion for adults with type 1 diabetes up to 15 years since diagnosis. The open label portion (n=40) will examine the safety, efficacy, and durability of BMF-219 at two oral dose levels, 100 mg and 200 mg for 12-weeks of treatment followed by a 40 week off-treatment period. Additional information about the Phase II clinical trial of BMF-219 in type 1 diabetes can be found at ClinicalTrials.gov using the identifier NCT06152042. About Menin’s Role in Diabetes Loss of functional beta cell mass is a core component of the natural history in both types of diabetes — type 1 diabetes (mediated by autoimmune dysfunction) and type 2 diabetes (mediated by metabolic dysfunction). Beta cells are found in the pancreas and are responsible for the synthesis and secretion of insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the body use glucose for energy and helps control blood glucose levels. In patients with diabetes, beta cell mass and function have been observed to be diminished, leading to insufficient insulin secretion and hyperglycemia. Menin is thought to act as a brake on beta-cell turnover and growth, supporting the notion that inhibition of menin could lead to the regeneration of normal, healthy beta cells. Based on these and other scientific findings, Biomea is exploring the potential for BMF-219-mediated menin inhibition as a viable therapeutic approach to potentially halt or reverse progression of type 2 diabetes. About Type 2 Diabetes Diabetes is considered a chronic health condition that affects how the body turns food into energy and results in too much sugar in the bloodstream. Over time, this can cause serious health problems and damage vital organs. Most people with diabetes have a shorter life expectancy than people without this disease. The CDC estimates about 2 in 5 of the adult population in the USA are now expected to develop diabetes during their lifetime. More than 37 million people of all ages (about 11% of the US population) have diabetes today. 96 million adults (more than 1 in 3) have pre-diabetes, blood sugars that are higher than normal but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. Diabetes is also one of the largest economic burdens on the United States health care system with $1 out of every $4 in US health care costs being spent on caring for people with diabetes. Despite the current availability of many diabetes medications, there remains a significant need in the treatment and care of patients with diabetes.

Calliditas announces an additional seven year orphan drug exclusivity period for TARPEYO®,2024-03-06T07:34:00.000Z,Neutral,Positive,"Calliditas Therapeutics AB (Nasdaq: CALT) has received a seven-year orphan drug exclusivity period for TARPEYO®, expiring in December 2030, after obtaining full approval for a new indication to reduce kidney function loss in adults with primary IgAN. The exclusivity covers all adult patients with primary IgAN at risk of disease progression, reflecting a clinical benefit on kidney function.","Calliditas announces an additional seven year orphan drug exclusivity period for TARPEYO® Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Calliditas Therapeutics AB (Nasdaq: CALT) has received a seven-year orphan drug exclusivity period for TARPEYO®, expiring in December 2030, after obtaining full approval for a new indication to reduce kidney function loss in adults with primary IgAN. The exclusivity covers all adult patients with primary IgAN at risk of disease progression, reflecting a clinical benefit on kidney function. Positive None. Negative None. Pharmaceutical Industry Analyst The FDA's granting of a seven-year orphan drug exclusivity period to Calliditas Therapeutics for TARPEYO® is a significant milestone for the company. This exclusivity, which prevents other companies from marketing generic versions of TARPEYO® for the same indication, effectively grants Calliditas a temporary monopoly in the U.S. market for treating primary immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), a rare kidney disease. This is particularly notable given that IgAN can lead to end-stage renal disease and limited treatment options are currently available.The extended market exclusivity until December 2030 provides Calliditas with a prolonged period to capitalize on their investment in developing TARPEYO® without competition, which could lead to increased revenue streams. It is also a positive signal to investors, as the exclusivity period provides a clearer projection of the potential return on investment. The company's share price may respond favorably to this news, as market exclusivity is a strong driver of pharmaceutical stock valuations. Medical Research Analyst The orphan drug status is granted to drugs that treat rare diseases affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. TARPEYO®'s designation as such indicates the unmet medical need in the treatment of IgAN. The drug's ability to reduce the loss of kidney function in adults at risk of disease progression addresses a critical therapeutic gap. The clinical benefit on kidney function for adult patients with primary IgAN, as confirmed by the reduction of kidney loss, underscores the drug's potential impact on patient health outcomes and quality of life.From a research perspective, the exclusivity period also incentivizes continued investment in orphan drugs, which is crucial for innovation in the treatment of rare diseases. For stakeholders, particularly patients and healthcare providers, the news is reassuring as it ensures continued access to a clinically beneficial treatment without the immediate threat of generic competition. Healthcare Economist Orphan drug exclusivity has economic implications for both the healthcare system and patients. While it encourages pharmaceutical companies to invest in treatments for rare diseases by offering a period of market exclusivity, it also means that the drug's price is likely to remain high due to lack of competition. This can impact healthcare costs, especially for a condition like IgAN that requires long-term management.In the short-term, the exclusivity is beneficial for Calliditas as it secures a stable market share and allows for cost recovery and potential profit maximization. However, in the long-term, the healthcare system and patients would benefit from the introduction of generics, which typically lead to reduced drug prices. It will be important to monitor how the exclusivity period affects access to TARPEYO® for patients, particularly in terms of insurance coverage and out-of-pocket costs. 03/06/2024 - 02:34 AM STOCKHOLM, March 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Calliditas Therapeutics AB (Nasdaq: CALT) (Nasdaq Stockholm: CALTX) ('Calliditas') today announced that the FDA has granted an orphan drug exclusivity period of seven years for TARPEYO®, expiring in December 2030 based on when the company obtained full approval with a new indication for this drug product. Following full approval in December 2023, TARPEYO® (budesonide) is indicated 'to reduce the loss of kidney function in adults with primary immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) who are at risk for disease progression'. The exclusivity period reflects the new indication covering all adult patients with primary IgAN at risk of disease progression based on a confirmed reduction of kidney loss reflecting a clinical benefit on kidney function for adult patients with primary IgAN. ""We are delighted to have seven years of market exclusivity expiring in December 2030 for TARPEYO in the US, reflecting the new indication based on the long-term data generated,"" said CEO Renée Aguiar-Lucander.

The Company maintained a consistent average hashrate of 4.06 EH/s and successfully mined 200 Bitcoin in February. HIVE also expanded its mining capacity by 9% to 4.2 EH/s, aligning with its strategic HODL approach to anticipate increased Bitcoin demand. Executive Chairman Frank Holmes and President & CEO Aydin Kilic highlighted the Company's strategic foresight, technological advancements, and operational excellence. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The increased Bitcoin holdings and HODL position reported by HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. represent a strategic maneuver in anticipation of the upcoming Bitcoin Halving event, which historically influences Bitcoin's price due to the reduction in the block reward for miners. The 10% increase in Bitcoin holdings is a significant move, especially considering the high volatility in the cryptocurrency market. The company's operational efficiency, as demonstrated by the average daily production of 6.9 BTC, indicates a robust mining infrastructure, which is crucial for maintaining profitability amidst fluctuating Bitcoin prices.Investors should note the correlation between HIVE's stock performance and Bitcoin's price volatility. As the company holds a substantial amount of Bitcoin, its balance sheet is directly impacted by cryptocurrency market movements. The strategic increase in the HODL position could potentially lead to larger gains if the price of Bitcoin appreciates post-Halving, but it also exposes the company to higher risk if the price were to decline. The decision to expand ASIC mining capacity by 9% reflects a commitment to growth and could contribute to increased revenue, assuming stable or rising Bitcoin prices. Market Research Analyst HIVE's focus on green energy-powered blockchain infrastructure places it in a favorable position within the ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) trend that is increasingly influencing investment decisions. The integration of advanced Bitmain S21 Antminers is likely to enhance HIVE's competitive edge by reducing production costs and improving energy efficiency. This technological advancement is significant, as it can lead to lower operational costs and higher margins.Furthermore, the timing of HIVE's announcement, just before the Bitcoin Halving event, is strategic as it may attract investor attention towards the company's stock. The increased mining capacity and HODL strategy suggest that HIVE is preparing for long-term growth, which could be appealing to investors looking for exposure to the blockchain sector with a focus on sustainability. The expansion of data center facilities across multiple countries also diversifies operational risks and may contribute to a more stable performance in the face of regional regulatory changes or energy price fluctuations. Cryptocurrency Expert The Bitcoin Halving event is a fundamental aspect of Bitcoin's design, intended to control inflation by halving the reward for mining new blocks. This event typically leads to increased market attention and speculation, which can cause significant price swings. HIVE's strategy to increase its HODL position indicates a bullish outlook on the post-Halving market conditions. However, this strategy also increases the company's exposure to the inherent risks of cryptocurrency volatility.Additionally, HIVE's reported average of 60.5 Bitcoin mined per Exahash is an important metric for investors to consider, as it reflects the company's mining efficiency relative to the global Bitcoin network's total computational power. The company's operational excellence, as demonstrated by its consistent average hashrate and increased ASIC mining capacity, suggests that it is well-equipped to compete in the high-stakes mining landscape. Nonetheless, investors should be mindful of the high correlation between HIVE's operational success and Bitcoin's market performance, which can lead to amplified price movements in the company's stock. 03/06/2024 - 01:00 AM This news release constitutes a ""designated news release"" for the purposes of the Company's amended and restated prospectus supplement dated August 17, 2023, to its short form base shelf prospectus dated May 1, 2023.Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - March 6, 2024) - HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. (TSXV: HIVE) (NASDAQ: HIVE) (FSE: YO0) (the ""Company"" or ""HIVE"") a pioneer in green energy-powered blockchain infrastructure, proudly announces its unaudited production figures for February 2024. The Company has increased its Bitcoin holdings by 10% and its HODL position at month end was 2,131 Bitcoin on its balance sheet. The Company has maintained over 4.06 Exahash (""EH/s"") of Bitcoin mining capacity on average for February 2024.February 2024 Highlights:Production: HIVE successfully mined 200 Bitcoin in February 2024, utilizing its state-of-the-art ASIC and GPU mining operations. This achievement represents an impressive average of 60.5 Bitcoin per Exahash, with a consistent average hashrate of 4.06 EH/s throughout the month.Daily Production: The Company averaged a production of 6.9 BTC per day, underscoring its operational efficiency and robust mining capabilities.Mining Capacity Increase: HIVE concluded February with a 4.2 EH/s ASIC mining capacity, reflecting a notable 9% increase month over month. The Company's HODL position at the end of February 2024 was 2,131 BTC, which was a 10% increase from the prior month.Strategic HODL Increase:As of March 4, 2024, HIVE's HODL position increased further to 2,159 Bitcoin, up from 2,131 BTC at the end of February 2024.This continuing increase aligns with the Company's strategy to strive to HODL, anticipating heightened demand for Bitcoin due to the adoption of Bitcoin as an alternative asset class as witnessed with stunning fund flows into the recent launching of Bitcoin ETF's. We believe as we approach the Halving event in April, the short-term volatility will remain high, and investors must be aware that HIVE like our peers are usually correlated with Bitcoin but with a greater amplitude in price volatility.Executive Insights:Frank Holmes, Executive Chairman, emphasized HIVE's strategic foresight, stating, ""Our HODL strategy is to have a healthy balance sheet similar to what we had for the last Halving event in 2020.""Technological Advancements:Aydin Kilic, President & CEO, highlighted the Company's technological stability with the integration of Bitmain S21 Antminers into its mining fleet. ""These advanced machines not only bolster our mining efficiency but also provide sustainable stability by significantly reducing the cost of Bitcoin production,"" Kilic noted.Operational Excellence and Future Outlook:HIVE remains at the forefront of the blockchain technology sector, continuously enhancing its mining efficiency and expanding its green energy-powered data center facilities across Canada, Sweden, and Iceland.

Dr. Sonia Quaratino and Dr. Lorenzo Falchi express optimism about IPH6501's potential in treating refractory B-cell NHL. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The initiation of a Phase 1/2 trial for IPH6501, a novel CD20-targeting tetraspecific natural killer cell engager, marks a significant advancement in the therapeutic landscape for B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas (NHL). This therapy introduces a new mechanism of action by not only targeting the malignant B cells but also engaging multiple receptors on natural killer (NK) cells, which are a critical component of the innate immune system. By co-engaging CD20 on B cells and activating NK cells, IPH6501 could potentially overcome resistance mechanisms that have limited the efficacy of existing treatments.Furthermore, the addition of an interleukin-2 (IL-2) variant to this therapy is a strategic move to enhance NK cell proliferation and cytotoxic activity without the adverse effects associated with the alpha subunit of the IL-2 receptor. This could mean a more favorable safety profile and improved tolerability for patients. As an oncologist, the potential for IPH6501 to provide a more targeted and potent immune response is promising, particularly for patients who have relapsed or are refractory to current therapies. Medical Research Analyst The clinical development of IPH6501 from Innate Pharma's ANKET® platform is a noteworthy event for investors monitoring the biotechnology sector. As a first-in-class therapy, IPH6501's success or failure in clinical trials could significantly influence Innate Pharma's market valuation and the stock's performance. The planned enrollment of up to 184 patients will provide a substantial data set to assess the drug's safety and efficacy.From a research perspective, the innovative tetraspecific approach, which allows for simultaneous targeting and activation of multiple immune pathways, is a differentiator that could set IPH6501 apart from monospecific and bispecific antibodies currently in use or development. If trial results are positive, IPH6501 could capture a significant portion of the NHL treatment market, addressing an unmet need for patients with relapsed or refractory disease. This would likely have a positive impact on Innate Pharma's revenue streams and strategic positioning within the industry. Market Research Analyst Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma represents a market with a continuous need for innovative treatments, particularly for patients who do not respond to existing therapies. The introduction of IPH6501 into clinical trials is a strategic move by Innate Pharma to tap into this demand. As a market research analyst, it is important to note that the success of such a novel therapeutic could disrupt the current market dynamics by providing an alternative to T cell therapies, which have been the focus of much recent investment.Given the high cost of cancer treatments and the potential for improved outcomes with IPH6501, healthcare providers and payers will be closely watching the clinical progress of this drug. A successful trial could lead to rapid adoption and significant market share gains, provided the cost-benefit ratio is favorable. Conversely, any setbacks in the trial could have a negative impact on the perceived value of Innate Pharma's pipeline and its attractiveness to potential partners or acquirers. 03/06/2024 - 01:00 AM Phase 1/2 study is evaluating IPH6501, a first-in-class CD20-targeting tetraspecific natural killer cell engager, from ANKET® platform, for the treatment of CD20-expressing B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas. MARSEILLE, France--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News: Innate Pharma SA (Euronext Paris: IPH; Nasdaq: IPHA) (“Innate” or the “Company”) today announced the first patient was dosed in its Phase 1/2 multicenter trial (NCT06088654), investigating the safety and tolerability of IPH6501 in patients with Relapsed and/or Refractory CD20-expressing B-cell Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL). IPH6501 is Innate’s first-in-class CD20-targeting tetraspecific ANKET® (Antibody-based NK cell Engager Therapeutics) that co-engages CD20 as a target antigen on malignant B cells and three receptors on NK cells: two activating receptors (NKp46 and CD16) and the interleukin-2 receptor (but not its alpha subunit), with a human IL‑2 variant, hence providing proliferation and activation signals targeted to NK cells and promoting their cytotoxic activity against CD20 expressing malignant cells. The study is planned to enroll up to 184 patients. “We are pleased to announce the dosing of a first patient in this Phase 1/2 study evaluating IPH6501, our proprietary ANKET® asset and the first tetraspecific NK Cell Engager to enter the clinic.” commented Dr Sonia Quaratino, Chief Medical Officer at Innate Pharma. “With the addition of the IL-2 variant, our second generation ANKET® molecules can deliver proliferation signals to NK cells, and thus enhance their effector functions against cancer cells. Thanks to this novel format, IPH6501 represents a promising alternative strategy to T cell therapies for patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas.” “The discovery and implementation of novel chemotherapies, T-cell based immunotherapies and targeted therapies have improved outcomes for patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas compared with traditional chemotherapy.” added Dr Lorenzo Falchi, Lymphoma Specialist at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New-York, and principal investigator of the study. “However, many patients fail to achieve a response to or develop disease relapse after treatment. In this context, IPH6501 represents an innovative option for the treatment of patients with R/R B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas and has the potential to fulfil a large unmet need.” More information about the trial can be found on clinicaltrials.gov. About B-Cell Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma B-cell lymphomas are clonal tumors of mature and immature B cells that constitute the majority (80-85%) of NHLs. NHLs are a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative malignancies. NHL usually originates in the lymphoid tissues and can spread to other organs. NHL is the most common hematological malignancy worldwide, accounting for nearly 3% of cancer diagnoses and deaths. According to the latest World Health Organization (WHO) classification, the most common B-NHL in Western countries is Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), accounting for around 31% of adult cases. Other common aggressive B-cell subtypes include Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) (6% of cases) and Burkitt lymphoma (BL) (2% of cases). Among indolent B-cell NHL, Follicular Lymphoma (FL) accounts for 22% of cases in the Western world, followed by marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) (8% of cases). About IPH6501 IPH6501 is the first Antibody-based NK cell Engager Therapeutic to co-engage activating receptors on NK cells (NKp46 and CD16), IL-2R (but not α subunit) through a variant of human IL-2, and a tumor antigen (CD20) via a single molecule, hence providing proliferation and activation signals targeted to NK cells and promoting their cytotoxic activity against CD20 expressing malignant cells. IPH6501 has shown better anti-tumor efficacy than approved benchmark antibodies in preclinical tumor models (Demaria, EHA 2023).

The offering is managed by top financial institutions and includes an option for additional shares. The Secondary Offering is set to close on March 8, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Viper Energy, Inc. of a secondary public offering of 11,500,000 shares by its parent company, Diamondback Energy, Inc., is a significant event that warrants a detailed financial analysis. The gross proceeds of approximately $402.5 million are substantial and the fact that Viper will not receive any proceeds from the sale is a critical detail. This offering could indicate Diamondback's strategic financial management, potentially to bolster its balance sheet or reinvest in other areas of its business. The secondary offering could dilute existing shareholders' value, but it may also provide Diamondback with capital to pursue growth opportunities or debt reduction.Moreover, the underwriters' 30-day option to purchase an additional 1,725,000 shares could further impact the stock's market price, depending on the demand and overall market conditions. The involvement of prominent financial institutions as joint book-running managers and co-managers suggests a strong interest in the offering, possibly reflecting confidence in Viper's market position and future prospects.Investors should closely monitor the stock's performance post-offering, as the influx of new shares could temporarily affect its price. Additionally, the use of an automatic shelf registration statement indicates a pre-planned financing strategy, allowing for a quicker response to market conditions and financing opportunities. Market Research Analyst The secondary offering of Viper Energy's Class A common stock by Diamondback Energy provides an opportunity to assess the market's perception of the energy sector, particularly the oil and gas industry. The timing and size of the offering may reflect Diamondback's market outlook and its assessment of Viper's valuation. If the offering is well-received, it could suggest investor confidence in the sector's resilience or growth potential amidst fluctuating energy prices and evolving regulatory landscapes.Analyzing the sector's performance relative to the broader stock market and considering geopolitical factors, supply-demand dynamics and technological advancements in energy extraction and sustainability will be essential. This offering could also serve as a bellwether for other energy companies considering similar capital-raising activities, providing insights into investor appetite for energy stocks.It is also important to consider the potential impact on Viper's operational strategy, as the parent company's decision to sell shares might be part of a broader portfolio realignment or a shift in focus towards other projects or subsidiaries within Diamondback's portfolio. 03/05/2024 - 09:58 PM MIDLAND, Texas, March 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Viper Energy, Inc.

The offering includes an option for underwriters to purchase additional shares. Positive BridgeBio Pharma, Inc. announced a public offering of 8,620,690 shares of its common stock at a price of $29.00 per share.

Underwriters have the option to buy an additional 1,293,103 shares of common stock under the same terms. J.P. Morgan, Cantor, and Mizuho are the joint book-running managers, with Raymond James as the lead manager for the offering. The offering is anticipated to close on or around the specified date. Negative None. Financial Analyst The public offering of 8,620,690 shares by BridgeBio Pharma at a price of $29.00 per share represents a significant capital infusion for the company, with potential gross proceeds of approximately $250 million. This capital raise is a strategic move to bolster the company's balance sheet, potentially funding ongoing research and development (R&D) activities, commercialization efforts and possibly facilitating future strategic acquisitions or partnerships.Investors should note that the offering price can often reflect the current market's valuation of the company. The pricing at $29.00 per share may suggest investor confidence in BridgeBio's future prospects or a need for the company to offer a discount to the market price to attract sufficient interest. The underwriters' option for an additional 1,293,103 shares also indicates a potential for over-allotment, which could lead to dilution of existing shares but also provide additional capital if exercised.It's important to consider the company's current financial health, including cash reserves and burn rate, as these factors will influence the necessity and impact of the capital raise. The involvement of reputable financial institutions as book-running managers and lead manager can be seen as a positive signal, potentially indicating a well-managed offering process. Market Research Analyst The biopharmaceutical sector is highly competitive, with significant capital requirements for R&D and lengthy regulatory approval processes. BridgeBio's focus on genetic diseases and cancers places it in a high-growth potential market but also in one that is research-intensive and risky. The successful pricing of a public offering can be an indicator of market sentiment towards the company's pipeline and future revenue streams.Market response to such offerings can be mixed, depending on the perceived use of proceeds and the company's track record. If BridgeBio has a promising drug pipeline or recent successful drug approvals, the offering could be seen as a way to accelerate growth. Conversely, if the company is facing challenges or delays in its pipeline, the market could view the offering as a necessity to keep operations afloat, which may affect the stock performance negatively in the short term.Long-term implications for stakeholders include the potential for share dilution but also the opportunity for the company to achieve milestones that could drive up the stock price. The offering's timing and size relative to the company's market capitalization should be considered by investors when evaluating its potential impact. Biotech Industry Analyst BridgeBio's public offering is a common financial strategy in the biotech industry, where companies often rely on public markets to raise capital due to the high costs associated with drug development. The specifics of the offering, such as the number of shares and the price, provide insight into the company's valuation and the appetite of public investors for biotech stocks.Analyzing the company's recent R&D milestones, drug pipeline status and any strategic partnerships will be critical in understanding the potential return on investment from this capital raise. Investors often look for a balance between a company's short-term financial needs and its long-term growth prospects. BridgeBio's decision to sell all of the shares in the offering, instead of including secondary shares from existing shareholders, suggests that the proceeds are intended for corporate purposes rather than providing an exit for early investors.The biotech sector is subject to rapid changes due to technological advances and regulatory decisions. Thus, the success of BridgeBio's public offering and subsequent stock performance will likely be influenced by the company's ability to navigate these dynamics and effectively deploy the raised capital towards value-generating activities. 03/05/2024 - 11:53 PM PALO ALTO, Calif., March 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.

Prices $750 Million Convertible Senior Notes Offering Due 2029 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary SoFi Technologies, Inc. announces pricing of $750 million convertible senior notes due 2029 in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The issuance of $750 million in 1.25% convertible senior notes due 2029 by SoFi Technologies, Inc. represents a significant capital-raising activity that warrants attention from investors and market analysts. Convertible notes are a form of debt that can be converted into equity, typically stock, at a later date under specified conditions, which can dilute existing shareholders but also provide financing without immediately impacting the company's equity structure.This financing strategy can be indicative of a company looking to leverage its growth prospects without resorting to equity financing that could be more dilutive at present. It's crucial to assess the potential impact on SoFi's balance sheet and interest expenses, as well as the implied confidence of institutional investors who are the target buyers of such securities. The relatively low interest rate of 1.25% suggests a favorable view of SoFi's creditworthiness, but also reflects the current low-yield environment.Furthermore, the option for initial purchasers to acquire an additional $112.5 million of notes suggests the potential for over-subscription, which could indicate strong market demand for SoFi's debt. This additional capital could provide SoFi with more flexibility to invest in strategic initiatives or pay off existing debts. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the announcement of convertible notes by SoFi may signal strategic moves that could affect the company's stock performance. Investors often view convertible debt as a precursor to growth initiatives that could either significantly enhance the company's market position or increase financial risk due to the added debt burden.Analyzing the terms of the conversion, such as the conversion rate and any associated caps or floors, is essential as these terms will determine the potential for equity dilution and the attractiveness of the notes to investors. The impact on SoFi's stock could be nuanced, as the market weighs the benefits of the capital raise against the potential for future dilution and interest payment obligations.It's also important to consider the broader industry context, including competitive dynamics and interest rate environment, as these factors can influence investor sentiment towards such financial instruments. The tech and fintech sectors, where SoFi operates, are particularly sensitive to capital structure decisions due to the high growth and high volatility nature of these markets. Legal Expert The private offering of convertible notes is subject to specific regulatory conditions, such as Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. This rule allows for the sale of securities primarily to qualified institutional buyers, which is a category of investors that includes banks, insurance companies and investment funds, among others, that manage a substantial amount of securities.The choice of a private offering and the reliance on Rule 144A can be seen as a way to streamline the capital-raising process by limiting the offering to sophisticated investors. This approach can reduce the regulatory burden and expedite access to capital, but also limits the pool of potential investors, which might affect the liquidity and marketability of the notes.Understanding the legal framework and the reasons behind choosing such a financing route is crucial for stakeholders. It provides insights into the company's strategic financial planning and its approach to regulatory compliance and investor relations. 03/05/2024 - 09:23 PM SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- SoFi Technologies, Inc. (“SoFi”) (NASDAQ: SOFI) today announced that it priced its private offering of 1.25% convertible senior notes due 2029 (the “notes”) in an aggregate principal amount of $750 million. The notes will be sold in a private offering only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). SoFi also granted the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase, for settlement within a period of 13 days from, and including, the date notes are first issued, up to an additional $112.5 million aggregate principal amount of notes. The issuance and sale of the notes is scheduled to settle on or about March 8, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. The notes will be unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of SoFi and will accrue interest at a rate of 1.25% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2024. The notes will mature on March 15, 2029, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Noteholders will have the right to convert their notes prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 15, 2028 only under certain circumstances and during certain periods, and irrespective of those circumstances, will be convertible by the noteholders on or after September 15, 2028 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding March 15, 2029. The initial conversion rate will be 105.8089 shares of SoFi’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $9.45 per share of SoFi’s common stock, which represents a premium of approximately 30% over the last reported sale of $7.27 per share of SoFi’s common stock on March 5, 2024), subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Upon conversion, SoFi will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash and, if applicable shares of SoFi’s common stock, based on the applicable conversion rate. The notes will also be redeemable, in whole or in part, for cash at SoFi’s option at any time, and from time to time, on or after March 15, 2027 and on or before the 30th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of SoFi’s common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for a specified period of time and certain liquidity conditions have been satisfied. The redemption price will be equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. In addition, in certain limited circumstances, noteholders may require SoFi to repurchase their notes for cash for a repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special and additional interest thereon to, but excluding, the applicable repurchase date. SoFi estimates that the net proceeds from the offering will be approximately $735 million (or approximately $845.3 million if the initial purchasers fully exercise their option to purchase additional notes), after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions and before the capped call transactions and offering expenses payable by SoFi. SoFi intends to use approximately $78.8 million of the net proceeds to fund the cost of entering into the capped call transactions described below. SoFi intends to use the remainder of the net proceeds from the offering, together with cash on hand (i) to pay fees, costs and expenses relating to this offering and related transactions, (ii) to redeem its 12.5% Series 1 Preferred Stock and (iii) for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of higher cost indebtedness. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, then SoFi intends to use a portion of the additional net proceeds to fund the cost of entering into additional capped call transactions as described below. In connection with the pricing of the notes, SoFi entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers or their affiliates and/or other financial institutions (the “option counterparties”). The capped call transactions will cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of SoFi’s common stock that initially underlie the notes. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, SoFi expects to enter into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to SoFi’s common stock upon any conversion of the notes and/or, at SoFi’s election and subject to certain conditions, offset any potential cash payments SoFi is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. The cap price of the capped call transactions will initially be $14.54 per share, which represents a premium of 100% over the last reported sale price of SoFi’s common stock of $7.27 per share on March 5, 2024, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the capped call transactions. SoFi has been advised that, in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates expect to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to SoFi’s common stock and/or purchase shares of SoFi’s common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes, including with or from, as the case may be, certain investors in the notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of SoFi’s common stock or the notes at that time. In addition, SoFi has been advised that the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to SoFi’s common stock and/or purchasing or selling SoFi’s common stock or other securities in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so during the relevant valuation period under the capped call transactions or in connection with any repurchase, redemption, exchange or early conversion of the notes or any other date on which the notes are retired by SoFi, in each case, if SoFi exercises the relevant election to terminate a portion of the capped call transactions). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or decrease in the market price of SoFi’s common stock or the notes, which could affect a noteholder’s ability to convert the notes, and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of notes, it could affect the number of shares and value of the consideration that a noteholder will receive upon conversion of the notes. On March 4, 2024, in separate, privately negotiated transactions, SoFi entered into exchange agreements with a limited number of holders of its 0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the “2026 notes”) to exchange $600 million in aggregate principal amount of 2026 notes for an aggregate of approximately 61,713,287 shares of SoFi common stock (which estimate is based upon the closing share price of SoFi common stock on March 4, 2024). The final aggregate number of shares of SoFi common stock to be exchanged pursuant to such exchange agreements will be calculated based on the daily volume-weighted average price per share of SoFi common stock over a specified period. Following the completion of the offering, SoFi may engage in additional exchanges of, or SoFi may repurchase, its 2026 notes. Holders of the 2026 notes that participate in any of these exchanges or repurchases may purchase or sell shares of SoFi’s common stock in the open market to unwind any hedge positions they may have with respect to the 2026 notes or to hedge their exposure in connection with these transactions. These activities may adversely affect the trading price of SoFi’s common stock and the notes SoFi is offering. Moreover, market activities by holders of the 2026 notes that participate in the exchanges may impact the initial conversion price of the notes SoFi is offering. In connection with issuing the 2026 notes, SoFi entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the “existing capped call transactions”) with certain financial institutions (the “existing option counterparties”). In connection with exchanges by SoFi of its 2026 notes for shares of SoFi common stock discussed above, SoFi entered into agreements with one or more of the existing option counterparties to terminate a portion of these existing capped call transactions up to the notional amount corresponding to the amount of 2026 notes exchanged. In connection with the termination of any of these transactions, SoFi expects the existing option counterparties or their respective affiliates to unwind their related hedge positions, which may involve the sale of shares of SoFi’s common stock in the open market or other transactions with respect to SoFi’s common stock. This hedge unwind activity could offset or exacerbate the effects of the purchase, sale or other activity that holders of the 2026 notes that participate in the exchange or repurchase transactions may effect in connection with those transactions. The offer and sale of the notes and any shares of SoFi’s common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws. As a result, the notes and the shares of SoFi’s common stock, if any, issuable upon conversion of the notes will be subject to restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be offered, transferred or sold, except in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act or pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable securities laws. This press release does not and will not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, the notes, any shares of SoFi’s common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes, or any other securities, nor will there be any sale of the notes or any such shares or other securities, in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, sale or solicitation would be unlawful. Any offer will be made only by means of a private offering memorandum. About SoFi Technologies, Inc.

However, this should be weighed against the potential for the capital raised to accelerate the company's product development, which could lead to value creation in the long term. The underwriters' option for an additional 1.65 million shares adds a buffer that could further increase the proceeds, offering a vote of confidence from the underwriters in the company's prospects. Market Research Analyst Examining the broader market implications, Akero Therapeutics' public offering can be seen as a response to the high unmet medical need in the metabolic disease space. The significant amount of capital sought suggests confidence in their clinical-stage pipeline's potential. The pricing of the offering at $29.00 per share will be a key factor for institutional and retail investors, as it reflects the company's perceived value and growth potential within the biotech sector.It's important to consider market conditions and investor sentiment towards the biotech industry, which can be volatile and influenced by regulatory news, clinical trial outcomes and broader market trends. A successful offering could signal market optimism for therapeutic innovation in metabolic diseases, potentially influencing peer companies and sector investment patterns. Biotech Industry Analyst From an industry standpoint, Akero Therapeutics' move to raise capital through a public offering aligns with common practices among clinical-stage biotech firms, which often require substantial funding to advance their pipelines through costly clinical trials and towards commercialization. The focus on metabolic diseases, a field characterized by a high unmet medical need, positions the company in a potentially lucrative market.The decision to proceed with an offering at this time may reflect the company's internal assessments of their clinical data and the readiness to escalate operations. It's critical to assess how this influx of capital will enable Akero to advance its clinical programs and how it aligns with industry norms regarding the valuation of biotech firms at similar stages of development. 03/05/2024 - 09:13 PM SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., March 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Akero Therapeutics, Inc.

Financial Analyst The announcement by LivaNova PLC regarding the pricing of $300 million in convertible senior notes is a significant financial event that warrants analysis from a financial perspective. The interest rate of 2.50% per annum is particularly noteworthy, as it is indicative of the company's cost of borrowing. This rate must be compared to the current market rates and the company's risk profile to assess its attractiveness to investors. The option for initial purchasers to acquire an additional $45 million in notes could potentially increase the company's debt and impact its leverage ratios, which are critical metrics for evaluating a company's financial health.Furthermore, the conversion premium of approximately 32.5% above the last reported sale price of LivaNova's shares suggests a bullish outlook from the company on its stock performance. The cap price of the capped call transactions, set at a premium of 80%, also reflects this optimism. However, investors should be aware of the dilution risk associated with convertible notes, which can lead to a decrease in earnings per share if the notes are converted into equity. The capped call transactions aim to mitigate this dilution, but the effectiveness of such hedges should be scrutinized.Lastly, the repurchase of $230 million aggregate principal amount of the cash exchangeable senior notes for $270.5 million indicates a strategic move to manage the company's debt profile. The impact of this repurchase on the company's interest expenses and net income, as well as the timing and negotiated terms, are crucial factors for investors to consider. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the issuance of convertible notes by LivaNova PLC and the subsequent transactions can influence the company's stock market performance. The initial market reaction can be affected by the perceived use of proceeds, which in this case, is not explicitly stated, but could be inferred as general corporate purposes or refinancing existing debt. The timing of the settlement and the conditions for conversion are also pivotal in understanding the potential market impact.Moreover, the activities of the option counterparties, including the purchase of ordinary shares and derivative transactions, can lead to volatility in the stock price. The potential for these transactions to increase or decrease the market price of LivaNova's shares may affect investor sentiment and trading strategies. The repurchase of the cash exchangeable senior notes could be viewed as a positive signal, indicating the company's confidence in its financial position and its commitment to reducing higher-cost debt. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the issuance of convertible notes by LivaNova PLC is subject to securities regulation, specifically Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. This rule allows the sale of securities to qualified institutional buyers without the need for a public offering, which has implications for the liquidity and marketability of the notes. The terms of the notes, including the conversion conditions and the redemption options, are governed by contractual agreements that must adhere to securities laws and regulations.The capped call transactions are complex financial instruments that require careful legal structuring to ensure compliance with financial regulations and to accurately represent the interests of both the company and the option counterparties. Additionally, the repurchase of the cash exchangeable senior notes involves negotiations that must be legally sound and transparent to avoid any regulatory scrutiny or investor disputes. 03/05/2024 - 09:55 PM LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- LivaNova PLC (Nasdaq: LIVN), a market-leading medical technology company, today announced the pricing of $300 million aggregate principal amount of 2.50% convertible senior notes due 2029 (the “notes”) to be issued in a private offering only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). In addition, LivaNova has granted the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase, within a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the date on which the notes are first issued, up to an additional $45 million aggregate principal amount of the notes. The sale of the notes to the initial purchasers is expected to settle on March 8, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions, and is expected to result in approximately $289.3 million in net proceeds to LivaNova after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and estimated offering expenses payable by LivaNova (or $333.0 million if the initial purchasers’ option to purchase additional notes is exercised in full). The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of LivaNova. The notes will bear interest at a rate of 2.50% per year and interest will be payable semiannually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2024. Prior to December 15, 2028, the notes will be convertible only upon satisfaction of certain conditions. On or after December 15, 2028 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, the notes may be converted at any time. LivaNova will satisfy any conversion of notes by paying cash up to the aggregate principal amount of such notes being converted and paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, ordinary shares of LivaNova, or a combination of cash and ordinary shares, at LivaNova’s election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of LivaNova’s conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of such notes being converted. The initial conversion rate for the notes is 14.4085 ordinary shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $69.40 per share, which represents a conversion premium of approximately 32.5% to the last reported sale price of the ordinary shares on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on March 5, 2024). The notes will mature on March 15, 2029, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. LivaNova may redeem the notes at its option, on or after March 22, 2027, in whole or in part, if the last reported sale price of LivaNova’s ordinary shares has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which LivaNova provides notice of redemption. The redemption price will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. LivaNova may also redeem the notes at its option, at any time, in whole but not in part, upon the occurrence of certain tax-related events. In connection with the pricing of the notes, LivaNova entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain of the initial purchasers in the notes offering or their respective affiliates and certain other financial institutions (the “option counterparties”) having an expiration date that is the same as the maturity date of the notes. The capped call transactions will cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the notes, the number of LivaNova’s ordinary shares underlying the notes and are expected generally to compensate (through the payment of cash to LivaNova) for potential dilution to LivaNova’s ordinary shares upon conversion of the notes and to offset any cash payments LivaNova is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes in the event that the market price per ordinary share, as measured under the terms of the capped call transactions, is greater than the strike price of the capped call transactions, with such compensation and/or offset being subject to a cap. The cap price of the capped call transactions will initially be $94.2840 per share, which represents a premium of 80% over the last reported sale price of the ordinary shares of $52.38 per share on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on March 5, 2024. If the initial purchasers of the notes exercise their option to purchase additional notes, LivaNova expects to enter into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties. LivaNova expects that, in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates will purchase LivaNova’s ordinary shares and/or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to LivaNova’s ordinary shares concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. This activity could increase, or reduce the size of any decrease in, the market price of the ordinary shares or the notes at that time. In addition, LivaNova expects that the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to LivaNova’s ordinary shares and/or by purchasing or selling ordinary shares or other securities of LivaNova in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and prior to the maturity of the notes and are likely to do so (x) during the observation period related to conversions of notes on or after December 15, 2028, (y) during any observation period related to a conversion of notes prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding December 15, 2028, if LivaNova elects to unwind a corresponding portion of the capped call transactions in connection with such conversion and (z) following any repurchase of notes by LivaNova if LivaNova elects to unwind a corresponding portion of the capped call transactions in connection with such repurchase. This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of LivaNova’s ordinary shares or the notes, which could affect the ability of noteholders to convert their notes and, to the extent the activity occurs following conversion or during any observation period related to a conversion of the notes, it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that noteholders will receive upon conversion of their notes. Additionally, LivaNova’s wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary, LivaNova USA, Inc., expects to enter into separate and individually negotiated transactions with certain holders of its 3.00% Cash Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2025 (the “cash exchangeable senior notes”) to repurchase $230.0 million aggregate principal amount of the cash exchangeable senior notes for an aggregate cash amount of $270.5 million (including accrued and unpaid interest) (the “note repurchases”). The cash exchangeable senior notes were issued by LivaNova USA, Inc. and are guaranteed by LivaNova. The terms of any such note repurchases are anticipated to be individually negotiated with each holder of the cash exchangeable senior notes and will depend on several factors, including the market price of LivaNova’s ordinary shares and the trading price of the cash exchangeable senior notes at the time of each such note repurchase. No assurance can be given as to how much, if any, of the cash exchangeable senior notes will be repurchased or the terms on which they will be repurchased. LivaNova USA, Inc. intends to negotiate the note repurchases through one of the initial purchasers and/or its affiliate who would repurchase any such cash exchangeable senior notes from holders and resell them to LivaNova USA, Inc. on or about the closing date of this offering. LivaNova expects that holders of the cash exchangeable senior notes that sell their cash exchangeable senior notes to LivaNova USA, Inc. as described above and that have hedged their equity price risk with respect to such cash exchangeable senior notes may enter into or unwind various derivatives with respect to LivaNova’s ordinary shares (including entering into derivatives with one or more of the initial purchasers in this offering or their respective affiliates) and/or purchase ordinary shares concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. This activity could increase, or reduce the size of any decrease in, the market price of LivaNova’s ordinary shares. In connection with the issuance of the cash exchangeable senior notes, LivaNova USA, Inc. entered into capped call transactions with certain financial institutions. To the extent LivaNova USA, Inc. effects any note repurchases, it intends to enter into agreements with those financial institutions to terminate a portion of those capped call transactions in a notional amount corresponding to the amount of cash exchangeable senior notes repurchased. In connection with any such termination of any of the existing capped call transactions and the related unwinding of the existing hedge positions of the counterparties to those capped call transactions, those counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may unwind various derivatives with respect to LivaNova’s ordinary shares and/or sell ordinary shares concurrently with or shortly after pricing of the notes. This activity could decrease, or reduce the size of any increase in, the market price of LivaNova’s ordinary shares at that time and could decrease, or reduce the size of any increase in, the market value of the notes. The note repurchases and the unwind of the existing capped call transactions described above, and the potential related market activities by holders of the cash exchangeable senior notes participating in the note repurchases and by the financial institutions party to the capped call transactions, could increase, or reduce the size of any decrease in, or decrease, or reduce the size of any increase in, the market price of LivaNova’s ordinary shares, which may affect the trading price of the notes being offered and may have affected the initial conversion price of the notes. LivaNova cannot predict the magnitude of such market activity or the overall effect it will have on the price of the notes being offered or LivaNova’s ordinary shares. LivaNova expects to use the net proceeds of the offering and the unwind of the existing capped call transactions, after fees, discounts, commissions and other offering expenses, (i) to pay the cost of the capped call transactions described above, (ii) to pay the cost of the note repurchases described above and (iii) to the extent LivaNova has remaining proceeds after satisfying the foregoing, for general corporate purposes. The notes were only offered to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The notes have not been, nor will they be, registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and unless so registered, they may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an applicable exemption from such registration requirements. LivaNova will apply for the listing of the notes on The International Stock Exchange in Guernsey. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any offer or sale of, the notes in any state or jurisdiction in which the offer, solicitation or sale of the notes would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification thereof under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.

The company ended 2023 with $143.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The enrollment completion for the Phase 3 trial of IO102-IO103 in advanced melanoma patients represents a significant step in oncology therapeutics. Considering the combination with KEYTRUDA, an established anti-PD-1 therapy, the potential for improved treatment outcomes is noteworthy. The focus on progression free survival (PFS) as a primary endpoint is aligned with current oncological endpoints that prioritize the length of time during and after treatment that a patient lives with the disease without it getting worse. This metric is critical in assessing the efficacy of oncological treatments. The interim analysis for overall response rate (ORR) will provide an early indication of the vaccine's effectiveness, which could influence clinical practice and inform the design of subsequent trials. Financial Analyst The financial stability of IO Biotech, with cash reserves of $143.2 million providing an operational runway into Q4 2025, is crucial for investors. This runway indicates the company's ability to sustain operations without the immediate need for additional capital, which can be reassuring for stakeholders. The increased research and development expenses reflect the company's investment in clinical trials, which is a common pattern for biopharmaceutical companies at this stage. However, the net loss widening from $20.1 million to $26.2 million year-over-year suggests that investors should monitor the company's burn rate and future financing needs, especially as major trial milestones approach. Market Research Analyst The advancement of IO102-IO103 through clinical trials is of particular interest within the competitive landscape of cancer immunotherapies. The therapeutic vaccine's progress, especially in combination therapies, may position IO Biotech favorably in the market if clinical outcomes are positive. The data presentations at major oncology conferences indicate the company's commitment to transparency and scientific engagement, which can enhance its reputation among clinicians and researchers.

Our team is dedicated to continuing our diligent work to efficiently bring IO102-IO103 to patients in need, potentially as early as 2025.” Fourth Quarter 2023 and other Recent Highlights In November 2023, the company completed enrollment of 380 patients in its pivotal Phase 3 trial (IOB-013/KN-D18) of IO102-IO103 in combination with Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in advanced melanoma. The primary endpoint of the pivotal Phase 3 trial is progression free survival (PFS). The PFS analysis is event-driven and will be conducted when 226 events have occurred in the trial, which the company estimates will take place in the second half of 2025. Additionally, a planned interim analysis of overall response rate (ORR) will be conducted when the first 225 randomized patients reach one year of treatment in June 2024. The outcome of this analysis is expected in the third quarter of 2024.In December 2023, the first patient was dosed in the company’s Phase 2 solid tumor basket trial (IOB-032/PN-E40) studying treatment with IO102-IO103 in combination with pembrolizumab given before (neo-adjuvant) and after (adjuvant) surgery with curative intent in patients with resectable melanoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN).The company’s Phase 2 basket trial (IOB-022/KN-D38) evaluating IO102-IO103 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or recurrent or metastatic SCCHN is ongoing. Encouraging preliminary data that support the potential of IO102-IO103 in combination with pembrolizumab as first-line treatment in NSCLC and SCCHN were presented at the IASLC 2023 World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC) in September 2023 and at the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) annual meeting in October 2023.Progress continued in several investigator-initiated trials the company is supporting including dosing of the first patient in the Phase 2 trial evaluating its lead therapeutic cancer vaccine candidate, IO102-IO103, and pembrolizumab as neoadjuvant followed by adjuvant treatment of patients with SCCHN (NCT05977907), as well as continuing enrollment in both the Phase 2 trial of IO102-IO103 given in combination with nivolumab-relatlimab in patients with untreated, unresectable Stage III/IV melanoma (NCT05912244) and the Phase 1 study of the IO102-IO103 vaccine in combination with pembrolizumab for patients with BCG-unresponsive or intolerant high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NCT05843448).Three posters were presented at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer’s (SITC) 38th Annual Meeting in November 2023 with data providing further evidence of the differential biological impact of therapeutic vaccines IO102, IO103 and IO112.The company expanded its Board of Directors with the appointment of Helen Collins, MD in November 2023. Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2023, was $26.2 million, compared to $20.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022.Research and development expenses were $21.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $14.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily related to clinical trial-related activities for the company’s IO102-IO103 therapeutic cancer vaccine candidate, including the continued execution of the company’s Phase 3 clinical trial. The company recognized $0.5 million in research and development equity-based compensation for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $0.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022.General and administrative expenses were $6.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $6.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily related to personnel costs due to an increase in head count that was offset by a decrease in professional services, consultant and other costs. The company recognized $1.0 million in general and administrative equity-based compensation for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $1.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022.Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023 were $143.2 million, compared to $142.6 million at December 31, 2022.

(BTBT) reported a decrease in BTC production in February 2024 but maintained a strong financial position with significant digital asset holdings and cash equivalents.

Announces Monthly Production Update for February 2024 Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Bit Digital, Inc. (BTBT) reported a decrease in BTC production in February 2024 but maintained a strong financial position with significant digital asset holdings and cash equivalents. The company also highlighted its Proof-of-Stake initiatives and AI revenue generation. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The decrease in Bit Digital's BTC production by 11.7% compared to the prior month is a notable development. This reduction could be attributed to various factors such as increased difficulty in mining, operational challenges, or strategic shifts. Investors should consider the implications of this downward trend in production, as it may affect the company's revenue and profitability. Moreover, the reported active hash rate of approximately 2.73 EH/s provides an indication of the company's mining power, which is essential for understanding its potential to generate future digital assets.From a financial perspective, the treasury holdings of BTC and ETH, with a combined fair market value of over $100 million, represent significant assets on the company's balance sheet. The diversification of holdings between BTC and ETH may offer some risk mitigation against the volatility inherent in the cryptocurrency markets. However, the fluctuating nature of cryptocurrency prices could lead to substantial changes in the valuation of these assets, impacting the company's financial health. Market Research Analyst Bit Digital's engagement in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocols is a strategic move that aligns with the broader industry's shift towards more energy-efficient blockchain validation methods. With approximately 12,784 ETH actively staked, the company is not only earning a steady return, as evidenced by the 4.4% blended APY, but also positioning itself as a participant in the governance and security of the associated blockchain networks. The aggregate staking rewards of approximately 43.4 ETH add another revenue stream, which could be particularly valuable during periods when direct mining yields are lower.The update on Bit Digital AI's performance, with 251 servers actively generating an estimated $4.0 million of unaudited revenue, signals the company's diversification into AI infrastructure. This move could potentially offset volatility in digital asset markets and provide a more stable revenue base. However, the specifics of the AI contract and the nature of the AI services provided would be crucial in evaluating the sustainability and growth potential of this revenue stream. Cryptocurrency Expert The data presented by Bit Digital offers a snapshot of the company's operational status within the cryptocurrency mining and staking industry. The BTC equivalent of digital asset holdings provides a useful metric for investors to gauge the company's exposure to the cryptocurrency market. Given the volatility of cryptocurrency prices, the valuation of these assets can significantly impact the company's market capitalization and investor sentiment.It is also worth noting the company's cash and cash equivalents of $34.3 million, which is a critical factor in assessing its liquidity and ability to fund operations or expansion without diluting shareholder value through additional stock offerings or incurring debt. This financial cushion can be especially important in the capital-intensive cryptocurrency mining industry, where equipment upgrades and energy costs can be substantial. 03/05/2024 - 04:30 PM NEW YORK, March 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Bit Digital, Inc.

John Turner named as the new CEO effective March 6, 2024, succeeding Bud Brigham who will remain as Executive Chairman. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of Hi-Crush Inc. by Atlas Energy Solutions Inc. significantly alters the landscape of the proppant industry, particularly within the Permian Basin. The consolidation creates the largest proppant producer in the United States, which is expected to result in economies of scale and operational efficiencies. From a market perspective, this strategic move could potentially lower costs, improve profit margins and enhance the competitive position of Atlas in the market.Proppant is a critical material used in hydraulic fracturing (fracking) to keep fractures open and facilitate the extraction of oil and gas. The demand for proppant is closely tied to the activity levels in the oil and gas industry, which are influenced by commodity prices and energy policies. Therefore, the success of this acquisition will likely be contingent on the stability and growth of the fracking industry in the coming years. Financial Analyst Atlas's acquisition of Hi-Crush and the subsequent leadership transition with John Turner stepping in as CEO may have material implications for shareholder value. The addition of Hi-Crush's portfolio and the expansion of logistics capabilities through Pronghorn are poised to drive margin expansion and profitability. Investors should monitor the integration process closely, as successful mergers can lead to significant cost savings and revenue synergies, while poorly executed ones may result in integration challenges and unexpected costs.Moreover, the market will be observing the impact of the acquisition on Atlas's financials in subsequent quarters, particularly in terms of revenue growth, cost management and return on investment. The enhanced scale of operations and the combined customer base are intended to improve well economics, which could translate to stronger financial performance and potentially increased stock valuation. Energy Sector Analyst The acquisition's impact extends beyond Atlas and Hi-Crush, as it may influence the broader energy sector, especially within the Permian Basin. By creating a more sustainable energy manufacturing center, Atlas may set new benchmarks for operational efficiency and innovation in the sector. This could pressure competitors to seek similar consolidation opportunities or innovate to maintain market share.Additionally, the focus on sustainability and efficiency gains aligns with the energy industry's ongoing transition towards more environmentally friendly practices. This strategic direction may not only cater to investor preferences for sustainable operations but also comply with regulatory trends favoring reduced environmental impact from energy production. 03/05/2024 - 04:30 PM AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Atlas Energy Solutions Inc. (NYSE: AESI) (“Atlas” or the “Company”) today announced the completion of the acquisition of Hi-Crush Inc. (“Hi-Crush”). The transaction strengthens Atlas’s position as the largest proppant producer in the country, with a total combined annual production capacity of ~28 million tons per year, and an industry leading provider of proppant logistics in the Permian Basin. This acquisition brings together two of the leading innovators in the Permian proppant space and broadens Atlas’s logistics offering through the addition of Pronghorn, a leading multi-basin provider of proppant logistics and wellsite services. The combined logistics offerings are expected to drive significant operational efficiencies. Bud Brigham, Executive Chairman and CEO of Atlas commented, ""We are thrilled to complete this acquisition, which brings two of the leading innovators in the proppant and proppant logistics spaces together, creating a clear industry leader.

Gross profit also decreased by 46.8%. Despite challenges, management remains optimistic about the long-term prospects of the fitness industry in Australia. Positive None. Negative Revenue decreased by 30.5% compared to the same period in 2022, with a gross profit decline of 46.8%. Merchandise revenue dropped by 6.7%, and revenue from licensing customers decreased by 61.1%. Cost of goods sold decreased by 12.7%, but general and administrative expenses increased significantly by 648.6%. The net loss was $2,661,707, a substantial decrease from the previous year. Market Research Analyst The reported financial results of Fitell Corporation indicate a significant contraction in revenue and gross profit, with a notable 30.5% decrease in revenue and a 46.8% drop in gross profit compared to the previous year. The decline in merchandise revenue, complete cessation of consumable product sales and reduction of licensing income are clear contributors to this downturn. A Market Research Analyst would emphasize the importance of understanding consumer spending habits and market trends, particularly in the context of the economic conditions in Australia that have been cited as influencing average revenue per order.Additionally, the increase in sales orders by 34.3% alongside a decrease in revenue suggests a shift towards lower-priced items or more aggressive discounting, which may affect the company's long-term profitability. The strategic decision to suspend overseas expansion due to inflation and rising interest rates reflects a cautious approach by management in a volatile global market. However, the intention to re-enter the Asian market suggests optimism about future growth potential in that region. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the sharp increase in consulting fees to $1.27 million, from nil in the prior period and the 648.6% surge in general and administrative expenses are significant. These expenses, particularly the research and development costs for a mobile app and increased insurance and audit fees associated with the Nasdaq listing, have contributed to a substantial net loss of $2.66 million. A Financial Analyst would scrutinize these investments to evaluate their potential for generating future returns and improving operational efficiency.The gross profit margin decline to 39.9% from 52.1% is also a critical metric, indicating a shift in the company's product mix towards lower-margin items. This margin compression, if sustained, could impact the company's ability to invest in growth and innovation. The net loss widening by over $2.6 million raises concerns about the sustainability of the company's current cost structure and its capacity to navigate economic headwinds without further eroding profitability. Economist An Economist would consider the broader economic factors at play, such as inflation and interest rate hikes, which have a direct impact on consumer spending and business expansion plans. The cessation of consumable product sales might reflect a strategic pivot or a response to reduced disposable income among consumers. The decision to postpone international expansion can be seen as a risk mitigation strategy in response to economic uncertainties.The long-term outlook for the fitness and wellness industry remains positive, as indicated by management's statements, suggesting that current challenges may be cyclical rather than structural. However, the company's ability to capitalize on this potential growth will depend on its adaptability to changing economic conditions and its success in controlling costs while still investing in areas that drive future revenue growth. 03/05/2024 - 04:30 PM TAREN POINT, Australia, March 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fitell Corporation (Nasdaq: FTEL) (""Fitell"" or the ""Company""), an online retailer of gym and fitness equipment in Australia, today announced its half-year financial results for the six months ended December 31, 2023.

The decrease was primarily attributable to: (i) a 34.3% increase in sales orders, primarily due to promotional campaigns and new marketing channels; and (ii) a decrease of 30.5% in the average revenue per order, mainly due to consumer spending changes in response to recent economic conditions in Australia. Management believes that the market will gradually recover, and the fitness and wellness industry in Australia is still promising in the long-term.In the three months ended December 2023, merchandise revenue increased $103,849 or 10.9% compared to the same period in 2022.Sales of consumable products represents the revenue generated by selling various lifestyle products.

Revenue from licensing customers decreased by 61.4% or $181,308 to $115,557.

Since the successful listing on Nasdaq, the management has proactively engaged various consulting firms to assist the company in setting long-term business development plans and identifying new business growth opportunities. General and administrative expenses were $1,268,545, an increase of $1,099,110, or 648.6% from $169,445 for the same period of 2022. The increase was mainly due to (i) research and development expenses on mobile app of $798,684; (ii) an $99,801 increase of insurance expense related to D&O insurance coverage post-Nasdaq listing; and (iii) an $71,945 increase of audit fees due to the Company’s listing. Net loss was $2,661,707, a decrease of $2,602,382 from the same period in 2022.

The oral presentation will feature insights from the company's PROPHETIC trial, to be delivered by Prof. Jarushka Naidoo, consultant medical oncologist at Beaumont Hospital Dublin, professor at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, and co-author of the abstract. Titled 'Plasma proteomics-based models for predicting therapeutic benefit and immune-related adverse events in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with immunotherapy,' the presentation will highlight two predictive PROphet® tools that can be used independently, or in combination: a tool to guide treatment decisions by assessing a patient's probability of benefiting from immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, and another to assess the likelihood of the patient experiencing severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Additionally, biological insights related to treatment resistance and immune-related toxicity will be presented. ""We are honored to be selected to present our research at the AACR Annual Meeting, highlighting the capabilities of our PROphet® platform in guiding treatment decisions for NSCLC,"" said Ofer Sharon, MD, CEO of OncoHost. ""Our goal is to equip oncologists with robust tools to predict treatment response and mitigate adverse events. These findings are a source of great excitement for us, with our main commitment to bringing these advancements to healthcare providers and patients, improving cancer care globally. Our team's dedication to transforming precision medicine for better patient outcomes is underscored by our scientific progress, and we take pride in leading the charge to address these crucial challenges."" OncoHost's PROphet® platform utilizes machine learning to predict clinical benefit probability (at least 12 months progression-free survival) from proteomic patterns in response to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors - as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy. For this study, pre-treatment plasma samples were collected from 616 NSCLC patients receiving ICI-based therapy taking part in the company's ongoing, multicenter PROPHETIC clinical trial (NCT04056247). Clinical benefit data and irAEs were recorded. Proteomic profiling of plasma samples was performed using SomaLogic's (NASDAQ: SLGC) SomaScan platform, measuring the expression levels of approximately 7,000 proteins per sample. ""While ICIs have significantly enhanced outcomes for advanced NSCLC patients, managing these treatments is complex, and the need for a biomarker to optimize the choice between ICI monotherapy and combination ICI-chemotherapy is pressing. Additionally, the absence of biomarkers to predict irAEs in these patients only intensifies this challenge,"" said Yehonatan Elon, Ph.D., Chief Technology Officer at OncoHost, and co-author of the study. ""Our presentation will reveal how our PROphet® platform fills these critical gaps. It is a privilege to contribute to this research for the benefit of the cancer community.""

Despite a net loss of $93.9 million in 2023, the company launched Inspirato Rewards and saw growth in active subscriptions. Adjusted EBITDA loss improved compared to guidance. Positive Total revenue for Inspirato in 2023 was $329.1 million, falling within the guidance range of $320 to $340 million. Total Nights Delivered per member increased by 2% in 2023 compared to 2022. Residence occupancy in 2023 was 72%, down from 81% in 2022. Inspirato launched its loyalty program, Inspirato Rewards, in August 2023. Net loss for full-year 2023 was $93.9 million, compared to $51.1 million in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA loss for 2023 was $29.3 million, better than the guidance range of $30 to $45 million. Negative Year-over-year decreases in total revenue, total nights delivered, and residence occupancy. Net loss increased significantly in 2023 compared to 2022. Asset impairments led to a net loss in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. Market Research Analyst The financial results of Inspirato Incorporated reveal several key performance indicators that are crucial for understanding the company's current market position and future prospects. A Market Research Analyst would note the decline in total revenue year-over-year, which could be indicative of broader challenges within the luxury travel sector or company-specific issues. The decrease in Residence occupancy rates from 2022 to 2023, alongside the dip in the average daily rates (ADR), suggests a potential softening in demand or increased competition. The introduction of the Inspirato Rewards loyalty program is a strategic move to enhance customer retention and increase annual spend per member, which is supported by the data showing that 47% of members have already earned Rewards status.Furthermore, the growth in Total Active Subscriptions, particularly with contracts of two years or more, indicates a stable recurring revenue stream. However, the significant net loss reported, despite being partially attributed to asset impairments, raises concerns about the company's profitability trajectory. The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA loss is a positive signal, suggesting that management's cost control and operational efficiency measures may be yielding results. It will be important for investors to monitor upcoming quarters to assess whether these improvements can be sustained and lead to profitability. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the reported net loss widening in 2023 compared to 2022 is a significant concern. A Financial Analyst would scrutinize the asset impairments that contributed heavily to the loss, as this could indicate potential overvaluation of assets or a need for strategic realignment. The non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA is often used to provide a clearer picture of operational performance by excluding non-recurring items. The favorable Adjusted EBITDA, in this case, suggests that the company's core operations may be improving, which could be a positive sign for investors.It is also important to consider the guidance provided for 2024, which reflects management's expectations for the company's path to profitability. The guidance will likely influence investor sentiment and stock performance in the short term. Long-term investors, however, should consider the company's ability to adapt to market changes, manage costs and innovate in its offerings to ensure sustainable growth. Economist An Economist would explore the broader economic factors that could be influencing Inspirato's performance. For instance, the luxury travel industry is highly sensitive to economic cycles. The decrease in Total Nights Delivered and Residence occupancy may reflect economic headwinds such as reduced consumer spending or increased saving tendencies among high-net-worth individuals. Additionally, the launch of Inspirato for Good and Inspirato for Business indicates a diversification strategy that could tap into corporate social responsibility trends and B2B market opportunities.The long-term viability of Inspirato's business model in a post-pandemic world, where travel patterns may have been permanently altered, is also of interest. The company's ability to navigate these macroeconomic and sector-specific challenges while moving towards profitability will be a critical factor for its success. 03/05/2024 - 04:30 PM DENVER, March 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Inspirato Incorporated (“Inspirato” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: ISPO), the innovative luxury travel club, today announced its 2023 fourth quarter and full-year results and provided 2024 guidance aimed at improving its path to profitability. Except as otherwise stated, all financial results discussed below are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP. As supplemental information, we have provided certain additional non-GAAP financial measures in this press release’s supplemental tables, and such supplemental tables include a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to our GAAP results. The sum of individual metrics may not always equal total amounts indicated due to rounding. 2023 Fourth Quarter and Full-Year Highlights: Full-year total revenue was within the Company’s previously provided guidance range of $320 to $340 million. Total revenue of $70.7 million in the fourth quarter and $329.1 million for the full year, representing year-over-year decreases of 18% and 5%, respectively.Total Nights Delivered per member increased 2% in 2023 compared to 2022. Total Nights Delivered of 40,600 in the fourth quarter and 185,000 for the full-year 2023, representing year-over-year decreases of 14% and 1%, respectively.Residence occupancy in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 of 65% and 72%, respectively, compared to 73% and 81% in the comparable 2022 periods. Residence average daily rates (“ADR”) were approximately $1,700 and $1,800 in the fourth quarter and full-year 2023 periods, respectively, compared to approximately $1,900 and $1,800 in the comparable 2022 periods.Total Active Subscriptions of approximately 13,800 as of December 31, 2023, were comprised of approximately 11,300 Inspirato Club subscriptions and approximately 2,500 Inspirato Pass subscriptions. More than 75% of new sales made in 2023 were for contract terms of two years or more.Launched Inspirato Rewards, the Company’s first ever loyalty program, in August 2023. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 47% of Inspirato members had earned Rewards status based on 2023 annual spend of at least $20,000.Inspirato for Good (“IFG”) and Inspirato for Business (“IFB”) had fourth quarter contracted sales of $2.1 million and $2.8 million, respectively. For the full year 2023, IFG and IFB had contracted sales of $9.6 million and $14.5 million, respectively. Additionally, IFG sold more than 3,000 travel and membership packages in its first full year of operations, which are not included in the Company’s subscription count.Net loss of $15.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to a net loss of $14.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Full-year 2023 net loss was $93.9 million compared to a net loss of approximately $51.1 million in 2022. The fourth quarter and full year 2023 net loss included asset impairments predominantly related to properties in one geographic location of $6.5 million and $40.8 million, respectively.Full-year 2023 Adjusted EBITDA loss, a non-GAAP financial measure defined below, was favorable compared to the Company’s previously provided guidance range of an Adjusted EBITDA loss between $30 million and $45 million. Adjusted EBITDA loss of $5.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $29.3 million for the full-year 2023 compared to Adjusted EBITDA losses of $9.5 million and $32.1 million in the comparable 2022 periods. Management Commentary “I’m excited about our positioning heading into 2024,” commented Chief Executive Officer, Eric Grosse. “While 2023 was largely characterized by our portfolio optimization efforts and cost control initiatives, I expect 2024 to be a year in which Inspirato returns to its roots by simplifying the business with a renewed focus on our value proposition, ultimately resulting in a reinvigorated member base. Our core remains strong and our value-proposition to members continues to improve, as evidenced by the early success of Inspirato Rewards and the recent modifications to Inspirato Pass.” Chief Financial Officer, Robert Kaiden, added, “We have delivered results in-line or above our internal expectations for the past two quarters and look to continue building a track record of execution in 2024. Our top priority in 2024 is to reach breakeven, on an Adjusted EBITDA basis, by executing a plan that is grounded on achievable goals. Should we succeed, we not only expect to deliver periods of EBITDA profitability in 2024, but will have set the stage for profitable growth in the future with solid financial strength and adequate liquidity.” 2024 Guidance For 2024, Inspirato anticipates total revenue between $275 million and $305 million and Adjusted EBITDA between a loss of $15 million and income of $5 million. The Company expects to benefit from its recent portfolio optimization efforts and cost control initiatives, resulting in periods of profitability on an Adjusted EBITDA basis, including the first quarter of 2024. Total cash operating expenses are expected to decline by approximately 5-12% year-over-year to a range of $115 million to $125 million. In 2024, the Company plans to focus on better aligning its current offerings to its short- and long-term priorities of profitable operations, improved member engagement and increased travel revenue per member. As a result of this realignment, the Company anticipates a reduction of its Pass member base by a similar amount as 2023 and to exit the year with a similar amount of Club members as year-end 2023. In 2023, Inspirato reduced the asking ADR on new bookings in both its residences and hotels, contributing to an expected year-over-year decrease of 5-10% in 2024 residence and hotel ADRs. The combination of Inspirato Rewards and reduced residence ADRs led to a slight increase year-over-year in reservations and nights booked per member to exit 2023 and begin 2024. In February 2024, that trend reversed, resulting in the Company expecting a slight decrease in residence revenue on a year-over-year basis. 2024 hotel revenue is expected to decrease by 5-10% year-over-year due to aforementioned decreases in anticipated hotel ADRs and fewer expected hotel nights delivered. The Company currently expects its strategic partnership with Capital One Ventures to begin a multi-phased launch in the second half of 2024. Accordingly, 2024 guidance contains minimal expected revenue associated with the strategic partnership as future travel revenue is expected to be recognized as travel is delivered, predominantly beginning in 2025. These statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Refer to the Forward-Looking Statements section below for information on the factors that could cause Inspirato’s actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA is a forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure. The Company is unable to reconcile forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA to net income, its most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure, without unreasonable effort, as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as equity-based compensation expense. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on Inspirato’s future GAAP results. 2023 Financial Results and Operational Metrics The following table provides the components of gross margin for the periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2023: Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31,(Unaudited, in millions) 2022 2023 % Change 2022 2023 % ChangeTravel revenue $46.5 $38.1 (18.1)% $198.9 $190.3 (4.4)%Subscription revenue 39.3 31.7 (19.3)% 145.7 137.6 (5.5)%Rewards and other revenue 0.8 0.9 12.5% 1.0 1.2 28.2%Total revenue 86.6 70.7 (18.4)% 345.5 329.1 (4.8)%Cost of revenue 60.7 51.4 (15.3)% 228.4 233.9 2.4%Asset impairments 0.9 6.5 n/m 0.9 40.8 n/m Gross margin $25.0 $12.8 (48.7)% $116.2 $54.4 (53.2)%Gross margin (%) 29% 18% N/A 34% 17% N/A n/m = not meaningful The following table provides a breakdown of Nights Delivered, Occupancy and ADR for the periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2023: Three months ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2021 2022 2023 2021 2022 2023Residences Paid Nights Delivered 16,000 14,500 14,100 61,100 67,800 61,400 Total Nights Delivered 24,800 27,700 24,400 94,800 114,900 111,600 Occupancy 84% 73% 65% 88% 81% 72%ADR $1,693 $1,923 $1,687 $1,557 $1,825 $1,825 Hotels Paid Nights Delivered (1) 8,600 10,400 9,600 29,300 38,900 41,900 Total Nights Delivered (1) 14,300 19,500 16,200 48,200 72,700 73,400 Occupancy (2) 77% 70% 70% 79% 79% 72%ADR (2) $956 $970 $925 $962 $970 $935 Total Paid Nights Delivered (1) 24,600 24,900 23,700 90,500 106,600 103,300 Total Nights Delivered (1) 39,100 47,200 40,600 143,000 187,600 185,000 Occupancy (2) 82% 72% 67% 85% 80% 72%ADR (2) $1,364 $1,513 $1,464 $1,364 $1,513 $1,464 (1)Includes net rate hotel nights.(2)Excludes net rate hotel nights as we purchase individual nights but do not have a total number of nights obligation. Reconciliation of Non- GAAP Financial Measures In addition to Inspirato’s results determined in accordance with GAAP, Inspirato uses Adjusted Net Loss, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Free Cash Flow as part of its overall assessment of performance, including the preparation of its annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of its business strategies and to communicate with its Board concerning our business and financial performance. Inspirato believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors about its business and financial performance, enhance their overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by its management in their financial and operational decision making. Inspirato is presenting these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in seeing its business and financial performance through the eyes of management, and because we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing results of operations of our business over multiple periods with other companies in our industry. There are limitations related to the use of these non-GAAP financial measures, including that they exclude significant expenses that are required by GAAP to be recorded in Inspirato’s financial measures. Other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to calculate their financial performance, and therefore, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Thus, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Inspirato provides a reconciliation of Adjusted Net Loss, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBTIDA Margin and Free Cash Flow to their respective related GAAP financial measures. Inspirato encourages investors and others to review our business, results of operations, and financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view Adjusted Net Loss, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Free Cash Flow in conjunction with their respective related GAAP financial measures. Adjusted Net Loss. Adjusted Net Loss is a non-GAAP financial measure that Inspirato defines as net loss and comprehensive loss less fair value gains and losses on financial instruments and asset impairments. The above items are excluded from Inspirato’s Adjusted Net Loss measure because management believes that these costs and expenses are not indicative of core operating performance and do not reflect the underlying economics of Inspirato’s business. Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that Inspirato defines as net loss less interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation expense, fair value gains and losses on financial instruments, asset impairments and public company readiness expenses. The above items are excluded from Inspirato’s Adjusted EBITDA measure because management believes that these costs and expenses are not indicative of core operating performance and do not reflect the underlying economics of Inspirato’s business. Free Cash Flow. Inspirato defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and development of internal-use software. Inspirato believes that Free Cash Flow is a meaningful indicator of liquidity that provides information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated from operations, after purchases of property and equipment and development of internal-use software, that can be used for strategic initiatives. See below for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures. Key Business and Other Operating Metrics Inspirato uses a number of operating and financial metrics, including the following key business metrics, to evaluate its business, measure its performance, identify trends affecting its business, formulate financial projections and business plans, and make strategic decisions. Inspirato regularly reviews and may adjust processes for calculating its internal metrics to improve their accuracy. Active Subscriptions. Inspirato uses Active Subscriptions to assess the adoption of its subscription offerings, which is a key factor in assessing penetration of the market in which it operates and a key driver of revenue. Inspirato defines Active Subscriptions as subscriptions as of the measurement date that are paid in full, as well as those for which Inspirato expects payment for renewal. Total Nights Delivered. Total Nights Delivered includes all Paid, Inspirato Pass, Inspirato for Good, Inspirato for Business, employee and other complimentary nights in all residences or hotels.

The Bank's operating income also saw a substantial rise in 4Q23. However, total consolidated financing and deposits experienced declines during the quarter. The non-performing loan ratio improved, while the efficiency ratio showed positive trends. BBVA Argentina's regulatory capital ratio and Tier I ratio remained strong. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst BBVA Argentina's announcement of a 220.8% increase in inflation-adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the previous quarter demonstrates a significant quarterly growth, yet an 8.7% decrease year-over-year. This indicates a volatile performance which could be attributed to the economic environment or operational factors within the bank. The substantial growth in operating income, at 86.4% higher than the same quarter of the previous year, suggests increased operational efficiency or higher revenue-generating activities. However, the decline in financing to the private sector could be a concern as it may reflect a contraction in the bank's core business of lending.The bank's regulatory capital ratio of 32.8% is well above the minimum requirement, indicating a strong capital position that could provide resilience against financial shocks. However, investors should consider the high efficiency ratio, despite its improvement, as it may imply higher costs relative to income compared to peers. The non-performing loan ratio, coupled with a coverage ratio of 165.30%, suggests that the bank has a handle on credit risk, which is a positive sign for credit quality. Economist BBVA Argentina's results, especially the significant quarterly increase in net income and the high operating income, must be analyzed within the context of Argentina's inflationary environment. The bank's decision to report inflation-adjusted results pursuant to IAS 29 is crucial for providing a more accurate financial picture. The decrease in total consolidated financing to the private sector and in deposits in real terms suggests a possible tightening of credit conditions or reduced demand for loans, which could be indicative of broader economic challenges. Such trends can have implications for the country's economic growth and credit expansion, potentially affecting consumer spending and business investment. Market Research Analyst The reported figures show BBVA Argentina's fluctuating market share in private sector loans and deposits. A decrease in market share could imply increased competition or a strategic shift in the bank's operations. The bank's liquid assets being at 91.2% of total deposits is a strong indicator of liquidity, which is essential for meeting short-term obligations and maintaining customer confidence. However, the contraction in key areas like credit cards, consumer loans and other loans could signal a shift in consumer behavior or risk appetite, which may affect future revenue streams and market positioning. 03/05/2024 - 04:38 PM BUENOS AIRES, Argentina, March 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Banco BBVA Argentina S.A (NYSE; BYMA; MAE: BBAR; LATIBEX: XBBAR) (""BBVA Argentina"" or ""BBVA"" or ""the Bank"") announced today its consolidated results for the fourth quarter (4Q23), ended on December 31, 2023.

(GILD) announces positive real-world data on Veklury (remdesivir) at CROI, showing reduced risk of long-COVID symptoms and mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, including the immunocompromised. Positive Veklury associated with lower risk of developing long-COVID in one analysis. Veklury linked to reduced mortality among immunocompromised COVID-19 patients in a separate analysis. Real-world data supports Veklury's efficacy and safety profile for COVID-19 patients. Veklury remains the antiviral standard of care for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recent findings presented regarding Veklury, known generically as remdesivir, are significant in the context of ongoing COVID-19 management, particularly for those with compromised immune systems. The data indicating a lower risk of long-COVID symptoms and reduced mortality rates provide a compelling argument for the continued use of this antiviral in hospital settings. The association between Veklury and improved outcomes in immunocompromised patients is particularly noteworthy, as this subgroup faces a higher risk of severe disease progression and complications.It is essential to understand that 'association' does not necessarily imply causation and retrospective studies have inherent limitations, including potential biases and confounding factors. However, these studies can still provide valuable real-world evidence that complements randomized controlled trials. The observed benefits in conjunction with dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, suggest a possible synergistic effect, which could inform treatment protocols and guidelines.The clinical implications extend beyond immediate survival rates, touching on the quality of life post-recovery. The potential reduction in long-COVID symptoms could alleviate the long-term burden on healthcare systems and improve patient outcomes. However, continuous monitoring and further research are needed to validate these findings and optimize treatment regimens. Health Economist The economic implications of these findings are substantial. If Veklury indeed reduces long-COVID symptoms and mortality among the immunocompromised, it could lead to lower healthcare costs associated with prolonged hospital stays, post-acute care and long-term disability. The reduction in mortality rates could also have indirect economic benefits by maintaining the productivity of the workforce.However, the cost-effectiveness of Veklury must be carefully evaluated. The drug's price, the healthcare system's capacity to administer it effectively and the potential need for additional supportive care are all factors that impact its overall economic value. Policymakers and healthcare providers must weigh the benefits against the costs to make informed decisions about resource allocation, especially in a pandemic setting where efficient use of resources is paramount.Moreover, the broad application of these findings across different healthcare systems globally would require an assessment of varying healthcare infrastructures, access to medication and economic disparities. This analysis could guide international health policy and funding decisions, especially in resource-limited settings. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The announcement of these studies could have implications for Gilead Sciences' market position. As the manufacturer of Veklury, Gilead could see an increased demand for the drug, particularly as the data suggests utility beyond the immediate treatment of COVID-19 to include long-term symptom management and benefits for high-risk patient populations.The pharmaceutical market is highly responsive to clinical data and positive results can lead to increased stock valuations. Investors and stakeholders will be closely monitoring the uptake of Veklury in the healthcare system and any potential expansion of its approved indications. The competitive landscape of COVID-19 treatments is continually evolving and Gilead's ability to demonstrate sustained efficacy and safety of Veklury will be crucial in maintaining its market share against emerging therapies.It's also worth noting that the long-term demand for COVID-19 treatments will depend on the trajectory of the pandemic, vaccination rates and the emergence of new variants. Gilead's strategic planning and continued investment in research will be key factors in adapting to these market dynamics. 03/05/2024 - 04:35 PM – Veklury Was Associated With a Lower Risk of Developing Long-COVID in One Analysis – – Veklury Was Associated With a Reduced Risk of Mortality Among People Who Are Immunocompromised in a Separate Analysis – FOSTER CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) today announced new data from three real-world retrospective studies being presented at the 31st Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI). One study showed Veklury® (remdesivir) was associated with a reduced risk of certain long-COVID symptoms in people who were hospitalized for COVID-19. In a separate study, Veklury use was associated with significantly reduced mortality among people who were immunocompromised and were hospitalized for COVID-19 during the Omicron period (Dec’21 – April’23), irrespective of oxygen requirements. A third analysis revealed that treatment with Veklury and dexamethasone among patients hospitalized for COVID-19 was associated with reduced mortality as compared to treatment with only dexamethasone, irrespective of oxygen requirements. “The real-world data presented at CROI continue to reinforce the strong efficacy and safety profile of Veklury, as well as the potential benefit of Veklury for people affected by COVID-19,” said Frank Duff, MD, Senior Vice President, Virology Therapeutic Area Head, Gilead Sciences. “As we enter the fourth year of COVID-19, Veklury remains the antiviral standard of care for people hospitalized for COVID-19. These latest data add to our scientific understanding about Veklury’s potential role in reducing mortality, including in immunocompromised people, and helping to reduce the risk of getting long-COVID symptoms.” To understand Veklury’s potential impact on the risk of long-COVID, also known as post-COVID conditions (PCC), Gilead analyzed HealthVerity data from 52,006 patients. Results from the study demonstrate that Veklury use was associated with a 10% lower risk of any PCC in both age groups analyzed: HR 0.90 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.86–0.93) in those <65 years old and HR 0.90 (95% CI: 0.86–0.95) in those ≥65 years old. Veklury use was associated with lower risk for 6 of 16 individual symptoms/diagnoses in the ≥65 age group (including cognitive dysfunction, cerebrovascular disease, neuropsychiatric features, diarrhea, chest pain, and dysautonomia) and for 8 of 16 individual symptoms/diagnoses in the <65 age group (including the 6 symptoms in the ≥65 age group, as well as thromboembolic disease and headache). Results from this analysis build on existing evidence that support the importance of treating COVID-19 early in the disease course with an antiviral. In a separate analysis, data from the PINC AI Healthcare database from the Omicron era (Dec’21 – Apr’23) showed an association between Veklury use and reduced mortality among immunocompromised people in the study who were hospitalized for COVID-19. The study included 10,687 immunocompromised people who received Veklury and 4,989 who were matched controls. Results at Day 28 showed that people who were immunocompromised and treated with Veklury had an overall 25% significantly lower mortality risk compared to the non-Veklury group, irrespective of supplemental oxygen requirements (HR: 0.75, 95% CI:0.68-0.83; p<0.0001). This research builds on and further reinforces previous research presented at CROI 2023. Additional data from a real-world study showed improved outcomes among patients with COVID-19 who received treatment with Veklury in combination with dexamethasone compared to dexamethasone alone. The study matched 33,037 patients who received both Veklury and dexamethasone to 33,037 patients who received only dexamethasone. Patients who received the dual therapy had a significantly lower mortality risk compared to dexamethasone monotherapy across all supplemental oxygen requirements at both 14 and 28 days. For patients with no documented use of supplemental oxygen at baseline, treatment with Veklury was associated with a 20% (p<0.001) lower risk of mortality at Day 28. Patients on low-flow or high-flow oxygen had a 26% (p<0.001) and 29% (p<0.001) lower risk of mortality at Day 28, respectively. Patients on invasive mechanical ventilation/ECMO at baseline had a 19% (p=0.0182) reduced risk for mortality at Day 28. About Veklury Veklury (remdesivir) is a nucleotide analog prodrug invented by Gilead, building on more than a decade of the company’s antiviral research. Veklury is the antiviral standard of care for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and is a recommended treatment for reducing disease progression in non-hospitalized patients at high risk of disease progression. Veklury has an established safety profile and limited known drug interactions in diverse populations. It plays an important role in reducing disease progression across a spectrum of disease severity and enabling patients to recover faster. Veklury directly inhibits viral replication inside of the cell by targeting the SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA polymerase. Based on in vitro analyses, Veklury retains antiviral activity against recent Omicron subvariants of concern, including XBB, XBB.1.5 and CH.1.1. Veklury continues to be evaluated against emerging variants of interest and concern, including EG.5, EG.5.1 and BA.2.86. Veklury is approved in more than 50 countries worldwide. To date, Veklury and generic remdesivir have been made available to more than 14 million patients around the world, including more than 8 million people in middle- and low-income countries through Gilead’s voluntary licensing program. U.S. Indication for Veklury Veklury (remdesivir 100 mg for injection) is indicated for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients (weighing ≥1.5 kg) who are: Hospitalized, or Not hospitalized and have mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. For more information, please see the U.S. full Prescribing Information available at www.gilead.com. U.S. Important Safety Information for Veklury Contraindication Veklury is contraindicated in patients with a history of clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions to Veklury or any of its components. Warnings and precautions Hypersensitivity, including infusion-related and anaphylactic reactions: Hypersensitivity, including infusion-related and anaphylactic reactions, has been observed during and following administration of Veklury; most occurred within one hour. Monitor patients during infusion and observe for at least one hour after infusion is complete for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity as clinically appropriate. Symptoms may include hypotension, hypertension, tachycardia, bradycardia, hypoxia, fever, dyspnea, wheezing, angioedema, rash, nausea, diaphoresis, and shivering. Slower infusion rates (maximum infusion time up to 120 minutes) can potentially prevent these reactions. If a severe infusion-related hypersensitivity reaction occurs, immediately discontinue Veklury and initiate appropriate treatment (see Contraindications). Increased risk of transaminase elevations: Transaminase elevations have been observed in healthy volunteers and in patients with COVID-19 who received Veklury; these elevations have also been reported as a clinical feature of COVID-19. Perform hepatic laboratory testing in all patients (see Dosage and administration). Consider discontinuing Veklury if ALT levels increase to >10x ULN. Discontinue Veklury if ALT elevation is accompanied by signs or symptoms of liver inflammation. Risk of reduced antiviral activity when coadministered with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine: Coadministration of Veklury with chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate is not recommended based on data from cell culture experiments, demonstrating potential antagonism, which may lead to a decrease in antiviral activity of Veklury. Adverse reactions The most common adverse reaction (≥5% all grades) was nausea. The most common lab abnormalities (≥5% all grades) were increases in ALT and AST. Drug interactions Drug interaction trials of Veklury and other concomitant medications have not been conducted in humans. Dosage and administration Administration should take place under conditions where management of severe hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylaxis, is possible. Treatment duration: For patients who are hospitalized, Veklury should be initiated as soon as possible after diagnosis of symptomatic COVID-19. For patients who are hospitalized and do not require invasive mechanical ventilation and/or ECMO, the recommended treatment duration is 5 days. If a patient does not demonstrate clinical improvement, treatment may be extended up to 5 additional days, for a total treatment duration of up to 10 days. For patients who are hospitalized and require invasive mechanical ventilation and/or ECMO, the recommended total treatment duration is 10 days. For patients who are not hospitalized, diagnosed with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, and are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death, the recommended total treatment duration is 3 days. Veklury should be initiated as soon as possible after diagnosis of symptomatic COVID-19 and within 7 days of symptom onset for outpatient use. Testing prior to and during treatment: Perform hepatic laboratory, and prothrombin time testing prior to initiating Veklury and during use as clinically appropriate. Renal impairment: No dose adjustment of Veklury is recommended in patients with any degree of renal impairment, including patients on dialysis. Veklury may be administered without regard to the timing of dialysis. Pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy: A pregnancy registry has been established for Veklury. Available clinical trial data for Veklury in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes following second- and third-trimester exposure. There are insufficient data to evaluate the risk of Veklury exposure during the first trimester. Maternal and fetal risks are associated with untreated COVID-19 in pregnancy. Lactation: Veklury can pass into breast milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Veklury and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Veklury or from an underlying maternal condition. Breastfeeding individuals with COVID-19 should follow practices according to clinical guidelines to avoid exposing the infant to COVID-19.

About VIP236 VIP236, the first-in-class small molecule drug conjugate (SMDC) from our VersAptx Platform, consists of an αvβ3 integrin binder, a neutrophil elastase linker cleaved in the tumor microenvironment, and a camptothecin payload optimized for high permeability and low efflux. VIP236 was designed to deliver its payload to advanced/metastatic tumors that express αvβ3. Preclinical data show enhanced efficacy, independent of HER2 status, in patient-derived and cell line-derived gastric cancer models compared with ENHERTU®, an approved ADC. VIP236 is being evaluated in a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial treating patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors (NTC05371054). As VIP236 is a first-in-class drug, the Phase 1 trial is evaluating various dosing schedules. To date, 20 patients with advanced or metastatic disease that has relapsed or is refractory to standard of care have received VIP236. About VIP943 VIP943, the first ADC from our VersAptx platform, consists of an anti-CD123 antibody, a unique linker cleaved intracellularly by legumain, and a novel kinesin spindle protein inhibitor (KSPi) payload enhanced with our CellTrapper® technology. Our proprietary effector chemistry (linker + payload) was designed to reduce non-specific release of the payload and ensure payload accumulation in cancer cells versus healthy cells. The increased therapeutic index has the potential to address challenges associated with many ADCs by improving efficacy and reducing severe toxicities. VIP943 is in a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial evaluating patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia who have exhausted standard therapeutic options (NCT06034275). Preliminary pharmacokinetic data from the first cohort shows low levels of unconjugated payload (VIP716) in circulation, as predicted from preclinical experiments. Reduced nonspecific release of payload is one of many features engineered into VIP943 to increase the therapeutic index compared with existing technologies. We expect to expand into additional CD123-positive indications, including TP53 mutated AML, both as monotherapy and in combination, as safety and efficacy data are generated. Preliminary Phase 1 data are expected in mid-2024. About VersAptx Platform VersAptx is our versatile and adaptable next-generation bioconjugation platform. The modular nature of this innovative platform allows us to combine different targeting, linker, and payload technologies to develop bespoke bioconjugates to address different cancer biologies. With this platform, (i) antibodies and small molecules can be used to target different tumor antigens, (ii) linkers can be designed to reduce non-specific release of the payload, cleave intracellularly or extracellularly, and conjugate to single or multiple payloads, and (iii) payloads can be designed with reduced permeability using our CellTrapper technology to ensure accumulation in cancer cells or to be permeable for release in the tumor microenvironment. The VersAptx platform allows us to optimize these technologies to a specific target and develop bioconjugates designed to address the safety and efficacy challenges of many ADCs and the needs of cancer patients.

The data includes studies on investigational combination regimens, long-acting dosing strategies, and once-weekly integrase strand transfer inhibitor. Results show potential for transforming HIV management and addressing unmet needs. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recent data presented by Gilead Sciences signify a considerable stride in HIV treatment research, particularly in the development of long-acting antiretroviral therapies. The investigational combination of bictegravir and lenacapavir, if approved, could simplify treatment regimens for those on complex therapies, potentially improving adherence and virologic suppression rates. Current HIV treatments often require daily dosing, which can be a barrier to adherence for some patients. A switch to a less complex regimen with a once-daily combination could be a significant improvement in HIV management, especially for the estimated 10% of patients on more complicated regimens. The exploration of long-acting treatments, such as the twice-yearly dosing strategy with lenacapavir and bNAbs, is particularly noteworthy. This approach could revolutionize treatment paradigms by reducing the dosing frequency, thereby addressing one of the critical challenges in HIV treatment adherence. The potential to maintain virologic suppression with such infrequent dosing is a testament to the advancements in pharmaceutical technology and could have profound implications for patient quality of life and public health outcomes. Market Research Analyst Gilead's innovative pipeline and the possibility of introducing new long-acting HIV treatments could have a significant impact on the company's market position. The HIV therapeutic market is highly competitive and the introduction of treatments with varied dosing schedules, such as once-daily, once-weekly and twice-yearly regimens, could provide Gilead with a competitive advantage, catering to diverse patient needs and preferences. Additionally, the potential to switch patients from complex regimens to simpler ones could lead to increased market share in a segment that has been stable for some time due to the chronic nature of HIV treatment. Moreover, the ability to maintain viral suppression with these investigational treatments could lead to a decrease in the transmission of the virus, aligning with public health goals and potentially expanding the market for Gilead's products. The focus on long-acting regimens also positions the company to meet future market demands, as the trend in HIV treatment is moving towards more patient-friendly options that reduce the burden of daily medication intake. Health Economist From an economic standpoint, the shift towards long-acting HIV treatments could result in significant cost savings for healthcare systems. Improved adherence associated with simpler treatment regimens could lead to better health outcomes and a reduction in the need for more intensive healthcare services. The potential reduction in the frequency of dosing with long-acting treatments could also decrease the overall costs associated with medication dispensing and healthcare visits. However, the pricing strategy for these innovative treatments will be crucial. If priced competitively, Gilead's long-acting therapies could become the standard of care, leading to broader adoption and cost-effectiveness at scale. It's essential to consider the economic implications of these treatments, not only in terms of direct costs but also regarding their impact on reducing HIV transmission rates and the associated long-term healthcare savings. 03/05/2024 - 04:30 PM – New Positive Clinical Data Demonstrate Momentum on Investigational Once-Daily, Once-Weekly and Twice-Yearly Dosing Strategies – – Key Findings from Studies Evaluating Potential Future Long-Acting Combination Regimens Affirm Commitment to Continuous Biomedical Innovation – FOSTER CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) today announced the presentation of key data highlighting the breadth of its innovative HIV treatment research pipeline. The latest results explore clinical outcomes from a study evaluating an investigational combination regimen of bictegravir and lenacapavir, new findings from a study evaluating the investigational combination of lenacapavir with broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs), and new proof-of-concept data on GS-1720, a novel once-weekly integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI). The data presented at the 31st Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) demonstrate Gilead’s commitment to advancing the next wave of biomedical innovations in HIV to address the unmet needs of people with the virus and help end the epidemic worldwide. “The latest findings across our HIV pipeline showcase the potential of multiple candidates to help transform HIV management,” said Jared Baeten, MD, PhD, Vice President, HIV Clinical Development, Gilead Sciences. “Exploring a broad range of agents with different dosing frequencies and administration methods is a fundamental aspect of Gilead’s research and development program. By working to provide more options that aim to enhance adherence, we can help more individuals achieve sustained viral suppression, and further help reduce the transmissible virus pool at the population level.” Oral, Once-Daily Combination of Bictegravir and Lenacapavir ARTISTRY-1 (NCT05502341) is an ongoing, open-label, multicenter Phase 2/3 study being conducted to compare the investigational once-daily combination of bictegravir, an integrase strand transfer inhibitor, and lenacapavir, a first-in-class capsid inhibitor, versus current therapy in people with HIV who are virologically suppressed on complex regimens. It is estimated that up to 10% of people with HIV take a complex treatment regimen, defined as 2 or more pills each day. While single-tablet regimens for HIV have been available for well over a decade, some individuals cannot take a single-tablet option, although studies have found greater adherence for one pill, once daily options. In new Phase 2 data, 128 participants on a stable baseline regimen for six or more months prior to screening were randomly allocated in a 2:2:1 ratio to receive once-daily oral bictegravir 75 mg + lenacapavir 25 mg (n=51), bictegravir 75 mg + lenacapavir 50 mg (n=52) or continue their current stable baseline regimen (n=25). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients without virologic suppression (HIV viral load ≥50 copies/mL per FDA Snapshot) at Week 24. Key secondary endpoints included the proportion of participants with virologic suppression (HIV viral load ≤50 copies/mL per FDA Snapshot) and the proportion of participants with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Results showed that all three treatment groups had robust virologic suppression at six months, with consistently low viral loads throughout the study. None of the participants in the lower-dose lenacapavir group or the stable baseline regimen group experienced viral load rebound (≥50 copies/mL) through Week 24. In the higher dose lenacapavir group, only one participant had a viral load increase above the threshold, which was later suppressed without changing the regimen. Additionally, both bictegravir + lenacapavir regimens exhibited favorable safety profiles with similar rates of TEAEs. Up to Week 24, the most common TEAEs in these groups were diarrhea (7%), COVID-19 (6%), and constipation (5%). Drug-related TEAEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 2% of participants receiving bictegravir 75 mg + lenacapavir 50 mg, 2% receiving bictegravir 75 mg + lenacapavir 25 mg, and none in the stable baseline regimen group. The findings help support the efficacy and safety profile of switching individuals with HIV on complex regimens to a potentially less complex combination of bictegravir and lenacapavir. This investigational combination is being further evaluated as a single-tablet regimen in the Phase 3 portion of the ARTISTRY-1 study. Twice-Yearly Dosing with Lenacapavir and bNAbs In a recent Phase 1b study published in The Lancet HIV, the investigational combination of lenacapavir + teropavimab (GS-5423, TAB) + zinlirvimab (GS-2872, ZAB) demonstrated high efficacy and maintained virologic suppression for six months with twice-yearly dosing. To follow up on the potential of this long-acting combination, an additional cohort to the Phase 1B study was added to evaluate the regimen in an expanded population of virologically suppressed adults with HIV on ARV for 18 months or longer with high-level sensitivity to either bNAb, but not both, to determine whether sensitivity to either bNAb impacts the safety profile or efficacy of this investigational combination approach. Doses of TAB and ZAB were weight-based. All participants received lenacapavir (927 mg subcutaneously after oral loading) + TAB (30 mg/kg intravenously [IV]) and were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive two different ZAB doses (Group 1, 10 mg/kg IV; Group 2, 30 mg/kg IV). Eleven participants were randomized and treated (Group 1, n=5; Group 2, n=6). Age range was 28–63 years; 3/11 were female; 4/11 were Black; & median CD4 count was 916 cells/µL. At six months, the investigational long-acting combination of lenacapavir + TAB + ZAB was well tolerated, had a favorable safety profile, and maintained virologic suppression (HIV viral load ≤50 copies/mL) in 8/10 of participants. In addition, each of the six participants in the higher-dose ZAB group maintained virologic suppression at six months, showing the potential of this investigational long-acting treatment regimen with twice-yearly dosing. Of the two participants who experienced virologic rebound, one was diagnosed with acute COVID-19 at the time of rebound, and one rebounded at Week 26. Both had HIV RNA below 100 copies at Week 26. Additionally, one participant restarted baseline antiretroviral therapy due to a protocol violation and was excluded from the efficacy analysis. Safety outcomes were similar between the two groups, and no AEs led to discontinuation of the study drug. There was one instance of a serious adverse event, which involved a soft tissue infection unrelated to study treatment. The investigational combination of lenacapavir + TAB + ZAB has advanced to a Phase 2 study (NCT05729568). Evaluating the combination in virologically suppressed people with HIV, the study will assess safety and efficacy of the regimen in virologically suppressed participants followed longitudinally for multiple doses of the study regimen. An additional observational study from the PRESTIGIO registry investigated susceptibility to the bNAbs TAB and ZAB in individuals with multidrug-resistant (MDR) HIV, who were resistant to four drug classes and may have limited options. In approximately 40% of participants, the virus was susceptible to TAB and ZAB, indicating that certain individuals living with multi-drug resistant HIV may be suitable candidates for future trials investigating long-acting regimens containing TAB and ZAB. Long-Acting, Once-Weekly Dosing New clinical data featured in a late-breaker oral presentation at CROI demonstrate the first proof of concept that an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) has a pharmacokinetic profile suitable for a weekly dosing interval. GS-1720 is a selective INSTI being evaluated as a novel, investigational once-weekly antiretroviral agent in combination with long-acting agents with a goal to provide people with HIV with new long-acting options. The ongoing Phase 1b open-label trial is being conducted in participants with HIV who are treatment-naïve or viremic and off antiretroviral therapy for at least 12 weeks. Twenty-eight people with HIV were randomly allocated to receive doses of GS-1720 (30, 150, 450, or 900 mg) on Day 1 and Day 2 and followed for 10 days. The primary endpoint was the maximum reduction of plasma HIV-1 RNA through post-dose Day 11. Results were presented for each of the four treatment cohorts. GS-1720 demonstrated potential antiviral activity in those participants dosed above 150mg compared to baseline. GS-1720 was generally well tolerated. No participants experienced any serious AEs, Grade 3 or higher TEAEs, or AEs related to study drug. No treatment emergent INSTI resistance was observed at Day 11 for the 450mg and 150mg cohorts; resistance testing is ongoing for the other dose cohorts. These findings support the continued clinical evaluation of GS-1720 as part of a potential novel once-weekly oral HIV treatment option. Gilead’s goal is to discover and develop innovative HIV medicines. We believe the next wave of innovation in HIV includes long-acting options that are aiming to help address the differentiated needs and preferences of the diverse range of individuals and communities affected by the epidemic. Optionality is critical for those who are not able to adhere to current regimens and for helping people with HIV, regardless of where they find themselves on the continuum of care, to improve their individual outcomes and advance public health. Teropavimab (GS-5423, TAB), zinlirvimab (GS-2872, ZAB), and GS-1720 are investigational compounds and are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or any other regulatory authority for any use. The use of these compounds alone or in combination with lenacapavir are investigational. Their safety and efficacy are unknown. Bictegravir and lenacapavir in combination are investigational and not approved anywhere globally. Their safety and efficacy have not yet been established. Lenacapavir, marketed as Sunlenca®, is approved in in Australia, Canada, the European Union, Israel, Japan, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States for the treatment of people with multi-drug resistant HIV in combination with other antiretroviral(s). Please see below for the U.S. Indication and Important Safety Information for Sunlenca. There is currently no cure for HIV or AIDS. About Sunlenca Sunlenca (300 mg tablet and 463.5 mg/1.5 mL injection) [(lenacapavir)] is a first-in-class, long-acting HIV capsid inhibitor indicated for the treatment of HIV infection, in combination with other antiretroviral(s), in adults with multi-drug resistant HIV who are heavily treatment-experienced. Sunlenca is the only HIV treatment option administered twice-yearly. Sunlenca tablets are approved for oral loading during initiation of Sunlenca treatment, prior to or at the time of the first long-acting lenacapavir injection depending on initiation option. The multi-stage mechanism of action of Sunlenca’s active pharmaceutical agent, lenacapavir, is distinguishable from other currently approved classes of antiviral agents. While most antivirals act on just one stage of viral replication, Sunlenca is designed to inhibit HIV at multiple stages of its lifecycle and has no known cross resistance exhibited in vitro to other existing drug classes. Lenacapavir is being developed as a foundation for future HIV therapies. The goal is to offer both long-acting oral and injectable options with various dosing frequencies in combination with other antiretroviral agents for treatment or as a single agent for prevention. This approach aims to help address the individual needs and preferences of people with HIV and people who would benefit from pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The use of lenacapavir for HIV prevention is investigational and the safety and efficacy of lenacapavir for this use have not been established. Lenacapavir is being evaluated as a long-acting option in multiple ongoing and planned early and late-stage clinical studies in Gilead’s HIV prevention and treatment research program. U.S. Indication for Sunlenca Sunlenca, a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) capsid inhibitor, in combination with other antiretroviral(s), is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in heavily treatment-experienced adults with multidrug resistant HIV-1 infection failing their current antiretroviral regimen due to resistance, intolerance, or safety considerations. U.S. Important Safety Information for Sunlenca Contraindications Coadministration: Concomitant administration of SUNLENCA is contraindicated with strong CYP3A inducers. Warnings and precautions Immune reconstitution syndrome, including the occurrence of autoimmune disorders with variable time to onset, has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral (ARV) therapy. Long-acting properties and potential associated risks with SUNLENCA: Residual concentrations of SUNLENCA may remain in the systemic circulation of patients for up to 12 months or longer. SUNLENCA may increase exposure, and potential risk of adverse reactions, to drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A initiated within 9 months after last injection. Counsel patients regarding the dosing schedule because nonadherence could lead to loss of virologic response and development of resistance. If virologic failure occurs, switch to an alternative regimen if possible. If discontinuing SUNLENCA, begin alternate suppressive ARV regimen within 28 weeks from last injection. Injection site reactions may occur, and nodules and indurations may be persistent. Adverse reactions Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥3%, all grades) are injection site reactions (65%) and nausea (4%). Drug interactions Prescribing information: Consult the full prescribing information for SUNLENCA for more information on Contraindications, Warnings, and potentially significant drug interactions, including clinical comments. Enzymes/transporters: Drugs that are strong or moderate inducers of CYP3A may significantly decrease the concentration of SUNLENCA. Drugs that strongly inhibit CYP3A, P-gp, and UGT1A1 together may significantly increase the concentration of SUNLENCA. SUNLENCA may increase the exposure of drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A, when initiated within 9 months after the last injection of SUNLENCA, which may increase the potential risk of adverse reactions. Dosage and administration Dosage: Initiation with 1 of 2 options, followed by maintenance dosing once every 6 months. Tablets may be taken with or without food. Initiation Option 1: Day 1: 927 mg by subcutaneous injection and 600 mg orally (2 x 300-mg tablets). Day 2: 600 mg orally (2 x 300-mg tablets). Initiation Option 2: Day 1: 600 mg orally (2 x 300-mg tablets). Day 2: 600 mg orally (2 x 300-mg tablets). Day 8: 300 mg orally (1 x 300-mg tablet). Day 15: 927 mg by subcutaneous injection. Maintenance: 927 mg by subcutaneous injection every 26 weeks +/- 2 weeks from date of last injection. Missed Dose: During the maintenance period, if more than 28 weeks have elapsed since the last injection and if clinically appropriate to continue SUNLENCA treatment, restart the initiation dosage regimen from Day 1, Option 1 or Option 2. Pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy: There is insufficient human data on the use of SUNLENCA during pregnancy. An Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) has been established. Lactation: Individuals infected with HIV-1 should be instructed not to breastfeed, due to the potential for HIV-1 transmission.

Cboe Global Markets Reports Trading Volume for February 2024,2024-03-05T21:30:00.000Z,Low,Very Negative,"Cboe Global Markets, Inc. reported February trading volume statistics, showing changes in various business segments. Notable increases were seen in index options and Japanese equities, while decreases were noted in Canadian equities and European equities.","Cboe Global Markets Reports Trading Volume for February 2024 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Cboe Global Markets, Inc. reported February trading volume statistics, showing changes in various business segments. Notable increases were seen in index options and Japanese equities, while decreases were noted in Canadian equities and European equities. Positive Positive: Significant growth in index options trading volumes by 19.5% compared to the previous year. Positive: Japanese equities trading volume surged by 63.3% year-over-year, indicating a strong market presence. Negative: Decline in European equities trading volume by 10.3% compared to the prior year, signaling potential challenges in that market. Negative: Canadian equities trading volume dropped by 8.8% year-over-year, reflecting a decrease in market activity. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported trading volume statistics from Cboe Global Markets offer a snapshot of market activity and liquidity across various asset classes. The notable increase in Index options by 16.8% and Japanese Equities by 62.5% year-over-year indicates a shift in investor sentiment or strategy towards these particular segments. This could be attributed to a range of factors, including market volatility, shifts in monetary policy, or geopolitical events influencing these markets.On the other hand, the decrease in Canadian Equities and European Equities by 8.8% and 12.5%, respectively, raises questions about the underlying causes, such as changes in the economic outlook or investor preference for other markets. The Global FX ADNV showed a moderate increase, suggesting steady interest in currency trading, possibly due to ongoing currency fluctuations driven by international trade tensions or policy changes. Financial Analyst The RPC/net revenue capture reported on a one-month lag is a critical metric for assessing the exchange's profitability. Changes in RPC can significantly impact the exchange's financial performance, as it reflects the average revenue per contract or trade. A higher RPC indicates greater revenue efficiency, which could translate into improved earnings. Investors would be keen on this metric to gauge the company's operational efficiency and potential impact on future earnings.Furthermore, the shift in Average Daily Trading Volume (ADV) across different asset classes could signal changing risk appetites among investors and may affect the exchange's transaction-based revenues. The 7.1% increase in U.S. Equities - On-Exchange volume suggests a possible uptrend in retail or institutional participation in the equity markets, which could enhance liquidity and potentially attract more listings and trading activity to Cboe's platforms. Economist These trading statistics can be seen as a barometer for economic activity and investor confidence. For example, the substantial growth in Japanese Equities may reflect optimism about Japan's economic prospects or a favorable exchange rate movement that has attracted foreign investment. Conversely, the decline in European Equities could indicate economic uncertainty in the region, potentially stemming from factors like Brexit or regulatory changes affecting market dynamics.Moreover, the data on Cboe Clear Europe Cleared Trades and Net Settlements provides insights into the clearing and settlement landscape in Europe, which is critical for understanding the robustness of the post-trade environment. The figures might also reflect the impact of regulatory frameworks like MiFID II on European trading activity. 03/05/2024 - 04:30 PM CHICAGO, March 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Cboe Global Markets, Inc.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The appointment of Julia Zhang as Chief Risk Officer (CRO) at Equitable Holdings signifies a strategic move that may reassure investors about the company's commitment to robust risk management, a key aspect for financial services firms. Zhang's promotion from Treasurer to CRO reflects a continuity of internal expertise, which is often viewed positively as it suggests stability and a deep understanding of the company's risk profile. Her previous role in capital and liquidity management, as well as her involvement in the company's hedging and corporate debt programs, indicates a comprehensive grasp of the financial strategies that underpin Equitable Holdings' operations.With Equitable Holdings' share price potentially being sensitive to changes in leadership, especially in positions as crucial as the CRO, Zhang's track record could instill confidence among shareholders. Moreover, her efforts in establishing the FABN program highlight an innovative approach to financing that aligns with current trends in sustainable investment, which could appeal to socially conscious investors and possibly impact the stock positively. Market Research Analyst Equitable Holdings' strategic realignment with Aaron Sarfatti taking on the role of Chief Strategy Officer and Head of Institutional Businesses and New Ventures can be interpreted as a forward-looking initiative aimed at revenue diversification. Sarfatti's new role encompasses P&L responsibility for institutional growth markets, which could be pivotal in the company's future performance. The mention of the in-plan guarantee market as a growth area is particularly noteworthy, as it suggests a focus on innovative retirement solutions that may address market demands for financial security.From a market perspective, Sarfatti's previous experience and his role in the Federal Reserve Board's Insurance Policy Advisory Committee underscore his expertise and could be seen as a strategic advantage for Equitable Holdings in navigating regulatory landscapes and identifying growth opportunities. This could potentially lead to the development of new products and services that cater to untapped markets, thereby creating shareholder value. 03/05/2024 - 04:30 PM Julia Zhang named Chief Risk Officer Chief Strategy Officer, Aaron Sarfatti, to lead institutional businesses and new ventures NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Equitable Holdings, Inc.

Negative None. 03/05/2024 - 04:30 PM Under Pendery's leadership, the breakfast & brunch brand grew successfully from one California restaurant to more than 520 nationwide BRADENTON, Fla., March 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- His bold words are plastered on the walls of the Florida-based restaurant company's Home Office and serve as a constant reminder and permanent edict from the beloved hospitality leader: ""Culture is integrity. It's honesty. It's respect."" First Watch announced today that co-founder and longtime leader Ken Pendery passed away on March 4, 2024, after a battle with Multiple System Atrophy, a rare neurological disorder. He was 70. Pendery retired from the company's board of directors in 2022 after 38 years with the breakfast, brunch and lunch concept. During his extensive and influential tenure, he and co-founder John Sullivan moved the company's operations from California to the Gulf Coast of Florida in the mid-1980s. Pendery assumed the role of CEO in the late '90s. During his time at the helm, First Watch grew from about 50 restaurants in 1998 to more than 330 in 2018, when he transitioned from CEO to executive chairman. After working together for 12 years, successor and current CEO and President Chris Tomasso continued the successful expansion to more than 450 restaurants by the time Pendery stepped down from the board of directors four years later. Today, First Watch operates more than 520 restaurants in 29 states. ""Ken's impact and influence is – and will forever be – felt throughout our organization,"" said Tomasso. ""He was a mentor and dear friend, and the epitome of the 'You First' culture our company is built upon. Everyone who crossed his path is better for it. Our hearts go out to his family, and we will carry his memory fondly."" Regarded as a beloved leader and dear friend, Pendery cared deeply about the value of trust, humility, doing the right thing and having only the highest of standards. He instilled in each new leader their crucial and primary responsibility: company culture. Pendery was adamant that the behaviors of just one person can strengthen and embolden a culture or destroy it, and he found it his mission to protect the integrity of culture. Today, Pendery's legacy lives on through First Watch's ""5 Steps of Service,"" first written on the back of a napkin in 1987, and his 10 Commandments (now ""Commitments""). Beginning with ""Welcome with warmth"" and ending with ""Act with infectious positivity,"" the tenets are actively trained and practiced in each restaurant. Pendery is survived by his wife, Jenny; two children, Trey (Maureen) and Libby (Kevin); and four grandchildren, Woods, Nora, Sita and Red. A private service will take place later this month.

About Acrivon Therapeutics Acrivon is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing precision oncology medicines that it matches to patients whose tumors are predicted to be sensitive to each specific medicine by utilizing Acrivon’s proprietary proteomics-based patient responder identification platform, Acrivon Predictive Precision Proteomics, or AP3. The AP3 platform is engineered to measure compound-specific effects on the entire tumor cell protein signaling network and drug-induced resistance mechanisms in an unbiased manner. These distinctive capabilities enable AP3’s direct application for drug design optimization for monotherapy activity, the identification of rational drug combinations, and the creation of drug-specific proprietary OncoSignature companion diagnostics that are used to identify the patients most likely to benefit from Acrivon’s drug candidates. Acrivon is currently advancing its lead candidate, ACR-368, a selective small molecule inhibitor targeting CHK1 and CHK2 in a potentially registrational Phase 2 trial across multiple tumor types. The company has received Fast Track designation from the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the investigation of ACR-368 as monotherapy based on OncoSignature-predicted sensitivity in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian or endometrial cancer. Acrivon’s ACR-368 OncoSignature test, which has not yet obtained regulatory approval, has been extensively evaluated in preclinical studies, including in two separate, blinded, prospectively-designed studies on pretreatment tumor biopsies collected from past third-party Phase 2 trials in patients with ovarian cancer treated with ACR-368. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Device designation for the ACR-368 OncoSignature assay for the identification of ovarian cancer patients who may benefit from ACR-368 treatment. In addition to ACR-368, Acrivon is also leveraging its proprietary AP3 precision medicine platform for developing its co-crystallography-driven, internally-discovered preclinical stage pipeline programs. These include ACR-2316, a potent, selective WEE1/PKMYT1 inhibitor with single-agent activity, and a cell cycle program with an undisclosed target.

About CB-012CB-012 is a product candidate from Caribou’s allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy platform being evaluated in the AMpLify Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (r/r AML). CB-012 is an anti-CLL-1 CAR-T cell therapy engineered with five genome edits, enabled by Caribou’s patented next-generation CRISPR technology platform, which uses Cas12a chRDNA genome editing to significantly improve the specificity of genome edits. To Caribou’s knowledge, CB-012 is the first allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy with both checkpoint disruption, through a PD-1 knockout, and immune cloaking, through a B2M knockout and B2M–HLA-E fusion protein insertion; both armoring strategies are designed to improve antitumor activity. Additional information on the AMpLify trial (NCT06128044) can be found at clinicaltrials.gov. About Caribou’s novel next-generation CRISPR platform CRISPR genome editing uses easily designed, modular biological tools to make DNA changes in living cells. There are two basic components of Class 2 CRISPR systems: the nuclease protein that cuts DNA and the RNA molecule(s) that guide the nuclease to generate a site-specific, double-stranded break, leading to an edit at the targeted genomic site. CRISPR systems are capable of editing unintended genomic sites, known as off-target editing, which may lead to harmful effects on cellular function and phenotype. In response to this challenge, Caribou has developed CRISPR hybrid RNA-DNA guides (chRDNAs; pronounced “chardonnays”) that direct substantially more precise genome editing compared to all-RNA guides. Caribou is deploying the power of its Cas12a chRDNA technology to carry out high efficiency multiple edits, including multiplex gene insertions, to develop CRISPR-edited therapies. About Caribou Biosciences, Inc.Caribou Biosciences is a clinical-stage CRISPR genome-editing biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing transformative therapies for patients with devastating diseases. The company’s genome-editing platform, including its Cas12a chRDNA technology, enables superior precision to develop cell therapies that are armored to potentially improve antitumor activity. Caribou is advancing a pipeline of off-the-shelf cell therapies from its CAR-T and CAR-NK platforms as readily available treatments for patients with hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.

(Nasdaq: BDTX), a clinical-stage oncology company developing MasterKey therapies that target families of oncogenic mutations in patients with cancer, today announced an upcoming oral presentation at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2024, taking place April 5-10 in San Diego, California. The presentation will describe real world data of the evolving EGFR mutation landscape in patients with NSCLC, highlighting the increasing relevance of “non-classical” EGFR mutations, which can be found in up to 30% of EGFRm NSCLC. The presentation will also describe the profile of BDTX-1535, an oral, brain-penetrant MasterKey inhibitor that selectively targets more than 50 oncogenic EGFR mutations. Abstract Number: 1229Title: BDTX-1535 – A MasterKey EGFR Inhibitor Targeting Classical, Non-Classical and the C797S Resistance Mutation to Address the Evolved Landscape of EGFR Mutant NSCLCSession Title: MinisymposiaSession Date and Time: Sunday, April 7, 2024, 3:00-5:00pm PDT Location: San Diego Convention Center About BDTX-1535BDTX-1535 is an oral, brain-penetrant MasterKey inhibitor of oncogenic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), including classical driver mutations, families of non-classical driver mutations (e.g., L747P, L718Q), acquired resistance C797S mutation, and complex mutations. BDTX-1535 is a fourth-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that potently inhibits, based on preclinical data, more than 50 oncogenic EGFR mutations expressed across a diverse group of patients with NSCLC in multiple lines of therapy. Based on preclinical data, BDTX-1535 also inhibits EGFR extracellular domain mutations and alterations commonly expressed in glioblastoma (GBM) and avoids paradoxical activation observed with earlier generation reversible TKIs. A “window of opportunity” trial of BDTX-1535 in patients with GBM is ongoing (NCT06072586) and a Phase 2 trial is currently ongoing in patients with NSCLC (NCT05256290). About Black Diamond TherapeuticsBlack Diamond Therapeutics is a clinical-stage oncology company focused on the development of MasterKey therapies that address families of oncogenic mutations in clinically validated targets. The Company’s MasterKey therapies are designed to address broad genetically defined patient populations, overcome resistance, minimize wild-type mediated toxicities, and be brain penetrant to treat CNS disease.

The accepted abstracts are available on the AACR conference website: https://www.aacr.org/meeting/aacr-annual-meeting-2024/. About GFH375 (VS-7375) GFH375 (VS-7375) is a potential best-in-class, potent and selective oral KRAS G12D (ON/OFF) inhibitor, identified as the lead program from the Verastem Oncology discovery and development collaboration with GenFleet Therapeutics. GenFleet plans to submit an IND in China for GFH375 (VS-7375) in the first half of 2024, and upon approval GenFleet is expected to initiate a Phase 1 trial in China in the second half of 2024. The collaboration includes three discovery programs, the first being the KRAS G12D inhibitor, and will provide Verastem Oncology with exclusive options to obtain licenses to each of the three compounds in the collaboration after successful completion of pre-determined milestones in Phase 1 trials. The licenses would give Verastem Oncology development and commercialization rights outside of the GenFleet markets of mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. About the Avutometinib and Defactinib Combination Avutometinib is a RAF/MEK clamp that induces inactive complexes of MEK with ARAF, BRAF and CRAF potentially creating a more complete and durable anti-tumor response through maximal RAS/MAPK pathway inhibition. In contrast to currently available MEK-only inhibitors, avutometinib blocks both MEK kinase activity and the ability of RAF to phosphorylate MEK. This unique mechanism allows avutometinib to block MEK signaling without the compensatory activation of MEK that appears to limit the efficacy of other MEK-only inhibitors. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for the combination of Verastem Oncology’s investigational RAF/MEK clamp avutometinib, with defactinib, a selective FAK inhibitor, for the treatment of all patients with recurrent low-grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSOC) regardless of KRAS status after one or more prior lines of therapy, including platinum-based chemotherapy. Verastem Oncology is currently conducting clinical trials with its RAF/MEK clamp avutometinib in RAS/MAPK driven tumors as part of its (Raf And Mek Program). RAMP 301 (NCT06072781) is a Phase 3 confirmatory trial evaluating the combination of avutometinib and defactinib versus standard chemotherapy or hormonal therapy for the treatment of recurrent LGSOC. RAMP 201 (NCT04625270) is a Phase 2 registration-directed trial of avutometinib in combination with defactinib in patients with recurrent LGSOC and has completed enrollment in the dose optimization, expansion phase, and low-dose evaluation cohorts. Verastem Oncology has established clinical collaborations with Amgen and Mirati to evaluate LUMAKRAS™ (sotorasib) and KRAZATI™ (adagrasib) in combination with avutometinib in KRAS G12C mutant NSCLC as part of the RAMP 203 (NCT05074810) and RAMP 204 (NCT05375994) trials, respectively. Supported by the “Therapeutic Accelerator Award” Verastem Oncology received from PanCAN, the Company is conducting RAMP 205 (NCT05669482), a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial evaluating avutometinib and defactinib with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in patients with front-line metastatic pancreatic cancer. About Verastem Oncology Verastem Oncology (Nasdaq: VSTM) is a late-stage development biopharmaceutical company committed to the development and commercialization of new medicines to improve the lives of patients diagnosed with cancer.

Core Scientific Announces February 2024 Production and Operations Updates,2024-03-05T21:19:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Core Scientific, Inc. provided an update for February 2024, operating 222,000 bitcoin miners and earning 893 self-mined bitcoin with customers earning 307 bitcoin. The company increased its self-mining hash rate, completed all payments for miner orders in 2024, and focused on new miner purchases and infrastructure growth.","Core Scientific Announces February 2024 Production and Operations Updates Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Core Scientific, Inc. provided an update for February 2024, operating 222,000 bitcoin miners and earning 893 self-mined bitcoin with customers earning 307 bitcoin. The company increased its self-mining hash rate, completed all payments for miner orders in 2024, and focused on new miner purchases and infrastructure growth. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The operational update from Core Scientific, Inc. indicates a strategic maneuvering in the highly competitive bitcoin mining industry. The company's ability to increase its self-mining hash rate by a substantial 300 petahash, through the redeployment of previous generation miners, is a testament to its agility in optimizing resources for better returns. Despite a slight decrease in self-mined bitcoin from January to February, the company's earnings from bitcoin sales remain robust, with proceeds approximating $46.7 million in February. This reflects a dynamic pricing strategy that leverages spot market conditions.From a financial perspective, the completion of all miner payments due in 2024 for the S19j XPs and S21s is a critical step towards reducing future financial liabilities and strengthening the balance sheet. This preemptive fulfillment of financial obligations should reassure investors about the company's fiscal prudence and its commitment to managing capital expenditures effectively. The impact on stock performance will likely hinge on the broader cryptocurrency market trends and investor sentiment towards the sector's volatility. Market Research Analyst Core Scientific's update highlights significant developments in their operational capabilities, with the operation of approximately 222,000 bitcoin miners. The total energized hash rate of 25.1 EH/s represents a substantial share of the global bitcoin mining power, which is a critical factor in maintaining competitiveness. The strategic focus on increasing self-mining efficiency, as seen in the reduction of the average self-mining fleet efficiency to 26.79 J/TH, is indicative of the company's commitment to technological advancements and energy efficiency.Moreover, the company's efforts to support the electrical grid by delivering 941 megawatt hours to local grid partners in February not only demonstrate corporate responsibility but also may provide a buffer against regulatory pressures concerning energy consumption by cryptocurrency miners. This dual approach of operational excellence and community engagement could position Core Scientific favorably in the eyes of potential investors who are increasingly valuing sustainability and corporate citizenship. Energy Sector Analyst Core Scientific's engagement in grid support services is a noteworthy aspect of their operations, as it reflects a strategic alignment with energy sector trends towards demand response programs. By reducing power consumption at strategic times, the company contributes to grid stability, which can be particularly valuable during peak demand periods. This not only enhances the company's reputation as a responsible energy consumer but also potentially opens up additional revenue streams through participation in demand response programs.The energy sector's increasing focus on integrating renewable energy sources and maintaining grid stability presents both challenges and opportunities for energy-intensive industries like bitcoin mining. Core Scientific's proactive approach to grid support could serve as a model for other companies in the sector, potentially mitigating some of the regulatory risks associated with high energy consumption and aligning with broader societal goals for energy efficiency and sustainability. 03/05/2024 - 04:19 PM Core Scientific, Inc. February ‘24 Update - Operated approximately 222,000 owned and hosted bitcoin miners Earned 893 self-mined bitcoin and our customers earned an estimated 307 bitcoin in our data centers in February Increased self-mining hash rate by redeploying previous generation miners Completed all payments due in 2024 for previously announced miner orders AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Core Scientific, Inc. (Nasdaq: CORZ, CORZW, CORZZ) (""Core Scientific"" or “the Company”), a leader in bitcoin mining and digital infrastructure for emerging high-value compute, today released production and operations updates for February 2024. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240305231273/en/Core Scientific designs its data centers with heat aisles to optimize miner performance without HVAC systems (Photo: Business Wire) “Owning our own infrastructure provides us with strategic flexibility to respond rapidly to dynamic market conditions,” said Adam Sullivan, Core Scientific’s Chief Executive Officer. “For example, we increased our self-mining hash rate by 300 petahash largely by redeploying earlier-generation miners. These miners had been replaced with more efficient S19j XP units in January, using newly activated capacity. Capitalizing on strong spot bitcoin pricing, quickly reactivating these miners boosted our hash rate and enhances our bitcoin earnings.” “From a capital expenditures perspective, we continue to manage our investments carefully to ensure our ongoing financial strength. To that end, we completed all miner payments due in 2024 for the S19j XPs and S21s we previously announced, enabling us to focus our remaining investments this year on new miner purchases and our organic infrastructure growth plans,” Mr. Sullivan added.

Self-Mining Core Scientific earned 893 bitcoin in February from its owned fleet of miners. As of month end, the Company operated approximately 171,000 owned bitcoin miners, accounting for approximately 77% of its total number of miners and representing a total energized hash rate of 18.9 EH/s. Hosting Services In addition to its self-mining fleet, Core Scientific provided data center hosting services, technology and operating support for approximately 51,000 hosted, customer-owned bitcoin miners, representing approximately 23% of the bitcoin miners operating in the Company’s data centers as of February 29. Customer-owned bitcoin miners earned an estimated 307 bitcoin in February, including bitcoin rewards paid to the Company pursuant to proceeds sharing agreements. Grid Support The Company reduced the consumption of power at its data centers on several occasions in February, delivering 941 megawatt hours to local grid partners. By supporting the grid in such a fashion, Core Scientific helps grid operators keep power flowing to their customers when temperatures rise and air conditioning use increases, and when temperatures drop and heating use increases. Core Scientific works with utility companies and the communities in which it operates to enhance electrical grid stability. New Miner Deployments As a result of the deployment of 28,400 new S19j XP miners procured from Bitmain under a contract announced on September 21, 2023, and completed this January, a number of prior generation bitcoin miners were de-energized. These de-energized miners were redeployed and re-energized using newly available capacity at two of the Company’s data centers, contributing to an increase in self-mining hash rate. The Company completed all payments due for the Bitmain S19j XP miners and completed all payments due in 2024 for the additional 2.5 exahash in Bitmain S21 miners previously announced, while also accelerating their delivery to begin in mid-March, 2024. ABOUT CORE SCIENTIFIC Core Scientific is one of the largest bitcoin miners and hosting solutions providers for bitcoin mining in North America. Transforming energy into high value compute with superior efficiency at scale, we employ our own large fleet of computers (“miners”) to earn bitcoin for our own account and provide hosting services for large bitcoin mining customers at our seven operational data centers in Georgia (2), Kentucky (1), North Carolina (1), North Dakota (1) and Texas (2). We derive the majority of our revenue from earning bitcoin for our own account (“self-mining”).

Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Viper Energy, Inc. (VNOM) announces a secondary offering of 11,500,000 shares of its Class A common stock by its parent company, Diamondback Energy, Inc. The offering, led by J.P. Morgan and other underwriters, includes an option for an additional 1,725,000 shares. Viper will not receive any proceeds from the sale. Positive None. Negative The secondary offering may dilute existing shareholders' ownership due to the increased number of shares in the market, potentially impacting the stock price negatively. Financial Analyst The launch of a substantial secondary offering, as seen with Viper Energy, Inc., typically indicates a strategic move by the parent company to divest or redistribute assets. In this case, Diamondback Energy, Inc.'s decision to sell 11,500,000 shares of Viper's Class A common stock could be motivated by several factors, including the desire to raise capital for other investments, pay down debt, or reallocate resources within its portfolio.The market's response to such an offering can vary. If investors perceive this move as a lack of confidence by Diamondback in Viper's future prospects, it might negatively affect Viper's stock price. Conversely, if the market views this as a positive step towards Diamondback's financial health or strategic repositioning, it could have a neutral or even positive impact. Moreover, the granting of a 30-day option for underwriters to purchase additional shares provides a buffer against potential market fluctuations and can help stabilize the stock price post-offering. Market Research Analyst Secondary offerings are common in the energy sector, where capital-intensive projects and fluctuating commodity prices often require companies to seek additional funding. The involvement of notable financial institutions such as J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs as joint book-running managers can be seen as a vote of confidence in the process, potentially attracting institutional investors and lending credibility to the offering.It's important to analyze the timing of the Secondary Offering within the context of the current energy market and broader economic conditions. Factors such as oil prices, regulatory changes, or shifts in energy demand could significantly influence investor interest. The market's reception of this offering could serve as a bellwether for the energy sector's access to capital markets, especially in a time when the industry is facing transitions towards renewable energy sources and sustainability goals. Legal Expert The legal framework surrounding a secondary offering is crucial in ensuring compliance with securities regulations. The use of an effective automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 indicates that Viper Energy has previously met the regulatory criteria to qualify for this expedited process, which is reserved for well-established issuers. This can streamline the offering process and reduce the time frame for accessing public markets, thereby potentially minimizing market disruption and the impact on Viper's stock price.However, the legal stipulation that the offering is subject to market and other conditions underscores the inherent uncertainties associated with such financial maneuvers. This conditionality serves as a legal safeguard, allowing for the offering to be adjusted or withdrawn in response to unfavorable market conditions or other unforeseen events, mitigating legal and financial risks for both Viper and its parent company, Diamondback Energy. 03/05/2024 - 04:23 PM MIDLAND, Texas, March 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Viper Energy, Inc.

(NYSE: TXO) declared a distribution of $0.58 per common unit for Q4 2023. The company focuses on long-lived production, reducing activity due to natural gas price volatility. Financial discipline drives cash flow and future value. Annual Report on Form 10-K to be filed, with a focus on foreign unitholder tax implications. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst TXO Partners, L.P. has declared a distribution of $0.58 per common unit for the last quarter, which is a critical indicator of the company's profitability and financial health. Distributions are a direct reflection of the company's cash flow and its ability to generate earnings. Investors often view consistent or increasing distributions as a sign of a company's stability and a positive outlook, which can influence the stock's attractiveness and perceived value.Given the volatile nature of natural gas prices, TXO's strategy to reduce activity and spending is a conservative approach to preserve capital and maintain financial discipline. This decision may impact short-term growth prospects but could be seen as a strategic move to ensure long-term stability and operational efficiency. The focus on long-term cash flow planning and efficient capital allocation is essential, as it suggests that the company prioritizes sustainable growth over aggressive expansion, which can be reassuring for investors concerned about the risks associated with commodity price fluctuations. Market Research Analyst The mention of TXO's operations in the legacy basins, such as the Vacuum Field in the Permian Basin, highlights the company's investment in established oil-producing regions. The Permian Basin is known for its rich reserves and has been a focal point for energy companies. TXO's allocation of approximately $25 million for reservoir exploitation indicates a targeted approach to production, which could lead to operational efficiencies and optimized output.Investors and market analysts will be interested in how TXO's strategic investments and operational adjustments align with broader market trends in the energy sector. The ability to navigate the complexities of commodity price volatility while maintaining a stable production outlook is crucial for TXO's market position and can influence investor sentiment and stock performance in the energy sector. Legal Expert The press release includes a notice regarding the withholding of federal income tax for distributions to foreign unitholders. This is significant for international investors, as it affects the net income they receive from their investments. The adherence to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1446-4(b) ensures compliance with U.S. tax laws, which is an important consideration for foreign investors and can impact the attractiveness of TXO's units to a global investor base.Understanding the tax implications is essential for brokers and nominees who handle distributions on behalf of foreign unitholders, as they are responsible for the withholding and remittance of taxes. Proper handling of these obligations is critical to maintaining investor trust and ensuring legal compliance, which can indirectly influence the company's reputation and financial standing. 03/05/2024 - 04:18 PM FORT WORTH, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- TXO Partners, L.P. (NYSE: TXO) announced today that the Board of Directors of its general partner declared a distribution of $0.58 per common unit for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. The quarterly distribution will be paid on March 28, 2024, to eligible unitholders of record as of the close of trading on March 15, 2024. “We celebrate the success of our first year as a public company with a secure asset base and a confident business plan for our owners,” stated Bob R. Simpson, Chairman and CEO. “Our focus on long-lived production in legacy basins allows us flexibility. With the volatile natural gas prices due to a warm winter, we are reducing activity and spending for the year as the industry adjusts. That said, we expect stable production in 2024 and are optimistic for stronger commodity prices ahead.” “Our financial discipline is the key component of the TXO strategy,” further commented President of Business Operations and CFO, Brent Clum. “Through efficient capital allocation, our team generates a cash flow plan with long-term vision. As a result, we confidently deliver distributions while accreting future value for our unit-holders.” “As commodity prices declined in the second half of 2023, we reduced development activities for the year. Our operations team completed the facility repairs and upgrades at the plant in the Vacuum Field in the second half of December,” stated Keith A. Hutton, President of Production and Development. “The field plans for 2024 are to invest approximately $25 million to exploit our reservoirs, with the primary focus in the Vacuum Field of the Permian Basin.” Annual Report on Form 10-K TXO's financial statements and related footnotes will be available in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which TXO will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) today.

Negative None. Biopharmaceutical Analyst The recent developments by 23andMe in the realm of immuno-oncology are indicative of the company's strategic pivot from genetic testing towards therapeutic solutions. The IND clearance by the FDA for 23ME-01473 is a critical milestone, as it represents regulatory validation of the compound's potential and allows for the initiation of human trials. This progress is particularly significant given the novelty of the target, ULBP6, which has been identified through the company's proprietary genetic database. The dual mechanism of action of '1473, which includes Fc-effector enhancement, suggests a differentiated approach to cancer immunotherapy that could potentially offer enhanced efficacy over existing treatments.Investors should closely monitor the Phase 2a clinical study of 23ME-00610, an inhibitor of the CD200R1 receptor. The drug's progression into mid-stage trials underscores its therapeutic promise, especially in the context of combination therapies. The potential for '00610 to synergize with other anti-tumor agents could be a game-changer, offering a new avenue for treatment regimens in oncology.The impact on 23andMe's stock could be substantial, as successful clinical outcomes may lead to significant value creation, given the high unmet need in cancer treatment. However, investors should also consider the inherent risks associated with drug development, including the possibility of clinical trial failures, regulatory hurdles and the competitive landscape of immuno-oncology drugs. Medical Research Analyst The focus on ULBP6 by 23andMe represents an innovative approach to immuno-oncology, targeting a mechanism that tumors use to evade immune detection. By blocking the interaction of soluble ULBP ligands with the NKG2D receptor, '1473 could potentially reinstate the immune system's ability to recognize and destroy cancer cells. This mechanism, coupled with the Fc-effector function, which may enhance the ability of NK cells to induce apoptosis in cancer cells, positions '1473 as a promising candidate in the field of targeted cancer immunotherapies.Furthermore, the non-clinical insights into 23ME-00610's inhibition of the CD200R1 pathway provide a glimpse into the strategic use of checkpoint inhibitors that modulate immune responses. This inhibitor's role in enhancing the activity of T and NK cells, either as a monotherapy or in combination with other treatments, aligns with current trends in oncology research focusing on the immune checkpoint pathways.For stakeholders, the implications are twofold: the potential for new, effective cancer treatments and the demonstration of 23andMe's capabilities in leveraging its genetic database for drug discovery. The presentations at the AACR Annual Meeting will be pivotal in shaping the scientific community's reception of these therapies and could influence future research collaborations and partnerships. Oncology Doctor ULBP6's identification as an immuno-oncology target underscores the intersection of genetics and cancer therapy. As a clinician, the prospect of a monoclonal antibody like '1473 that can reinvigorate anti-tumor NK cell function is promising. NK cells play a crucial role in the innate immune response against malignancies and enhancing their function could lead to more effective cancer immunotherapies. The potential benefits of restoring immune cell recognition and killing of cancer cells by blocking the immunosuppressive effects of soluble ULBP ligands are significant.Additionally, the advancement of 23ME-00610 into Phase 2a trials suggests it could become an important tool in the oncologist's arsenal, particularly for patients who may not respond to other forms of immunotherapy. The exploration of the CD200R1 pathway as a target for immunomodulation reflects the ongoing evolution of cancer treatment strategies toward precision medicine.It is essential to remain cautious, as the safety and efficacy of these treatments must be established through rigorous clinical trials. The forthcoming data presentations will be critical in determining the clinical viability of these therapies and their potential impact on patient care. 03/05/2024 - 04:30 PM 23andMe to give an oral presentation on the genetic signature of ULBP6, the target of 23ME-01473, along with poster presentations of the biology of ULBP6 and mechanism of 23ME-01473, and new non-clinical insights for 23ME-00610, targeting the CD200R1 pathwaySOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., March 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 23andMe Holding Co. (Nasdaq: ME) (“23andMe”), a leading human genetics and biopharmaceutical company, today announced an oral presentation and two poster presentations on two of the Company’s immuno-oncology programs that will be presented at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2024, taking place in San Diego, CA, April 5-10, 2024. The oral presentation will detail the use of the 23andMe genetic and health survey database to discover ULBP6, the highest affinity ligand of the NK and T-cell activation receptor, NKG2D. ULBP6 is the primary target for 23ME-01473 (‘1473), a dual mechanism monoclonal antibody. The Company will also present a poster on the biology of ULBP6, and how ‘1473 reinvigorates anti-tumor NK cell function through NKG2D and FcγRIIIa activation. These presentations will be the first scientific communications the Company has prepared on ‘1473 since announcing its pursuit of this novel, genetically-validated target. The FDA recently cleared the IND application for ‘1473, which targets ULBP6. Cancers escape immune cell recognition by shedding ULBP ligands from their cell surface, which act as immunosuppressive molecular decoys. Blocking the binding of soluble ULBP6 to NKG2D with ‘1473 may restore immune cell recognition and killing of cancers. Further, ‘1473 is Fc-effector enhanced, which provides an additional mechanism for NK cells to induce cell death of ULBP6-expressing cancer cells. 23andMe will also present a non-clinical poster on 23ME-00610, an inhibitor of the CD200R1 receptor, which will include new insights into targeting the CD200R1 pathway in T and NK cells using 23ME-00610 as a single agent or in combination with other anti-tumor therapies. 23ME-00610 is currently in Phase 2a of a Phase 1/2a clinical study. The presentations will be available on the 23andMe Investor Relations and Therapeutics websites on April 5, 2024.

ULBPs are stress-induced ligands found on the surface of cancer cells that bind to their receptor, NKG2D, on NK and T cells. Cancers escape immune cell recognition by shedding ULBP ligands from their cell surface, which act as immunosuppressive molecular decoys. Blocking the binding of soluble ULBP6 to NKG2D may restore immune cell recognition and killing of cancers. Further, ‘1473 is Fc-effector enhanced, which provides an additional mechanism for NK cells to induce cell death of ULBP6-expressing cancer cells. 23andMe plans to evaluate ‘1473 in participants with advanced solid tumors in a Phase 1 clinical study beginning in the first half of 2024. Clinical trials registry (clinicaltrials.gov): NCT06290388. About 23ME-0061023ME-00610 is a high-affinity, fully humanized monoclonal antibody that is designed to bind to CD200R1 and prevent the interaction of CD200R1 with CD200. The CD200–CD200R1 axis is an immunological checkpoint that plays a pivotal role in maintenance of immune tolerance. CD200R1 is an inhibitory receptor expressed on T cells and myeloid cells while CD200, the ligand for CD200R1, is highly expressed on certain tumors. In preclinical studies, binding of tumor-associated CD200 to CD200R1 leads to immune suppression and decreased immune cell killing of cancer cells. Preclinical data indicate that this mechanism has the potential to restore the ability for both T-cells and myeloid cells to kill cancer cells.

The abstracts include data on Lyell's rejuvenation technology, LYL119 CAR T-cell therapy, and tumor-restricted IL-12 technology. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recently disclosed nonclinical data from Lyell Immunopharma's research into T-cell reprogramming technologies represents a significant advancement in the field of adoptive cell therapy for cancer treatment. The rejuvenation technology, aimed at reversing the epigenetic age of T cells, could potentially overcome a major hurdle in cancer immunotherapy: the age-related decline in T-cell function. By generating T cells with more stem-like properties and enhanced proliferation ability, this approach might improve the success rates of T-cell therapies in solid tumors, which have historically faced challenges due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.Furthermore, the development of LYL119, a second-generation CAR T-cell therapy targeting ROR1, is particularly noteworthy. The preclinical data suggests that LYL119 could maintain efficacy across a range of doses and exhibit reduced T-cell exhaustion, a common issue that limits the longevity and effectiveness of CAR T-cell therapies. If these results translate to the clinical setting, it could lead to more durable responses in patients with solid tumors. Oncology Doctor The introduction of tumor-restricted IL-12 (trIL-12) technology is a promising development in enhancing the specificity and safety profile of T-cell therapies. IL-12's role as an immune-stimulatory cytokine is well-documented, but its systemic administration has been limited by significant toxicity. The localized delivery of IL-12 activity within the tumor microenvironment could provide a powerful stimulus for antitumor T-cell responses without the systemic side effects. This strategy aligns with the current trend in oncology to increase the precision of immunotherapies and reduce off-target effects, potentially improving patient outcomes and expanding the applicability of T-cell therapies to a broader range of cancers. Biotechnology Market Analyst The acceptance of Lyell Immunopharma's abstracts for presentation at the AACR Annual Meeting may have a positive impact on the company's valuation and investor perception, signaling progress in their pipeline. The advancements in their T-cell reprogramming technologies could position Lyell as a leader in the competitive field of cell therapy for solid tumors. As investors seek companies with innovative and potentially disruptive technologies, Lyell's progress in this area could attract increased investment and partnership opportunities. However, it is critical to monitor how these nonclinical findings translate into clinical outcomes, as the true test of these technologies' impact will be their safety and efficacy in human trials. 03/05/2024 - 04:30 PM SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., March 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lyell Immunopharma, Inc. (Nasdaq: LYEL), a clinical‑stage T-cell reprogramming company advancing a diverse pipeline of cell therapies for patients with solid tumors, announced that three abstracts of new nonclinical data have been accepted for presentation at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2024 taking place in San Diego, CA, April 5-10. One oral and two poster presentations will highlight data from Lyell’s product pipeline and research programs, including: An oral presentation on Lyell’s rejuvenation technology which has shown the potential to turn back the epigenetic clock to generate more stem-like T cells with reduced epigenetic age and enhanced proliferation abilityA poster presentation of nonclinical data on LYL119, Lyell’s second-generation ROR1-targeted CAR T-cell product candidateA poster presentation on technology being advanced through a collaboration between Lyell and Outpace to enable tumor-restricted IL-12 activity to enhance solid tumor T cell therapies Details on the presentations are below. An oral presentation titled “Rejuvenation of Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes: A novel strategy to revitalize TIL antitumor function for cell therapy” will highlight Lyell’s rejuvenation technology which has shown the potential to generate T cells with reduced epigenetic age, more stem-like properties and enhanced proliferation ability. Previously published studies have demonstrated the decline in T-cell function as a person ages. These new nonclinical data show tumor infiltrating lympyocytes (TIL) rejuvenated with Lyell’s technology retain a broad T-cell receptor repertoire and demonstrate sustained proliferation and improved antitumor activities in vivo. Presentation details: Session Date/Time: Tuesday Apr 9, 2024 2:30 PM - 4:30 PMAbstract Number: 6593Session Category: ImmunologySession Title: New Insights for Therapies Modulating Antitumor T-Cell Responses New nonclinical data on LYL119, Lyell’s second-generation ROR1-targeted CAR T-cell therapy, will be presented in a poster titled “LYL119, a Preclinical ROR1-Targeted CAR T-Cell Product Incorporating Four Novel Reprogramming Technologies Designed for Effective Cell Therapy for Solid Tumors.” LYL119 incorporates four of Lyell’s complementary, stackable T-cell reprogramming technologies and is designed to create potent ROR1-targeted CAR T cells with durable function. In this study, LYL119 demonstrated superior in vivo antitumor efficacy in a mouse xenograft tumor model across a 10-fold dose range, including at very low cell doses. In addition, following repeated rounds of tumor cell killing, LYL119, displayed reduced expression of exhaustion-related gene signatures and retained unique cell subsets characterized by upregulation of memory and effector-associated gene signatures. Presentation details: Session Date and Time: Sunday Apr 7, 2024 1:30 PM - 5:00 PMAbstract Number: 49Session Category: ImmunologySession Title: Adoptive Cell Therapies 2: CAR-T Cells A poster presentation titled “Development of Tumor-restricted IL-12 With Antigen-dependent Expression and Localized IL-12 Activity” highlights an innovative tumor-restricted IL-12 (trIL-12) technology that delivers potent IL-12 stimulation at the tumor site while avoiding systemic exposure. IL-12 is an immune-stimulatory cytokine that can induce potent anti-tumor activity, but unregulated systemic delivery of IL-12 has been shown to have a limited therapeutic window. trIL-12 was designed leveraging Outpace’s OUTSMART™ technology to rapidly auto-inactivate IL-12 after inducible secretion from engineered T cells with the aim of achieving safe, local delivery of IL-12 activity in the tumor microenvironment. trIL-12 is being advanced under a collaboration between Lyell and Outpace with the goal of improving efficacy for T-cell therapies by harnessing the therapeutic potential of IL-12. Presentation details: Session Date and Time: Tuesday Apr 9, 2024 9:00 AM - 12:30 PMAbstract Number: 4067Session Category: ImmunologySession Title: Immune Modulation with Cytokines About Lyell Immunopharma, Inc.

(NYSE: PAC; BMV: GAP) reports a 1.1% increase in terminal passenger traffic at its 12 Mexican airports in February 2024 compared to February 2023. Puerto Vallarta, Guanajuato, Los Cabos, and Guadalajara saw passenger traffic growth, while Montego Bay showed a significant increase. The company also highlights new routes and load factor improvements. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported increase in terminal passenger traffic for Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacífico (GAP) in February 2024, although modest at 1.1% compared to the prior year, indicates a steady demand for air travel in the regions where GAP operates. Notably, the growth in international passengers by 9.0% is a strong indicator of the recovery in tourism and international business travel, which may have positive implications for regional economic activity and, indirectly, for businesses tied to the travel and tourism industry. The increased load factors from 78.3% to 81.7% suggest improved operational efficiency and could lead to better financial performance due to higher revenue per flight. Financial Analyst Analyzing the financial implications of the increased load factors and passenger traffic, GAP may see an uplift in revenue, which is critical for their profitability. However, the decrease in available seats due to revisions to aircraft engines could signal potential cost increases or future capital expenditures to maintain the fleet. Investors will need to monitor how these factors balance out in GAP's financial statements in terms of operating costs versus revenue growth. The establishment of new routes, such as Tijuana to Phoenix, suggests strategic expansion that could open additional revenue streams, but it's also essential to consider the competitive dynamics and market demand for these new routes. Aviation Industry Expert The seat reduction due to the preventive maintenance on Pratt & Whitney engines reflects industry-wide concerns for safety and reliability. While this may have short-term financial impacts, it demonstrates GAP's commitment to safety which is paramount in the aviation industry. The introduction of new routes by American Airlines indicates confidence in the market's growth potential and could enhance connectivity and business opportunities in the region. Investors should note that such developments can increase an airport operator's bargaining power with airlines and possibly lead to more favorable terms in the long run. 03/05/2024 - 04:22 PM GUADALAJARA, Mexico, March 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacífico, S.A.B. de C.V., (NYSE: PAC; BMV: GAP) (“the Company” or “GAP”) announces preliminary terminal passenger traffic figures for February 2024, compared with February 2023.

(Nasdaq: MRUS) (Merus, the Company, we, or our), a clinical-stage oncology company developing innovative, full-length multispecific antibodies (Biclonics® and Triclonics®), today announced the publication of an abstract highlighting the preclinical evaluation of the bispecific antibody zenocutuzumab (Zeno) for poster presentation at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2024 taking place in San Diego, CA April 5-10, 2024. The abstract describes Zeno’s activity in preclinical models representing different tumor types expressing high neuregulin 1 (NRG1) levels. High NRG1 expression is associated with poorer prognosis in certain cancers and resistance to standard therapies. The anti-tumor efficacy of Zeno in vivo against a panel of 28 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models representing different tumor types was examined. The results show that Zeno significantly inhibited tumor growth in seven high-NRG1-expressing PDX models representing multiple different tumor types.

Approximately 25 million people in the US with Type 2 diabetes not using insulin can benefit from Stelo. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The FDA clearance of Stelo, a non-prescription glucose biosensor, represents a significant milestone in diabetes care technology. This development could potentially expand the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) market by making it more accessible to a broader segment of the population. Unlike traditional CGM systems, Stelo's over-the-counter availability targets the substantial number of Type 2 diabetes patients not on insulin therapy. This group has historically had limited access to CGM due to insurance constraints.From a medical research perspective, increased availability of CGM devices like Stelo could lead to better diabetes self-management and potentially reduce long-term healthcare costs associated with diabetes-related complications. Clinical studies have linked CGM use with improvements in glycemic control, exemplified by reductions in A1c levels, which could translate into decreased risks for diabetic complications. Market Research Analyst Dexcom's strategic move to introduce Stelo into the market aligns with the growing demand for user-friendly and accessible healthcare technologies. The decision to make Stelo available without a prescription taps into the consumer health empowerment trend, where individuals are increasingly seeking tools that offer more control over their health management. This could potentially disrupt the current CGM market dynamics, where prescription-based products dominate.By analyzing the addressable market size of 25 million non-insulin-using Type 2 diabetes patients in the U.S., the commercial potential for Stelo is considerable. The product's unique selling proposition of being the first FDA-cleared, prescription-free glucose biosensor could provide Dexcom with a first-mover advantage in this new market segment. However, it remains to be seen how competitors will respond and how price sensitivity will affect adoption rates among the target demographic. Financial Analyst The FDA clearance of Dexcom's Stelo is likely to have a positive impact on the company's financial health. By entering the over-the-counter market, Dexcom is not only diversifying its product portfolio but also potentially increasing its total addressable market. The financial implications of this move could include an uptick in sales volume and revenue growth, particularly as the product reaches market saturation.Investors should monitor the adoption rate of Stelo post-launch, as it will be a critical determinant of its financial success. Furthermore, the cost structure of producing and distributing Stelo, as well as the pricing strategy adopted by Dexcom, will be key factors in assessing the product's profitability. It's important to note that while the market opportunity is significant, the actual impact on Dexcom's financials will depend on the execution of their go-to-market strategy and the competitive landscape. 03/05/2024 - 04:26 PM Stelo will be the first glucose biosensor in the US cleared for use without a prescription Indicated for use for people 18 years and older who are not using insulin therapy A small, wearable sensor worn on the back of the upper arm, Stelo will provide glucose insights directly to a user’s smartphone† Created by the makers of Dexcom G7, the most accurate,1 easy-to-use2 and clinically-proven CGM brand,3-7 Stelo will empower even more people with Type 2 diabetes not using insulin to take control of health Stelo will be available summer of 2024 SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- DexCom, Inc.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a regular quarterly cash dividend by Clarus Corporation is a significant signal to investors, indicating the company's current financial health and its management's confidence in the ability to generate consistent cash flow. The dividend payout, albeit modest at $0.025 per share, suggests a commitment to providing shareholders with a tangible return on investment. This move can be seen as a positive reinforcement of the company's stability and could potentially attract dividend-seeking investors.However, it is crucial to scrutinize the dividend yield, which is calculated by dividing the annual dividends per share by the stock's price per share. If the yield is higher than what is typical in the industry, it may indicate that the stock is undervalued. Conversely, a lower yield could suggest an overvalued stock or a company conservatively managing its cash due to potential future investments or uncertainty in the market. Investors should compare this yield with industry standards and consider the company's long-term growth prospects and payout ratio, which reflects the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends. Market Research Analyst Clarus Corporation's dividend announcement also provides insight into the company's market positioning within the outdoor and consumer enthusiast sectors. A regular dividend payout can imply a mature company with a stable customer base, which may not be reinvesting all of its profits back into the business for growth but rather rewarding its shareholders. This could be indicative of the company's lifecycle stage and competitive dynamics within the market.Furthermore, the impact of such a dividend on the stock market can be multifaceted. It could lead to a temporary increase in the stock price leading up to the ex-dividend date, as investors might purchase shares to receive the dividend. Post the ex-dividend date, the stock price might witness a drop equivalent to the dividend paid. Long-term investors might view the consistency of dividend payments as a sign of a reliable investment, while traders might leverage the dividend announcement for short-term gains. 03/05/2024 - 04:15 PM SALT LAKE CITY, March 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Clarus Corporation (NASDAQ: CLAR) (“Clarus” and/or the “Company”), a global company focused on the outdoor and consumer enthusiast markets, announced that its board of directors has confirmed the Company’s regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.025 per share.

ORIC-944, a potent PRC2 inhibitor, shows promise in prostate cancer treatment. ORIC-613, a PLK4 inhibitor, demonstrates synthetic lethality in TRIM37-high cancer models. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Medical Research Analyst The recent announcement by ORIC Pharmaceuticals, Inc. regarding the acceptance of multiple abstracts for presentation at the AACR Annual Meeting is significant within the field of oncology drug development. The focus on ORIC-944, described as a potent and selective allosteric inhibitor of PRC2, highlights the ongoing efforts to target therapeutic resistance in prostate cancer. PRC2, or Polycomb Repressive Complex 2, plays a critical role in gene silencing and is implicated in cancer progression. The reported synergy of ORIC-944 with androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibitors could represent a substantial advancement in combination therapies for prostate cancer, particularly for patients exhibiting resistance to current AR-targeted treatments. Furthermore, the development of ORIC-613 as a PLK4 inhibitor, with a unique mechanism of synthetic lethality in TRIM37 high cancer models, introduces a novel approach to targeting specific genetic vulnerabilities in cancer cells. Synthetic lethality occurs when the simultaneous impairment of two genes results in cell death, whereas impairment of only one of these genes does not. This strategy could be particularly effective in personalized medicine, targeting tumors with specific genetic profiles such as high TRIM37 expression. The potential cross-cancer application, with a notable prevalence in breast cancer, broadens the impact of this research. For investors and stakeholders, these developments may signal a positive trajectory in ORIC Pharmaceuticals' pipeline, potentially leading to new treatment options and an expansion of the company's market presence in oncology therapeutics. However, it is essential to consider that these findings are preclinical and the success of these candidates in clinical trials is yet to be determined. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the announcement from ORIC Pharmaceuticals could have a significant impact on the company's valuation and investor interest. The oncology market is highly competitive, with a constant demand for innovative treatments that can address drug resistance—a major challenge in cancer therapy. ORIC Pharmaceuticals' focus on developing best-in-class treatments positions them well within this space, especially if ORIC-944 and ORIC-613 continue to demonstrate efficacy in clinical trials. The company's strategy to present their research at a prestigious conference like AACR also allows for increased visibility among potential partners and investors. It is important for investors to monitor the progression of these compounds through the clinical pipeline, as positive data could lead to partnerships, licensing deals, or even acquisition interest from larger pharmaceutical companies. Conversely, any setbacks in development could have a negative impact on the company's market performance. The specificity of ORIC-613's mechanism against TRIM37-high tumors could also open niche market opportunities, potentially allowing for premium pricing if the compound reaches the market. While these developments are promising, the actual market impact will depend on clinical trial outcomes, regulatory approvals and the ability to successfully commercialize the treatments. The long-term success will also hinge on the competitive landscape, including the emergence of alternative therapies and changes in treatment protocols. Financial Analyst Analyzing the financial implications of ORIC Pharmaceuticals' recent announcement requires a nuanced understanding of the drug development process and the associated costs. The transition from preclinical to clinical stages often involves a significant increase in investment, as clinical trials are resource-intensive. The potential for ORIC-944 and ORIC-613 to address unmet needs in prostate and breast cancer therapy, respectively, could justify these investments if the compounds demonstrate safety and efficacy in human trials. Investors should evaluate the company's cash flow, research and development expenses and funding strategies to sustain these projects through to commercialization. The acceptance of abstracts at a major conference can sometimes lead to a short-term positive reaction in stock prices due to increased investor optimism. However, the long-term value will be determined by the successful navigation of clinical trials and regulatory pathways. Given that the pharmaceutical industry is subject to stringent regulatory requirements, any delays or issues with clinical trials could impact the company's financial projections and timelines. It is also critical to assess the intellectual property portfolio of ORIC Pharmaceuticals, as patents and exclusivity rights can significantly affect the company's revenue potential from these compounds. 03/05/2024 - 04:30 PM SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. and SAN DIEGO, March 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ORIC Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

These results position ORIC-944 as a potential best-in-class PRC2 inhibitor for combination with AR inhibitors in patients with prostate cancer. Poster presentation details:Title:ORIC-613, a potential first- and best-in-class, orally bioavailable, potent and selective PLK4 inhibitor with synthetic lethality in TRIM37 high cancer modelsAbstract Number:594Date & Time:Sunday April 7, 2024, 1:30 p.m. - 5:00 p.m. PTSession Category:Experimental and Molecular TherapeuticsSession Title:Kinase and Phosphatase Inhibitors 1Location:Poster Section 25 Abstract Highlights ORIC-613 is an orally bioavailable, potent and exquisitely selective small molecule inhibitor of PLK4, which is synthetic lethal in tumor cells with high levels of TRIM37. ORIC-613 is highly selective against the kinome, including against the closely related aurora kinases and other PLK family members. Preclinical assessment in cancer cell lines revealed the synthetic lethality, with ORIC-613 having stronger potency in TRIM37-high cells as evidenced by inducing tumor cell death specifically in TRIM37-high versus TRIM37-wildtype cells. Analysis of genomic data from adult tumors indicates that increased TRIM37 copy number is found across a breadth of cancers, with notable prevalence in breast cancer. Oral dosing of ORIC-613 resulted in tumor growth inhibition and regressions in TRIM37-high xenograft breast tumors. These results position ORIC-613 as a potential first- and best-in-class development candidate, which demonstrates synthetic lethality in TRIM37-high tumors and has the potential to benefit these patients.

(INAB) presents new preclinical data on its non-signaling gamma-delta T cell CAR platform targeting CD-33 and CD-123 at the AACR Annual Meeting. The platform shows promise in selectively targeting cancer cells while sparing healthy tissue, potentially addressing 'undruggable' tumor types. Positive IN8bio unveils new preclinical data for its INB-300 non-signaling gamma-delta T cell CAR platform at the 2024 AACR Annual Meeting. The platform demonstrates the ability to target cancer cells while preserving healthy tissues, a critical advancement in CAR-T therapy. IN8bio's nsCAR technology leverages gamma-delta T cells to differentiate between tumor and healthy tissue, enhancing precision in cancer treatment. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The development of IN8bio's non-signaling gamma-delta T cell CAR-T platform, INB-300, represents a significant advancement in the field of cancer treatment. Gamma-delta T cells are a subset of T cells that possess innate-like properties, which enable them to recognize and eliminate cancerous cells without the requirement for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. This feature is particularly advantageous as it allows the targeting of a broader range of tumor antigens that are not restricted by MHC, which is a limitation of conventional T cell therapies.The ability of INB-300 to discern between cancerous and healthy cells despite the presence of the same antigen on both is a potential game-changer. This could greatly reduce the incidence of 'on-target, off-tumor' toxicities, a common side effect of current CAR-T therapies where healthy cells are inadvertently attacked, leading to serious complications. By preserving healthy tissues, INB-300 could offer a safer treatment option and possibly extend its applicability to solid tumors, which have been challenging to treat with existing CAR-T therapies due to the difficulty in distinguishing between healthy and cancerous cells.Moreover, targeting CD-33 and CD-123 antigens, which are expressed on myeloid malignancies, could address a significant unmet need in leukemia treatment. The preclinical success of INB-300 might translate into a competitive edge for IN8bio in the biopharmaceutical industry, potentially leading to partnerships, increased funding and a rise in stock valuation if clinical trials confirm the preclinical findings. Oncology Doctor Current CAR-T cell therapies, although revolutionary, have been predominantly successful in treating certain hematological malignancies, such as B-cell lymphomas and leukemias. The challenge with solid tumors and some myeloid malignancies has been the lack of specificity, leading to significant damage to healthy tissues. The nsCAR platform's ability to mitigate this issue could revolutionize the treatment landscape for a wider array of cancers, including those considered 'undruggable'.This advancement could lead to improved patient outcomes, as the selective targeting of cancer cells would likely result in fewer adverse effects and improved tolerability. This is particularly important for patients who are often debilitated by both the disease and the treatment side effects. If INB-300 progresses to clinical trials and demonstrates efficacy and safety in humans, it could become a cornerstone treatment, potentially improving survival rates and quality of life for cancer patients.From a clinical perspective, the poster presentation at AACR is an opportunity for the oncology community to scrutinize the data and methodology behind INB-300. The feedback and discussions generated could guide further development and optimization of the therapy. Market Research Analyst The preclinical success of the INB-300 platform could have substantial implications for IN8bio's market positioning. The global CAR-T therapy market is experiencing rapid growth and innovations that offer potential safety and efficacy improvements are likely to capture significant interest from investors, healthcare providers and patients alike.As an emerging player in the field, IN8bio's focus on addressing the limitations of current CAR-T therapies could attract strategic partnerships or licensing deals, particularly with larger pharmaceutical companies seeking to diversify their oncology portfolios. The ability to target solid tumors effectively would open up a large segment of the cancer treatment market, currently underserved by existing CAR-T therapies.From a financial standpoint, positive preclinical results typically lead to a positive market reaction, as they increase the likelihood of successful clinical trials and eventual FDA approval. Investors will be closely watching the progress of INB-300 through clinical development, as each milestone achieved has the potential to influence IN8bio's stock performance. 03/05/2024 - 04:30 PM New preclinical data demonstrating proof-of-concept for the non-signaling gamma-delta T cell CAR (nsCAR) platform candidate targeting CD-33 and CD-123 will be presented.The platform has demonstrated the ability to target cancer cells while sparing healthy tissue when both express the CAR-targeted antigens, which could be used for previously “undruggable” solid and liquid tumor targets. NEW YORK, March 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IN8bio, Inc. (Nasdaq: INAB) a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative gamma-delta T cell therapies, today announced the presentation of new preclinical data for its non-signaling gamma-delta T cell based Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cell (CAR-T) platform, INB-300. The data will be presented at the 2024 American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting, being held April 5-10, 2024 in San Diego, California. The current generation of CAR-T technology eliminates the target antigen regardless of whether it is expressed on tumor or healthy tissue. IN8bio's nsCAR platform, INB-300, uses the CAR to traffic and bind to cells expressing the target and leverages the natural innate immune recognition abilities of gamma-delta T cells to distinguish between tumor and healthy tissue. This allows the cells to selectively eliminate cancer cells while leaving healthy cells intact, even when both express the CAR-target. “We're excited to share this new data from our nsCAR platform, INB-300, which enables next-generation precision CAR-T therapy by selectively targeting leukemia cells while preserving healthy tissues,” said Lawrence Lamb, Ph.D., co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer, IN8bio. “We are using gamma-delta T cells to treat a wide variety of cancers, including myeloid malignancies and solid tumors, where current CAR-T therapy has historically faced significant challenges due to on target, but off tumor toxicities. We look forward to advancing our pipeline of novel gamma-delta based nsCAR therapies for patients with significant unmet need.” AACR Poster Presentation Details Poster Title: Gamma-delta (γδ) CAR-T cells lacking the CD3ζ signaling domain enhance targeted killing of AML cells and preserve healthy tissues Abstract Presentation Number: 5227 Session Title: Adoptive Cell Therapies 4 Session Date and Time: Tuesday, April 9, 2024, 1:30pm-5:00pm PT (4:30pm-8:00pm ET) About INB-300INB-300 is a non-signaling CAR (nsCAR) gamma-delta T cell platform with several preclinical product candidates, including the INB-330 program against AML targets, that combine our expertise in gamma-delta T cells and genetic engineering.

The company also generated record annual Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin. Cadre expects full-year 2024 net sales of $553 to $572 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $104 to $108 million. Positive Cadre achieved impressive annual net sales of $483 million, with a gross margin of 41.6% and net income of $39 million. The company generated record annual Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin. Cadre projects full-year 2024 net sales to be in the range of $553 to $572 million and Adjusted EBITDA between $104 to $108 million. The CEO, Warren Kanders, highlighted the company's strong performance in 2023, driven by strategic execution and high demand for safety equipment. Cadre's recent acquisitions of ICOR Technology and Alpha Safety aim to enhance its product offerings and market position. The company's liquidity improved, with cash and cash equivalents increasing to $87.7 million and total debt decreasing to $140.1 million as of December 31, 2023. Cadre declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.0875 per share, representing a 9.4% increase over the previous annualized dividend. The company provided an optimistic outlook for 2024, expecting revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth of 16.5% and 23.5%, respectively. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported annual net sales of $483 million and a gross margin of 41.6% by Cadre Holdings, Inc. indicate a robust performance, particularly when considering the net income of $39 million. This performance is noteworthy as it signifies a strong revenue stream and cost-effective operations. The company's ability to maintain a high gross profit margin above 40% suggests effective pricing strategies and cost control, which is essential for profitability in the manufacturing and distribution sector. The growth in net sales and gross profit margin compared to the previous year also reflects positively on the company's market positioning and operational efficiency.Furthermore, the company's forecast for 2024, with expected net sales between $553 to $572 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $104 to $108 million, projects confidence in sustained growth. This guidance anticipates significant year-over-year growth, which could be an indicator of strong demand for the company's products and a positive outlook on the execution of its business strategy. The emphasis on Adjusted EBITDA is particularly relevant for investors as it excludes non-cash and one-time expenses, providing a clearer picture of the company's operating profitability. Market Research Analyst The strategic acquisitions of ICOR Technology and Alpha Safety by Cadre are strategic moves that could potentially expand the company's market share and diversify its product offerings. ICOR Technology's focus on EOD robots complements Cadre's existing safety equipment portfolio, potentially opening up new government and law enforcement contracts. Alpha Safety's niche in nuclear safety solutions introduces Cadre to a new industry vertical with a growing total addressable market. These acquisitions, funded through cash and debt, reflect Cadre's aggressive growth strategy and its ability to leverage its balance sheet for expansion.Another point of interest is the increase in the quarterly cash dividend, which signals the company's financial health and commitment to returning value to shareholders. A 9.4% increase in the dividend rate is considerable and could attract income-focused investors. This move, combined with the company's performance and growth outlook, could contribute to positive investor sentiment and potentially impact the company's stock valuation positively. Economist The company's performance, particularly in the context of macroeconomic factors such as inflation and currency exchange rates, is commendable. The ability to increase gross profit margins in the face of inflationary pressures and a stronger Mexican peso suggests effective cost management and pricing power. This resilience to external economic pressures is a significant indicator of the company's strength. Moreover, the reduction in net debt by $52.0 million enhances the company's financial stability and could improve its creditworthiness, potentially lowering future borrowing costs.Looking ahead, the company's optimistic 2024 outlook, with projected revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth of 16.5% and 23.5% respectively, indicates a positive economic forecast for the safety equipment industry. This growth may be supported by secular tailwinds such as increased global emphasis on safety and security. However, investors should also consider potential risks such as geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions and changes in government spending on defense and law enforcement, which could impact demand for Cadre's products. 03/05/2024 - 04:15 PM Achieved Annual Net Sales of $483 Million, Gross Margin of 41.6% and Net Income of $39 million Generated Record Annual Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin Expects Full Year 2024 Net Sales of $553 to $572 Million and Adjusted EBITDA of $104 to $108 Million JACKSONVILLE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cadre Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: CDRE) (""Cadre"" or ""the Company""), a global leader in the manufacturing and distribution of safety equipment, announced today its consolidated operating results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. Net sales of $124.6 million for the fourth quarter; net sales of $482.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 Gross profit margin of 39.9% for the fourth quarter; gross profit margin of 41.6% for the year ended December 31, 2023 Net income of $9.6 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter; net income of $38.6 million, or $1.02 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2023 Adjusted EBITDA of $20.7 million for the fourth quarter; Adjusted EBITDA of $85.8 million for year ended December 31, 2023 Adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.6% for the fourth quarter; Adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.8% for the year ended December 31, 2023 Declared quarterly cash dividend of $0.0875 per share in January 2024. On an annualized basis, this dividend represents an increase of $0.03 per share, or 9.4% per share, over the previous annualized dividend of $0.32 per share. “2023 was a record year, reflective of Cadre’s outstanding strategic execution and the strong and recurring demand for our best-in-class, mission-critical safety equipment,” said Warren Kanders, CEO and Chairman. “Strong fourth quarter results capped off an outstanding year, in which we generated our highest annual revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, gross margin, and Adjusted EBITDA margin since inception. Based on the ongoing, successful implementation of the Cadre operating model, strong secular tailwinds, and confidence in our leading platform of premium safety brands moving forward, our 2024 guidance shared today implies at its midpoints full-year revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth next year of 16.5% and 23.5%, respectively.” Mr. Kanders added, “M&A has been a key tenet of our strategy to seek to unlock long-term value, and we are pleased to have recently capitalized on attractive opportunities to add two high-margin safety businesses with recurring revenues. With the acquisition of ICOR Technology, we’ve considerably expanded our ability to provide mission-critical EOD robots to law enforcement agencies and military organizations. Additionally, the acquisition of Alpha Safety represents an important step in diversifying Cadre’s platform, as we enter an attractive new adjacent vertical with a large and growing total addressable market. Supported by a robust acquisition pipeline, as well as favorable industry dynamics, we believe Cadre is ideally positioned to continue to grow our platform and further enhance our market leadership over the long-term.” Fourth Quarter and Year Ended 2023 Operating Results For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, Cadre generated net sales of $124.6 million, as compared to $123.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. Net sales were impacted by a decrease in the Product segment primarily resulting from project timing in our explosive ordnance disposal (“EOD”) products which were offset by an increased demand for armor products, duty gear products and crowd control products. Net sales were also impacted by an increase in the Distribution segment primarily the result of agency demand for hard goods. For the year ended December 31, 2023, Cadre generated net sales of $482.5 million, as compared to $457.8 million for the prior year period, mainly driven by higher demand for armor and crowd control products, as well as recent acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease from large international orders for EOD products fulfilled in the prior year. For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, Cadre generated gross profit of $49.8 million, as compared to $48.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2023, Cadre generated gross profit of $200.7 million, as compared to $175.7 million for the prior year period. Gross profit margin was 39.9% for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 39.2% for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 mainly driven by favorable pricing and product mix. Gross profit margin was 41.6% for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 38.4% for the prior year period, mainly driven by favorable pricing, product mix and productivity, partially offset by inflation and pressure from a stronger Mexican peso. Net income was $9.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, as compared to net income of $6.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The increase resulted primarily from increased net sales, unrealized foreign exchange and lower tax expense. Net income was $38.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to net income of $5.8 million for the prior year period, primarily as a result of an increase in net sales and decreased stock-based compensation expense. Cadre generated $20.7 million of Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $22.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 16.6% for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 18.1% for the prior year period. Cadre generated $85.8 million of Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $75.7 million for the prior year period.

Total debt decreased by $9.6 million from $149.7 million as of December 31, 2022, to $140.1 million as of December 31, 2023. Net debt (total debt net of cash and cash equivalents) decreased by $52.0 million from $104.4 million as of December 31, 2022, to $52.4 million as of December 31, 2023. Capital expenditures totaled $2.7 million for the fourth quarter and $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared with $1.5 million for the fourth quarter and $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Dividend On January 23, 2024, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.0875 per share, or $0.35 per share on an annualized basis, which represents an increase of $0.03 per share, or 9.4% per share, over the previous annualized dividend of $0.32 per share. Cadre's dividend payment was made on February 16, 2024, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on the record date of February 2, 2024. The declaration of any future dividend is subject to the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors. Acquisition of ICOR Technology On January 10, 2024, Cadre announced the completion of its accretive acquisition of ICOR Technology, a leading manufacturer and distributor of EOD and tactical robots and specialized protective security equipment for EOD and military organizations worldwide. The purchase price was funded through available cash on the Company’s balance sheet. Acquisition of Alpha Safety On March 1, 2024, Cadre completed its accretive acquisition of Alpha Safety, a leading nuclear safety solutions company, for $106.5 million (including working capital and certain other adjustments at closing). The transaction was funded through available cash on the Company’s balance sheet and an increase in term debt under its existing credit facility. 2024 Outlook For the full year 2024, Cadre expects to generate net sales in the range of $553 million to $572 million and Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $104 million and $108 million. We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $8 million to $10 million. Cadre has not provided net income guidance due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting certain types of expenses and gains, which affect net income but not Adjusted EBITDA. Therefore, we do not provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA guidance to net income guidance.

Goldwin Inc. will be the exclusive distributor in Japan, and Compendium Group in Australasia, focusing on brand awareness and affinity. The partnerships aim to accelerate sustainable growth and increase brand presence in key markets. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The strategic shift by Allbirds Inc. to a distributor model in Australasia and Japan can be seen as a pivotal move to leverage local market expertise and reduce operational complexities associated with direct selling. By partnering with Goldwin Inc. and Compendium Group, Allbirds is tapping into established networks and regional know-how, which can lead to more effective market penetration and brand positioning. The focus on sustainability aligns with the increasing consumer demand for eco-friendly products, particularly in regions like Japan and Australasia where environmental awareness is high.However, the long-term success of this transition will largely depend on the distributors' ability to maintain Allbirds' brand integrity and commitment to sustainability. The operational shift may result in cost savings and increased efficiency, but it also introduces a dependency on third parties, which could pose risks if the partners' performance does not meet expectations. The impact on Allbirds' revenue and market share in these regions will be an important metric to monitor in the coming quarters. Financial Analyst Allbirds' completion of distributor agreements is likely to have financial implications that warrant close scrutiny. Transitioning to a distributor model can lead to a more variable cost structure, where expenses are more directly tied to sales performance. This could improve Allbirds' gross margins and potentially reduce the risks associated with inventory management and fixed costs. Moreover, the move could signal a strategic prioritization of profitability over aggressive expansion—a shift that may be well-received by investors looking for sustainable growth.It is essential to analyze future financial statements to assess the impact on Allbirds' bottom line. Key indicators will include changes in revenue growth, cost of sales and operating expenses. Additionally, any changes in the capital allocation strategy, such as increased investments in marketing or R&D due to savings from the distributor model, could further influence the company's financial health and stock performance. Sustainability Expert Allbirds' emphasis on sustainability is not only a core brand value but also a strategic differentiator in the competitive footwear market. The partnership with distributors that share a commitment to environmental stewardship, like Goldwin Inc., reinforces Allbirds' market position as a sustainable brand. This alignment is likely to resonate with consumers who prioritize eco-friendly products, potentially leading to increased brand loyalty and market share in these environmentally-conscious regions.The collaboration with distributors that have a proven track record with sustainable practices could enhance Allbirds' supply chain transparency and sustainability reporting. Investors and consumers alike are increasingly valuing companies that can demonstrate real progress on sustainability metrics, which could have positive implications for Allbirds' reputation and long-term brand equity. 03/05/2024 - 04:15 PM Footwear brand finalizes agreements that will cover Australasia and JapanSAN FRANCISCO, March 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Allbirds Inc., a global lifestyle brand that innovates with sustainable materials to make better footwear and apparel products in a better way, announced the completion of its previously announced agreements with distributor partners in Australasia and Japan.

EcoVadis uses a broad range of criteria to score companies' sustainability programs in four main areas: environment, ethics, labor and human rights, and sustainable procurement. In addition to helping Fastenal identify opportunities to reduce risk and improve its sustainability performance, the assessment helps current and potential customers identify Fastenal as a responsible business partner. ""Today, many of our customers are looking at EcoVadis scores to evaluate our sustainability credentials and to help them make purchasing decisions,"" said Dan Florness, Fastenal's president and CEO.

The company also provided optimistic financial guidance for 2024, expecting continued growth and profitability. Management highlighted strategic initiatives to drive operational and commercial excellence, expansion into high-growth markets, and human resource optimization. Positive MEC reported a 15.6% increase in net sales for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the prior year, driven by organic growth and the acquisition of Mid-States Aluminum (MSA). Net income for the quarter was $2.2 million, with adjusted EBITDA of $17.7 million. Full-year 2023 results showed a 9.1% increase in net sales, reaching $588.4 million. Net income for the year was $7.8 million, with adjusted EBITDA of $66.1 million. Free cash flow increased to $23.8 million. MEC provided financial guidance for full-year 2024, expecting net sales between $620 million and $640 million, adjusted EBITDA between $72 million and $76 million, and free cash flow between $35 million and $45 million. Management emphasized the company's progress in its business transformation journey, focusing on operational discipline, commercial expansion, and capital allocation. The recent acquisition of MSA positions MEC to capitalize on demand for lightweight materials in energy transition markets. MEC's strategic initiatives include driving a high-performance culture, operational excellence, commercial expansion, and human resource optimization. The company aims to achieve total net sales of $750 to $850 million, adjusted EBITDA margin expansion to 14% to 16%, and free cash flow of $65 to $75 million by 2026 through its MEC Business Excellence (MBX) framework. The company's balance sheet update as of December 31, 2023, showed net debt of $149.5 million and total cash availability of $250.01 million. MEC utilized free cash flow to repay debt incurred from the MSA acquisition. Financial guidance for 2024 considers potential macroeconomic factors affecting end market demand, with expectations of offsetting these challenges through new project work and contributions from the MSA acquisition. MEC's outlook for 2024 includes mid-to-high single-digit organic net sales growth, expansion in adjusted EBITDA margins, and significant growth in free cash flow generation, aligning with the company's long-term financial targets. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported net sales growth of 15.6% y/y and organic growth of 6.1% for Mayville Engineering Company (MEC) indicate robust performance, particularly in a manufacturing sector that often mirrors broader economic trends. The positive net income and substantial increase in Free Cash Flow (FCF) by $20.6 million y/y underscore the company's ability to generate cash post-capital expenditures, which is crucial for debt repayment and potential shareholder returns. The net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.1x, while improved, still suggests a moderate debt burden that management aims to reduce to a target of 1.5x to 2.0x by the end of 2024.Adjusted EBITDA margins, although impacted negatively by the Hazel Park facility ramp-up, remained relatively stable. This is indicative of the company's operational resilience and ability to manage costs effectively despite external pressures. The acquisition of Mid-States Aluminum (MSA) and the associated revenue and cost synergies expected to be realized by 2024 could enhance MEC's competitive position in lightweight materials, a sector with growing demand due to energy transition movements. However, investors should monitor the integration process closely, as acquisition synergies are often challenging to achieve.MEC's forward-looking statements for 2024, forecasting mid-to-high single digit organic net sales growth and Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, reflect management's confidence in the company's strategic initiatives and market position. Yet, the anticipated softening in macroeconomic conditions could pose risks to these projections, necessitating a cautious outlook on the company's ability to achieve these targets. Market Research Analyst MEC's strategic focus on high-value market adjacencies and increased automation suggests a deliberate shift towards sectors with higher growth potential and margin profiles. The emphasis on lightweight materials, particularly in the context of energy transition technologies, positions MEC favorably within a niche but expanding market segment. Given the growing environmental concerns and the shift towards electrification in the automotive industry, MEC's capabilities in lightweight material fabrication could see increased demand, contributing positively to future revenue streams.The company's MBX initiative, aimed at driving operational and commercial excellence, is a critical factor in improving margins and operational efficiency. The expected Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion to between 14% to 16% by year-end 2026, if achieved, would represent a significant improvement and could lead to increased investor confidence. However, the success of such initiatives often depends on consistent execution and market conditions.MEC's end-market diversification, including growth in the powersports and military sectors, mitigates risks associated with demand fluctuations in any single market. The strong pipeline of lightweight materials fabrication bidding activity and the expected synergies from the MSA acquisition further support the potential for market share expansion. Nonetheless, the company's performance in agriculture markets, which experienced softening demand, highlights the need for close monitoring of sector-specific trends that may impact future sales. Legal Expert One area of concern highlighted in the report is the increase in legal costs associated with litigation against a former fitness customer. While the specifics of the litigation are not detailed, legal disputes can lead to unforeseen expenses and may distract from core business operations. It is important for stakeholders to understand the nature of these legal challenges and potential implications for MEC's financials and reputation.Furthermore, the report mentions the impact of United Auto Workers (UAW) labor strikes on net sales and Adjusted EBITDA. Labor relations and the ability to effectively navigate union negotiations are critical for maintaining production stability and avoiding disruptions. As MEC continues to grow and potentially face more labor-related challenges, the company's approach to labor relations will be an important aspect for stakeholders to consider. 03/05/2024 - 04:15 PM MILWAUKEE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Mayville Engineering Company (NYSE: MEC) (the “Company” or “MEC”), a leading value-added provider of design, prototyping and manufacturing solutions serving diverse end markets, today announced results for the three and twelve-months ended December 31, 2023. FOURTH QUARTER 2023 RESULTS (All comparisons versus the prior-year period) Net sales of $148.6 million, or +15.6% y/y, including organic growth of 6.1% y/y Net income of $2.2 million, or $0.11 per diluted share; Non-GAAP Adjusted Diluted EPS of $0.21 Adjusted EBITDA of $17.7 million, including a $1.3 million negative impact from the ramp-up of production at the Hazel Park facility Adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.9% of net sales, including an 85-basis point negative impact from the ramp-up of production at the Hazel Park facility Estimated $5.0 million impact to net sales and a $1.6 million impact to Adjusted EBITDA related to United Auto Workers (“UAW”) labor strikes at select customers Record quarterly Free Cash Flow of $19.9 million, an increase of $20.6 million y/y Ratio of net debt to trailing twelve-month Adjusted EBITDA of 2.1x as of Dec 31, 2023 FULL-YEAR 2023 RESULTS (All comparisons versus the prior-year period) Net sales of $588.4 million, or +9.1% y/y, including organic growth of 4.3% y/y Net income of $7.8 million, or $0.38 per diluted share; non-GAAP Adjusted Diluted EPS of $0.79 Adjusted EBITDA of $66.1 million, including a $6.2 million negative impact from the ramp-up of production at the Hazel Park facility Adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.2% of net sales, including a 105 basis point negative impact from the ramp-up of production at the Hazel Park facility Free Cash Flow of $23.8 million, an increase of $29.9 million y/y FULL-YEAR 2024 FINANCIAL GUIDANCE Net sales of between $620 million and $640 million Adjusted EBITDA of between $72 million and $76 million Free Cash Flow of between $35 million to $45 million MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY “In 2023, we demonstrated significant progress on our multi-year business transformation journey, while leveraging our position as the market leading U.S. based vertically integrated provider of best-in-class design, engineering, and fabrications solutions,” stated Jag Reddy, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Last year, we sharpened our commercial focus, expanding within higher-value market adjacencies, while improving our operational discipline through increased automation and process efficiencies. We introduced a balanced capital allocation strategy, investing in innovation and inorganic growth, while returning capital to shareholders through opportunistic open market share repurchases.” “Following the recent acquisition of Mid-States Aluminum (“MSA”), MEC is uniquely positioned to capitalize on rising multi-sector demand for lightweight materials fabrication capabilities,” continued Reddy. “MSA positions us to grow our share-of-wallet with existing customers as they make investments in energy transition-related technologies, including those that support fleet electrification and infrastructure. Importantly, customer interest in our expanded capabilities has been strong with a quickly growing pipeline of lightweight materials fabrication bidding activity currently underway. We continue to expect that we will deliver at least $20 million of annual synergies resulting from the MSA acquisition by year-end 2026.” “Our fourth quarter performance was a solid finish to the year,” noted Reddy. “We delivered organic net sales growth of more than 6% in the fourth quarter, while our Adjusted EBITDA margins finished the year at nearly 12%.” “In 2024, we anticipate that a combination of share gains, enhanced productivity, a higher-value sales mix and continued price discipline will position us to deliver another year of profitable growth,” continued Reddy. “We expect that our Hazel Park facility will approach $100 million of annualized sales during the fourth quarter 2024, consistent with our prior forecast, while recently adopted MBX-related and commercial pricing initiatives are expected to deliver between $3 to $6 million of incremental Adjusted EBITDA benefit this year, net of inflationary pressures.” “For the full-year 2024, these actions are expected to result in mid-to-high single digit organic net sales growth, between 40 to 80 basis points of Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, and significant year-over-year growth in free cash flow generation, putting us on-pace to achieve the 2026 financial targets introduced at our 2023 Investor Day. While our 2024 outlook contemplates a potential softening in macroeconomic conditions, we continue to experience pronounced demand strength across our business which, together with the benefits of our MBX self-help actions, position MEC to deliver above-market growth through the cycle.” “Looking ahead, our capital allocation strategy will continue to prioritize debt reduction, returns-focused organic growth investments, together with opportunistic open-market purchase of our common equity under our existing share repurchase authorization,” continued Reddy. “We continue to expect that MEC will achieve our net leverage target of 1.5x to 2.0x by the end of 2024.” PERFORMANCE SUMMARY Net sales increased by 15.6% on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter 2023, driven in part by the recent acquisition of MSA and increased organic volumes in our construction, military, powersports and other end markets, partially offset by softening demand in our agriculture end markets. Net sales were unfavorably impacted by an estimated $5.0 million primarily in the Company’s commercial vehicle end market related to the UAW strikes during the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of the MSA acquisition, net sales increased organically by 6.1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter 2023. Manufacturing margin was $18.2 million in the fourth quarter 2023, or 12.3% of net sales, versus $13.0 million, or 10.1% of net sales, in the prior year period. The year-over-year increase in manufacturing margin was driven by the increased organic sales volumes, the MSA acquisition and MBX initiatives, partially offset by fixed cost under-absorption associated with new project launches, operations restructuring expense and the impact of the UAW strikes. Profit sharing, bonus and deferred compensation expense decreased $0.5 million to $3.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Other selling, general and administrative expenses were $7.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to $6.0 million for the same prior year period. The increase in these expenses during the fourth quarter primarily reflects the increase in legal costs associated with litigation against the former fitness customer. Interest expense was $3.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, as compared to $1.2 million in the prior year period, due to higher interest rates and an increase in borrowings. The increase in borrowings relative to the prior year is due to the acquisition of MSA, which closed on July 1, 2023. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $2.2 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, versus $2.4 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. MEC reported Adjusted EBITDA of $17.7 million in the fourth quarter 2023, or 11.9% of net sales, versus $11.6 million, or 9.0% of net sales, in the prior-year period. Fourth quarter 2023 Adjusted EBITDA reflects $1.3 million of losses associated with the ramp-up of production at the Hazel Park facility as compared to $1.8 million of losses in the prior year period. Fourth quarter 2023 Adjusted EBITDA also reflects an estimated $1.6 million impact from the UAW strikes. Fourth quarter Adjusted net income was $4.4 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, versus $3.1 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, in the prior year period. The increase in adjusted net income reflects an increase in income from operations, which was partially offset by higher interest expense. Free cash flow during the fourth quarter 2023 was $19.9 million as compared to ($0.7) million in the prior year period. The increase in free cash flow was primarily attributable to a $7.6 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities and a $13.0 million decrease in capital expenditures associated with the completion of the Hazel Park facility. END MARKET UPDATE Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Commercial Vehicle $ 52,758 $ 53,283 Construction & Access 25,902 25,476 Powersports 24,552 19,233 Agriculture 14,307 12,423 Military 8,871 7,860 Other 22,191 10,252 Net Sales $ 148,582 $ 128,527 Commercial Vehicles MEC is a Tier 1 supplier to many of the country’s top original equipment manufacturers (OEM) of commercial vehicles providing exhaust & aftertreatment, engine components, cooling, fuel and structural systems for both heavy- and medium-duty commercial vehicles. Net sales to the commercial vehicle market were $52.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease of 1.0% versus the prior-year period. The decrease in sales was primarily the result of the estimated $5.0 million impact related to the UAW strikes. Excluding the estimated impact of the UAW strikes, net sales to the commercial vehicle market would have grown 8.4% versus the prior-year period. The increase in net sales when excluding the estimated UAW strike impact was primarily the result of new project start-ups, strong order volumes and the prior-year impact of customer supply chain challenges. Construction & Access MEC manufactures components and sub-assemblies for the construction & access market including fenders, hoods, supports, frames, platforms, frame structures, doors and tubular products such as exhaust & aftertreatment, engine components, cooling system components, handrails and full electro-mechanical assemblies. Net sales to the construction & access market were $25.9 million in the fourth quarter 2023, an increase of 1.7% versus the prior-year period. The increase in sales was primarily due to increased volumes for construction customers resulting from public infrastructure and non-residential construction demand. Powersports MEC manufactures stampings and complex metal assemblies and coatings for the marine propulsion, all-terrain vehicles (ATV), multi-utility vehicles (MUV) and motorcycle markets. MEC’s powersports expertise includes axle housings, steering columns, swing arms, fenders, suspension components, ATV/MUV racks, cowl assemblies and vehicle frames. Net sales to the powersports market were $24.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 27.7% versus the prior-year period. The increase in sales was the result of higher volumes from new project wins, share gains from both new and existing customers, and the prior-year impact of customer supply chain challenges. Agriculture MEC is an integral partner in the supply chain of the world’s leading agriculture OEMs manufacturing components and sub-assemblies including fenders, hoods, supports, frames, platforms, frame structures, doors, and tubular products such as exhaust, engine components, cooling system components, handrails and full electro-mechanical assemblies. Net sales to the agriculture market were $14.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 15.2% versus the prior-year period. The increase in sales was mostly driven by market share gains which were slightly offset by demand softness in our legacy business. Military MEC holds the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) certification and produces components for the United States military. Products include exhaust, engine components, cooling, fuel, suspension, structural systems, and chemical agent resistant coating (CARC) painting capabilities. Net sales to the military market were $8.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 12.9% versus the prior-year period. Contributions from new programs, new vehicle introductions and demand associated with the conflict in Ukraine, contributed to the year-over-year sales growth. Other MEC also produces a wide variety of components and assemblies for customers in the power generation, industrial equipment & fixtures, consumer tools, mining, forestry, automotive, and medical markets. Net sales to other end markets for the fourth quarter 2023 were $22.2 million, an increase of 116.5% year-over-year. The increase is primarily attributable to MSA-related contributions, which was acquired on July 1, 2023. Legacy net sales to this end market category increased 20.8% year-over-year, primarily due to the launch of new customer projects. STRATEGIC UPDATE During the fourth quarter, MEC continued the rigorous implementation of its MEC Business Excellence (MBX) initiative, a value-creation framework designed to drive sustained operational and commercial excellence across all aspects of the organization. Upon full implementation, MEC expects MBX to drive total net sales of between $750 to $850 million, Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion to between 14% to 16% and free cash flow of between $65 to $75 million by year-end 2026. Drive a High-Performance Culture. The Company is focused on effectuating cultural change across the organization by implementing performance-based metrics, daily lean management and other process-oriented strategies. Through these efforts, the Company is building a high-performance culture capable of driving improved performance, asset utilization and cost optimization. During the fourth quarter, the Company continued the implementation and alignment of processes and best-practices across the enterprise to drive strategic execution. As part of the implementation, the Company has updated its organizational mission statement to align with a culture of standardization and consistency; One MEC. One Mission. Drive Operational Excellence. The Company is focused on leveraging technologies and capabilities to increase productivity and reduce costs across the value chain. The Company intends to achieve this objective through the implementation of lean initiatives such as value stream mapping, sales, inventory, and operations planning (SIOP), and further optimization of its supply chain and procurement strategies. The Company’s operational excellence initiatives also focus on improving fixed cost absorption, labor productivity and inventory efficiency by leveraging its recent investments in advanced manufacturing capabilities and automation. As of the end of the fourth quarter, the Company had held over 125 MBX lean events which contributed to improved margins and inventory utilization. Also during the fourth quarter, the Company restructured its operation teams in an effort to centralize and streamline leadership. MEC continues to estimate that its operational excellence initiatives will generate 180 to 270 bps of Adjusted EBITDA margin improvement by 2026. Drive Commercial Expansion. The Company is focused on driving commercial growth through an integrated, solutions-oriented approach that leverages its full suite of design, prototyping, and aftermarket services; an expansion of its fabrication capabilities beyond steel, with an emphasis on lightweight aluminum, plastics and composites; diversification within high-growth energy transition markets; further market penetration within existing end markets; and the implementation of value-based pricing. In July 2023, the Company closed the acquisition of MSA, which positions MEC to capitalize on revenue synergies within its existing legacy customer base and is now positioned to grow organically by pursuing demand for light-weight aluminum products in high-growth energy transition and fleet electrification applications. During the fourth quarter, MEC continued to expand its pipeline of cross-selling opportunities with existing customer to leverage MSA’s aluminum extrusion capabilities. The Company expects to begin recognizing both revenue and cost synergies from the MSA acquisition beginning in 2024. Drive Human Resource Optimization. The Company remains focused on the recruitment and retention of skilled, experienced employees to support the growth of its business. This component of the MBX value creation framework is designed to provide competitive, performance-based incentives; develop high-potential candidates for internal development and advancement; ensure business continuity through multi-tiered succession planning; and to ensure a stable recruiting pipeline. As part of this effort, the Company began the process of relocating its corporate headquarters to Milwaukee, which was completed during the first quarter of 2024. BALANCE SHEET UPDATE As of December 31, 2023, MEC had net debt outstanding of $149.5 million and total cash and availability on its senior secured revolving credit facility of $250.01 million. During the fourth quarter 2023, the Company utilized free cash flow to repay $21.8 million of debt that it incurred in conjunction with the MSA acquisition. At the end of the fourth quarter, the ratio of net debt to trailing twelve-month Adjusted EBITDA was 2.1x. _________________ 1 This amount is reduced to approximately $102.5 million after taking into account the $147.5 million of outstanding borrowings under the credit facility as of December 31, 2023.

The company received a communication from Meta to end its ASP program, impacting revenue significantly. Despite this, Entravision maintains a strong cash position and compliance with debt covenants. Positive Entravision cancels conference call and provides update on digital commercial partnership with Meta Platforms. Meta intends to end its ASP program, impacting Entravision's revenue substantially. Entravision assures confidence in long-term opportunities despite Meta's decision. The company maintains a solid balance sheet with a strong cash position and compliance with debt covenants. Negative Significant revenue loss expected due to Meta ending ASP program. Cancellation of conference call may impact communication with investors and analysts. Operating strategy review may lead to potential restructuring and cost-cutting measures. Decrease in consolidated EBITDA by 56% raises concerns about profitability. Financial Analyst The announcement from Entravision Communications Corporation regarding the termination of its digital commercial partnership with Meta Platforms, specifically the Authorized Sales Partner (ASP) program, has significant financial implications. The disclosed figures indicate that Meta's ASP program contributed approximately 42% of Entravision's consolidated EBITDA and over 52% of its total consolidated revenue for the full year 2023. The cessation of this program will necessitate a strategic overhaul to mitigate the loss of a substantial revenue stream.Entravision's solid balance sheet, with $118.9 million in cash and marketable securities, provides some cushion. However, the company's leverage ratio, at 2.8 times net of $50 million cash and marketable securities, could be a point of concern if the company cannot quickly replace the lost revenue. The dividend declaration signals confidence in liquidity, but investors should monitor the company's ability to maintain dividend payments in light of the impending revenue gap. Market Research Analyst The digital advertising landscape is highly competitive and dynamic. Entravision's reliance on partnerships with major media companies like Meta, ByteDance and others, positions it at the nexus of digital advertising. The dissolution of Meta's ASP program globally will force Entravision to pivot and potentially seek new partnerships or enhance existing ones. The company's global presence in 31 countries provides a diversified market base, which may help absorb the shock from Meta's exit.With digital revenue accounting for the majority of Entravision's net revenue increase, the company's future growth strategy will likely focus on expanding its digital footprint. The company's performance in the digital segment, with a 19% increase in net revenue for Q4 2023 and a 25% increase for the full year, underscores the potential of this segment as a growth driver. Legal Expert The legal implications of Meta's decision to end its ASP program are not detailed in the announcement, but it is crucial for Entravision to review its contractual obligations and rights. The company will need to assess the legal aspects of winding down the partnership to ensure compliance and minimize potential liabilities. Additionally, the company's review of its operating strategy and cost structure in response to this development should be conducted with careful consideration of legal risks, including potential employment law implications if cost-cutting measures include workforce reductions. 03/05/2024 - 04:15 PM Provides Update on Digital Commercial Partnership with Meta Platforms Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.05 Per Share Payable on March 29, 2024 Company to Cancel Today’s Conference Call SANTA MONICA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Entravision Communications Corporation (NYSE: EVC), a leading global advertising solutions, media and technology company, today announced financial results for the three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2023, and provided an update on its digital commercial partnership with Meta Platforms. Entravision is canceling the conference call scheduled for 5 p.m. Eastern Time today. Digital Commercial Partnerships Business Update Through Entravision Global Partners, our digital commercial partnerships business, the Company acts as an intermediary between primarily global media companies and advertisers. These global media companies include Meta, for whom the Company acts as an Authorized Sales Partner (ASP), ByteDance, X Corp., Spotify, Snap and Pinterest, as well as other media companies, in 31 countries throughout the world. On March 4, 2024, the Company received a communication from Meta that it intends to wind down its ASP program globally and end its relationship with all of its ASPs, including Entravision, by July 1, 2024. For full year 2023, the Company estimates Meta’s ASP program represented approximately $23.8 million of the Company’s $57.7 million total consolidated EBITDA and $586.4 million of the Company’s $1,106.9 million of total consolidated revenue. Entravision has initiated a review of its operating strategy and cost structure and will provide an update on associated plans as soon as practicable. As of December 31, 2023, Entravision reported $118.9 million of cash and marketable securities. The Company is in compliance with all debt covenants under its current credit facility and, except for quarterly principal scheduled payments, has no maturities under that facility until March 17, 2028. ""While we are disappointed in Meta’s decision, we are confident in Entravision’s long-term opportunities given the strength of our advertising and marketing platforms and the need for our solutions globally. We are conducting an extensive review of our strategy and cost structure to reinforce our operating foundation and ensure we are best positioned to capitalize on Entravision’s global, market leading advertising, media and technology solutions. Our balance sheet is solid with a strong cash position to support the business as we navigate these changes,” said Michael Christenson, Chief Executive Officer.

Media cost is classified as cost of revenue in the period in which the corresponding revenue is recognized. (2) Operating expenses include direct operating and selling, general and administrative expenses. Included in operating expenses are $2.3 million and $2.8 million of non-cash stock-based compensation for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $9.5 million and $5.7 million of non-cash stock-based compensation for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. (3) Corporate expenses include $4.4 million and $9.2 million of non-cash stock-based compensation for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $14.2 million and $14.3 million of non-cash stock-based compensation for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. (4) Consolidated EBITDA means net income (loss) plus gain (loss) on sale of assets, depreciation and amortization, non-cash impairment charge, non-cash stock-based compensation included in operating and corporate expenses, net interest expense, other operating gain (loss), gain (loss) on debt extinguishment, income tax (expense) benefit, equity in net income (loss) of nonconsolidated affiliate, non-cash losses, syndication programming amortization less syndication programming payments, revenue from the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, spectrum incentive auction less related expenses, expenses associated with investments, EBITDA attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest, acquisitions and dispositions and certain pro-forma cost savings. We use the term consolidated EBITDA because that measure is defined in our 2017 Credit Agreement and 2023 Credit Agreement, and does not include gain (loss) on sale of assets, depreciation and amortization, non-cash impairment charge, non-cash stock-based compensation, net interest expense, other income (loss), gain (loss) on debt extinguishment, income tax (expense) benefit, equity in net income (loss) of nonconsolidated affiliate, non-cash losses, syndication programming amortization less syndication programming payments, revenue from FCC spectrum incentive auction less related expenses, expenses associated with investments, EBITDA attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest, acquisitions and dispositions and certain pro-forma cost savings. (5) Free cash flow is defined as consolidated EBITDA less cash paid for income taxes, net interest expense, capital expenditures (less amounts reimbursed by landlord) and non-recurring cash expenses plus dividend income, and other operating gain (loss). Net interest expense is defined as interest expense, less non-cash interest expense relating to amortization of debt finance costs, and less interest income. Net revenue for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 increased primarily due to an increase in advertising revenue from our digital commercial partners business, and from various acquisitions, which did not fully contribute to our financial results in the comparable prior period. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in political advertising revenue in our television and audio segments. Cost of revenue for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 increased primarily due to the increase in digital advertising revenue. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 remained constant. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased primarily due to expenses associated with the increase in advertising revenue, increases in salary expense and non-cash stock-based compensation, rent expense, and expenses from various acquisitions, which did not fully contribute to our financial results in the comparable prior period. Corporate expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased primarily due to non-recurring severance expense incurred in the fourth quarter of 2022 upon the passing of our former Chief Executive Officer, and due to a decrease in bonus expense. Corporate expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased primarily due to professional service fees, audit fees and rent expense, partially offset by a decrease in severance expense incurred in 2022 upon the passing of our former Chief Executive Officer, and due to a decrease in bonus expense. Quarterly Cash Dividend The Company announced today that its Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend to shareholders of $0.05 per share on the Company's Class A and Class U common stock, in an aggregate amount of $4.4 million. The quarterly dividend will be payable on March 29, 2024 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 15, 2024, and the common stock will trade ex-dividend on March 14, 2024. The Company currently anticipates that future cash dividends will be paid on a quarterly basis; however, any decision to pay future cash dividends will be subject to approval by the Board.

Non-GAAP net income was $15.4 million for fiscal 2024, compared to $13.6 million in the prior fiscal year. Adjusted EBITDA was $19.8 million for fiscal 2024, up from $17.4 million in fiscal 2023. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in total revenue by 9% for the fourth quarter and 10% for the fiscal year at Ooma, Inc. demonstrates a consistent upward trajectory in the company's earnings. The growth is largely attributed to the expansion of Ooma Business and strategic acquisitions like 2600Hz. The subscription and services revenue, comprising 94% of total revenue, underscores a strong recurring revenue model which is a positive indicator for future financial stability.However, the GAAP net loss widening from $0.4 million to $3.1 million in the fourth quarter raises concerns. The non-GAAP net income decrease from the previous year suggests that while the company is growing top-line revenue, it may be facing increased costs or investment expenses, which could impact profitability in the short term. Investors should consider the one-time gains and costs such as the tax benefit and acquisition-related expenses when evaluating the company's true operating performance. Market Research Analyst Ooma's focus on the smart communications platform market is timely, as there is a growing demand for cloud-based communication solutions. The acquisition of 2600Hz is strategic, potentially broadening Ooma's product offerings and enhancing its competitive position. This move could be seen as a response to the market's increasing appetite for unified communications as a service (UCaaS) and could help Ooma in capturing a larger market share.However, the market will be watching closely how Ooma integrates 2600Hz and realizes expected synergies. The growth in subscription revenue is promising, but it's critical that the company maintains service quality and customer satisfaction to ensure churn rates remain low. Long-term success will depend on how well Ooma can leverage its acquisitions to deliver innovative solutions and drive user adoption. Investment Risk Analyst The financial results reveal a mixed picture for Ooma, Inc. that investors need to dissect carefully. On one hand, the growth in subscription revenue suggests a stable and predictable cash flow, which is a positive sign for risk-averse investors. On the other hand, the increase in GAAP net losses and the decrease in non-GAAP net income year-over-year could indicate underlying risks associated with the company's current growth strategy.Investors should assess the sustainability of Ooma's growth, considering both the one-off financial benefits and costs incurred from the acquisition and restructuring. It is also important to evaluate the company's ability to scale effectively while managing costs. The increase in adjusted EBITDA is modest and should be weighed against the overall financial health of the company and the competitive dynamics of the industry. 03/05/2024 - 04:15 PM SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ooma, Inc.

We achieved this growth while also investing significantly in new market opportunities and international expansion, and we believe we enter FY25 in a strong position with leading product solutions. Our plans for FY25 include continued investment across our business as we capitalize on key industry trends, such as the expansion of cloud communications for small to medium sized businesses and the sunsetting of copper lines. We believe our strategic focus on small to medium sized businesses, larger businesses that are in select verticals, POTS copper line replacement, and wholesale and CPaaS platform opportunities positions us well for future success.” Business Outlook: For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, Ooma expects: Total revenue in the range of $61.7 million to $62.2 million. GAAP net loss in the range of $2.6 million to $2.9 million and GAAP net loss per share in the range of $0.10 to $0.11. Non-GAAP net income in the range of $3.0 million to $3.3 million and non-GAAP net income per share in the range of $0.11 to $0.12. For the full fiscal year 2025, Ooma expects: Total revenue in the range of $250.0 million to $253.0 million. GAAP net loss in the range of $8.6 million to $9.6 million, and GAAP net loss per share in the range of $0.32 to $0.36. Non-GAAP net income in the range of $14.0 million to $15.0 million, and non-GAAP net income per share in the range of $0.51 to $0.55. The following is a reconciliation of GAAP net loss to non-GAAP net income and GAAP basic and diluted net loss per share to non-GAAP diluted net income per share guidance for the first fiscal quarter ending April 30, 2024 and the fiscal year ending January 31, 2025 (in millions, except per share data): Projected range Three Months Ending Fiscal Year Ending April 30, 2024 January 31, 2025 (unaudited) GAAP net loss ($2.6)-($2.9) ($8.6)-($9.6) Stock-based compensation and related taxes 4.4 17.8 Amortization of intangible assets 1.5 5.8 Non-GAAP net income $3.0-$3.3 $14.0-$15.0 GAAP net loss per share ($0.10)-($0.11) ($0.32)-($0.36) Stock-based compensation and related taxes 0.16 0.66 Amortization of intangible assets 0.06 0.21 Non-GAAP net income per share $0.11-$0.12 $0.51-$0.55 Weighted-average number of shares used in per share amounts: Basic 26.2 26.7 Diluted 26.6 27.4 Conference Call Information: The company will host a conference call and live webcast for analysts and investors at 5:00 p.m., Eastern time on March 5, 2024.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to disclosing financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), this press release and the accompanying tables contain certain non-GAAP financial measures, including: non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share, non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, non-GAAP operating income, and Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA represents the net income before interest and other income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization of capital expenditures, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related transaction costs, certain litigation settlement and restructuring costs, non-recurring gains, and stock-based compensation expense and related taxes. Other non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation expense and related taxes, certain non-recurring charges and gains, such as acquisition-related income tax benefits, acquisition-related transaction costs, amortization of intangible assets and certain legal settlement and restructuring costs. Non-GAAP weighted-average diluted shares include the effect of potentially dilutive securities from the company’s stock-based benefit plans. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented to provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results and core business operations. Ooma considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful measures of the operating performance of the company, because they contain adjustments for unusual events or factors that do not directly affect what management considers to be Ooma's core operating performance and are used by the company's management for that purpose. Management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures allow for a better evaluation of the company's performance by facilitating a meaningful comparison of the company's core operating results in a given period to those in prior and future periods. In addition, investors often use similar measures to evaluate the operating performance of a company. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only to aid an understanding of the company's operating results. The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies. A limitation of the non-GAAP financial measures presented is that the adjustments relate to items that the company generally expects to continue to recognize. The adjustment of these items should not be construed as an inference that the adjusted gains or expenses are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Therefore, both GAAP financial measures of Ooma's financial performance and the respective non-GAAP measures should be considered together. Please see the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the tables below. Disclosure Information Ooma uses the investor relations section on its website as a means of complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. Accordingly, investors should monitor Ooma's investor relations website in addition to following Ooma's press releases, Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings, and public conference calls and webcasts.

Xerox Holdings Corporation Announces Increase in Maximum Tender Cap for 5.000% Senior Notes Due 2025,2024-03-05T21:52:00.000Z,Low,Negative,Xerox Holdings Corporation (XRX) has increased the maximum principal amount for repurchasing its 5.000% Senior Notes due 2025 from $94 million to $362 million under its cash tender offer. The terms for the 2024 Notes Tender Offer remain unchanged. Citigroup Global Markets Inc. is the dealer manager for the Tender Offers.,"Xerox Holdings Corporation Announces Increase in Maximum Tender Cap for 5.000% Senior Notes Due 2025 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Xerox Holdings Corporation (XRX) has increased the maximum principal amount for repurchasing its 5.000% Senior Notes due 2025 from $94 million to $362 million under its cash tender offer. The terms for the 2024 Notes Tender Offer remain unchanged. Citigroup Global Markets Inc. is the dealer manager for the Tender Offers. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Increasing the maximum principal amount for the repurchase of senior notes indicates a strategic financial maneuver by Xerox Holdings Corporation to manage its debt portfolio. By raising the repurchase amount from $94 million to $362 million for the 2025 Notes, the company is potentially aiming to reduce future interest expenses and improve its balance sheet ahead of the 2025 maturity date. Such a move could be seen as a proactive approach to debt management, which may be interpreted positively by investors as it could improve the company's creditworthiness and potentially lead to an improved credit rating.However, the impact on the stock market will depend on investors' perceptions of the company's long-term financial strategy and the opportunity cost of using cash for the repurchase instead of other investments or growth opportunities. The repurchase could also indicate that the company views its stock as undervalued or that it believes the repurchase of debt is the best use of its cash at this time. The financial implications of such debt restructuring should be analyzed in the context of the company's overall capital structure and interest rate forecasts. Market Research Analyst The decision by Xerox to modify the terms of its tender offer for the 2025 Notes could reflect broader market conditions. For instance, if the market interest rates are expected to decline, repurchasing high-interest debt like the 5.000% Senior Notes makes financial sense as it could reduce the cost of capital. Conversely, if interest rates are expected to rise, the company might be seizing the opportunity to lock in lower interest costs before rates escalate further.Market sentiment towards corporate debt repurchases often hinges on the company's rationale for such actions. If the repurchase is seen as a sign of financial strength and prudent liability management, it could bolster investor confidence. On the other hand, if the market interprets this as a move to mask underlying operational weaknesses, the reaction could be less favorable. Monitoring peer actions and industry trends is crucial to understand the strategic significance of Xerox's move within the context of the technology and document management services sector. Debt Capital Markets Expert In the debt capital markets, a company's decision to increase the principal amount it is willing to repurchase in a tender offer can have several implications. For Xerox, this could mean that the initial response to the tender offer was stronger than anticipated, prompting the company to repurchase more of its debt. This could be a signal to the market of a strong demand for the company's debt, or conversely, it could indicate that Xerox is taking advantage of a favorable debt market to reduce its outstanding obligations.It is also important to consider the role of the dealer manager, in this case, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and the tender and information agent, Global Bondholder Services Corporation. Their involvement suggests a well-structured and professionally managed process, which can reassure bondholders about the legitimacy and efficiency of the tender offer. The dynamics of the tender offer, including the acceptance priority level and pricing mechanisms, would be key factors in evaluating the success of the offer and its impact on the company's financial strategy. 03/05/2024 - 04:52 PM NORWALK, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Xerox Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ: XRX) today announced that it has increased the maximum principal amount of its $750 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of 5.000% Senior Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”) that it can repurchase under its previously announced cash tender offer for the 2025 Notes (the “2025 Notes Tender Offer”) from $94 million to $362 million, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the related Offer to Purchase dated March 4, 2024 (the “Offer to Purchase”).

(LGIH) closed 376 homes in February 2024 and had 117 active selling communities as of February 29, 2024.","LGI Homes, Inc. Reports February 2024 Home Closings Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary LGI Homes, Inc. (LGIH) closed 376 homes in February 2024 and had 117 active selling communities as of February 29, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The closing of 376 homes by LGI Homes, Inc. in February 2024 is a tangible performance metric that can influence investor sentiment and the company's stock valuation. It is essential to compare this figure with historical data and industry benchmarks to assess the company's market position and growth trajectory. An increase in home closings suggests robust demand and efficient operations, while a decrease may indicate market challenges or internal inefficiencies. Additionally, the number of active selling communities provides insight into the company's expansion efforts and potential future revenue streams.Investors should consider the broader economic context, such as interest rate trends, housing market health and consumer confidence, as these factors can significantly impact homebuilders. A strong housing market with supportive economic policies can lead to increased home sales and higher revenue for LGI Homes, potentially boosting its stock price. Conversely, economic downturns or restrictive policies can dampen sales and affect the company's financial performance. Financial Analyst The announcement of home closings is a direct indicator of LGI Homes' revenue-generating activities for the month. When evaluating the company's financial health, one should scrutinize the revenue implications of these closings. For instance, the average selling price of the homes closed, along with the closing rate compared to previous months and quarters, can reveal trends in revenue and growth. This information is crucial for forecasting future earnings and adjusting financial models.Investors should also consider the operational costs associated with these closings and the company's ability to manage expenses. Profit margins are a key focus and an increase in home closings must translate to bottom-line growth for the news to positively impact the stock. It's also worth noting the company's inventory turnover rate, as a higher rate may indicate efficient capital utilization and a strong sales strategy. Economist The housing industry is often seen as a leading economic indicator and LGI Homes' performance can reflect broader economic trends. The number of homes closed by the company can be influenced by macroeconomic factors such as employment rates, GDP growth and consumer spending power. A high number of closings may suggest economic expansion and increased consumer confidence, which bodes well for the housing market and related sectors.However, it's important to consider regional economic conditions, as LGI Homes operates in specific markets that may not align with national trends. Localized factors such as job market strength, population growth and regional policies can have a significant impact on the company's success in its active selling communities. Observing these trends can help stakeholders understand the potential risks and opportunities associated with LGI Homes' market presence. 03/05/2024 - 04:47 PM THE WOODLANDS, Texas, March 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LGI Homes, Inc.

(OTC: WEBC) today reported results for our second quarter of fiscal year 2024, which ended January 31, 2024. For our second quarter of fiscal year 2024, we had a net income of $0.3 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, while in our second quarter of fiscal year 2023, we had net income of $3.5 million, or $4.43 per diluted share. Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 were $146.0 million, a 15.8 percent decrease from the $173.4 million of sales in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. For the first six months of fiscal year 2024, we generated a net income of $5.4 million, or $6.69 per diluted share, compared to a net income of $11.9 million, or $14.97 per diluted share, for the same period in fiscal year 2023. Net sales for the first six months of the current year amounted to $303.8 million, a 16.0 percent decrease from the $361.9 million in sales for the same six-month period of last year. Dana S. Weber, Chief Executive Officer and Board Chair, stated, ""The current quarter was impacted by inventory destocking and economic slowdown in various markets we serve, as well as seasonality. Further, we have certain markets that are being adversely impacted by foreign imports. We continue to focus on positioning Webco for various economic environments and opportunities by maintaining a strong balance sheet and good liquidity and making compelling investments in our business. Our total cash, short-term investments and available credit on our revolver were $78.3 million at January 31, 2024, which we believe to be a competitive advantage."" In the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, we had income from operations of $1.5 million after depreciation of $3.7 million. The second fiscal quarter of the prior year generated income from operations of $4.6 million after depreciation of $3.3 million. Gross profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was $13.0 million, or 8.9 percent of net sales, compared to $15.3 million, or 8.8 percent of net sales, for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. Our income from operations for the first six months of fiscal year 2024 was $9.5 million, after depreciation expense of $7.3 million. Income from operations in the first six-month period of fiscal year 2023 was $17.0 million, after depreciation expense of $6.5 million.

Decreases in costs associated with lower profitability, such as company-wide incentive compensation and variable pay programs, have been more than offset by inflation we have experienced in wages and other expenses. Interest expense was $1.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 and $1.7 million in the same quarter of fiscal year 2023. Interest expense was $2.3 million and $3.2 million in the first six-month periods of the current and prior fiscal years, respectively. The reduction in interest expense is primarily a result of lower average debt balances. Capital expenditures incurred amounted to $11.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 and $21.4 million for the first six months of fiscal year 2024. Included in our capital spending is ongoing construction of our F. William Weber Leadership Campus, which will house our Tech Center and corporate headquarters. The Tech Center will be the tip of the spear leading Webco's trusted and technical brand throughout our industry. As of January 31, 2024, we had $17.8 million in cash and short-term investments, in addition to $60.5 million of available borrowing under our $220 million senior revolving credit facility. Availability on the revolver, which had $62.7 million drawn at January 31, 2024, was subject to advance rates on eligible accounts receivable and inventories. Our term loan and revolver mature in September 2027. Accounting rules require asset-based debt agreements like our revolver to be classified as a current liability, despite its fiscal year 2028 maturity. Webco's stock repurchase program authorizes the purchase of our outstanding common stock in private or open market transactions. In September 2023, the Company's Board of Directors refreshed the repurchase program with a new limit of up to $40 million and extended the program's expiration until July 31, 2026. We purchased less than one thousand shares of our stock during the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. The number of shares repurchased in the prior fiscal year totaled approximately 4,000 shares. Webco purchased over 144,000 shares over the course of the four prior fiscal years. The repurchase plan may be extended, suspended or discontinued at any time, without notice, at the Board's discretion.

(Nasdaq: PYXS), a clinical stage company focused on developing next generation therapeutics to target difficult-to-treat cancers, announced today that the company will present new preclinical data in four posters at the 2024 American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting in San Diego, California, held from April 5 to 10, 2024. ""Our preclinical research continues to support the broad potential of PYX-201, our innovative clinical stage ADC targeting EDB+FN, a protein associated with the stroma of solid tumors,” said Lara S. Sullivan, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Pyxis Oncology. “Data from PDX tumor preclinical models has shown potent anti-tumor activity in multiple human cancer indications. We will also demonstrate that the overexpression of EDB+FN, the molecular target of PYX-201, is consistently observed in various human tumor types, with minimal expression observed in healthy tissue. For our PYX-106 program, we will also present encouraging preclinical data supporting the clinical opportunity of this immune-oncology therapeutic candidate to potentially demonstrate clinical activity in individuals that are not candidates for anti-PD-(L)1 approaches. Finally, we will present anti-tumor efficacy data supporting the potential for PYX-102 as a therapeutic candidate, and remain open to out-licensing opportunities for future development.” Poster titles are now available on the AACR website. Posters will be made available on the Pyxis Oncology website following presentations at the conference.

Despite a net loss in Q4 2023, the company reported total revenues of $337.9 million and adjusted EBITDA of $46.0 million. The CEO expressed condolences for a tragic accident and highlighted strategic growth in government and offshore energy services. Positive Total revenues of $337.9 million in Q4 2023 compared to $338.1 million in Q3 2023. Net loss of $7.9 million in Q4 2023 compared to net income of $4.3 million in Q3 2023. Adjusted EBITDA of $46.0 million in Q4 2023 compared to $56.6 million in Q3 2023. Full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA of $170.5 million exceeded the upwardly revised outlook of $170.0 million. CEO expressed condolences for a tragic accident and highlighted strategic growth in government and offshore energy services. Revenues in 2023 were 8% higher than in 2022, with a 24% increase in adjusted EBITDA excluding asset dispositions and foreign exchange gains. 2024 outlook projects a 9% revenue growth and over 20% increase in adjusted EBITDA. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent financial results reported by Bristow Group Inc. reflect a mixed picture, with the company achieving a slight increase in revenues year-over-year but experiencing a net loss in the most recent quarter. The reported net loss of $7.9 million for Q4 2023 contrasts with a net income of $4.3 million in Q3 2023, indicating a downturn in profitability despite relatively stable revenues. This raises concerns about the company's cost control and margin management.Adjusted EBITDA, a key metric for evaluating a company's operating performance, decreased from $56.6 million in Q3 to $46.0 million in Q4. This decline suggests that Bristow may be facing operational challenges or increased costs that are not offset by revenue growth. Investors should be aware of these factors when assessing the company's financial health and future prospects. The company's outlook for 2024, which forecasts continued revenue growth and a substantial increase in Adjusted EBITDA, will require close monitoring to ensure these targets are met amidst the challenges observed in the latest quarter. Market Research Analyst Bristow Group's performance in the offshore energy services market is noteworthy, as the company anticipates benefiting from a multi-year growth cycle in this sector. With the largest global fleet of offshore helicopters, Bristow is well-positioned to capitalize on increased demand. However, the sector is cyclical and sensitive to changes in oil prices and energy market dynamics. The company's diversification into government services, such as the recent award of the €670 million Irish Coast Guard contract, may provide a more stable revenue stream and mitigate the risks associated with the volatility of the offshore energy market.It's also important to consider the impact of foreign exchange rates on Bristow's international operations, as evidenced by the reported foreign exchange gains and losses. The weakening of the GBP relative to the USD has affected revenues, highlighting the importance of currency risk management for global companies like Bristow. Legal Expert The mention of a tragic SAR training accident offshore Norway and Bristow's cooperation with authorities investigating the incident is a reminder of the operational risks inherent in the aviation industry. While this event does not have a direct financial impact, it could have implications for the company's reputation and operational safety record, which in turn could affect client relationships and future contracts. It is crucial for Bristow to maintain rigorous safety standards and transparent communication with stakeholders to manage these non-financial risks effectively. 03/05/2024 - 04:42 PM Achieves 2023 Increased Outlook and Affirms 2024 Outlook HOUSTON, March 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Total revenues of $337.9 million in Q4 2023 compared to $338.1 million in Q3 2023Net loss of $7.9 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, in Q4 2023 compared to net income of $4.3 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, in Q3 2023EBITDA adjusted to exclude special items, asset dispositions and foreign exchange gains (losses) was $46.0 million in Q4 2023 compared to $56.6 million in Q3 2023Full year 2023 EBITDA adjusted to exclude special items, asset dispositions and foreign exchange gains (losses) was $170.5 million compared to the upwardly revised 2023E outlook of $170.0 millionBristow Group Inc.

""On behalf of all Bristow team members around the world, I extend our heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of our dear colleague whose life was lost in the tragic SAR training accident offshore Norway on February 28, 2024. This is a deeply sad and difficult time, and we will carry this loss with us always,"" said Chris Bradshaw, President and CEO of Bristow Group. ""We are relieved to share that the other crew members have now either been released from the hospital or remain in stable condition at the hospital. Bristow is fully cooperating with authorities investigating the accident, and we will provide future updates as appropriate."" ""Looking back on 2023, I want to thank and commend the Bristow team for delivering many successful outcomes last year,"" said Bradshaw. ""We continued to progress our strategic goal to grow and diversify our leading government services business with the successful award of the €670 million Irish Coast Guard contract, building upon the recent addition of key government contracts in the United Kingdom (UKSAR2G), Dutch Caribbean, the Netherlands, and the Falkland Islands. In our offshore energy services business, the second half of 2023 marked the positive inflection point beginning what we believe will be a multi-year growth cycle. With the largest global fleet of offshore helicopters and a significant presence in key regions, Bristow expects to be a primary beneficiary of this extended growth cycle in offshore energy. Revenues in 2023 were 8% higher than 2022, and Adjusted EBITDA, excluding asset dispositions and foreign exchange, increased by 24% compared to the prior year. In 2024, the mid-point of our guidance range represents a similar year-over-year growth of 9% in revenues and over 20% in Adjusted EBITDA."" Sequential Quarter Results Operating revenues in the Current Quarter were $0.7 million lower compared to the Preceding Quarter. Operating revenues from offshore energy services were $7.0 million higher primarily due to a new contract in Norway and increased utilization in Africa, partially offset by lower lease payments received from Cougar Helicopters Inc. (""Cougar"") and lower utilization in the UK. Operating revenues from government services were $3.8 million lower primarily due to lower utilization and the weakening of the British pound sterling (""GBP"") relative to the U.S. dollar (""USD""). Fixed wing revenues were $3.5 million lower primarily due to lower seasonal utilization. Operating expenses were $8.8 million higher in the Current Quarter primarily due to higher fuel costs, leased-in equipment costs, repairs and maintenance costs and personnel costs. General and administrative expenses were $2.1 million lower in the Current Quarter primarily due to lower compensation costs. During the Current Quarter, the Company sold or otherwise disposed of certain assets, resulting in net losses of $0.2 million. During the Preceding Quarter, the Company sold or otherwise disposed of two helicopters and other assets, resulting in net gains of $1.2 million. During the Current Quarter, the Company recognized earnings of $1.1 million from unconsolidated affiliates compared to $3.7 million in the Preceding Quarter. Other income, net of $1.7 million in the Current Quarter primarily resulted from foreign exchange gains of $1.9 million, partially offset by an unfavorable interest adjustment to the Company's pension liability. Other income, net of $4.8 million in the Preceding Quarter primarily resulted from foreign exchange gains of $4.5 million. Income tax expense was $21.6 million in the Current Quarter compared to $22.6 million in the Preceding Quarter. The change in income tax expense is primarily due to the earnings mix of the Company's global operations and changes to deferred tax valuation allowances and assets. Full Year Results On August 3, 2022, Bristow's Board of Directors approved a change in the fiscal year end of the Company from March 31st to December 31st, on a prospective basis, aligning its fiscal year to the calendar year. As such, references below to the ""Current Year"" refer to the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, and references to the ""Prior Year"" refer to the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. Bristow reported net loss attributable to the Company of $6.8 million, or loss per diluted share of $0.24, for the Current Year on operating revenues of $1.3 billion compared to net income attributable to the Company of $9.2 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, on operating revenues of $1.2 billion for the Prior Year. Operating revenues in the Current Year were $90.8 million higher compared to the Prior Year. Operating revenues from offshore energy services were $29.7 million higher in the Current Year primarily due to higher utilization in most geographic regions, partially offset by the end of a contract in Guyana. Operating revenues from government services were $53.7 million higher in the Current Year primarily due to the commencement of new contracts in the Falkland Islands, the Netherlands and the Dutch Caribbean. Operating revenues from fixed wing services were $10.5 million higher in the Current Year primarily due to increased rates. Operating expenses were $49.2 million higher in the Current Year primarily due to higher costs related to new contracts, higher personnel costs, insurance costs and leased-in equipment costs, partially offset by lower fuel and repairs and maintenance costs. General and administrative expenses were $17.1 million higher in the Current Year primarily due to increased headcount related to backfilling positions that were vacant in the Prior Year, higher non-cash stock compensation expense, severance costs, and higher tax expenses. During the Prior Year, restructuring costs were $2.1 million primarily due to severance costs in the Africa region. During the Prior Year, the Company recognized a loss on impairment of $5.2 million related to a power-by-the-hour (""PBH"") intangible asset write-off. During the Current Year, the Company sold or otherwise disposed of eight helicopters and other assets, resulting in net gains of $1.1 million. During the Prior Year, the Company sold twelve helicopters and other assets resulting in net losses of $0.5 million. During the Current Year, the Company recognized earnings of $7.2 million from unconsolidated affiliates compared to earnings of $1.1 million in the Prior Year. Interest income was $7.0 million higher than the Prior Year due to higher investment balances, higher interest rates and income from sales-type leases. Other expense, net of $9.9 million in the Current Year primarily resulted from foreign exchange losses of $10.7 million, partially offset by a favorable interest adjustment to the Company's pension liability of $0.4 million. Other income, net of $33.4 million in the Prior Year primarily resulted from foreign exchange gains of $20.9 million, government grants to fixed wing services of $6.2 million, a favorable interest adjustment to the Company's pension liability of $2.7 million and a gain on sale of inventory of $1.9 million. Income tax expense was $24.9 million in the Current Year compared to $10.8 million in the Prior Year primarily due to the earnings mix of the Company's global operations and changes to deferred tax valuation allowances and assets. 2023 and 2024 Outlook Please refer to the paragraph entitled ""Forward Looking Statements Disclosure"" below for further discussion regarding the risks and uncertainties as well as other important information regarding Bristow's guidance. The following guidance also contains the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA. Please read the paragraph entitled ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" for further information. After stronger than expected Q3 results, Bristow raised its 2023 Adjusted EBITDA guidance range from $150 - $170 million to $165 - $175 million in the Preceding Quarter. Select financial results for 2023 and targets for 2023 and 2024 are as follows (in USD, millions): 2023E(1) 2023A 2024E Operating revenues: Offshore energy services $803 $810 $850 - $970 Government services $335 $337 $335 - $360 Fixed wing services $108 $107 $100 - $120 Other services $11 $10 $5 - $15 Total operating revenues $1,257 $1,264 $1,290 - $1,465 Adjusted EBITDA, excluding asset dispositions and FX $170 $171 $190 - $220 Cash interest ~$40 $39 ~$40 Cash taxes $18 $19 $25 - $30 Maintenance capital expenditures $18 $14 $15 - $20 (1) Reflects the mid-point of the previously issued 2023 financial outlook ranges. There are two main ways in which foreign currency fluctuations impact Bristow's reported financials. The first is primarily non-cash foreign exchange gains (losses) that are reported in the Other Income line on the Income Statement. These are related to the revaluation of balance sheet items, typically do not impact cash flows, and thus are excluded in the Adjusted EBITDA presentation. The second is through impacts to certain revenue and expense items, which impact the Company's cash flows. The primary exposure is the GBP/USD exchange rate. 2023A 2024E (in millions, except for exchange rates) Adjusted EBITDA, excluding asset dispositions and foreign exchange (gains) losses $171 $190 - $220 Average GBP/USD exchange rate 1.24 1.27 Each £0.01 movement in the GBP/USD exchange rate would impact 2024E Adjusted EBITDA by +/- ~$1.5 million. Outlook by Line of Service Offshore Energy Services: The increasing activity in offshore energy has driven a constructive supply and demand balance for offshore helicopters. Given our sector's late cycle exposure and the lag effect involving new projects, we only recently have begun to see the impacts of a multi-year growth cycle, with the second half of 2023 marking the positive inflection point for Bristow's financial results. A tighter equipment market, constrained global labor force and inflationary cost pressures should further drive meaningful rate increases, which we expect to capture during contract renewal and new project tenders. Headwinds from continued supply chain shortages, particularly those related to the S92 heavy helicopters, are expected to continue through 2024. Europe region: The full year impact of the newly commenced offshore energy SAR contract in Norway is expected to have a positive impact in 2024. Beyond that, we expect activity in the mature markets of Norway and the UK to be mostly stable in 2024. Americas region: The full year impact of expanded operations in Brazil and potential additional tenders in 2024 will contribute to meaningful increases in our results. Exploration activity is expected to drive increased utilization in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Africa region: Increased market activity has driven better results in Nigeria, and we expect this momentum to continue in 2024. Government Services: With operations in the Falkland Islands, the Dutch Caribbean and the Netherlands now reflected in our full year results, we anticipate 2024 will remain largely in line with 2023. Our government services offering typically involves short periods of investment followed by long periods of strong cash flows, and we anticipate 2024 to be a period of investment related to contracts scheduled to commence in late 2024. The transition to the £1.6 billion UKSAR2G contract will begin in late 2024. Operations in Ireland, for the recently awarded €670 million Irish Coast Guard contract, are set to commence towards the end of 2024, and its full year impacts in subsequent years will contribute meaningfully to our financial results. Fixed wing and other services: Activity has increased with demand for fixed wing services and charters. Pilot shortages continue to remain a challenge through this upturn. We anticipate the financial performance of this business will remain consistent with 2023. Liquidity and Capital Allocation As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $180.3 million of unrestricted cash and $70.9 million of remaining availability under its amended asset-based credit facility (the ""ABL Facility"") for total liquidity of $251.2 million. Borrowings under the ABL Facility are subject to certain conditions and requirements. In the Current Quarter, purchases of property and equipment were $19.4 million, of which $4.3 million were maintenance capital expenditures, and cash proceeds from dispositions of property and equipment were $0.1 million. In the Preceding Quarter, purchases of property and equipment were $18.4 million, of which $4.7 million were maintenance capital expenditures, and cash proceeds from dispositions of property and equipment were $7.3 million. See Adjusted Free Cash Flow Reconciliation for a reconciliation of Adjusted Free Cash Flow. In January 2024, Bristow entered into a new twelve-year secured equipment financing for an aggregate principal amount of up to £55 million. The proceeds from the financing will be used to support Bristow's capital commitments related to the Second-Generation UK Search and Rescue (UKSAR2G) contract. Bristow's obligations will be secured by four new AW139 SAR-configured helicopters to be delivered in 2024. The credit facility has a 15-month availability period and is expected to fund during 2024, subject to delivery of the new SAR-configured helicopters. The credit facility will bear interest at a rate equal to the Sterling Overnight Index Average (""SONIA"") plus 2.75% per annum. Recent Events On February 28, 2024, one of Bristow's SAR helicopters, registration LN-OIJ with six crew members onboard, was involved in an accident during a training exercise approximately 15 nautical miles west of Bergen, Norway. Very sadly, one fatality was confirmed. The other five crew members have either been released or are in stable condition in the hospital. Bristow's highest priority is to take care of our crew and their family members and provide them with any assistance needed. The Company is in the process of collecting pertinent information and will provide updates as appropriate. Bristow is fully cooperating with authorities investigating the accident. On February 27, 2024, Bristow announced an agreement with Leonardo for 10 AW189 super medium helicopters plus options to purchase an additional 10 AW189 helicopters. The new AW189 helicopters will support offshore transport as well as search and rescue (SAR) missions. Bristow currently operates 21 AW189 helicopters globally, with an additional five already scheduled for delivery beginning this year. In addition to its Offshore Energy Services business, Bristow also operates SAR-equipped AW189 helicopters in its Government Services business. The new aircraft will offer added flexibility as well as superior operational and environmental performance, including lower CO2 emissions than comparable aircraft types. The aircraft deliveries will occur over a three-year period from 2025-2028. On February 28, 2024, Bristow announced a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with The Helicopter and Jet Company (THC), Saudi Arabia's premier provider of commercial helicopter services and fully owned by the Public Investment Fund (PIF). The two companies plan to work together on advanced air mobility (AAM) initiatives in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as well as other collaborative vertical lift endeavors.

Each of these measures, as well as Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow, each as detailed below, have limitations, and are provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in the Company's financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (""GAAP"") (including the notes), included in the Company's filings with the SEC and posted on the Company's website. EBITDA is defined as Earnings before Interest expense, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA further adjusted for certain special items that occurred during the reported period, as noted below. The Company includes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to provide investors with a supplemental measure of its operating performance. Management believes that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is meaningful to investors because it provides information with respect to the Company's ability to meet its future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements and the financial performance of the Company's assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis. Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA is a recognized term under GAAP. Accordingly, they should not be used as an indicator of, or an alternative to, net income as a measure of operating performance. In addition, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to be measures of free cash flow available for management's discretionary use, as they do not consider certain cash requirements, such as debt service requirements. Because the definitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (or similar measures) may vary among companies and industries, they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company is unable to provide a reconciliation of forecasted Adjusted EBITDA for 2023 and 2024 included in this release to projected net income (GAAP) for the same periods because components of the calculation are inherently unpredictable. The inability to forecast certain components of the calculation would significantly affect the accuracy of the reconciliation. Additionally, the Company does not provide guidance on the items used to reconcile projected Adjusted EBITDA due to the uncertainty regarding timing and estimates of such items.

Reconciliation of Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow Free Cash Flow represents the Company's net cash provided by operating activities less maintenance capital expenditures. In prior periods, the Company's Free Cash Flow was calculated as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities plus proceeds from disposition of property and equipment less purchases of property and equipment. Management believes that the change in the Company's free cash flow calculation, as presented herein, better represents the Company's cash flow available for discretionary purposes, including growth capital expenditures. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is Free Cash Flow adjusted to exclude costs paid in relation to a PBH maintenance agreement buy-in, reorganization items, costs associated with recent mergers, acquisitions and ongoing integration efforts, as well as other special items which include nonrecurring professional services fees and other nonrecurring costs or costs that are not related to continuing business operations. Management believes that Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow are meaningful to investors because they provide information with respect to the Company's ability to generate cash from the business. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow is net cash provided by operating activities. Since neither Free Cash Flow nor Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a recognized term under GAAP, they should not be used as an indicator of, or an alternative to, net cash provided by operating activities. Investors should note numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by management to calculate Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. As such, they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Negative None. Market Research Analyst The secondary public offering by NAPCO Security Technologies is a strategic move that allows for liquidity and diversification for the Selling Stockholder. The pricing of the offering at $40.75 per share could be indicative of the company's current valuation in the eyes of the underwriters, Needham & Company and TD Cowen, who are seasoned in gauging market interest and setting a competitive price point.Investors might view the sale by the company's Chairman and President/CEO as a signal regarding his confidence in the company's future growth. Although the company will not receive proceeds from this sale, the market's reception of this offering could influence the stock's performance and investor perception. The option for underwriters to purchase additional shares provides a buffer for increased demand, potentially stabilizing the stock price post-offering.The finalization of the offering without any hitches could affirm the market's confidence in NAPCO's business stability and the attractiveness of its stock as an investment. However, it's important to monitor the stock's volume and price fluctuations post-offering to gauge the market's true sentiment. Financial Analyst The secondary offering's impact on NAPCO's stock could be multifaceted. On one hand, the increase in available shares may dilute existing shareholder value. On the other, the offering could potentially reduce the Selling Stockholder's influence, which might be favorable if investors are seeking a more diversified board.From a financial perspective, the fact that the company is not issuing new shares means its earnings per share (EPS) will not be affected. However, the market might still react to the CEO's decision to sell a portion of his stake. Investors should compare the offering price to the stock's recent performance to assess whether the offering is accretive or dilutive to the stock's intrinsic value.The involvement of reputable financial institutions as book-runners and lead managers might lend credibility to the offering, which could be interpreted as a positive sign by the investment community. However, the true test will be the post-closing performance and whether the market absorbs the additional shares without significant price disruption. Legal Expert The offering is being conducted under an effective registration statement on Form S-3ASR, which signifies a 'shelf' registration process. This process allows the company to prepare the offering documents in advance and then go to market quickly when conditions are favorable. Compliance with the SEC regulations is critical to ensure the offering's legality and to prevent any potential future litigation.Prospective and current investors should review the preliminary prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus for a detailed understanding of the risks and benefits associated with the offering. The availability of these documents on the SEC's website enhances transparency and allows for informed decision-making.It is also important to consider the legal implications of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares. This could affect the control dynamics within the company if exercised and it's an essential factor for shareholders to consider. 03/05/2024 - 08:20 PM AMITYVILLE, N.Y., March 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- NAPCO Security Technologies, Inc.

The company aims to provide unique business and financial solutions to independent business owners in the U.S. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, NewtekOne's transition from a BDC to a financial holding company has been a significant strategic move, impacting its accounting methodologies and operational structure. The reported basic and diluted EPS for the full year 2023 are within the guidance range, indicating management's ability to forecast and achieve targeted earnings, which is a positive signal for investors. The forecasted EPS growth for 2024 suggests confidence in the company's business model and growth trajectory. However, the reliance on non-interest-bearing net revenue to drive EPS growth is an unconventional approach in the banking sector, where traditional interest income is a primary revenue driver. This strategy could be seen as either a diversification of income sources or a potential risk if interest rates rise significantly.The reported ROAA and ROTCE are substantially higher than industry norms for banks, which typically average below 1% for ROAA and below 10% for ROTCE. Such exceptional performance metrics may attract investor attention, but they also warrant scrutiny to ensure they are sustainable and not the result of aggressive accounting or risk-taking. The efficiency ratio, while improved, is still higher than the traditional banking sector's average of around 50-60%, indicating room for operational efficiency improvements. The capital ratios reported exceed regulatory minimums, suggesting a strong capital position, which is crucial for supporting future growth and withstanding potential economic downturns. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, NewtekOne's patented NewTracker® system represents a significant technological advantage that could disrupt traditional banking business development models. The system's capability to generate approximately 1,000 unique business referrals daily without using traditional banking personnel could lead to lower operating costs and higher scalability. This innovation is particularly relevant as the banking industry is increasingly moving towards digitalization and technology-driven customer acquisition strategies. The focus on non-interest income as recurring revenue is an interesting aspect of NewtekOne's business model, potentially offering a more stable revenue stream less susceptible to interest rate fluctuations.Investors may find the company's unique business model appealing, as it differentiates NewtekOne from traditional bank holding companies. However, this also means that traditional valuation metrics may not be directly applicable. The company's emphasis on not being valued like a traditional bank could be a double-edged sword, as it may require investors to adopt new valuation frameworks to accurately assess the company's potential. The projected loan fundings growth and the increase in deposits are positive indicators of business growth, but the competitive landscape and economic factors will play a crucial role in whether these projections can be met. Legal Expert Legally, the transition from a BDC to a financial holding company has implications for regulatory compliance and tax treatment. No longer qualifying as a RIC for federal income tax purposes means that NewtekOne will be subject to corporate income tax, which could impact its net income and cash flows. Additionally, the company's internal control over financial reporting (ICFR) is under scrutiny due to accounting errors made in previous quarters. The management's ongoing assessment of ICFR effectiveness and the implementation of additional policies and procedures are crucial steps in mitigating the risk of future discrepancies and maintaining investor confidence. The legal and regulatory environment for financial holding companies is complex and NewtekOne's ability to navigate these challenges will be critical to its long-term success. 03/05/2024 - 07:11 PM Full Year 2023 Basic Earnings per Share of $1.71 and Diluted Earnings per Share of $1.70 Conference Call Tomorrow 8:30 AM ET BOCA RATON, Fla., March 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NewtekOne, Inc. (Nasdaq: NEWT), announced today its financial and operating results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023. This is NewtekOne's fourth quarter reporting, and third full quarter reporting, as a financial holding company following the Company's January 6, 2023 completion of the acquisition of National Bank of New York City (""NBNYC"") (renamed Newtek Bank, N.A.) and the withdrawal of NewtekOne's BDC election. NewtekOne now consolidates the balance sheets and results of operations of its former portfolio companies (now consolidated subsidiaries) and no longer applies investment company accounting. Barry Sloane, CEO, President and Chairman commented, “We are pleased to report our first full year as a financial holding company owning Newtek Bank, a nationally chartered bank. We achieved basic earnings per share (EPS) of $1.71 and diluted EPS of $1.70, in line with our previously issued annual earnings guidance of $1.60 to $1.80 per basic and diluted common share. For 2024, we are currently forecasting annual EPS in a range of $1.80 to $2.00 per basic and diluted common share, which would represent an approximate 11% increase from 2023 EPS to the midpoint of the 2024 forecasted range. We believe that we can achieve double-digit controlled EPS growth in today’s environment, given the majority of our net revenue is non-interest-bearing, making our business model unique and valuable. For the full year 2023, Newtek Bank realized return on average assets (""ROAA"") of 5.8%, return on tangible common equity (""ROTCE"") of 35.8%, and an efficiency ratio of 49.8%. NewtekOne, Newtek Bank's financial holding company, realized ROAA of 3.2%, and ROTCE of 22.7%1. We believe these metrics clearly depict a thriving business; one that serves independent business owners in all 50 states and that is well positioned for financial and operational growth in future quarters, demonstrated by our expanding net interest margin. Our operating structure does not use branches, traditional bankers, brokers, or business development officers to source business opportunities, and instead, relies upon the patented NewTracker(R) system which generates approximately 1,000 unique business referrals each day. Unlike other financial holding companies, we have been able to expand our business during these difficult times in the banking sector, which we attribute to our unique and time-tested business model that utilizes technology to minimize or eliminate the concept of traditional bankers, brokers, branches and business development officers. With NewtekOne’s common equity Tier-1 capital (CET1) ratio of 16.5%, total capital ratio of 19.6%, and 15.6% leverage ratio, we believe we have the equity to continue to grow our business, pay an attractive market dividend and grow retaining earnings.” Mr. Sloane continued, “With 2023 behind us, we can look back with pride over the year’s multiple accomplishments and building a strong foundation for our future. The conversion from a BDC to a financial holding company resulted in the Company no longer qualifying as a regulated investment company (RIC) for federal income tax purposes and no longer qualifying for accounting treatment as an investment company. Accordingly, we believe prior year and year-over-year comparisons are difficult and it is important to analyze many of our financial metrics on a quarter-over-quarter sequential basis. Additionally, when analyzing NewtekOne, we also believe it is important to consider our time-tested, differentiated business model which has provided multiple streams of income from its lines of business. These changes came with many operational and accounting challenges. We are on a path to realizing our goal of being recognized as the premier business and financial solutions provider for independent business owners in the U.S. By purchasing a nationally chartered bank, we were able to add depository services to our already-robust menu of high-quality business and financial solutions that we believe can enable our clients to operate at a higher level. Most of our clients go to their depository institutions multiple times per week or month. Extremely important to note is that our conversion to a bank holding company in no way implies that NewtekOne and Newtek Bank will look like or operate like the universe of traditional bank holding companies or banks. As a result, we do not think we should be valued like a traditional bank, as our business model offers our investors more than net interest income, and therefore, we believe should garner distinct valuation compared to the universe of traditional banks. We also value this non-interest income as reoccurring income. We firmly believe that our business model can be executed with prudent risk management practices while servicing our clients with multiple solutions that can enhance their business and commercial endeavors. Our operating metrics are built on growth objectives with respect to ROA, ROE, and efficiency ratios, which we believe is distinct from the asset-growth strategies of the traditional banking industry. During our call tomorrow morning, we will illustrate our differentiated model through the discussion of detailed performance metrics.” NewtekOne Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Highlights As noted above, we believe it is important to analyze many of our financial metrics on a quarter-over-quarter sequential basis: Net income was $13.4 million, or $0.53 per basic and diluted common share, for the three months ended December 31, 2023, a 20.5% increase on a per share basis over net income of $10.9 million, or $0.43 per basic and diluted common share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023.Net interest income was $8.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023; an increase of 2.5% over $8.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.Total assets were $1.4 billion at December 31, 2023, which remained relatively consistent to the balance at September 30, 2023.Total borrowings were $644.1 million at December 31, 2023; a decrease of 0.7% from $648.7 million at September 30, 2023.Loans held for investment were $806.8 million at December 31, 2023; an increase of 4.2% over $774.6 million at September 30, 2023.Cash and cash equivalents were $184.0 million, including $30.9 million of restricted cash, at December 31, 2023; a decrease of 17.7% from to $223.7 million, including $70.7 million of restricted cash, at September 30, 2023.Net interest margin2 was 2.83% for the three months ended December 31, 2023; an increase of 4.4% over 2.71% for the three months ended September 30, 2023.ROTCE of 20.4% for the three months ended December 31, 2023; a decrease of 16.0% over 24.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2023.ROAA1,2 of 3.7% for the three months ended December 31, 2023; an increase of 19.4% over 3.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2023.Efficiency ratio2 of 61.2% for the three months ended December 31, 2023; a decrease of 4.1% compared to 63.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2023.Total risk-based capital ratio2 was 19.6% at December 31, 2023; an increase of 10.7% over 17.7% at September 30, 2023.Tier-1 leverage ratio2 was 15.6% at December 31, 2023; an increase of 6.8% over 14.6% at September 30, 2023.On January 12, 2024, the Company paid its fourth quarterly cash dividend as a financial holding company of $0.18 per share to shareholders of record as of December 29, 2023.The Company is forecasting full year 2024 EPS in a range of $1.80 to $2.00 per basic and diluted common share, which would represent a 13.1% increase from full year 2023 EPS of $1.70 from the midpoint of the full year 2024 forecasted range.

The Company’s 2023 prior-period comparative financial statements have been adjusted to correct errors made in the Company’s condensed financial statements previously issued in the first, second, and third quarters of 2023. Amounts referenced in this press release refer to results on an ""As Adjusted"" basis unless otherwise noted. Specifically, as set forth in the ""Summary of Revisions to Prior Period Financial Statements,"" annexed hereto, which revises certain line items in the Company’s condensed financial information for the first, second, and third quarters of 2023 as previously reported, the Company’s: (i) year-to-date EPS (basic and diluted) reflects an increase of $0.08 per share and $0.07 per share, respectively; (ii) year-to-date Net Income reflects an increase of $1.1 million; and (iii) Total Assets reflects an increase of $7.5 million. The increases in Total Assets was primarily driven by the recognition of net deferred tax assets and income tax receivables as well as intangible assets. The increases in Net Income resulted principally from the after-tax impact of the recognition of servicing assets at Newtek Bank, and the recognition of deferred loan origination costs, net, in connection with accounting for loans originated by Newtek Bank. The revised calculations of EPS are attributed to application of the treasury stock and if-converted methods, as well as revisions to the allocation of undistributed earnings to preferred stock under the two class method, in conjunction with other adjustments to net income. The Company's management continues to assess the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting (“ICFR”), including any deficiencies in ICFR which led to these accounting errors. Continuing, Mr. Sloane said, “The goal of owning a nationally chartered bank was the recognition that our client base communicates with their bank digitally with high frequency, so the opportunity and our ability to communicate with our clients through our Newtek Advantage® platform, and assist them on a daily basis to become part of their operating ecosystem, has been our goal and is now closer to reality. We have witnessed the customer traffic to Newtekone.com and Newtekbank.com increase to approximately 18,000 unique digital visitors per month, providing our customers with the opportunity to access the Newtek Advantage®, communicate with us, and see all we have to offer. We will discuss these concepts and the value of these impressions on our call tomorrow. We seek to employ the most cutting-edge technology and AI in order to enhance the client experience, improve work flow processes, and acquire clients in an environment that has less friction and higher levels of business satisfaction.” Mr. Sloane concluded, “We spent a good part of 2023 building out our bank infrastructure, continuing to hire top-quality executives and establishing additional policies and procedures, all at a great expense, an investment we believe will provide a great return in the future. Obviously, the investment and upfront expense is to better enable us to safely and soundly grow our business, and develop a lasting infrastructure. Also important to note, is that we have been able to grow our loan-loss reserves dramatically during our first twelve months of operations ending December 31, 2023. We ended 2023 with a 3.1% loan loss reserve to loans held for investment, and we expect to prudently manage credit risk and related reserves as the future conditions of the economy take shape. We are excited about our results for 2023 and discussing them in greater detail during our conference call scheduled for tomorrow at 8:30am EST. Please visit our website and review our Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Presentation.” Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Conference Call and Webcast A conference call to discuss the fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results will be hosted by Barry Sloane, President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, M.

Investor Relations & Public RelationsContact: Jayne Cavuoto Telephone: (212) 273-8179 / jcavuoto@newtekone.com Summary of Revisions to Prior Period Consolidated Financial Statements As of January 6, 2023, the Company is no longer subject to Financial Accounting Standard Board Accounting Standards Codification (FASB) Topic (ASC) 946 Financial Services – Investment Companies, which resulted in a significant change in the Company’s accounting and financial reporting requirements for the year ended December 31, 2023. For example, the Company is required to consolidate the financial statements of what was previously referred to as our controlled or majority-owned investments together with those already consolidated by the Company. In accordance with ASC 946, prior to January 6, 2023, the Company was required to account for investments, loans and other receivables at fair value. For fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the Company is now required to account for debt securities under ASC 320, loans and other receivables, including modifications and restructurings under ASC 310, and must apply the current expected credit loss model to each of these financial instruments under ASC 326. Additionally, management continues to elect the fair value option of accounting under ASC 825 for certain financial instruments. Finally, as a result of the conversion, the Company no longer qualifies as a RIC for federal income tax purposes, and no longer qualifies for accounting treatment as an investment company, therefore management has been required to expend significant efforts in order to implement these changes in accounting and financial reporting requirements. The Company’s condensed comparative financial statements have been adjusted to correct errors made in the Company’s financial statements previously issued for the first, second, and third quarters of 2023. These adjustments include the following adjustments for the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2023: Accounting for deferred loan origination fees and costs, net, under ASC 310 resulting in a $5.1 million and $5.7 million decrease in non-interest income and non-interest expense, respectively;Calculating EPS under ASC 260 to reflect the treasury stock and if-converted methods and adjusting the allocations under the two-class method, in conjunction with other adjustments to net income, all resulting in an increase of $0.08 and $0.07 per share for basic and diluted EPS, respectively;Establishing deferred net tax assets and income taxes receivable under ASC 740 in conjunction with the common control transaction, resulting in increased net deferred tax assets and income taxes receivable of $1.9 million;Establishing certain servicing assets under ASC 860 in conjunction with the common control transaction resulting in a $1.0 million increase in non-interest income and a $1.5 million increase in servicing assets; andAn adjusting opening balance sheet entry in conjunction with common control transaction to correct understatements of goodwill and intangibles and stockholders’ equity resulting in respective increases of $3.9 million. The year-to-date and quarterly impact of these adjustments for the periods presented are outlined in the unaudited tables below.

SS&C's expertise and global reach will support Circulate Capital's operations and attract institutional capital for expanding their impact. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc.'s collaboration with Circulate Capital represents a strategic move that could enhance SS&C's positioning within the ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) investment services market. By serving as the fund administrator for Circulate Capital's funds, SS&C is set to benefit from the growing demand for ESG-focused financial services. The partnership underscores the importance of robust fund administration capabilities in attracting institutional capital, particularly as investors increasingly prioritize sustainable and ethical investment criteria.The provision of anti-money laundering support further emphasizes the comprehensive nature of services that fund administrators must offer to remain competitive. From a financial perspective, this collaboration could potentially lead to an increase in SS&C's revenue streams, given the expanding ESG market. However, it is essential to monitor the operational costs associated with the added complexity of managing ESG-focused funds and the impact on SS&C's profit margins. ESG Investment Consultant The appointment of SS&C by Circulate Capital as its fund administrator is indicative of the increasing sophistication required in the ESG investment space. Circulate Capital's focus on the circular economy and its impressive track record in reducing plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions reflects a maturing market where environmental impact is not only measured but also monetized. This collaboration could set a precedent for how ESG funds operate and report, potentially influencing industry norms and investor expectations.For stakeholders, the long-term implications may include a more transparent and accountable investment landscape, which could foster greater trust and lead to further capital inflows. However, the challenge lies in maintaining the balance between rigorous impact reporting and operational efficiency. As the ESG investment space evolves, the need for specialized fund administration that can navigate the complexities of impact measurement and reporting will likely become a differentiator among investment management firms. Market Research Analyst With SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. expanding its services to include fund administration for an ESG-focused firm like Circulate Capital, there is a clear signal that the market for ESG investments is not only growing but also diversifying. Circulate Capital's investments in companies that contribute to the circular economy and its efforts in reducing environmental impact are likely to resonate with a broader investor base, particularly Development Finance Institutions.As the demand for ESG investment opportunities increases globally, SS&C's role in facilitating these investments could position the company as a key player in this niche market. This collaboration may also reflect broader market trends, where investors are not just looking for financial returns but also for measurable environmental and social impact. The ability of SS&C to meet these complex reporting requirements could be a significant competitive advantage and may influence other service providers to enhance their capabilities in this domain. 03/05/2024 - 08:00 PM Leading ESG investor Circulate Capital appoints SS&C as fund administrator to advance environmental impact Goals WINDSOR, Conn., March 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc.

BlackRock Successfully Prices $3 Billion Offering of Senior Notes,2024-03-05T22:33:00.000Z,Low,Negative,"BlackRock, Inc.

The offering will fund a portion of the cash consideration for the acquisition of Global Infrastructure Management, LLC. The Notes are guaranteed by BlackRock and will be subject to special mandatory redemption under certain circumstances.","BlackRock Successfully Prices $3 Billion Offering of Senior Notes Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary BlackRock, Inc. (BLK) successfully priced a $3 billion debt offering with three tranches of senior unsecured notes. The offering will fund a portion of the cash consideration for the acquisition of Global Infrastructure Management, LLC. The Notes are guaranteed by BlackRock and will be subject to special mandatory redemption under certain circumstances. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst BlackRock's recent $3 billion debt offering is a significant financial maneuver that underscores the company's strategic approach to capital management. The structuring of the debt into three tranches with varying maturities allows BlackRock to diversify its debt profile and manage interest rate risk. The higher interest rates on the longer-dated notes reflect a typical yield curve, where investors require higher yields for longer commitments due to the increased risk of interest rate changes over time.The specified use of proceeds to fund a portion of the GIP Transaction acquisition indicates a calculated move to expand BlackRock's assets under management and potentially increase its market share in the infrastructure investment space. This strategic acquisition could lead to enhanced revenue streams and diversification of BlackRock's portfolio, which is beneficial for stakeholders in the long run. However, the mention of a special mandatory redemption clause suggests a cautious approach, as it provides a safeguard for investors should the acquisition not proceed as planned. Legal Expert The inclusion of a special mandatory redemption clause is a critical legal element in this debt offering. It is designed to protect the investors by allowing them to recoup their investment plus a premium if the GIP Transaction does not materialize. This legal mechanism reflects BlackRock's commitment to investor interests and provides a level of security that could make the notes more attractive to potential investors, thereby potentially reducing the cost of capital for BlackRock.Furthermore, the guarantee by BlackRock on a senior unsecured basis indicates a strong backing for BlackRock Funding's obligations. This guarantee suggests a vote of confidence in BlackRock Funding's financial stability and BlackRock's overall financial health. Investors should be aware that this structure prioritizes the repayment of these notes over other unsecured obligations, which could influence the company's creditworthiness and debt servicing priorities. Market Research Analyst The decision by BlackRock to enter the market with a sizable debt offering at this juncture could be indicative of market conditions and the company's assessment of the interest rate environment. With the staggered maturities, BlackRock is positioning itself to manage future cash flows and interest obligations in a way that aligns with its long-term financial strategy. This move could signal confidence to the market about BlackRock's financial planning and its ability to service debt over an extended period.Additionally, the role of prominent financial institutions as joint book-running managers reflects the offering's credibility and the importance of such partnerships in executing large-scale financial operations. Their involvement may contribute to the successful placement of the notes by ensuring a wide distribution among institutional investors, which can be a positive signal for the stock market regarding BlackRock's industry standing and the anticipated success of the offering. 03/05/2024 - 05:33 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BlackRock, Inc.

(AWK) announces the start of water main flushing operations in Camden, New Jersey, to maintain water quality and ensure system reliability. Positive None. Negative None. 03/05/2024 - 05:30 PM Water main flushing begins this month and continues through the fall CAMDEN, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Beginning this week and into the fall months, New Jersey American Water will perform the annual flushing of its water distribution system to continue to provide customers with high-quality, reliable water service. “Flushing our system is an important, routine process that helps us clean out any mineral deposits or sediment that may have built up over time inside the pipes,” said New Jersey American Water President Mark McDonough. “While we’re flushing, we also take the opportunity to check our water pressure and fire flows in the system and confirm our hydrants are operational.” Flushing involves simultaneously opening fire hydrants in a specific area to create increased water flows. This routine flushing program also includes flushing blowoff valves on dead-end water mains throughout the system. While water mains are being cleaned, customers may notice short periods of low water pressure or discolored water. If customers experience temporary water discoloration, New Jersey American Water recommends running the cold water until it is clear. The following steps are also encouraged: Sign up and opt-in for general alerts to be notified when flushing takes place. Draw water for cooking prior to the flushing period. Store a large bottle of water in the refrigerator for drinking. Check for discolored water before using the washing machine or dishwasher. If water pressure or water volume seems low after flushing has been completed, check faucet screens for trapped particles. “In addition to continuously investing in our infrastructure, essential maintenance activities such as our hydrant flushing program are key to providing our customers with high-quality drinking water, and it is an annual requirement of the Water Quality Accountability Act,” McDonough added. New Jersey American Water will notify customers when flushing takes place in their area through its mass notification system and asks customers to take a few moments to update their contact information and preferences in their MyWater account. Customers must opt-in for general alerts to receive local flushing and other non-emergency notifications via phone call, text or email. Individuals who are not New Jersey American Water account holders but would like to receive alerts and notifications from the company can also sign up by visiting awcodered.com or by texting WATER to 99411.

The company is addressing a rare cancer with no approved treatments, impacting a significant patient population. Positive FDA Orphan Drug Designation granted to avutometinib and defactinib for recurrent low-grade serous ovarian cancer. Ongoing Phase 3 trial (RAMP 301) evaluating the combination treatment. Targeting submission of rolling NDA for Accelerated Approval in the first half of 2024. Avutometinib and defactinib aim to address a high unmet medical need in LGSOC patients. LGSOC affects a younger patient population with significant mortality rates. Potential launch of the combination treatment in 2025. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The granting of Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) by the U.S. FDA to avutometinib, either as a monotherapy or in combination with defactinib, represents a significant endorsement for Verastem Oncology's commitment to address the unmet medical needs in recurrent low-grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSOC). The ODD status not only facilitates the development process by providing certain benefits, such as tax credits and market exclusivity upon approval, but it also underscores the urgency in finding effective treatments for this rare and challenging form of cancer.From a clinical perspective, the focus on the RAS/MAPK Pathway alterations, which are prevalent in approximately 70% of LGSOC cases, is noteworthy. These genetic mutations are known to drive tumor growth and resistance to conventional chemotherapy, highlighting the potential of avutometinib and defactinib to provide a targeted therapeutic approach. The combination of a RAF/MEK clamp with a selective FAK inhibitor could offer a novel mechanism of action, potentially improving outcomes for a patient demographic that experiences high recurrence rates and limited treatment options.Furthermore, the mention of a rolling New Drug Application (NDA) for Accelerated Approval indicates a proactive regulatory strategy that could expedite the availability of this treatment to patients. Given the high mortality rate and the severe pain and complications associated with LGSOC, accelerated access to new therapies could significantly impact patient quality of life and survival outcomes. Medical Research Analyst The Phase 3 RAMP 301 trial is a critical step in the clinical development pathway for avutometinib and defactinib. This trial's results will be pivotal in determining the efficacy and safety of the drug combination in a real-world patient population. The trial design and endpoints will likely focus on progression-free survival, overall survival and quality of life metrics, considering the disease's high recurrence rate and resistance to chemotherapy.From a research analysis standpoint, the trial's success could set a precedent for similar targeted therapies in rare cancers. It is also important to note the potential economic implications for Verastem Oncology. A successful trial followed by FDA approval could lead to significant revenue generation, especially given the market exclusivity granted by the ODD. However, the cost of treatment and reimbursement strategies will be crucial factors in the commercial viability of the therapy.Investors and stakeholders should closely monitor the trial's progress and interim data releases, as these will provide valuable insights into the treatment's potential market impact. Additionally, the company's preparation for a potential 2025 launch suggests confidence in the treatment's prospects, but it is essential to remain cautious until the trial data substantiates this optimism. Financial Analyst The announcement of the FDA's Orphan Drug Designation for Verastem Oncology's treatment options for LGSOC is likely to be well-received by investors, as it signals regulatory support and potential for market exclusivity. The designation could enhance investor confidence in the company's pipeline and its strategic focus on addressing rare cancers with high unmet medical needs.Analyzing the financial implications, the tax benefits associated with the ODD can improve the company's fiscal efficiency and potentially attract investment for further research and development. Additionally, the market exclusivity period post-approval could protect the company's market share against competitors, contributing to a stronger long-term financial position.Considering the estimated patient population numbers provided, the addressable market for the treatment appears substantial enough to drive significant revenue growth for Verastem Oncology upon successful approval and commercialization. However, the actual market penetration will depend on factors such as pricing, insurance coverage and the competitive landscape at the time of launch. Stakeholders should also consider the inherent risks of investing in biopharmaceutical companies, where drug development is costly, time-consuming and subject to regulatory uncertainties. 03/05/2024 - 05:27 PM Recurrent low-grade serous ovarian cancer is a rare cancer with no FDA-approved treatments Ongoing Phase 3 RAMP 301 trial is evaluating avutometinib and defactinib in recurrent low-grade serous ovarian cancer On track to submit rolling NDA for Accelerated Approval in H1 2024 BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Verastem Oncology (Nasdaq: VSTM), a biopharmaceutical company committed to advancing new medicines for patients, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) to avutometinib, a RAF/MEK clamp, alone or in combination with defactinib, a selective FAK inhibitor, for the treatment of all patients with recurrent low-grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSOC). “The FDA Orphan Drug Designation for avutometinib alone or in combination with defactinib in low-grade serous ovarian cancer is an important step in recognizing this rare cancer as a distinct disease that currently has no FDA-approved treatments,” said Dan Paterson, president and chief executive officer of Verastem Oncology. “We are rapidly advancing the development program for avutometinib and defactinib in low-grade serous ovarian cancer with our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial to deliver this new combination treatment to patients as quickly as possible. We remain on track to begin submission of an NDA to the FDA for Accelerated Approval of this combination in the first half of 2024 and preparing for a potential launch in 2025.” Approximately 70% of LGSOC is associated with RAS/MAPK Pathway alterations including KRAS, NRAS HRAS, and other non-RAS associated mutations. Unfortunately, approximately 85% of patients with LGSOC experience recurrence of the disease. LGSOC is a highly recurrent, chemotherapy-resistant cancer, associated with slow tumor growth and high mortality rate. An estimated 6,000 women in the U.S. and 80,000 worldwide are living with this disease. LGSOC affects a younger patient population with bimodal peaks at ages 20-30 and 50-60 years of age and has a median survival of approximately ten years. The majority of patients experience severe pain and complications as the disease progresses. While chemotherapy is the standard of care for this disease, there are no treatments specifically approved by the FDA to treat LGSOC. About the Avutometinib and Defactinib Combination Avutometinib is a RAF/MEK clamp that induces inactive complexes of MEK with ARAF, BRAF and CRAF potentially creating a more complete and durable anti-tumor response through maximal RAS/MAPK pathway inhibition. In contrast to currently available MEK-only inhibitors, avutometinib blocks both MEK kinase activity and the ability of RAF to phosphorylate MEK. This unique mechanism allows avutometinib to block MEK signaling without the compensatory activation of MEK that appears to limit the efficacy of other MEK-only inhibitors. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for the combination of Verastem Oncology’s investigational RAF/MEK clamp avutometinib, with defactinib, a selective FAK inhibitor, for the treatment of all patients with recurrent low-grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSOC) regardless of KRAS status after one or more prior lines of therapy, including platinum-based chemotherapy. Verastem Oncology is currently conducting clinical trials with its RAF/MEK clamp avutometinib in RAS/MAPK driven tumors as part of its (Raf And Mek Program). RAMP 301 (NCT06072781) is a Phase 3 confirmatory trial evaluating the combination of avutometinib and defactinib versus standard chemotherapy or hormonal therapy for the treatment of recurrent LGSOC. RAMP 201 (NCT04625270) is a Phase 2 registration-directed trial of avutometinib in combination with defactinib in patients with recurrent LGSOC and has completed enrollment in the dose optimization, expansion phase, and low-dose evaluation cohorts. Verastem Oncology has established clinical collaborations with Amgen and Mirati to evaluate LUMAKRAS™ (sotorasib) and KRAZATI™ (adagrasib) in combination with avutometinib in KRAS G12C mutant NSCLC as part of the RAMP 203 (NCT05074810) and RAMP 204 (NCT05375994) trials, respectively. Supported by the “Therapeutic Accelerator Award” Verastem Oncology received from PanCAN, the Company is conducting RAMP 205 (NCT05669482), a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial evaluating avutometinib and defactinib with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in patients with front-line metastatic pancreatic cancer. About Verastem Oncology Verastem Oncology (Nasdaq: VSTM) is a late-stage development biopharmaceutical company committed to the development and commercialization of new medicines to improve the lives of patients diagnosed with cancer. Our pipeline is focused on novel small molecule drugs that inhibit critical signaling pathways in cancer that promote cancer cell survival and tumor growth, including RAF/MEK inhibition and FAK inhibition.

The proceeds will fund exploration and development projects in Nevada. Positive Integra Resources Corp. has entered into an agreement with underwriters for a bought deal offering of 11,112,000 units at a price of C$0.90 per unit, totaling approximately C$10 million. Each unit includes one common share and one-half of a common share purchase warrant, with the warrant allowing the purchase of one common share at C$1.20 within 36 months. The underwriters have the option to purchase additional units equal to 15% of the offering for market stabilization and to cover over-allotments. The net proceeds from the offering will be used for exploration and development at the DeLamar Project, the Nevada North Project, and general corporate purposes. The offering will be qualified by a prospectus supplement to the existing base shelf prospectus in Canada, excluding Quebec. Closing of the offering is expected soon. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Integra Resources Corp. regarding the 'bought deal' financing represents a significant capital infusion for the company, which is a critical component for its growth and expansion strategy. The gross proceeds of approximately C$10 million, with the potential for an additional 15% in over-allotments, provide the company with a substantial amount of capital to allocate towards its exploration and development projects. The inclusion of warrants in the deal structure could potentially dilute existing shareholders but also serves as an incentive for investors, as it allows them to purchase additional shares at a set price in the future, potentially below market value if the company performs well.It is important to note that the offering price of C$0.90 per unit represents a snapshot of the company's valuation at the time of the deal. Investors and stakeholders should compare this price to the current market price and historical performance to assess the attractiveness of the deal. The exercise price of the warrants (C$1.20) is another key figure, as it indicates the level of confidence the underwriters and the company have in the future stock price appreciation.The intended use of proceeds for specific projects like the DeLamar Project and the Nevada North Project gives investors a clear direction on the company's strategic priorities. However, the allocation of funds towards 'working capital and general corporate purposes' is less specific and stakeholders should look for further details on how these funds will be used to drive shareholder value. Market Research Analyst Integra Resources Corp.'s decision to raise capital through a 'bought deal' can be seen as a strategic move to accelerate its exploration and development activities. This is indicative of a bullish outlook from the company on the prospects of its projects. The market's reaction to such news typically depends on investor sentiment regarding the company's growth potential and the terms of the deal. The fact that the underwriters have committed to buying the shares upfront suggests confidence in the company's value proposition.It's also noteworthy that the company has excluded Quebec from the offering, which could be due to regulatory, strategic, or financial considerations. This exclusion could influence the regional market dynamics and investor participation. The market will also be observing the uptake of the over-allotment option as an indicator of demand and confidence in the company's future prospects.As the mining sector is capital intensive, the success of such financings is often a bellwether for a company's operational progress and financial health. The market will likely monitor the deployment of the raised capital into the stated projects and evaluate the potential impact on the company's production capabilities and resource estimates, which in turn could influence the company's stock performance. Legal Expert The financing transaction by Integra Resources Corp. is structured to comply with securities regulations, as evidenced by the reference to the prospectus supplement and the base shelf prospectus. The legal framework for such transactions is designed to ensure that investors are provided with sufficient information to make informed decisions. The availability of the prospectus supplement on SEDAR+ indicates transparency and adherence to disclosure obligations, which is crucial for investor trust.Additionally, the 30-day period for the underwriters to purchase additional units for market stabilization and over-allotment coverage is a common feature in such deals, known as the 'greenshoe option'. This legal mechanism allows for better market liquidity and price stability post-offering, which can be beneficial for both the company and its investors. Stakeholders should be aware of the implications of these legal provisions on the overall transaction structure and the company's capital market activities. 03/05/2024 - 05:17 PM TSXV: ITR; NYSE American: ITRGwww.integraresources.com VANCOUVER, BC, March 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Integra Resources Corp.

Announces Significant Five-Year Contract Extension in Australia Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary North American Construction Group Ltd. (NOA) secures a five-year contract extension worth $500 million with a major metallurgical coal producer in Australia. The contract includes fully maintained equipment and services, with additional fleet purchases planned. Positive Securing a $500 million contract extension showcases the company's strong partnership and operational capabilities. The contract extension provides visibility and stability in revenue for the next five years. The addition of new equipment demonstrates the company's commitment to meeting client needs and expanding its fleet. The estimated rental scopes of $100 million per year indicate significant revenue generation potential. The extension enhances the company's contractual backlog and strengthens its position in the market. The strategic location of the mine in Queensland, Australia, offers growth opportunities for the company. The planned fleet expansion reflects the company's focus on operational efficiency and capacity enhancement. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The extension of the MacKellar Group contract represents a significant reinforcement of North American Construction Group Ltd.'s revenue stream, particularly in the context of the mining sector. The $500 million total value over five years indicates a robust addition to NACG's contractual backlog, which is a critical metric for assessing the company's future revenue predictability and stability. This development is noteworthy for stakeholders as it reflects the company's ability to maintain long-term relationships with major clients, a key indicator of service quality and operational reliability.Furthermore, the investment in additional heavy equipment units, while substantial, is likely to be offset by the guaranteed revenue from the contract. The capital expenditure of $20 to $25 million needs to be examined in relation to the expected annual rental income of $100 million, suggesting a favorable return on investment. This strategic expansion of NACG's fleet also implies confidence in the ongoing demand for their services within the mining industry. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the announcement is likely to be received positively by the stock market, as it provides a clear signal of NACG's growth trajectory. The five-year contract extension ensures a stable cash flow, which is a positive indicator for investors and could potentially lead to an upward revision of stock price targets. It is also essential to consider the timing of the equipment purchase in Q4 2024, which will impact the fiscal year's capital expenditure and depreciation schedules.Investors should monitor how this capital outlay influences the company's debt levels and financing activities. The financial leverage and interest coverage ratios will be key indicators to watch in subsequent quarters. It is also relevant to assess the impact of this contract on the company's earnings per share (EPS), as the additional revenue could contribute to higher profitability if costs are managed effectively. Economist The contract extension can be seen as a microeconomic indicator of the health of the metallurgical coal industry, particularly in the Australian market. Metallurgical coal is a critical input for steel production and its demand is closely tied to the global steel industry's performance. The commitment to a long-term contract might suggest expectations of sustained demand for steel and by extension, metallurgical coal. This could have broader implications for the mining equipment and services sector, indicating a potential period of growth and investment.Additionally, the scale of the contract and its extension could have a positive impact on the regional economy in Queensland, potentially leading to job creation and increased economic activity. This contract serves as a case study for the interconnectedness of global commodity markets and regional economic development. 03/05/2024 - 05:05 PM ACHESON, Alberta, March 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- North American Construction Group Ltd. (“NACG” or “the Company”) (TSX:NOA.TO/NYSE:NOA) today announced that the MacKellar Group (“MacKellar”) has been awarded a five-year contract extension by a major metallurgical coal producer in relation to a mine in the state of Queensland, Australia. The contract contemplates the provision of fully maintained equipment and related services at the site operated by the producer. The award extends the expiry date from June 6, 2025 to June 30, 2030 and qualifies as contractual backlog given minimum hour commitments in the agreement. Rental scopes are estimated at $100 million per year resulting in a total value from this extension of $500 million. The contract requires the addition of two loading units and one service truck, for between $20 and $25 million, which will be purchased in 2024 Q4 and bring the total dedicated fleet at this site to approximately seventy heavy equipment units. “We are excited about this extension and look forward to continuing the relationship we have with our customer at this site,” said Joe Lambert, President and CEO of NACG. “This is the first material contract we have signed in Australia since the acquisition of MacKellar and are very proud of how well the first five months have gone. MacKellar has provided an excellent platform to grow our business in Australia as we leverage our operational and maintenance expertise in the region. We believe this ‘locking in’ of fleet is indicative of the strong demand for heavy equipment in the Australian mining sector. In light of this demand, and bolstered by long-term contracts, we have begun to take steps towards prudently increasing fleet size in Australia, including potentially transferring underutilized Canadian fleet into that market with the goal of maximizing overall utilization.” About the MacKellar GroupEstablished in 1966 based on humble family values, MacKellar has earned an enviable reputation in Australia for performance and reliability. MacKellar specializes in heavy earthmoving equipment solutions and has a proud history of working on both mining and civil earthwork projects.

The transaction with the officer constitutes a ""related party transaction"" as defined under Multilateral Instrument 61-101 Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (""MI 61-101""). The Company is relying on the exemptions under section 5.5(a) and section 5.7(1)(a) from the formal valuation and minority shareholder approval requirements of MI 61-101, as the fair market value of the Units issued to the related party and the consideration paid by the related party under the Private Placement does not exceed 25% of Company's market capitalization, as determined in accordance with MI 61-101. The Company did not file a material change report in respect of the related party transaction at least 21 days before the closing of the Private Placement, as the details of the participation by related party of the Company were not settled until shortly prior to closing of the Private Placement.In addition, South Star and its BamaStar project partners Hexagon and US Critical Minerals have extended the current existing mineral leases and surface agreements on the Project for an additional two-year period beyond the initial five-year term of the original agreements (Refer to the Company's Press Release dated December 07, 2021). The earn-in option agreement remains unchanged.Richard Pearce, CEO of South Star, commented, ""We are very excited to get the oversubscribed, private placement successfully closed and be on very solid financial footing, while also executing on our strategy of near-term production with scalable graphite assets in Tier 1 jurisdictions at a critical time when the global supply chains require more graphite products sourced outside of China. We are aiming to produce at Santa Cruz around 5,000 tonnes of graphite concentrates in 2024 and 13,000 tonnes in 2025. We are getting ready to kickoff our National Instrument 43-101 Preliminary Economic Assessment for BamaStar, including the value-add plant in the southeast corridor of U.S., which we are planning to have preliminary results completed in approximately three months. We had excellent meetings recently with the Economic Development Partnership of Alabama, as well as the Louisiana Economic Development Agency. 2024 is going to be an exciting year for South Star as we become the first new graphite producer in the Americas this century.""About South Star Battery Metals CorpSouth Star Battery Metals Corp. is a Canadian battery metals project developer focused on the selective acquisition and development of near-term production projects in the Americas. South Star's Santa Cruz Graphite Project, located in Southern Bahia, Brazil is the first of a series of industrial and battery metals projects that will be put into production. Brazil is the second-largest graphite-producing region in the world with more than 80 years of continuous mining. Santa Cruz has at-surface mineralization in friable materials, and successful large-scale pilot-plant testing (> 30t) has been completed. The results of the testing show that approximately 65% of Cg concentrate is +80 mesh with good recoveries and 95%-99% Cg. With excellent infrastructure and logistics, South Star is fully funded for Phase 1, and the construction and commissioning are underway. Santa Cruz will be the first new graphite production in the Americas since 1996 with Phase 1 commercial production projected in Q1 2024. Phase 2 production (25,000 tpa) is partially funded and planned for 2026, while Phase 3 (50,000 tpa) is scheduled for 2028.South Star's second project in the development pipeline is strategically located in Alabama in the center of a developing electric vehicle, aerospace, and defense hub in the southeastern United States. The BamaStar Project is a historic mine active during World Wars I & II. A NI43-101 technical report with the maiden resource estimate has been filed on SEDAR. Trenching, phase 1 drilling, sampling, analysis, and preliminary metallurgical testing have been completed. The testing indicates a traditional crush/grind/flotation concentration circuit that achieved grades of approximately 94-97% Cg with approximately 86% recoveries. South Star is executing on its plan to create a multi-asset, diversified battery metals company with near-term operations in strategic jurisdictions. South Star trades on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol STS, and on the OTCQB under the symbol STSBF.South Star is committed to a corporate culture, project execution plan and safe operations that embrace the highest standards of ESG principles based on transparency, stakeholder engagement, ongoing education, and stewardship.

Negative Net loss for the year due to increased finance costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased for the year. Adjusted net income decreased by 10% for the year. Decline in net income per diluted share for the year. Financial Analyst The reported financial results of Nuvei Corporation indicate significant year-over-year growth in total volume and revenue, which are critical metrics for assessing a company's performance and future prospects. The substantial increase in total volume, by 59% to $203.0 billion and a 41% rise in revenue to $1,189.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, reflect a robust expansion of the company's transaction processing capabilities and market reach. However, it is important to note the reported net loss of $0.7 million, compared to the previous year's net income of $62.0 million and a decrease in adjusted net income by 10% to $247.9 million. This divergence between top-line growth and bottom-line results could be indicative of increased operational costs or strategic investments that may affect profitability in the short term but potentially position the company for long-term success.Another key point is the adjusted EBITDA margin decrease to 36.8% from 41.7%, suggesting a contraction in operational efficiency or increased costs relative to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The share repurchase and cash dividends declared, totaling $56 million and $27.9 million respectively, demonstrate the company's confidence in its cash flow generation and commitment to returning value to shareholders. However, the repayment of $127.8 million in long-term debt and the lowering of the combined leverage ratio to 2.5x reflect a prudent approach to financial management and debt reduction.When evaluating the financial outlook, the projected ranges for total volume, revenue and adjusted EBITDA suggest continued growth, albeit with a cautious approach due to macro uncertainties. This forward-looking information is crucial for investors as it provides insight into management's expectations and strategic priorities. The impact of the acquisition of Till Payments on the company's adjusted EBITDA margins and the goal to achieve breakeven or better on the acquisition by year-end are particularly noteworthy, as they highlight the company's focus on integrating acquisitions effectively and improving profitability. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Nuvei's performance and strategic moves must be contextualized within the broader fintech industry, which is characterized by rapid innovation, high competition and significant regulatory scrutiny. The company's revenue growth across all sales channels—Global commerce, B2B, government and ISV and SMB—and regions—North America, EMEA, LATAM and APAC—demonstrates its ability to scale globally and diversify its revenue streams, a crucial factor for resilience and long-term success in the fintech space.The focus on organic revenue growth at constant currency, which was 9% for the year, indicates a solid core business performance that is less influenced by external factors such as currency fluctuations. This is a positive sign for investors looking for sustainable growth. Furthermore, the company's medium-term revenue growth target of 15-20% and long-term adjusted EBITDA margin target of 50%+ are ambitious and signal a confident outlook on the company's strategic direction and market opportunities. However, achieving these targets will likely require continued investment in product innovation, customer acquisition and perhaps further strategic acquisitions, which could impact short-term margins and profitability.Additionally, the company's capital expenditure strategy, maintaining it between 4-6% of revenue over the medium term, reflects a balanced approach to investing in growth while managing cash flow. The fact that Nuvei has reached an 'inflection point' where it can continue to expand its adjusted EBITDA margin indicates operational maturity and the potential for improved profitability as the company scales. Legal Expert From a legal and regulatory standpoint, the declaration of dividends and the share repurchase program are subject to compliance with corporate laws and securities regulations. The designation of dividends as 'eligible dividends' for Canadian tax purposes and the expectation to report them as dividends to U.S. shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes indicate a strategic approach to shareholder returns that takes into account tax implications. It is also worth noting that dividends paid to certain non-corporate U.S. shareholders may be eligible for taxation as 'qualified dividend income', which could be a tax-efficient way of distributing profits.The forward-looking statements and financial outlook provided by the company are subject to various risks and uncertainties, as indicated under the 'Forward-Looking Information' and 'Financial Outlook and Growth Targets Assumptions' sections. These disclosures are important for investors to understand the potential variability in future performance and the inherent limitations of such projections. Additionally, the use of non-IFRS financial measures, such as adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income, while providing useful insights into the company's operational performance, are not standardized under IFRS and may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Investors should be aware of these differences when making cross-company comparisons. 03/05/2024 - 05:00 PM Nuvei reports in U.S. dollars and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (""IFRS"") MONTREAL, March 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Nuvei Corporation (""Nuvei"" or the ""Company"") (Nasdaq: NVEI) (TSX: NVEI), the Canadian fintech company, today reported its financial results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023.

In NA, EMEA, LATAM, APAC, revenue increased 91%, 5%, 55% and 5%, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2023.Cash Dividend Nuvei today announced that its Board of Directors has authorized and declared a cash dividend of $0.10 per subordinate voting share and multiple voting share, payable on April 4, 2024 to shareholders of record as of March 19, 2024. The aggregate amount of the dividend is expected to be approximately $14 million, to be funded from the Company's existing cash on hand. The Company, for the purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada) and any similar provincial or territorial legislation, designates the dividend declared for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, and any future dividends, to be eligible dividends. The Company further expects to report such dividend as a dividend to U.S. shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Subject to applicable limitations, dividends paid to certain non-corporate U.S. shareholders may be eligible for taxation as ""qualified dividend income"" and therefore may be taxable at rates applicable to long-term capital gains. A U.S. shareholder should talk to its advisor regarding such dividend, including with respect to the ""extraordinary dividend"" provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (US). The declaration, timing, amount and payment of future dividends remain at the discretion of the Board of Directors, as more fully described under the heading ""Forward-Looking Information"" of this press release. Financial Outlook(d) For the three months ending March 31, 2024 and the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, Nuvei anticipates Total volume(a), Revenue, Revenue at constant currency(b) and Adjusted EBITDA(b) to be in the ranges below. The financial outlook includes the acquisition of Till Payments from the date of acquisition (January 5, 2024). Total volumes quarter-to-date have been encouraging. Nevertheless, the Company has taken a prudent approach to building its financial outlook for the current year, weighing optimism for its business and prospects against macro uncertainties, and applying more rigor around expected timing for new customer implementations throughout the year Nuvei generally expects for its underlying quarterly revenue growth rates and Adjusted EBITDA margins to ramp up throughout the year, with an objective to exit the year in line with the Company's medium-term revenue growth target of 15 – 20%. While there are near-term Adjusted EBITDA margin implications as the Company integrates Till Payments, Nuvei is focused on achieving breakeven or better on the acquisition before year-end. Normalizing for the acquisition, the Company's underlying Adjusted EBITDA margin expectation is between 36 – 37% for the three months ending March 31, 2024, which is consistent with the exit rate for the three months ending December 31, 2023. The financial outlook, including the various underlying assumptions, constitute forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws and is fully qualified and based on a number of assumptions and subject to a number of risks described under the headings ""Forward-Looking Information"" and ""Financial Outlook and Growth Targets Assumptions"" of this press release. Three months endingMarch 31, Year ending December31, 2024 2024 Forward-looking Forward-looking (In US dollars) $ $ Total volume(a) (in billions) 57 - 58 246 - 252 Revenue (in millions) 322 - 330 1,340 - 1,380 Revenue at constant currency(b) (in millions) 322 - 330 1,338 - 1,378 Adjusted EBITDA(b) (in millions) 110 - 116 480 - 510 Growth Targets Nuvei's medium-term(e) annual growth target for revenue, as well as its medium-term(e) target for capital expenditures (acquisition of intangible assets and property and equipment) as a percentage of revenue and long-term(e) target for Adjusted EBITDA margin(c), are shown in the table below. In addition, the Company believes it has a defined path to accelerate the growth in its B2B, government and ISV channel(c) to 20%-plus over the medium term(e). Furthermore, the Company believes its scaled global platform has reached an inflection point whereby it can continue to expand Adjusted EBITDA margin(c). Nuvei's targets are intended to provide insight into the execution of its strategy as it relates to growth, profitability and cash generation. These medium(e) and long-term(e) targets should not be considered as projections, forecasts or expected results but rather goals that we seek to achieve from the execution of our strategy over time, and at a further stage of business maturity, through geographic expansion, product innovation, growing wallet share with existing customers and new customer wins, as more fully described under the heading ""Summary of Factors Affecting our Performance"" of our most recent Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. These growth targets, including the various underlying assumptions, constitute forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws and are fully qualified and based on a number of assumptions and subject to a number of risks described under the headings ""Forward-Looking Information"" and ""Financial Outlook and Growth Targets Assumptions"" of this press release. We will review and revise these growth targets as economic, market and regulatory environments change. Growth Targets Revenue 15% - 20% annual year-over-year growth in the medium-term(e) Adjusted EBITDA margin(b) 50%+ over the long-term(e) Capital expenditures(f) 4% - 6% of Revenue over the medium-term(e) This is the performance of the Company with respect to these metrics over the last three years: (in US dollars except the percentages) 2021 2022 2023 Revenue (in thousands) 724,526 843,323 1,189,893 Revenue annual year-over-year growth (%) 93 % 16 % 41 % Adjusted EBITDA(b) (in thousands) 317,234 351,317 437,341 Adjusted EBITDA margin(b) (%) 43.8 % 41.7 % 36.8 % Capital expenditures(f) (in thousands) 27,169 48,322 55,080 Capital expenditures(f) as a percentage of revenue (%) 3.7 % 5.7 % 4.6 % In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2023, Organic revenue growth excluding digital assets and cryptocurrencies at constant currency(b) was 17% and pro forma B2B, government and ISV channel revenue growth(g) was 16%. (a) Total volume does not represent revenue earned by the Company, but rather the total dollar value of transactions processed by merchants under contractual agreement with the Company. See ""Non-IFRS and Other Financial Measures"", including the definition of Nuvei pro forma revenue growth, on an aggregate basis and by channel. (b) Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Revenue at constant currency, Revenue growth at constant currency, Organic revenue excluding digital assets and cryptocurrencies at constant currency, Organic revenue growth excluding digital assets and cryptocurrencies at constant currency, Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures are non-IFRS measures and non-IFRS ratios. These measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and do not have standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. See ""Non-IFRS and Other Financial Measures"". (c) In its Global commerce channel, the Company supports mid-market to large enterprise customers across multiple verticals with domestic, regional, international, and cross-border payments; leveraging its deep industry expertise and utilizing its modern scalable modular technology stack that is purpose-built for businesses whose operations span multi-location, multi-country, and multi-currency. In its B2B, government and ISV channel, the Company embeds its global payment capabilities and proprietary software into enterprise resource planning (""ERP"") solutions and software platforms. The Company's SMB channel consists of its North American based traditional SMB customers that utilize Nuvei for card acceptance. (d) Other than with respect to revenue and capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue, the Company only provides guidance on a non-IFRS basis. The Company does not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking revenue at constant currency (non-IFRS), Organic revenue growth excluding digital assets and cryptocurrencies at constant currency (non-IFRS) to revenue, and Adjusted EBITDA (non-IFRS) to net income (loss) due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation such as predicting the future impact and timing of acquisitions and divestitures, foreign exchange rates and the volatility in digital assets. In periods where significant acquisitions or divestitures are not expected, the Company believes it might have a basis for forecasting the IFRS equivalent for certain costs, such as employee benefits, commissions and depreciation and amortization. However, because other deductions such as share-based payments, net finance costs, gain (loss) on financial instruments carried at fair market value and current and deferred income taxes used to calculate projected net income (loss) can vary significantly based on actual events, the Company is not able to forecast on an IFRS basis with reasonable certainty all deductions needed in order to provide an IFRS calculation of projected net income (loss). The amount of these deductions may be material and, therefore, could result in projected IFRS net income (loss) being materially less than projected Adjusted EBITDA (non-IFRS). These statements represent forward-looking information and may represent a financial outlook, and actual results may vary. See the risk and assumptions described under the headings ""Forward-looking information"" and ""Financial Outlook and Growth Targets Assumptions"" of this press release. (e) The Company defines ""Medium-term"" as between three and five years and ""long-term"" as five to seven years. (f) Capital expenditures means acquisition of property and equipment and acquisition of intangible assets. (g) Pro forma revenue growth by channel is calculated as (i) Nuvei's reported revenue for the relevant channel for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023 divided by (ii) Nuvei pro forma revenue for the relevant channel for the three months and year ended December 31, 2022. Nuvei pro forma revenue for the three months and year ended December 31, 2022 consists of (x) Nuvei's reported revenue for the relevant channel for the three months and year ended December 31, 2022, plus (y) Paya's reported revenue for the three months and year ended December 31, 2022, net of interchange fees in order to align with Nuvei's presentation of revenue calculated in accordance with the accounting policies used to prepare the revenue line item presented in the Company's financial statements under IFRS. See ""Supplemental Financial Measures"" for more detail.

For more information, visit www.nuvei.com Non-IFRS and Other Financial Measures Nuvei's Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB. The information presented in this press release includes non-IFRS financial measures, non-IFRS financial ratios and supplementary financial measures, namely Adjusted EBITDA, Paya Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Revenue at constant currency, Revenue growth at constant currency, Organic Revenue at constant currency, Organic revenue growth at constant currency, Organic revenue excluding digital assets and cryptocurrencies at constant currency, Organic revenue growth excluding digital assets and cryptocurrencies at constant currency, Nuvei pro forma revenue and Nuvei pro forma revenue growth, Combined trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA, Combined leverage ratio, Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per basic share, Adjusted net income per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures, Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures conversion, Total volume, Organic total organic volume at constant currency and eCommerce volume. These measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and do not have standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement IFRS measures by providing further understanding of our results of operations from our perspective. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of the Company's financial statements reported under IFRS. These measures are used to provide investors with additional insight of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in Nuvei's business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS measures. We also believe that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use these non-IFRS and other financial measures in the evaluation of issuers. We also use these measures to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, to prepare annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine components of management compensation. We believe these measures are important additional measures of our performance, primarily because they and similar measures are used widely among others in the payment technology industry as a means of evaluating a company's underlying operating performance. The information in this press release also includes a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, namely Paya Adjusted EBITDA, for periods prior to Nuvei's acquisition of Paya on February 22, 2023. This measure is not a recognized measure under U.S. GAAP and does not have standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, including Nuvei's. Rather, this measure is provided as additional information to complement U.S. GAAP measures by providing further understanding of Paya's results of operations. Prior to its acquisition by Nuvei, Paya's financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""U.S. GAAP""), and Paya Adjusted EBITDA has been derived from Paya's annual or interim financial statements for the period prior to the acquisition. IFRS differs in certain material respects from U.S. GAAP. Paya adjusted EBITDA presented in this press release has not been adjusted to give effect to the differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS or to accounting policies that comply with IFRS and as applied by Nuvei, nor has such financial information been conformed from accounting principles under U.S. GAAP to IFRS as issued by the IASB, and thus may not be directly comparable to Nuvei's presentation of Adjusted EBITDA. However, we have assessed the differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS and have determined the impact to be immaterial on the combined financial metrics presented in this press release, such that no adjustments would be necessary. Paya Adjusted EBITDA is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net income, income before income taxes, or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-IFRS Financial Measures Revenue at constant currency: Revenue at constant currency means revenue, as reported in accordance with IFRS, adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. This measure helps provide insight on comparable revenue growth by removing the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates year-over-year. Foreign currency exchange impact in the current period is calculated using prior period quarterly average exchange rates applied to the current period foreign currency amounts. Organic revenue at constant currency: Organic revenue at constant currency means revenue, as reported in accordance with IFRS, adjusted to exclude the revenue attributable to acquired businesses for a period of 12 months following their acquisition and excluding revenue attributable to divested businesses, adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Foreign currency exchange impact in the current period is calculated using prior period quarterly average exchange rates applied to the current period foreign currency amounts. This measure helps provide insight on organic and acquisition-related growth and presents useful information about comparable revenue growth. Organic revenue excluding digital assets and cryptocurrencies at constant currency: Organic revenue excluding digital assets and cryptocurrencies at constant currency means revenue excluding the revenue attributable to acquired businesses for a period of 12 months following their acquisition and excluding revenue attributable to divested businesses and digital assets and cryptocurrencies, and adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. This measure helps provide insight on comparable revenue growth by removing the effect of volatility in digital assets and cryptocurrencies and changes in foreign currency exchange rates year-over-year. Foreign currency exchange impact in the current period is calculated using prior period quarterly average exchange rates applied to the current period foreign currency amounts. The revenue attributable to digital assets and cryptocurrencies is calculated in accordance with the accounting policies used to prepare the revenue line item presented in the Company's financial statements under IFRS. Adjusted EBITDA: We use Adjusted EBITDA as a means to evaluate operating performance, by eliminating the impact of non-operational or non-cash items. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before finance costs (recovery), finance income, depreciation and amortization, income tax expense, acquisition, integration and severance costs, share-based payments and related payroll taxes, loss (gain) on foreign currency exchange, and legal settlement and other. Paya Adjusted EBITDA: Paya Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest and other expense, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or EBITDA and further adjustments to EBITDA to exclude certain non-cash items and other non-recurring items that Paya believes are not indicative of ongoing operations. Prior to its acquisition by Nuvei, Paya was disclosing Paya Adjusted EBITDA because this non-U.S. GAAP measure was a key measure used by it to evaluate its business, measure its operating performance and make strategic decisions. Nuvei is disclosing Paya Adjusted EBITDA in order to show Combined trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA and Combined leverage ratio. Combined trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA: Combined trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA represents the summation for the trailing twelve months of Nuvei's Adjusted EBITDA with Paya's Adjusted EBITDA for the period prior to the acquisition. Prior to its acquisition by Nuvei, Paya's financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and Paya Adjusted EBITDA has been derived from Paya's annual or interim financial statements for periods prior to the acquisition. IFRS differs in certain material respects from U.S. GAAP. Paya Adjusted EBITDA presented in this press release has not been adjusted to give effect to the differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS or to accounting policies that comply with IFRS and as applied by Nuvei, nor has such financial information been conformed from accounting principles under U.S. GAAP to IFRS as issued by the IASB, and thus may not be directly comparable to Nuvei's presentation of Adjusted EBITDA. The presentation of financial information on a combined basis does not comply with IFRS. The combined financial information included in this press release is unaudited and does not purport to be indicative of the Company's results of operations and financial condition had Nuvei and Paya operated as a combined entity during the periods presented, and should not be considered as a prediction of the financial information that will result from the operations of the Company on a consolidated basis following the acquisition. We use Combined trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it provides insight into the operations of the combined company for the periods presented. Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures: We use Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures (which we define as acquisition of intangible assets and property and equipment) as a supplementary indicator of our operating performance. Adjusted net income: We use Adjusted net income as an indicator of business performance and profitability with our current tax and capital structure. Adjusted net income is defined as net income (loss) before acquisition, integration and severance costs, share-based payments and related payroll taxes, loss (gain) on foreign currency exchange, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and the related income tax expense or recovery for these items. Adjusted net income also excludes change in redemption value of liability-classified common and preferred shares, change in fair value of share repurchase liability and accelerated amortization of deferred financing fees and legal settlement and other. Non-IFRS Financial Ratios Revenue growth at constant currency: Revenue growth at constant currency means the year-over-year change in Revenue at constant currency divided by reported revenue in the prior period. We use Revenue growth at constant currency to provide better comparability of revenue trends year-over-year, without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Organic revenue growth at constant currency: Organic revenue growth at constant currency means the year-over-year change in Organic revenue at constant currency divided by comparable Organic revenue in the prior period. We use Organic revenue growth at constant currency to provide better comparability of revenue trends year-over-year, without the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and fluctuations in foreign currency exchanges rates. Organic revenue growth excluding digital assets and cryptocurrencies at constant currency: Organic revenue growth excluding digital assets and cryptocurrencies at constant currency means the year-over-year change in Organic revenue excluding digital assets and cryptocurrencies at constant currency divided by comparable Organic revenue excluding digital assets and cryptocurrencies in the prior period. We use Organic revenue growth excluding digital assets and cryptocurrencies at constant currency to provide better comparability of revenue trends year-over-year, without the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, volatility in digital assets and cryptocurrencies and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Adjusted EBITDA margin: Adjusted EBITDA margin means Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures conversion: Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures conversion means Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures divided by Adjusted EBITDA. We use Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures conversion to measure our capacity to convert Adjusted EBITDA into Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures. Combined leverage ratio: Combined leverage ratio means net debt divided by Combined trailing twelve months adjusted EBITDA. Net debt represents the carrying amount of Nuvei's Total credit facilities excluding unamortized transaction costs less Cash and cash equivalents. We use Combined leverage ratio as an additional measure to monitor our financial leverage. Adjusted net income per basic share and per diluted share: We use Adjusted net income per basic share and per diluted share as an indicator of performance and profitability of our business on a per share basis. Adjusted net income per basic share and per diluted share means Adjusted net income less net income attributable to non-controlling interest divided by the basic and diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The number of share-based awards used in the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding in the Adjusted net income per diluted share calculation is determined using the treasury stock method as permitted under IFRS. Supplementary Financial Measures We monitor the following key performance indicators to help us evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions. Our key performance indicators may be calculated in a manner that differs from similar key performance indicators used by other companies. Total volume: We believe Total volume is an indicator of performance of our business. Total volume and similar measures are used widely among others in the payments industry as a means of evaluating a company's performance. We define Total volume as the total dollar value of transactions processed in the period by customers under contractual agreement with us. Total volume does not represent revenue earned by us. Total volume includes acquiring volume, where we are in the flow of funds in the settlement transaction cycle, gateway/technology volume, where we provide our gateway/technology services but are not in the flow of funds in the settlement transaction cycle, as well as the total dollar value of transactions processed relating to APMs and payouts. Since our revenue is primarily sales volume and transaction-based, generated from merchants' daily sales and through various fees for value-added services provided to our customers, fluctuations in Total volume will generally impact our revenue. Organic total volume at constant currency: Organic total volume at constant currency is used as an indicator of performance of our business on a more comparable basis. This measure helps provide insight on organic and acquisition-related growth and presents useful information about comparable Total volume growth. This measure also helps provide better comparability of business trends year-over-year, without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Organic total volume at constant currency means Total volume excluding Total volume attributable to acquired businesses for a period of 12 months following their acquisition and excluding Total volume attributable to divested businesses, adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Foreign currency exchange impact in the current period is calculated using prior period quarterly average exchange rates applied to the current period foreign currency amounts. Nuvei pro forma revenue: Nuvei pro forma revenue represents Nuvei's reported revenue after giving effect to the acquisition of Paya as though such acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the period presented. Nuvei pro forma revenue is presented both on an aggregated basis and by channel. In order to align with the Company's presentation of revenue calculated in accordance with the accounting policies used to prepare the revenue line item presented in the Company's financial statement under IFRS, Paya's revenue contribution amounts are presented net of interchange fees, which was not the case for a small portion of fees prior to the acquisition of Paya by the Company. This presentation is consistent with the pro forma disclosure required under IFRS in Nuvei's Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. This measure helps provide insight on the combined revenue of the Nuvei and Paya businesses. Nuvei pro forma revenue growth: Nuvei pro forma revenue growth represents Nuvei reported revenue divided by Nuvei pro forma revenue in the comparative year. This ratio is presented both on an aggregated basis and by channel. This ratio helps provide a better understanding of the additional contribution of the Paya business on Nuvei's year-over-year revenue growth. Nuvei pro forma revenue is used as a component of this ratio only until the completion of a full financial year following the acquisition of Paya.

The company is suspended from trading on the TSX Venture Exchange and issued a cease trade order due to failure to file financial statements. The company initiates NOI Proceedings due to the inability to repay convertible debentures, resulting in the cessation of operations for Future of Cheese. 03/05/2024 - 05:00 PM TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ORAGIN Foods Inc. (“ORAGIN” or the “Company”) (TSXV: OG) (OTC: OGGFF) (FRA: 9CW) is providing the following corporate update. Formation and Efforts of Special Committee and Director Resignations Prior to the respective resignations of the independent directors (the “Independent Directors”) and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company in November 2022, the Independent Directors had formed a special committee (the “Special Committee”) to initiate a process to explore, review and evaluate a broad range of strategic options with an aim to repay the holders (the “Holders”) of convertible debentures issued on October 25, 2019 (the “Debentures”), in the aggregate principal amount of CAD $3,000,000, which the Company was unable to repay by maturity on October 25, 2022 (the “Maturity Date”). Prior to and following the Maturity Date, initially through management and then through the efforts of the Special Committee since its formation, the Company engaged in discussions with the Holders with the objective of coming to mutually beneficial terms with regard to the repayment of the Debentures. However, despite these efforts, the Company was unable to agree with the Holders on terms that were mutually agreeable and, in the Company’s view, in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Concurrently, the Company’s Directors & Officers Indemnity Insurance (the ""D&O Insurance”), which was scheduled for renewal, could only be renewed with certain limitations related to and as a result of the Notices and related circumstances. As a result of the inability of the Company to continue to maintain full coverage for its board of directors and management, the Independent Directors tendered their resignations, despite continued efforts to reach a resolution with the Holders up until the last possible date. Status of Listing on TSX Venture Exchange and NEX and Cease Trade Order As the policies of the TSXV Venture Exchange (the “Exchange”) require that there be a minimum three (3) directors on the board of directors of a reporting issuer listed on the Exchange, the Exchange suspended the Company’s listing for failure to comply with the policies of the Exchange, and thereafter in June 2023, the Company announced a move to the NEX Board (the “NEX”), the subsidiary board of the Exchange, under the symbol OG.H, for not meeting Exchange requirements. The Company’s shares continue to be listed on the NEX and to be suspended from trading. As anticipated thereafter, the Company was issued a cease trade order (the “CTO”) due to its failure to file on or before December 30, 2022 its interim financial statements, corresponding management’s discussion and analysis, and CEO and CFO certificates (the “Interim Filings”), for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022. The Interim Filings have not been filed and no financial statements nor corresponding management’s discussion and analysis have since been filed as the Company is unable to do so without a Chief Financial Officer and properly constituted board of directors. The CTO prohibits all trading in the Company’s shares until all filing requirements are completed. The CTO will remain in effect until the Interim Filings have been filed. A copy of the CTO is posted on the OSC’s website and readers may refer to the Company’s news release dated January 20, 2023 for further details regarding the CTO. NOI Proceeding After careful consideration of all available alternatives and following thorough consultations with legal and financial advisors, Organic Garage and the Lease Subsidiaries determined that it is in the best interests of its creditors and other stakeholders to commence NOI Proceedings. The decision to initiate the NOI Proceedings was made in view of the effect of the ongoing dispute with the holders (the “Holders”) of convertible debentures issued on October 25, 2019 (the “Debentures”), in the aggregate principal amount of CAD $3,000,000, which the Company was unable to repay by maturity on October 25, 2022 (the “Maturity Date”). On October 28th, 2022, the Company had announced that it had received Notices of Default (the “Notices”) from the Holders, as previously disclosed. In an effort to repay the Holders, the Company made multiple attempts to secure financing and/or a transaction that would repay the Holders in whole or in part. Both prior to and following the Maturity Date until the recent decision to initiate the NOI Proceedings was made, continual efforts were made to reach a resolution with the Holders, which have been unsuccessful. Oragin announces today that its wholly-owned operating subsidiaries, Organic Garage (Canada) Ltd. (“Organic Garage”), 2412383 Ontario Inc., 2347018 Ontario Inc., 2507158 Ontario Inc., 2581751 Ontario Inc. (together, the “Lease Subsidiaries” and together with Organic Garage, the “Subsidiaries”) initiated proceedings (“NOI Proceedings”) under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act R.S.C., 1985, c. B-3 (“BIA”) by filing a Notice of Intention to Make a Proposal under section 50.4(6) of the BIA. KPMG Inc. was appointed as the proposal trustee in the NOI Proceedings. The Company continues to consider its strategic options and alternatives. Future Of Cheese Given the NOI Proceedings, the Future of Cheese has ceased operations as the Company is no longer able to fund this subsidiary’s operations. Given the complex nature of the products Future of Cheese produces, it was unable to find a suitable co-packer to help scale the brand. While the Company received a positive response from the product in the market from customers and the Future of Cheese had gained a foothold in many retailers spanning both conventional and health food, it was not financially viable for the Company to continue with the brand.

(NYSE: WTI) reported operational and financial results for Q4 and full year 2023, acquisitions totaling $99.4 million, strong production of 34.9 MBoe/d, net income of $15.6 million for 2023, Adjusted EBITDA of $183.2 million, and a dividend of $0.01 per share for Q1 2024. Positive Completed two accretive acquisitions of producing properties totaling $99.4 million Generated strong production of 34.9 MBoe/d in 2023 Reported net income of $15.6 million for full year 2023 Delivered Adjusted EBITDA of $183.2 million in 2023 Declared a dividend of $0.01 per share for Q1 2024 Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results of W&T Offshore, Inc. show a mixed picture, with the company achieving a net income of $15.6 million for the full year 2023, which is a substantial decline from the previous year's net income of $231.1 million. This indicates a challenging environment, potentially due to lower commodity prices and decreased oil production, which are common sector-wide issues. The company's strategy of funding acquisitions with cash on hand rather than debt is noteworthy, as it suggests a conservative financial approach aimed at maintaining a low leverage profile, evidenced by a Net Debt to TTM Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.2 times.W&T's focus on free cash flow generation has resulted in the 24th consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow, a strong indicator of operational efficiency and financial discipline. However, investors should be aware that Adjusted Net Loss for the year was $21.7 million, contrasting with the reported net income. This discrepancy is mainly due to the exclusion of unrealized gains on derivative contracts and other non-recurring costs, which may not reflect the company's ongoing operational performance.Furthermore, the announcement of a consistent quarterly dividend policy might be viewed positively by investors seeking regular income, although the dividend amount of $0.01 per share may be considered nominal. The capital expenditure guidance for 2024 of $35 to $45 million suggests a continued focus on strategic investments while maintaining fiscal prudence. Market Research Analyst The operational highlights, such as the completion of two accretive acquisitions, underline W&T's strategic intent to grow through consolidation of assets in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). The acquisitions, which were made at approximately $4.75 per barrel of oil equivalent, are indicative of the company's ability to identify and secure value-accretive deals. The focus on properties with high working interest and net revenue interest suggests a strategy to optimize control over operations and revenue streams.From a market perspective, W&T's approach to enhance production and reserves through operational excellence and acquisitions is significant. The company's emphasis on maintaining a balance between liquids and natural gas in its production mix reflects a response to market demand and price dynamics. The GOM assets' proximity to W&T's existing operations is expected to deliver synergies, potentially reducing operational costs and enhancing profitability.However, the downward revisions in proved reserves due to SEC pricing and the increase in Lease Operating Expense (LOE) on a per Boe basis year-over-year could be areas of concern for investors. These factors might impact the company's cost efficiency and margin sustainability in the long-term. Energy Sector Analyst The energy sector is characterized by volatility in commodity prices, which can significantly impact the financial performance of companies like W&T Offshore. The reported decrease in realized prices for oil, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in the previous year, reflects broader market trends and emphasizes the importance of cost management and operational efficiency in this sector.W&T's strategic focus on the Gulf of Mexico is notable, as the region is known for its established infrastructure and relatively low-cost production compared to deepwater and unconventional onshore operations. The company's acquisition strategy in the GOM, particularly targeting shallow water fields, aligns with industry trends of pursuing lower-risk assets with known geology.The potential exploration of a Drilling Joint Venture is a strategic move that could allow W&T to share operational risks and costs while leveraging its expertise in deepwater wells. This collaborative approach could enhance the company's ability to capitalize on high-impact opportunities in its portfolio without overextending its capital expenditure. 03/05/2024 - 04:58 PM HOUSTON, March 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- W&T Offshore, Inc. (NYSE: WTI) (“W&T” or the “Company”) today reported operational and financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023, including the Company’s year-end 2023 reserve report. Detailed guidance for the first quarter of 2024 and full year 2024 was also provided, and W&T announced its dividend for the first quarter of 2024. This press release includes non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted Net (Loss) Income, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Net Debt and PV-10 which are described and reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures below in the accompanying tables under “Non-GAAP Information.” Key highlights for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 and since year-end 2023 included: Completed two accretive acquisitions of producing properties for a total of $99.4 million, or approximately $4.75 per barrel of oil equivalent (“Boe”); Acquired six shallow water Gulf of Mexico (“GOM”) fields in January 2024 (“the Cox acquisition”), all of which are 100% working interest and located adjacent to existing W&T operations, for $72.0 million;Purchased working interests in eight shallow water GOM fields in September 2023 for $27.4 million;Both acquisitions were funded with cash on hand, which increases proved reserves, production and Free Cash Flow per share; Delivered strong production in full year 2023 of 34.9 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (“MBoe/d”) (51% liquids), or 12.7 million barrels of oil equivalent (“MMBoe”), at the midpoint of latest guidance; Production was 34.1 Mboe/d (49% liquids), or 3.1 MMBoe in the fourth quarter of 2023; Reported net income for full year 2023 of $15.6 million, or $0.11 per diluted share and fourth quarter 2023 net loss of $0.4 million or ($0.00) per diluted share; Adjusted Net Loss totaled $21.7 million, or ($0.15) per share for full year 2023 and $8.7 million, or ($0.06) per share for the fourth quarter 2023, which excludes the net unrealized gain on outstanding derivative contracts, non-ARO plugging and abandonment (“P&A”) costs and non-recurring costs related to the Company’s IT services transition; Generated solid Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter 2023 of $44.9 million and $183.2 million in full year 2023;Produced net cash from operating activities of $35.7 million and Free Cash Flow of $15.8 million in the fourth quarter 2023, marking the 24th consecutive quarter of positive Free Cash Flow; In full year 2023, generated net cash from operating activities of $115.3 million and $63.3 million of Free Cash Flow, further strengthening the balance sheet and allowing W&T to fund accretive acquisitions; Grew cash and cash equivalents to $173.3 million at December 31, 2023 from $149.0 million at September 30,2023;Reported Net Debt of $217.3 million as of December 31, 2023, compared with Net Debt of $232.1 million a year ago;Continued to maintain a low leverage profile with Net Debt to trailing twelve months (“TTM”) Adjusted EBITDA of 1.2 times;Adopted a quarterly cash dividend policy in November 2023 and paid initial dividend of $0.01 per common share on December 22, 2023; Declared first quarter 2024 dividend of $0.01 per share which will be payable on March 25, 2024 to stockholders of record on March 18, 2024; and Announced 2024 guidance including a capital spending budget of $35 to $45 million. Tracy W. Krohn, W&T’s Board Chair and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We continued to deliver solid results in 2023, while executing on our strategic vision focused on Free Cash Flow generation. We have reported 24 consecutive quarters of positive Free Cash Flow and generated Adjusted EBITDA of $183.2 million in 2023. In early 2023, we strengthened our balance sheet by issuing new 2026 Senior Second Lien Notes and repurchasing all of our outstanding 2023 Senior Second Lien Notes. These notes are trading at a premium of approximately 3% to par value as of February 29, 2024. Our strong balance sheet has allowed us to close on two accretive acquisitions utilizing a portion of our cash on hand, which we expect will meaningfully boost our production and reserve base. We believe these acquisitions will bolster our per share metrics, increase shareholder value and provide additional Free Cash Flow, all without using any debt or equity. We plan to continue to utilize our significant cash position and expertise in acquiring complementary GOM assets to enhance the scale of W&T. Acquisitions have been a key component of how we have grown reserves and production at W&T, and we remain well positioned to continue to enhance our portfolio through additional attractive opportunities.” Mr. Krohn continued, “Turning to our year-end reserve results, I would like to point out that the recent acquisition in January 2024, which added 18.7 MMBoe of proved reserves, is not reflected in these numbers. While the decline in SEC pricing led to downward revisions in proved reserves, we continue to see positive well performance resulting in positive technical revisions. This clearly demonstrates our ability to enhance production and reserves through operational excellence. In 2023, we had 4.0 MMBoe of positive performance revisions and an increase of 2.6 MMBoe related to the acquisition we closed in September. We have built a sustainable group of high performing GOM assets with good production diversity that is almost evenly distributed between liquids and natural gas. We expect that our assets and operational excellence will continue to provide meaningful cash flow to our shareholders for many years.” Mr. Krohn concluded, “Looking at 2024 and beyond, we are integrating our recent acquisitions and believe that we can materially increase production and reduce costs at the 14 additional fields that we now operate. We are deferring some of our drilling plans while we complete the integration of those assets and are exploring a Drilling Joint Venture, similar to the Monza Energy LLC Joint Venture, which closed in 2018. The new drilling Joint Venture may include certain of the Company’s 100% owned and operated deepwater wells, including the Holy Grail well. We remain very well positioned to take advantage of potential acquisitions that become available and poised to continue delivering on our strategic vision. We have a successful track record of accretive growth through both acquisitions and drilling success. We remain committed to enhancing shareholder value and returning value to our shareholders through the quarterly dividend announced in November 2023. Our proven strategy focused on Free Cash Flow generation and operational excellence has proven to be sustainable over the past 40 years, and we are well-positioned to continue to successfully execute it in the future.” Production, Prices, and Revenue: Production for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 34.1 MBoe/d compared with 35.9 Mboe/d for the third quarter of 2023 and 38.6 MBoe/d for the corresponding period in 2022. The small decrease in production compared to the third quarter of 2023 was primarily driven by natural decline and some unplanned downtime, which was partially offset by production optimization and workovers. Fourth quarter 2023 production was comprised of 13.3 MBbl/d of oil (39%), 3.6 MBbl/d of natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) (10%), and 103.6 million cubic feet per day (“MMcf/d”) of natural gas (51%). W&T’s average realized price per Boe before realized derivative settlements was $41.55 per Boe in the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease of 2% from $42.48 per Boe in the third quarter of 2023 and a decrease of 21% from $52.82 per Boe in the fourth quarter of 2022. Fourth quarter 2023 crude oil, NGL, and natural gas prices before realized derivative settlements were $77.17 per barrel, $20.82 per barrel, and $3.08 per Mcf, respectively. Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $132.3 million, which was 7% lower than third quarter 2023 revenue of $142.4 million due to lower production volumes coupled with slightly lower realized prices. Fourth quarter 2023 revenue was lower than $189.7 million of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022 due to significantly lower realized prices and lower production volumes. Lease Operating Expense: Lease operating expense (“LOE”), which includes base lease operating expenses, insurance premiums, workovers and facilities maintenance, was $64.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, which was at the midpoint of the previously provided guidance range. LOE for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 5% higher compared to $61.8 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher workover and base lease operating expenses related to a full quarter of the September acquisition, offset by lower facility expenses, and lower than the $69.0 million for the corresponding period in 2022. On a component basis for the fourth quarter of 2023, base LOE and insurance premiums were $52.4 million, workovers were $6.7 million, and facilities maintenance and other expenses were $5.5 million. On a unit of production basis, LOE was $20.61 per Boe in the fourth quarter of 2023. This compares to $18.72 per Boe for the third quarter of 2023 and $19.42 per Boe for the fourth quarter of 2022. Gathering, Transportation Costs, and Production Taxes: Gathering, transportation costs and production taxes totaled $6.6 million ($2.11 per Boe) in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $6.7 million ($2.03 per Boe) in the third quarter of 2023 and $8.5 million ($2.39 per Boe) in the fourth quarter of 2022. Gathering, transportation costs and production taxes decreased by $1.9 million year-over-year due to decreases in realized pricing and production volumes. Depreciation, Depletion, Amortization and Accretion (“DD&A”): DD&A, including accretion expense related to asset retirement obligations (“ARO”), was $13.08 per Boe in the fourth quarter of 2023. This compares to $11.09 per Boe and $9.64 per Boe for the third quarter of 2023 and the fourth quarter of 2022, respectively. General & Administrative Expenses (“G&A”): G&A was $18.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, which decreased from $20.0 million in the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to lower salary and benefits costs and lower legal expenses. G&A decreased by $3.7 million year-over-year from $22.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 likewise due primarily to lower salary and benefits costs and lower legal expenses. On a unit of production basis, G&A was $5.82 per Boe in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $6.05 per Boe in the third quarter of 2023 and $6.18 per Boe in the corresponding period of 2022. G&A in the fourth quarter of 2023 included $3.1 million of non-cash compensation expense compared with $3.3 million in the third quarter of 2023 and $2.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Derivative (Gain) Loss: In the fourth quarter of 2023, W&T recorded a net gain of $13.2 million related to commodity derivative contracts comprised of a $14.8 million unrealized gain related to the increase in fair value of open contracts, offset by $1.6 million of realized losses. The Company recognized a net gain of $1.5 million in the third quarter of 2023 and a net gain of $24.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 related to commodity derivative activities. As of December 31, 2023, W&T has 65.9 MMcf/d hedged for the first quarter of 2024 for natural gas and no existing hedges for oil. A significant portion of W&T’s natural gas hedges, in the form of sold swaps and purchased calls and puts, were entered into in conjunction with the non-recourse Mobile Bay term loan (the “Term Loan”) entered into by borrowers owned by the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary Aquasition Energy LLC, with the terms of such hedges corresponding to the maturity of such Term Loan. A summary of the Company’s outstanding derivative positions is provided in the investor presentation posted on W&T’s website. Interest Expense: Net interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $9.7 million compared to $9.9 million in the third quarter of 2023 and $14.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The large decrease in interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with the fourth quarter of 2022 was due to the full redemption of the 9.75% Senior Second Lien Notes which occurred in February 2023, lower interest expense on the lower outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan and increased interest income. These decreases were partially offset by interest expense incurred on the 11.75% Senior Second Lien Notes issued in late January 2023. Other (Income) Expense, net: During 2021 and 2022, as a result of the declaration of bankruptcy by a third party that is the indirect successor in title to certain offshore interests that were previously divested by the Company, W&T recorded a contingent loss accrual related to anticipated ARO. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company reassessed the existing ARO, recording an additional $4.1 million. Income Tax: W&T recognized income tax expense of $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. This compares to the recognition of income tax expense of $4.8 million and $6.9 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Balance Sheet and Liquidity: As of December 31, 2023, W&T had available liquidity of $223.3 million comprised of $173.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $50.0 million of borrowing availability under W&T’s first priority secured revolving facility provided by Calculus Lending LLC (“Calculus”). At year-end, the Company had total debt of $390.6 million and Net Debt of $217.3 million. Of the Company’s total debt of $390.6 million, only $279.5 million is recourse to W&T. The remaining $111.1 million is held at W&T’s subsidiary, Aquasition Energy LLC, and is non-recourse to W&T. As of December 31, 2023, Net Debt to TTM Adjusted EBITDA was 1.2x. Capital Expenditures: Capital expenditures (excluding acquisitions and changes in working capital associated with investing activities) in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $10.3 million, and asset retirement costs totaled $9.1 million. For the full year 2023, capital expenditures (excluding acquisitions and changes in working capital associated with investing activities) totaled $41.3 million, which was below the lower end of W&T’s updated 2023 capital expenditure guidance of $50 million to $70 million. Plugging and abandonment costs for full year 2023 were $34 million, which were within the Company’s latest guidance for 2023 of $25 million to $35 million. Accretive Acquisitions of Producing Properties in the GOM In January 2024, W&T was the successful bidder for six fields in the Gulf of Mexico, including Eugene Island 064, Main Pass 061, Mobile 904, Mobile 916, South Pass 049 and West Delta 073, all of which include a 100% working interest and an average 82% net revenue interest. They are located in water depths ranging between approximately 15 and 400 feet. Their proximity to W&T’s areas of existing operations provide the ability for W&T to capture synergies. The final purchase price for the assets was $72.0 million, excluding certain closing costs, which was funded from the Company’s cash on hand. Key highlights of the transaction are as follows: Adds significant proved reserves of 18.7 MMBoe1 (62% liquids) with a present value discounted at 10% (“PV-10”) value of $250.4 million based on an independent engineering report prepared by Netherland Sewell and Associates (“NSAI”);Based on the cash consideration paid of $72 million, this equates to a price of $3.85 per Boe of proved reserves;As it has done after prior acquisitions, W&T is assessing, inspecting and optimizing the newly acquired fields, which requires shutting in some of the fields in the near term;Field logistics are being examined to see if more cost-effective tie-ins and throughput can be done with existing W&T facilities adjacent to the newly acquired fields; andThe Company believes that it will increase production on these properties through workovers, recompletions and facility upgrades. In September 2023, the Company announced that it had completed the acquisition of working interests in eight shallow water oil and gas producing assets in the central and eastern shelf region of the GOM from an undisclosed private seller. The assets were acquired for a gross consideration of $32.0 million, and after normal and customary post-effective date adjustments (including net operating cash flow attributable to the properties from the effective date of June 1, 2023 to the closing date), cash consideration of $27.4 million was paid to the sellers. W&T used its cash on hand to pay the net purchase price. This acquisition has high average working interest of approximately 72% and provides additional producing properties located within W&T’s existing area of operations in water depths ranging from 25 to 265 feet. ____________________1 Reserves as of January 1, 2024 using year-end 2023 SEC pricing. Full Year-End 2023 Financial Review W&T reported net income for the full year 2023 of $15.6 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, and Adjusted Net Loss of $21.7 million, or ($0.15) per diluted share. For the full year 2022, the Company reported net income of $231.1 million, or $1.59 per diluted share, and Adjusted Net Income of $284.8 million, or $1.96 per diluted share. W&T generated Adjusted EBITDA of $183.2 million for the full year 2023 compared to $563.7 million in 2022. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by lower commodity prices and decreased oil production. Revenues totaled $532.7 million for 2023 compared with $921.0 million in 2022. Net Cash provided by operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 was $115.3 million compared with $339.5 million for the same period in 2022. Free Cash Flow totaled $63.3 million in 2023 compared with $376.4 million in 2022. Production for 2023 averaged 34.9 MBoe/d for a total of 12.7 MMBoe, comprised of 5.1 MMBbl of oil, 1.4 MMBbl of NGLs and 37.6 Bcf of natural gas. Full year 2022 production averaged 40.1 MBoe/d or 14.6 MMBoe in total and was comprised of 5.6 MMBbl of oil, 1.6 MMBbl of NGLs and 44.8 Bcf of natural gas. For the full year 2023, W&T’s average realized sales price per barrel of crude oil was $75.52, $22.93 per barrel of NGLs, and $2.93 per Mcf of natural gas. The equivalent sales price for 2023 was $41.16 per Boe, which was 33% lower than the equivalent price of $61.89 per Boe realized in 2022. For 2022, the Company’s realized crude oil sales price was $93.59 per barrel, NGL sales price was $36.66 per barrel, and natural gas price was $7.23 per Mcf. For the full year 2023, LOE was $257.7 million compared to $224.4 million in 2022. The increase in LOE in 2023 reflects increased workover and facility investments at Mobile Bay, the impact of the acquisition of additional properties in September 2023, and inflationary pressures. Gathering, transportation, and production taxes totaled $26.3 million in 2023, a decrease from the $35.1 million in 2022. Lower realized prices for natural gas and NGLs drove severance tax expense down year-over-year. For the full year 2023, G&A was $75.5 million, which was a minor increase over the $73.7 million reported in 2022. The increase year-over-year is primarily due to increased salary and benefits costs that were somewhat offset by lower legal expenses. On a per unit basis, G&A per Boe was $5.93 in 2023, up from $5.04 per Boe in 2022. G&A increased on a per Boe basis primarily due to lower production. OPERATIONS UPDATE Well Recompletions and Workovers During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company performed four workovers and three recompletions that positively impacted production for the quarter. W&T plans to continue performing these low cost, short payout operations that impact both production and revenue. Year-End 2023 Proved Reserves The Company’s year-end 2023 SEC proved reserves were 123.0 MMBoe, compared with 165.3 MMBoe at year-end 2022. The W&T year-end 2023 proved reserves do not include the 18.7 MMBoe of proved reserves acquired in early January 2024 for $72 million. In 2023, W&T recorded positive performance revisions of 4.0 MMBoe, and acquisitions of reserves of 2.6 MMBoe, which were more than offset by 36.2 MMBoe of negative price revisions and by 12.7 MMBoe of production for the year. During 2023, W&T continued to focus on reducing Net Debt and identifying and executing attractive acquisitions. Successful workovers, operational excellence and acquisitions allowed W&T to replace 52% of production with new reserves. The SEC twelve-month first day of the month average spot prices used in the preparation of the report for year-end 2023 were $78.21 per barrel of oil and $2.64 per MMBtu of natural gas. Comparable prices used for the prior year report were $94.14 per barrel of oil and $6.36 per MMBtu of natural gas. The PV-10 of W&T’s proved reserves at year-end 2023 declined to $1.1 billion from $3.1 billion at year-end 2022, driven primarily by lower pricing. Approximately 41% of year-end 2023 proved reserves were liquids (30% crude oil and 11% NGLs) and 59% natural gas. The reserves were classified as 67% proved developed producing, 17% proved developed non-producing, and 16% proved undeveloped. W&T’s reserve life ratio at year-end 2023, based on year-end 2023 proved reserves and 2023 production, was 9.7 years.

In accordance with guidelines established by the SEC, estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2023 were determined to be economically producible under existing economic conditions, which requires the use of the 12-month average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the year ended December 31, 2023. The WTI spot price and the Henry Hub spot price were utilized as the reference prices and after adjusting for quality, transportation, fees, energy content, and regional price differentials, the average realized prices were $74.79 per barrel for oil, $24.08 per barrel for NGLs, and $2.74 per Mcf for natural gas. In determining the estimated realized price for NGLs, a ratio was computed for each field of the NGLs realized price compared to the crude oil realized price. This ratio was then applied to the crude price using SEC guidance. Such prices were held constant throughout the estimated lives of the reserves. Future estimated production and development costs are based on year-end costs with no escalations. The standardized measure of future net cash flows was $683.2 million at December 31, 2023, which is calculated as the PV-10 of $1,080.9 million less discounted cash outflows of $246.5 million associated with asset retirement obligations and $151.0 million associated with income taxes. At December 31, 2022, the standardized measure was $2,263.0 million, which is calculated as the PV-10 of $3,128.6 million less discounted cash outflows of $271.5 million associated with asset retirement obligations and $594.1 million associated with income taxes. Pro-forma Impact of Cox Acquisition As noted above, the proved reserves added from the acquisition of six fields from Cox in January 2024 were not included in W&T’s year-end 2023 proved reserves. Below is the pro-forma impact of adding those reserves as of December 31, 2023, which were calculated by NSAI using the same pricing assumptions as W&T’s year-end 2023 reserves: OilNGLNatural GasEquivalentsPV-101 MMBblMMBblBcfMMBoe$MMBalance, December 31, 202337.013.7434.0123.0$1,080.9Proved reserves from Cox acquisition11.40.242.418.7$250.4Pro forma reserve balance, December 31, 2023 including Cox acquisition48.413.9476.4141.7$1,331.3 Cash Dividend Policy In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend policy with the initial dividend of $0.01 per common share payable on December 22, 2023 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 28, 2023. On March 5, 2024 the Board declared its first quarter dividend of $0.01 per share which will be payable on March 25, 2024 to stockholders of record on March 18, 2024. First Quarter and Full Year 2024 Production and Expense Guidance Looking ahead to 2024, Tracy Krohn commented, “In the first quarter of 2024, we completed an accretive acquisition of six GOM fields as a result of being the high bidder in a bankruptcy proceeding. We are actively assessing the capabilities of these fields, inspecting their needs and current condition and plan to optimize production with capital-efficient, low-cost workovers, recompletions and facility upgrades during 2024. This will take some time and effort by our operations personnel and will result in us shutting in some of the fields in the near term. With that said, our highly successful track record of integrating acquisitions while increasing production and value gives me the confidence that we will be able to accomplish this with the recent acquisitions. Taking into consideration the integration of the new assets and associated ramp-up of production, we believe that we will be able to show meaningful growth in production by year-end 2024. In addition, given our recent acquisitions and the current acquisition opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico, we have decided to defer the drilling of our Holy Grail well until 2025, which will reduce our drilling and capital investment plans for 2024 to between $35 million and $45 million. We are focused on operational excellence, integrating our new assets and building cash in 2024 which will allow us to act quickly should we see additional accretive acquisition opportunities arise. We have built W&T with a proven acquisition strategy and over the past seven months we have closed on two producing property acquisitions that added over 20 MMBoe of proved reserves at a purchase price of approximately $4.75 per Boe, which we believe provides significant upside potential. We seek to continue to add value for our shareholders through organic growth and acquisitions to continue to generate significant Free Cash Flow.” The guidance for the first quarter and full year 2024 in the table below represents the Company’s current expectations.

Included in this range are planned expenditures related to integrations as well as ongoing costs related to the acquisitions for facilities, leasehold, seismic, and recompletions. Plugging and abandonment expenditures are expected to be in the range of $30 million to $40 million. The Company spent approximately $34 million on these costs in 2023.

AND SUBSIDIARIESNon-GAAP Information Certain financial information included in W&T’s financial results are not measures of financial performance recognized by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are “Net Debt”, “Adjusted Net (Loss) Income”, “Adjusted EBITDA,” “Free Cash Flow” and “PV-10” or are derivable from a combination of these measures. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its analysis of performance. These disclosures may not be viewed as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures which may be reported by other companies. Prior period amounts have been conformed to the methodology and presentation of the current period. We calculate Net Debt as total debt (current and long-term portions), less cash and cash equivalents. Management uses Net Debt to evaluate the Company’s financial position, including its ability to service its debt obligations. Reconciliation of Net (Loss) Income to Adjusted Net (Loss) Income Adjusted Net (Loss) Income adjusts for certain items that the Company believes affect comparability of operating results, including items that are generally non-recurring in nature or whose timing and/or amount cannot be reasonably estimated. These items include unrealized commodity derivative (gain) loss net of derivative premiums, allowance for credit losses, write-off of debt issuance costs, non-recurring IT-transition costs, non-ARO plugging and abandonment costs, and other which are then tax effected using the Federal Statutory Rate.

W&T OFFSHORE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNon-GAAP Information Adjusted EBITDA/ Free Cash Flow Reconciliations The Company also presents the non-GAAP financial measures Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization, ARO accretion, excluding the unrealized commodity derivative (gain) loss net of derivative premiums, allowance for credit losses, non-cash incentive compensation, non-recurring IT-transition costs, non-ARO plugging and abandonment costs, and other. Company management believes this presentation is relevant and useful because it helps investors understand W&T’s operating performance and makes it easier to compare its results with those of other companies that have different financing, capital and tax structures. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for net income, as an indication of operating performance or cash flows from operating activities or as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA, as W&T calculates it, may not be comparable to Adjusted EBITDA measures reported by other companies. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not represent funds available for discretionary use. The Company defines Free Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA (defined above), less capital expenditures, plugging and abandonment costs and net interest expense (all on an accrual basis). For this purpose, the Company’s definition of capital expenditures includes costs incurred related to oil and natural gas properties (such as drilling and infrastructure costs and the lease maintenance costs) and equipment, furniture and fixtures, but excludes acquisition costs of oil and gas properties from third parties that are not included in the Company’s capital expenditures guidance provided to investors. Company management believes that Free Cash Flow is an important financial performance measure for use in evaluating the performance and efficiency of its current operating activities after the impact of accrued capital expenditures, plugging and abandonment costs and net interest expense and without being impacted by items such as changes associated with working capital, which can vary substantially from one period to another. There is no commonly accepted definition of Free Cash Flow within the industry. Accordingly, Free Cash Flow, as defined and calculated by the Company, may not be comparable to Free Cash Flow or other similarly named non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. While the Company includes net interest expense in the calculation of Free Cash Flow, other mandatory debt service requirements of future payments of principal at maturity (if such debt is not refinanced) are excluded from the calculation of Free Cash Flow. These and other non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from Free Cash Flow would reduce cash available for other uses.

AND SUBSIDIARIESNon-GAAP Information Reconciliation of PV-10 to Standardized Measure The Company also discloses PV-10, which is not a financial measure defined under GAAP. The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for proved reserves calculated using SEC pricing. Company management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of PV-10 is relevant and useful for evaluating the relative monetary significance of oil and natural gas properties. PV-10 is also used internally when assessing the potential return on investment related to oil and natural gas properties and in evaluating acquisition opportunities. Company management believes that the use of PV-10 is valuable because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid. Additionally, Company management believes that the presentation of PV-10 provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors in evaluating oil and natural gas companies. PV-10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor is it intended to represent the current market value of the Company’s estimated oil and natural gas reserves. PV-10 should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as defined under GAAP. Investors should not assume that PV-10 of the Company’s proved oil and natural gas reserves represents a current market value of the Company’s estimated oil and natural gas reserves. The following table presents a reconciliation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to the Company’s estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves, a GAAP measure, to PV-10, as defined by the Company.

The company's Extended Warranty segment saw a revenue decrease due to the sale of PWSC but KSX revenue surged by 82% driven by acquisitions. Net income rose to $24 million, and adjusted EBITDA stood at $9.1 million. Recent highlights include key appointments and a positive outlook for growth. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported 11% increase in consolidated revenue for Kingsway Financial Services Inc. reflects a positive trajectory in the company's growth, particularly within its Kingsway Search Xcelerator (KSX) business. The surge in KSX revenue by 82% is a testament to the successful integration of the newly acquired companies, CSuite and SNS, as well as SPI and DDI. These acquisitions seem to have effectively diversified the company's revenue streams and enhanced its market position.However, the Extended Warranty segment's performance shows a decline in revenue, primarily due to the sale of PWSC and an increase in the average cost per claim. This indicates potential challenges in cost management and could signal a need for strategic adjustments in the company's operations or product offerings within this segment.The increase in net income by nearly 60% compared to the prior year is a strong indicator of overall financial health and operational efficiency. This is particularly notable when considering the adjusted EBITDA decreased slightly, suggesting that the company has been able to leverage its assets and manage expenses effectively outside of EBITDA considerations. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the growth in Kingsway's KSX segment is particularly relevant. The acquisitions have not only contributed to increased revenue but also expanded Kingsway's capabilities and market reach. The 50% increase in KSX's adjusted EBITDA indicates that these acquisitions are already generating operational synergies and efficiencies.However, the Extended Warranty segment's performance, with a decrease in adjusted EBITDA, suggests that this market may be facing greater competitive pressures or changes in consumer behavior. The significant increase in the average cost per claim could be reflective of broader industry trends, such as rising parts and labor costs, that may affect profitability if not managed effectively. Economist An economist might highlight the broader economic implications of Kingsway's financial results. The company's ability to grow revenue during a period that may be challenging economically indicates resilience and adaptability in its business model. The strategic divestiture of PWSC and the subsequent acquisitions signal a shift in focus towards sectors that the company believes will offer better growth prospects.Additionally, the run-rate adjusted EBITDA figures provide insight into the company's current operational performance, excluding one-time events and changes in ownership structure. This metric can be valuable for stakeholders to assess the company's ongoing profitability and potential for future growth. 03/05/2024 - 04:55 PM Management to Host Conference Call Today at 5 p.m. ETSave the Date: Kingsway to also Host Investor Day at the New York Stock Exchange on May 20, 2024CHICAGO, IL / ACCESSWIRE / March 5, 2024 / (NYSE:KFS) Kingsway Financial Services Inc.

We added two great new businesses to the platform this year and are excited about the progress we are making in building a wonderful acquisition engine for further growth.""The strength of KSX was tempered by softness in Extended Warranty where macro-economic conditions continued to impact the end markets for our warranty products. Importantly, our claims severity began to moderate towards the end of 2023, despite an overall increase in claims costs for the full year. We remain focused on disciplined management of our operating costs to mitigate against rising claims and we have been implementing certain pricing adjustments across all of our businesses to better align with current market conditions.""Our KSX platform remains central to our strategy for growing our cash flows and increasing shareholder returns. Our recent acquisitions of Systems Products International, Inc. (""SPI"") in September and Digital Diagnostics Imaging, Inc.

Management uses non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, together with other measures of performance under GAAP, to compare the relative performance of operations in planning, budgeting and reviewing the performance of its business. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA allows investors to make a more meaningful comparison between the Company's core business operating results over different periods of time. Management believes that non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations, provides useful information about the Company's business without regard to potential distortions. By eliminating potential differences in results of operations between periods caused by the factors listed in the attached schedules, Management believes that non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA can provide useful additional basis for comparing the current performance of the underlying operations being evaluated. Investors should consider this non-GAAP measure in addition to, not as a substitute for or as superior to, financial reporting measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP to understand the Company's performance taking into account all relevant factors.Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release may include ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are not historical facts and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected and projected.

About NVL-330NVL-330 is a novel brain-penetrant HER2-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor designed to address the combined medical need of treating HER2-mutant tumors, including those with HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations, avoiding treatment related adverse events due to off-target inhibition of wild-type EGFR, and treating brain metastases. About zidesamtinib (NVL-520)Zidesamtinib is a novel brain-penetrant ROS1-selective inhibitor created with the aim to overcome limitations observed with currently available ROS1 inhibitors. Zidesamtinib is designed to remain active in tumors that have developed resistance to currently available ROS1 inhibitors, including tumors with treatment-emergent ROS1 mutations such as G2032R. In addition, zidesamtinib is designed for central nervous system (CNS) penetrance to improve treatment options for patients with brain metastases, and to avoid inhibition of the structurally related tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) family. Together, these characteristics have the potential to avoid TRK-related CNS adverse events seen with dual TRK/ROS1 inhibitors and to drive deep, durable responses for patients across all lines of therapy. Zidesamtinib has received breakthrough therapy designation for the treatment of patients with ROS1-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have been previously treated with 2 or more ROS1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors and orphan drug designation for ROS1-positive NSCLC. Zidesamtinib is currently being investigated in the ARROS-1 trial (NCT05118789), a first-in-human Phase 1/2 clinical trial for patients with advanced ROS1-positive NSCLC and other solid tumors. About NuvalentNuvalent, Inc. (Nasdaq: NUVL) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on creating precisely targeted therapies for patients with cancer, designed to overcome the limitations of existing therapies for clinically proven kinase targets. Leveraging deep expertise in chemistry and structure-based drug design, we develop innovative small molecules that have the potential to overcome resistance, minimize adverse events, address brain metastases, and drive more durable responses.

The Company expects to enter capped call transactions to reduce potential dilution to common stock. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Xerox Holdings Corporation's announcement of a $300 million convertible senior notes offering, with an additional option for purchasers to acquire up to $45 million more, is a strategic financial maneuver aimed at optimizing the company's capital structure. Convertible notes are hybrid securities offering potential upside through conversion into equity while providing interest income, making them attractive to certain institutional investors.The intent to use proceeds to refinance existing debt, specifically the 2024 and 2025 Senior Notes, indicates a proactive approach to debt management. This refinancing could potentially lower interest expenses and extend debt maturities, which would improve the company's financial flexibility. However, the impact on the company's leverage and interest coverage ratios will depend on the final terms of the offering and the success of the tender offer.The associated capped call transactions aim to minimize dilution from the conversion of the new notes into equity, which is beneficial for existing shareholders. However, the market response to these transactions, including potential hedging activities by the counterparties, may introduce volatility in the company's stock price in the short term. Market Research Analyst Convertible note offerings are often a signal of a company's confidence in its future growth potential, as they can be converted into equity at a later date, typically at a premium to the current stock price. For Xerox, a company with a storied history in document technology, this move suggests a strategic pivot or investment in growth initiatives that may require substantial capital.The market's reception to this offering will be contingent on the perceived risk-reward balance by institutional investors. Factors influencing this perception include Xerox's current market position, competitive landscape and future growth prospects. The capped call transactions indicate that Xerox is cognizant of the potential dilutive effect of the convertible notes and is taking steps to mitigate this impact, which could reassure investors concerned about share value dilution.Market observers should also note the potential for increased trading activity around the company's common stock due to the hedging strategies employed by the counterparties to the capped call transactions. Such activity may not necessarily reflect the company's fundamental value but rather the mechanics of derivative market strategies. Legal Expert The offering of convertible notes and related capped call transactions are complex legal processes governed by specific securities regulations, such as Rule 144A, which allows for the sale of securities to qualified institutional buyers without the need for a public offering. This facilitates quicker access to capital for the issuer but limits the pool of potential investors.It is important to note that neither the notes nor the shares of common stock potentially issuable upon conversion have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any state securities laws. This limits the secondary market for these securities and may impact their liquidity. Moreover, the legal stipulations surrounding the capped call transactions and the potential adjustments to the hedge positions by the counterparties are intricate and could have implications for the company's stock price and conversion mechanics of the notes.Investors in such offerings must rely on the issuer's compliance with securities laws and the robustness of contractual protections in the event of disputes or adverse market movements. The legal framework underpinning these transactions is critical for ensuring that the rights of all parties are adequately safeguarded. 03/05/2024 - 04:52 PM NORWALK, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Xerox Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ: XRX) (the “Company” or “Xerox”) announced today its intention to offer, subject to market and other conditions, $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes (the “Notes”) in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”). The Company also expects to grant the initial purchasers of the Notes a 13-day option to purchase up to $45,000,000 aggregate principal amount of additional notes. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to fund the cost of the capped call transactions described below, with any remaining net proceeds of the Notes, together with the net proceeds from the concurrent offering of the senior notes of the Company announced March 4, 2024, to be used to refinance any and all of its 3.800% Senior Notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”) and a portion of its 5.000% Senior Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”) through a tender offer, to pay related fees and expenses in connection with such transactions and for general corporate purposes. The aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes currently outstanding is $300 million and the aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes outstanding is $750 million. The Notes and the related guarantees will be senior, unsecured obligations of the Company, and interest will be payable semi-annually in arrears. The Notes will be convertible into cash, up to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be converted, and into cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination thereof, at the Company’s election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of the Company’s conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being converted. The interest rate, initial conversion rate and other terms of the Notes are to be determined upon pricing of the offering. The Notes also will be redeemable at the option of the Company on or after September 20, 2027, if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive), including the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption, during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption. The Notes will mature on March 15, 2030. In connection with the pricing of the Notes, the Company expects to enter into privately negotiated capped call transactions with one or more financial institutions, which may include certain initial purchasers or their respective affiliates and/or other financial institutions or their respective affiliates (collectively, the “Counterparties”). The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon any conversion of the Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap based on the cap price. The cap price of the capped call transactions will be determined upon pricing of the Notes. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional Notes, the Company expects to enter into additional capped call transactions with the Counterparties. The Company has been advised that, in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the Counterparties or their respective affiliates expect to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock and/or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the Company’s common stock concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the Notes and may unwind these various derivative transactions and purchase the Company’s common stock in open market transactions shortly following the pricing of the Notes. These activities could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of the Company’s common stock or the Notes at that time. In addition, the Company has been advised that the Counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to the Company’s common stock and/or by purchasing or selling shares of the Company’s common stock or other securities of the Company in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the Notes and from time to time prior to the maturity of the Notes (and are likely to do so following any conversion of the Notes, any repurchase of the Notes by the Company on a fundamental change repurchase date, any redemption date, or any other date on which the notes are retired by the Company in each case if the Company exercises its option to terminate the relevant portion of the capped call transactions). These activities could cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of the Company’s common stock or the Notes, which could affect the ability of holders of Notes to convert the Notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the Notes, could affect the number of shares of the Company’s common stock, if any, and value of the consideration that holders of Notes will receive upon conversion of the Notes. The Notes and the related guarantees will be offered only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Act. Neither the Notes, the related guarantees nor the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, if any, have been, nor will be, registered under the Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, the Notes, the related guarantees or any other security, and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale of any securities in any state or jurisdiction in which, or to any persons to whom, such offering, solicitation or sale would be unlawful. In addition, this press release shall not constitute an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to purchase the 2024 Notes or the 2025 Notes. Any tender offer will be made solely pursuant to an offer to purchase to the holders of the 2024 Notes and the 2025 Notes.

The data showcases significant progress in developing novel medicines targeting the chromatin regulatory system. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The preclinical efficacy and safety data of FHD-909, a BRM selective inhibitor, is significant due to its potential role in treating NSCLC (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer), which is a prevalent form of cancer with high morbidity and mortality. The prospect of an IND filing indicates a transition from preclinical to clinical studies, which is a critical step toward making the drug available to patients. The absence of thrombocytopenia in the selective CBP and EP300 degrader programs is particularly noteworthy, as this side effect has been a limitation of previous dual inhibitors in cancer treatments.From a clinical perspective, the development of long-acting degraders that enable up to once-a-month dosing could significantly improve patient compliance and quality of life. This dosing schedule is less frequent than current standards, which often require daily or weekly treatments and could represent a paradigm shift in the administration of cancer therapies. Pharmaceutical Research Analyst The advancement of FHD-909 and associated degrader programs by Foghorn Therapeutics represents a strategic move in the competitive landscape of oncology drug development. The ability to selectively target chromatin regulatory systems may offer a differentiated mechanism of action compared to existing therapies. This is particularly important for investors as it could position Foghorn Therapeutics as a leader in a niche market with significant unmet medical needs.Furthermore, the potential for once-a-month dosing could lead to a competitive advantage in terms of patient adherence and reduced healthcare costs associated with treatment administration. As these programs move closer to clinical trials, the valuation of Foghorn Therapeutics could be influenced by the perceived potential of these drugs to capture market share in the oncology sector. Market Research Analyst The preclinical data presentations at the AACR Annual Meeting are of interest to the broader market as they signal the progress of novel therapies in the pipeline. The market's reception to these updates can affect investor confidence and, consequently, stock performance. The pharmaceutical industry places high value on innovation, especially in oncology and the introduction of a first-in-class oral BRM selective inhibitor such as FHD-909 could disrupt existing treatment paradigms.It is also important to consider the potential market size for these therapies. NSCLC accounts for a substantial portion of cancer cases and treatments that offer improved efficacy and safety profiles can command premium pricing. Additionally, the development of long-acting formulations could tap into a growing demand for more convenient treatment regimens, potentially expanding the target market. 03/05/2024 - 04:48 PM Poster presentation of FHD-909, a first-in-class oral BRM selective inhibitor, highlighting preclinical efficacy and safety in multiple mouse models of NSCLC; IND filing planned in Q2 2024 Oral presentation demonstrating preclinical efficacy and tolerability data for Selective CBP and Selective EP300 degraders; Significant anti-tumor activity observed, with no thrombocytopenia as historically observed with dual CBP/EP300 inhibitors Additional poster presentation demonstrating long-acting degrader capabilities confirming up to once-a-month dosing for protein degrader programs CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Foghorn® Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq: FHTX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering a new class of medicines that treat serious diseases by correcting abnormal gene expression, today announced that preclinical data for its pipeline programs, including the first presentation of preclinical data for FHD-909, a potential first-in-class BRM (SMARCA2) selective inhibitor will be presented at the 2024 American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting being held April 5-10, 2024 in San Diego, California.

Oncology Doctor The development of SMARCA2 degraders and CDK inhibitors represents a significant advancement in targeted cancer therapies. SMARCA2 is part of the chromatin remodeling complex, essential in regulating gene expression and its dysregulation has been implicated in various cancers. An oral SMARCA2 degrader like PRT7732 has the potential to offer a more convenient and less invasive treatment option compared to intravenous therapies, potentially improving patient compliance and quality of life.Moreover, CDK9 and CDK4/6 are critical enzymes in cell cycle regulation and their inhibition can lead to the suppression of cancer cell proliferation. The preclinical efficacy of PRT2527 and PRT3645, especially in combination with other targeted therapies, could pave the way for more effective treatment regimens. Given the prevalence of lymphoid malignancies and breast cancer, these developments could have a substantial impact on patient outcomes and, by extension, on the business performance of Prelude Therapeutics. Medical Research Analyst Preclinical data are a cornerstone in the drug development process, providing the first glimpse of a compound's efficacy and safety profile. The acceptance of Prelude's posters at a prestigious conference like AACR indicates peer recognition of the scientific merit of their work. As the company prepares to transition PRT7732 into Phase 1 clinical trials, investors will be closely watching for any data that could signal the compound's viability and potential market impact.Furthermore, the ability of PRT3645 to penetrate the brain barrier is noteworthy, as it could address a significant unmet need in the treatment of central nervous system-involved malignancies. The combination therapies involving PRT2527 and PRT3645 might offer new hope for patients with refractory cancers. These developments could significantly impact Prelude's valuation and future revenue streams if the clinical trials confirm the preclinical promises. Market Research Analyst The oncology market is highly competitive, with numerous companies vying for a share of a growing market driven by an increasing global cancer burden. The introduction of a potentially best-in-class CDK9 inhibitor and a next-generation CDK4/6 inhibitor by Prelude Therapeutics could disrupt existing treatment paradigms if their preclinical advantages translate into clinical benefits. This could lead to a reevaluation of the company's market position and influence investor sentiment.Strategic partnerships, licensing agreements, or even acquisition interest could arise if these compounds demonstrate significant advantages over existing therapies. The potential for multi-indication treatment options also broadens the market opportunity for these drugs. Investors should monitor the outcomes of the upcoming clinical trials and any strategic moves by Prelude in response to these results. 03/05/2024 - 04:45 PM Posters to highlight highly selective oral SMARCA2 degrader, potentially best-in-class CDK9 inhibitor and next-generation CDK4/6 inhibitorWILMINGTON, Del., March 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Prelude Therapeutics Incorporated (Nasdaq: PRLD), a clinical-stage precision oncology company, today announced that three posters with preclinical data on the Company’s highly selective oral SMARCA2 degrader, its potentially best-in-class CDK9 inhibitor and its next-generation CDK4/6 inhibitor, have been accepted for presentation at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2024, taking place from April 5 to 10, 2024.

The projects mark a step forward in the Company's photovoltaic portfolio expansion in the US market, showcasing proactive and efficient construction timelines. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst The announcement by Ellomay Capital Ltd. regarding the execution of EPC agreements for photovoltaic projects in Texas represents a pivotal development in the company's growth trajectory, particularly within the renewable energy sector in the United States. The rapid transition from greenfield phase to project execution underscores Ellomay's operational efficiency and ability to adhere to an accelerated construction timeline. This efficiency is a critical factor in the renewable energy industry, where the time-to-market can significantly influence a project's return on investment (ROI) and competitiveness.The selection of a top-tier EPC contractor and procurement of solar modules from a leading manufacturer are indicative of Ellomay's commitment to quality and reliability. These strategic moves not only enhance the potential for successful project completion but also position the company favorably in a market that values sustainability and technological proficiency. By establishing a foothold in the Texas renewable energy market, Ellomay is poised to tap into the state's favorable regulatory environment and abundant solar resources, which could lead to lucrative power purchase agreements (PPAs) and long-term revenue streams. Financial Analyst The financial implications of Ellomay Capital's recent EPC agreements for stakeholders are multifaceted. The anticipated six-month completion timeline for the Fairfield and Malakoff projects may lead to an earlier-than-expected revenue generation, providing a positive outlook for short-term financial performance. Moreover, securing solar modules from a tier 1 manufacturer not only ensures high-quality inputs but may also mitigate risks associated with supply chain disruptions, a concern that has recently plagued various industries.Investors should note the potential for growth in Ellomay's stock value as the company expands its project portfolio and leverages its expertise in renewable energy. The forward-looking statements regarding the commencement of additional projects in the second half of 2024 suggest a strategic roadmap aimed at scaling operations and diversifying revenue sources. However, it is important to remain cognizant of the inherent risks in the renewable energy sector, such as regulatory changes, technological advancements and market competition, which can impact long-term financial sustainability. Market Research Analyst The renewable energy market in the United States and Texas in particular, is experiencing significant growth, driven by both regulatory support and increasing demand for clean energy. Ellomay Capital's announcement of advancing its photovoltaic portfolio in this region is a testament to the company's strategic alignment with market trends. By executing these projects ahead of schedule, Ellomay demonstrates not only its commitment to rapid expansion but also positions itself as a competitive player in the market.Understanding the broader context, Texas has emerged as a leading state for solar energy production, thanks to its large land area and high solar irradiance. Ellomay's entry into this market through the Fairfield and Malakoff projects could serve as a catalyst for further investment and expansion within the renewable energy sector. The company's proactive approach to project development and its strategic partnerships could serve as a model for other entities looking to capitalize on the growing demand for renewable energy solutions. 03/05/2024 - 04:15 PM TEL-AVIV, Israel, March 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Ellomay Capital Ltd. (NYSE American: ELLO) (TASE: ELLO) (""Ellomay"" or the ""Company""), a renewable energy and power generator and developer of renewable energy and power projects in Europe, USA and Israel, today announced that it reached a significant milestone in its strategic business plan.

The execution of these agreements marks a significant step in the advancement of the Company's photovoltaic portfolio in Texas, USA. The selected EPC contractor is renowned for its engineering expertise and high-quality construction of photovoltaic plants across the United States and the construction of these projects is expected to be completed within six months. The Company also entered into agreements to procure solar modules from one of the top five, tier 1, manufacturers for the Fairfield and Malakoff projects and for additional US PV projects under development (Mexia and Talco). ""The execution of EPC agreements for the Company's first US photovoltaic projects signifies an important moment for the Company's evolution in the US market. The transition of the Fairfield and Malakoff projects from the greenfield phase to project execution and initial site preparations was completed ahead of our expected schedule, exemplifying the Company's proactive and efficient approach to streamlining the construction timeline. These projects serve as proof of concept for the Company's strategic plan for rapid expansion and value creation and the Company's unwavering commitment to excellence and reliability. We are working tirelessly together with our US partners to achieve our goals and we expect that the Mexia and Talco projects (10.4 MW and 9.7 MW, respectively) will commence construction during the second half of 2024.

Positive Strong full fiscal year revenue of $507 million, showcasing growth Year-over-year subscription revenue growth of 41% Guidance for first quarter fiscal 2025 revenue of $100 to $110 million Negative Decrease in fourth quarter revenue by 24% Reduction in gross margin percentages compared to the prior year Negative net income figures for both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics Financial Analyst The reported fiscal fourth quarter and full year financial results of ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. indicate a mixed performance characterized by a significant year-over-year growth in subscription revenue but a decrease in total revenue and networked charging systems revenue for the fourth quarter. The company's guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 suggests a revenue decline, which could be a point of concern for investors. However, the reaffirmation of the goal to achieve positive non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 may signal management's confidence in the company's cost control and path to profitability.From a financial perspective, the substantial GAAP net loss and non-GAAP pre-tax net loss for both the quarter and the full year, coupled with the decline in gross margins, reflect ongoing challenges in operational efficiency and market conditions. The cash position and undrawn credit facility provide some liquidity buffer, but the continued losses could eventually necessitate capital-raising activities, which may dilute current shareholders or increase debt obligations. The stock's performance will likely be influenced by the company's ability to manage costs, grow subscription revenue and navigate the competitive landscape of the EV charging market. Market Research Analyst ChargePoint's focus on operational execution and the growth in subscription revenue are positive signs of the company's strategic pivot towards recurring revenue streams, which are typically more stable and predictable than one-time sales. The EV charging industry is expanding rapidly due to increased EV adoption and ChargePoint's position as a leading provider could benefit from this trend in the long-term.However, the reported decline in networked charging systems revenue and the projected decrease in overall revenue for the upcoming quarter suggest potential market saturation or competitive pressures. The company's ability to innovate and prioritize its software platform, as mentioned by the CEO, will be critical in differentiating its services and maintaining market share. Additionally, ChargePoint's success in securing government contracts, as enabled by the FedRAMP authority, could provide a significant boost to future revenues and should be monitored closely by stakeholders. Energy Sector Analyst The electric vehicle (EV) charging sector is poised for growth, driven by global efforts to reduce carbon emissions and the transition towards electric mobility. ChargePoint's reported year-over-year subscription revenue growth of 41% aligns with the increasing demand for EV infrastructure. However, the decrease in networked charging systems revenue suggests potential challenges in hardware sales, which may be due to market competition or a shift in consumer preferences towards subscription services.The company's strategic milestones, such as the opening of the Mercedes-Benz High-Performance Charging (HPC) network, indicate a focus on expanding high-quality charging solutions, which is essential in a market where consumer experience can significantly influence brand loyalty and market positioning. ChargePoint's long-term no-debt maturity and undrawn credit facility provide financial stability and flexibility to invest in these strategic initiatives. The energy sector's transition to electric mobility and ChargePoint's role within this shift will continue to be a critical area of focus for investors and industry observers alike. 03/05/2024 - 04:10 PM Fiscal fourth quarter revenue of $116 million and full fiscal year revenue of $507 million Fiscal fourth quarter GAAP gross margin of 19% and non-GAAP gross margin of 22%; full fiscal year GAAP gross margin of 6% and non-GAAP gross margin of 8% Full fiscal year subscription revenue of $120 million representing 41% year-over year growth ChargePoint guides to first quarter fiscal 2025 revenue of $100 to $110 million CAMPBELL, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ChargePoint Holdings, Inc.

First Quarter and Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2025 Guidance For the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 ending April 30, 2024, ChargePoint expects revenue of $100 million to $110 million. At the midpoint, this represents an anticipated decrease of 19% as compared to the prior year’s same quarter. For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025 ending January 31, 2025, the Company reaffirms its goal to achieve positive non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA. ChargePoint is not able to present a reconciliation of its forward-looking non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA goal to the corresponding GAAP measure because certain potential future adjustments, which may be significant and may include, among other items, stock-based compensation expense, are uncertain or out of its control, or cannot be reasonably predicted without unreasonable effort. The actual amounts of such reconciling items could have a significant impact on ChargePoint's GAAP Net Loss.

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions including statements regarding our projected revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and our goal to achieve positive non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025. There are a significant number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the statements made in this press release, including: macroeconomic trends including changes in or sustained inflation, interest rate volatility, or other events beyond our control on the overall economy which may reduce demand for our products and services, geopolitical events and conflicts, adverse impacts to our business and those of our customers and suppliers, including due to supply chain disruptions, component shortages, and associated logistics expense increases; our limited operating history as a public company; our ability as an organization to successfully acquire and integrate other companies, products or technologies in a successful manner; our dependence on widespread acceptance and adoption of EVs and increased demand for installation of charging stations; our current dependence on sales of charging stations for most of our revenues; overall demand for EV charging and the potential for reduced demand for EVs if governmental rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives are reduced, modified or eliminated or governmental mandates to increase the use of EVs or decrease the use of vehicles powered by fossil fuels, either directly or indirectly through mandated limits on carbon emissions, are reduced, modified or eliminated; our reliance on contract manufacturers, including those located outside the United States, may result in supply chain interruptions, delays and expense increases which may adversely affect our sales, revenue and gross margins; our ability to expand our operations and market share in Europe; the need to attract additional fleet operators as customers; potential adverse effects on our revenue and gross margins due to delays and costs associated with new product introductions, inventory obsolescence, component shortages and related expense increases; adverse impact to our revenues and gross margins if customers increasingly claim clean energy credits and, as a result, they are no longer available to be claimed by us; the effects of competition; risks related to our dependence on our intellectual property; and the risk that our technology could have undetected defects or errors. Additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results are included under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on December 8, 2023, which is available on our website at investors.chargepoint.com and on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in other filings that we make with the SEC from time to time. All forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we do not assume any obligation to update the forward-looking statements provided to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made, except as required by applicable law. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures ChargePoint has provided financial information in this press release that has not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). ChargePoint uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results. ChargePoint believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends and believes they provide meaningful supplemental information to investors regarding ChargePoint’s underlying operating performance because they exclude items the Company believes are unrelated to, and may not be indicative of, its core operating results. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with ChargePoint’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of ChargePoint’s historical non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review these reconciliations. Non-GAAP Gross Profit (Gross Margin). ChargePoint defines non-GAAP gross profit as gross profit excluding stock-based compensation expense, amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, and restructuring costs for severances and employment-related termination costs, and facility and other contract terminations. Non-GAAP gross margin is non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of revenue. Non-GAAP Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses (includes Non-GAAP research and development, Non-GAAP sales and marketing and Non-GAAP general and administrative). ChargePoint defines non-GAAP cost of revenue and operating expenses as cost of revenue and operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation expense, restructuring costs for severances and employment-related termination costs, and facility and other contract terminations, amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, non-recurring costs and professional services fees associated with acquisitions, registration filings and modification of convertible debt, non-cash charges related to tax liabilities and litigation, and non-cash charges related to the change in fair value of assumed common stock warrant liabilities. Non-GAAP Net Loss. ChargePoint defines non-GAAP net loss as net loss excluding stock-based compensation expense, restructuring costs for severances and employment-related termination costs, and facility and other contract terminations, amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, non-recurring costs and professional services fees associated with acquisitions, registration filings and modification of convertible debt, non-cash charges related to tax liabilities and litigation, and non-cash charges related to the change in fair value of assumed common stock warrant liabilities. These amounts reflect the impact of any related tax effects. Non-GAAP pre-tax net loss is non-GAAP net loss adjusted for provision for income taxes. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA Loss. ChargePoint defines non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss as net loss excluding stock-based compensation expense, restructuring costs for severances and employment-related termination costs, and facility and other contract terminations, amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, non-recurring costs and professional services fees associated with acquisitions, registration filings and modification of convertible debt, non-cash charges related to tax liabilities and litigation, and non-cash charges related to the change in fair value of assumed common stock warrant liabilities, and further adjusted for provision of income taxes, depreciation, interest income and expense, and other income and expense (net). Investors are cautioned that there are a number of limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures to analyze financial results and trends. In particular, many of the adjustments to ChargePoint’s GAAP financial measures reflect the exclusion of items that are recurring and will be reflected in its financial results for the foreseeable future, such as stock-based compensation, which is an important part of ChargePoint’s employees’ compensation and impacts hiring, retention and performance. Furthermore, these non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP, and the components that ChargePoint excludes in its calculation of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the components that other companies exclude when they report their non-GAAP results. In the future, ChargePoint may also exclude other expenses it determines do not reflect the performance of ChargePoint’s operating results. CHPT-IR ChargePoint Holdings, Inc.

Financial Analyst The initial public offering (IPO) of Ryde Group Ltd is a significant event that injects capital into the company, enabling it to pursue its strategic objectives. The pricing of the IPO at US$4.00 per share, resulting in a total raise of US$12 million, is a critical decision reflecting the company's valuation and market expectations. Analyzing this valuation against industry comparables is vital to understand investor sentiment and potential growth prospects.Furthermore, the option granted to underwriters to purchase additional shares to cover over-allotments could indicate confidence in the IPO's success and potentially stabilize the share price post-listing. The role of Maxim Group LLC as the sole book-running manager suggests a streamlined underwriting process, possibly impacting the efficiency and cost of the offering.Investors will monitor the stock's performance on the NYSE American, particularly given the current economic climate and the performance of tech and mobility sectors. The use of proceeds from the IPO is another area of interest, as it could significantly impact the company's future growth trajectory and competitive positioning. Market Research Analyst The mobility and quick commerce sector in which Ryde operates is highly competitive and rapidly evolving. The entry of Ryde onto the NYSE American provides an opportunity to gauge market appetite for such companies within this space. The performance of Ryde's IPO could serve as a bellwether for other tech companies considering going public, particularly in the Southeast Asian market.It's also important to consider the broader implications of Ryde's public listing for the industry. This move could potentially accelerate consolidation in the market or prompt competitors to seek additional capital to maintain their competitive edge. Moreover, investor response to Ryde's IPO could influence the valuation strategies of similar companies in the future. Legal Expert The effectiveness of Ryde's registration statement with the SEC is a crucial legal step in the IPO process, ensuring regulatory compliance and the provision of essential information to investors. The roles played by Sidley Austin LLP and Ortoli Rosenstadt LLP underscore the importance of legal due diligence and the complexities of cross-border securities offerings.Legal compliance and the transparency of the offering documents are paramount, as they provide investors with the necessary information to make informed decisions. The legal framework surrounding IPOs, including the use of prospectuses and registration statements, is designed to protect investors and maintain market integrity.Investors should also be aware of the legal implications of the 'quiet period' regulations that restrict promotional commentary before and after the IPO, which can influence market perception and trading volume. 03/05/2024 - 07:30 PM SINGAPORE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ryde Group Ltd (“Ryde” or the “Company”), a technology company with a leading platform for mobility and quick commerce in Singapore, announced today the pricing of its initial public offering (the “Offering”) of 3,000,000 Class A ordinary shares at a price of US$4.00 per share to the public, for a total of US$12,000,000 of gross proceeds to the Company, before deducting underwriting discounts and other offering expenses.

(NFE) has amended its Tender Offer to purchase up to $375,000,000 of its outstanding 6.750% Senior Secured Notes due 2025.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The amendment of the tender offer by New Fortress Energy to purchase a higher aggregate principal amount of its Senior Secured Notes indicates a strategic move to manage its debt portfolio. The upsizing from $250 million to $375 million, coupled with the pricing of a new debt offering with a higher interest rate, suggests an aggressive approach to refinancing existing debt. This is noteworthy as it may affect the company's interest expenses and leverage ratios, which are critical factors in assessing financial health and creditworthiness.An increase in the principal amount being repurchased could imply that the company is taking advantage of market conditions to retire debt that may be more expensive or less strategically aligned with its long-term financial planning. The introduction of new senior secured notes at a higher interest rate, however, raises questions about the cost of capital and the impact on future earnings. Investors and analysts should closely monitor the company’s debt-to-equity ratio and interest coverage ratios following these transactions for signs of increased financial risk or leverage. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, New Fortress Energy's actions reflect broader trends in corporate debt management, particularly in the energy sector. The decision to upsize the tender offer could be interpreted as a signal of management's confidence in the company's performance and its ability to service debt. However, the higher interest rate on the new notes may also reflect the current market environment, where rising interest rates and economic uncertainty have made borrowing more expensive.Investors should consider the potential impact on the company's stock performance. Typically, an increase in debt levels can lead to concerns about a company's financial flexibility, but if the refinancing is part of a well-structured financial strategy, it can also be viewed positively. The market's reception of these moves will likely be reflected in the company's stock price and volatility in the near term. Legal Expert Legally, the tender offer process is governed by specific regulations that protect investors and ensure transparency. The amendment to the tender offer and the conditions set forth, including the requirement for the company to receive gross proceeds from the debt financing, highlights the regulatory framework that governs such transactions. It is important for the company to adhere to these regulations to avoid legal repercussions and maintain investor confidence.Additionally, the tender offer being subject to customary conditions and not conditioned on any minimum principal amount of Notes being tendered demonstrates the company's flexibility and the potential for adjustments based on investor response and market conditions. Legal compliance in these matters is essential to ensure the integrity of the tender offer process and uphold shareholder rights. 03/05/2024 - 05:50 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- New Fortress Energy Inc.

Tenders of the Notes may be withdrawn at any time at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on March 18, 2024, unless extended or earlier terminated by the Company, and not thereafter, except in certain limited circumstances where withdrawal rights are required by applicable law. Subject to the Aggregate Maximum Principal Amount and the other terms and conditions of the Tender Offer, possible proration of the Notes on the Early Settlement Date or the Final Settlement Date will be determined in accordance with the terms of the Tender Offer. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date and accepted for purchase by the Company equals or exceeds the Aggregate Maximum Principal Amount, then Holders who validly tender their Notes after the Early Tender Date will not have any such Notes accepted for payment (unless the terms of the Tender Offer are amended by the Company in its sole and absolute discretion). If on the Early Settlement Date or Final Settlement Date (each, as defined herein), as applicable, only a portion of the tendered Notes may be accepted for purchase, due to the aggregate principal amount of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date or the Expiration Date, as applicable, exceeding the Aggregate Maximum Principal Amount, then the aggregate principal amount of Notes accepted for purchase will be prorated (subject to adjustment to maintain the authorized denomination of the Notes) based upon the aggregate principal amount of Notes that have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn and not yet accepted for purchase in the Tender Offer, such that the Aggregate Maximum Principal Amount will not be exceeded. If the Tender Offer is not fully subscribed as of the Early Tender Date, Holders who validly tender Notes after the Early Tender Date may be subject to proration, whereas Holders who validly tender Notes at or prior to the Early Tender Date will not be subject to proration. The Total Consideration includes an early tender payment (the “Early Tender Payment”) of $30.00 for each $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which Early Tender Payment is in addition to the Tender Offer Consideration. Subject to purchase in accordance with the Aggregate Maximum Principal Amount and possible proration, Holders validly tendering Notes that have not been validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date will be eligible to receive the applicable Total Consideration listed in the table above, which includes the Early Tender Payment, on the “Early Settlement Date,” which is expected to be March 19, 2024 (the first business day after the Early Tender Date), but that may change without notice. Holders validly tendering Notes after the Early Tender Date but at or prior to the Expiration Date will only be eligible to receive the “Tender Offer Consideration” listed in the table on the “Final Settlement Date.” The Final Settlement Date is expected to be April 3, 2024 (the first business day after the Expiration Date), but that may change without notice. In addition to the Total Consideration or Tender Offer Consideration, Holders whose Notes are accepted for purchase will also receive Accrued Interest from the last interest payment date up to, but not including, the applicable settlement date. The obligation of the Company to accept for purchase, and to pay for, Notes validly tendered pursuant to the Tender Offer is subject to, and conditioned upon, the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions as set forth in the Offer to Purchase, in the sole and absolute discretion of the Company, including the Company’s completion of the Debt Financing, on terms satisfactory to the Company, the proceeds of which (net of transaction fees and expenses) will be used to finance its purchase of Notes pursuant to the Tender Offer. For avoidance of doubt, references in the Offer to Purchase to “completion” of the Debt Financing mean the completion of the closing under the Debt Financing, at which closing the Company receives the anticipated proceeds from the Debt Financing. No assurance can be given that the Debt Financing will be completed. If such conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived by the Company), no payments will be made to tendering Holders on the Early Settlement Date or Final Settlement Date, as applicable. The Tender Offer is not conditioned on any minimum principal amount of Notes being tendered. The Tender Offer and its provisions may be amended, extended, terminated, waived or withdrawn by the Company in its sole and absolute discretion.

Holders must decide whether to tender Notes, and if tendering, the amount of Notes to tender. Holders are urged to evaluate carefully all information in the Offer to Purchase, consult their own investment, legal and tax advisors and make their own decisions whether to tender Notes and, if so, the principal amount of Notes to tender.

(NFE) announced a private offering of $750 million senior secured notes due 2029, with an 8.750% interest rate. The offering size increased by $250 million from the initial plan. The proceeds will be used to repay existing debts and for general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by New Fortress Energy Inc. regarding the upsizing of its senior secured notes offering from $500 million to $750 million is a significant financial move that warrants a detailed analysis. The decision to increase the offering size by $250 million may indicate a strong demand from qualified institutional buyers, suggesting investor confidence in the company's creditworthiness and future prospects. Additionally, the fixed interest rate of 8.750% is notably higher than current average corporate bond yields, which could reflect a risk premium demanded by investors due to the specific risks associated with the energy sector or the company's financial position.From a balance sheet perspective, using the net proceeds to repay a portion of existing debt is a strategic move that could improve the company's debt maturity profile and reduce future refinancing risk. However, the repurchase of existing senior secured notes due 2025 at this juncture also implies that the company is proactively managing its debt obligations, possibly to take advantage of current market conditions or to alleviate potential liquidity concerns. Stakeholders should monitor how this refinancing impacts the company's leverage ratios and interest coverage metrics. Legal Expert The legal intricacies of the offering, especially the fact that the notes and the guarantees thereof were offered under Rule 144A and Regulation S, cater to a specific investor base. Rule 144A allows for the resale of certain securities to qualified institutional buyers, which can facilitate liquidity in the secondary market. However, the notes not being registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws means they are subject to restrictions on their transferability, limiting the potential investor base to those who are willing to accept these limitations.The collateral arrangement, which is substantially the same as the company's existing first lien obligations, provides a layer of security for investors but also indicates that the company's assets are further encumbered, potentially affecting future borrowing capacity. It is essential for investors to understand the terms of the collateral and how it might affect their position in the event of default. Market Research Analyst Examining the broader market implications, the issuance of high-yield debt such as these senior secured notes by New Fortress Energy Inc. reflects a trend in the energy sector where companies often require substantial capital to fund operations and growth initiatives. In the context of the energy market, where volatility can be high due to fluctuating commodity prices and regulatory changes, the company's move to secure long-term financing at a fixed rate might be seen as a hedge against potential interest rate increases in the future.For the energy sector, this financing activity could signal a period of strategic financial restructuring as companies prepare for market shifts. It's important for stakeholders to consider the cyclical nature of the energy industry and how New Fortress Energy's financial strategy aligns with expected market trends. The company's actions may also serve as an indicator for the credit market's appetite for energy sector debt, which could influence the financing strategies of other firms within the industry. 03/05/2024 - 05:50 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- New Fortress Energy Inc. (NASDAQ: NFE) (the “Company”) announced today the pricing of its previously announced private offering of $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2029 (the “Notes”). The aggregate principal amount represents an increase in the size of the offering of $250 million from the previously announced offering of $500 million. The Notes will bear interest at 8.750% per annum and will be issued at an issue price equal to 100% of principal, plus accrued interest, if any, from March 8, 2024. The closing of the offering is subject to certain limited conditions. Subject to certain exceptions and thresholds, the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis by each domestic subsidiary and foreign subsidiary that is a wholly-owned restricted subsidiary of the Company that is a guarantor under its existing senior secured notes. The Notes will be secured by substantially the same collateral as the Company’s existing first lien obligations under its existing senior secured notes. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to repay a portion of its outstanding indebtedness, including to repurchase up to $375 million of the Company’s existing senior secured notes due 2025 pursuant to its tender offer announced on March 5, 2024, together with any fees and related expenses, and/or for general corporate purposes. The Notes and the guarantees thereof were offered in the United States to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and to persons outside of the United States under Regulation S under the Securities Act.

The company reaffirms the expected release of topline pivotal clinical data for Anaphylm in March 2024 and the anticipated FDA decision on Libervant application in April 2024. Aquestive provides full year 2024 financial guidance and hosts an investment community conference call on March 6, 2024. Positive Positive: Aquestive reported a strong revenue growth in 2023, with double-digit base revenue growth and an improved balance sheet. Positive: The company is progressing Anaphylm towards a US filing and continues to expand revenue base and advance pipeline assets. Positive: Aquestive received positive feedback from the FDA on the pivotal Phase 3 PK clinical protocol for Anaphylm, indicating progress in development. Negative: Aquestive reported a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss of $11.6 million in 2023, which may raise concerns among investors. Negative: The Company's net loss for the full year 2023 was $7.9 million, indicating financial challenges despite revenue growth. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported full year revenue of $50.6 million for Aquestive Therapeutics represents a significant 26% increase compared to the previous year, excluding the impact of prior year proprietary sales of Sympazan. This growth is a positive indicator of the company's ability to expand its manufacturing and supply revenues, which rose by 20% and license and royalty revenues, which saw an impressive 129% increase. These figures suggest a successful diversification of revenue streams and a strong performance in the company's licensing and supply collaborations.However, the non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss of $11.6 million, while improved from the previous year's loss of $35.3 million, indicates that the company is still operating at a loss. Investors should consider the company's ongoing need to manage expenses and the potential for future profitability, particularly in light of the projected non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss of $22 to $26 million for 2024. The reduction in net loss is a positive development, but the continued losses underscore the importance of successful commercialization of pipeline products like Anaphylm and Libervant. Medical Research Analyst Anaphylm's progress as the first orally delivered epinephrine product candidate is noteworthy for its potential to disrupt the emergency treatment market for allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. The clinical results comparable to autoinjectors, coupled with positive FDA feedback, position Anaphylm as a potentially transformative product. The pivotal Phase 3 Pharmacokinetic (PK) clinical study's design, which incorporates FDA feedback, is crucial for demonstrating the product's efficacy and safety, which will be pivotal in the NDA filing expected before the end of 2024.For Libervant, the anticipated FDA decision in April 2024 could open market access for acute treatment of seizure clusters in patients as young as two years old. This represents a significant patient population currently limited to Diastat Rectal Gel. The tentative approval for patients twelve years and older, despite the orphan drug market exclusivity block until January 2027, indicates a strategic approach to market entry. The outcome of these FDA decisions will be critical for Aquestive's future revenue and growth potential. Market Research Analyst The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and Aquestive's strategic collaborations, such as with Indivior for Suboxone Sublingual Film and the launch of Emilyf Oral Film by Zambon in Europe, demonstrate the company's commitment to leveraging partnerships for growth. The increase in doses manufactured for these collaborations indicates a solid operational capacity and demand for Aquestive's products.Moreover, the discontinuance of proprietary product sales of Sympazan following the outlicensing agreement with Assertio illustrates a shift in strategy to potentially reduce direct marketing costs and focus on a royalty-based revenue model. This shift, along with the projected revenue guidance of $48 to $51 million for 2024, indicates a conservative outlook that does not account for potential revenues from Libervant. Investors should monitor the progression of the company's pipeline products and FDA decisions, as these will heavily influence Aquestive's market positioning and financial performance. 03/05/2024 - 05:05 PM Reports full year 2023 revenue of $50.6 million and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss of $11.6 millionReaffirms expected release of topline pivotal clinical data for Anaphylm™ (epinephrine) Sublingual Film in March 2024Reaffirms anticipated FDA decision on Libervant™ (diazepam) Buccal Film application in April 2024Provides full year 2024 financial guidanceHosts investment community conference call on March 6, 2024 WARREN, N.J., March 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:AQST), a pharmaceutical company advancing medicines to bring meaningful improvement to patients' lives through innovative science and delivery technologies, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023, and provided a progress update on the key 2024 objectives previously outlined by the Company. “We ended 2023 on a strong note with double digit base revenue growth, an improved balance sheet, and the start of our pivotal study for Anaphylm. We are now focused on continuing our progress in 2024 and building a strong foundation for the long-term growth of the Company. This includes (1) progressing Anaphylm to a US filing, (2) expanding and growing our revenue base, (3) licensing or launching Libervant (diazepam) Buccal Film, if approved by the FDA with market access, and (4) advancing our next pipeline assets by utilizing our Adrenaverse technology,” stated Daniel Barber, President and Chief Executive Officer of Aquestive. “Anaphylm, as the only orally administered epinephrine product under development for the treatment of severe allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, continues to represent a transformational opportunity for both patients and the Company. We remain excited to see our topline pivotal data and continue to anticipate reporting topline data from our Anaphylm pivotal study this month.” Anaphylm™Aquestive is advancing the development of Anaphylm, the first and only orally delivered epinephrine product candidate to demonstrate clinical results comparable to autoinjectors (such as EpiPen® and Auvi-Q®) for the emergency treatment of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Aquestive received positive feedback in October 2023 from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the Company's pivotal Phase 3 Pharmacokinetic (PK) clinical protocol for Anaphylm. The FDA indicated that the Company’s proposed endpoints, sample size, and statistical analysis are reasonable. As anticipated, the FDA also reminded the Company that PK sustainability post-dosing (30–60 minutes) is an important factor and recommended using repeat-dose data to support PK sustainability. The Company has incorporated the FDA’s feedback into the design of its clinical protocol for Anaphylm. Aquestive commenced dosing in December 2023 in the Phase 3 pivotal PK clinical study of Anaphylm. The two-part, single-center, open-label, randomized study is designed to compare the PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) of single and repeat doses of Anaphylm versus single and repeat doses of the epinephrine IM injection and epinephrine autoinjectors in healthy adult subjects. The primary objective of the study is to compare the PK of epinephrine following the single administration of Anaphylm to single administration of epinephrine IM injection in healthy adult subjects. The secondary objectives of the study include evaluating PK sustainability following repeat administration and evaluating the safety and tolerability following single and repeat administrations versus epinephrine IM injection and epinephrine autoinjectors. Aquestive anticipates reporting topline data from the Anaphylm Pivotal PK study this month and continuing to guide to a filing of the Anaphylm New Drug Application (NDA) with the FDA before the end of 2024. A comprehensive adult and pediatric Human Factors program, an expected and ongoing part of the Anaphylm clinical development program, will also be included in the Anaphylm NDA to support future labeling and the use of the product by intended patients. Libervant™In September 2023, the FDA accepted Aquestive's NDA for Libervant (diazepam) Buccal Film for the acute treatment of intermittent, stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity (i.e., seizure clusters, acute repetitive seizures) in patients between two and five years of age. Diastat (diazepam) Rectal Gel is the only FDA approved treatment currently available to this patient population for this indication. Based on the latest information available to the Company, the review of the Libervant NDA remains on track and there are currently no outstanding information requests from the FDA. The NDA for Libervant was assigned a PDUFA target action date of April 28, 2024. The NDA for Libervant for the acute treatment of intermittent, stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity (i.e., seizure clusters, acute repetitive seizures) in patients twelve years of age and older was tentatively approved by the FDA in August 2022 and is currently subject to an orphan drug market exclusivity block until January 2027 based on an FDA approved nasal spray product of another company. The Company continues to engage with the FDA on Libervant’s approval for U.S. market access and remains committed to bringing Libervant to patients. Commercial CollaborationsAquestive continues to manufacture products for the licensing and supply collaborations that it has established. The Company manufactured approximately 45 million doses in the fourth quarter 2023, compared to approximately 37 million doses in the fourth quarter 2022. The Company continues to see consistent order demand for the manufacture of Indivior’s Suboxone® Sublingual Film product and continues to support its other global collaborations including the recent launch of Emilyf (Riluzole) Oral Film product by Zambon in Europe. Sales of royalty-based products, inclusive of Sympazan® (clobazam) Oral Film for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome in patients two years of age and older, and Azstarys® for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in patients six years of age and older continued to improve in the fourth quarter of 2023. Fourth Quarter 2023 FinancialsTotal revenues were $13.2 million in the fourth quarter 2023, compared to $10.7 million in the fourth quarter 2022, an increase of 24%. The increase was due to higher manufacture and supply revenues, and license and royalty revenues, offset by the discontinuance of proprietary product sales of Sympazan as a result of the outlicensing agreement with Assertio in October 2022. Manufacture and supply revenue increased by 23%, or $2.1 million, primarily due to increased manufacturing revenues of $3.2 million for Suboxone partially offset by decreases for Ondif® for Hypera in Brazil and for Sympazan. In addition, the Company recognized $1.0 million in milestone royalty revenue for Azstarys from Zevra Therapeutics. Aquestive’s net loss for the fourth quarter 2023 was $8.1 million, or $0.12 loss per share. The net loss for the fourth quarter 2022 was $12.4 million, or $0.23 loss per share. The reduction in net loss was primarily driven by increases in revenue described above, decreases in selling, general and administrative expense, including severance costs and lower administrative costs in the commercial organization subsequent to the outlicensing of Sympazan, and a decrease in research and development cost and expenses, partially offset by increases by a one-time loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.0 million and higher interest expense related to the amortization of debt discount related to the 13.5% Notes payable. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss was $2.8 million in the fourth quarter 2023, compared to a $9.6 million loss in the fourth quarter 2022. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss excluding adjusted R&D expenses was $0.1 million in the fourth quarter 2023, compared to a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss excluding adjusted R&D expenses of $5.6 million in the fourth quarter 2022. Full Year 2023 FinancialsExcluding the impact of prior year proprietary sales of Sympazan, total revenues increased from $40.0 million for the full year 2022 to $50.6 million for the full year 2023, an increase of 26%. The increase was due to higher manufacture and supply revenues and license and royalty revenue offset by the discontinuance of proprietary product sales of Sympazan following the outlicensing of Sympazan. Total reported revenues were $50.6 million for the full year 2023, compared to $47.7 million for the full year 2022, an increase of 6%. Manufacture and supply revenue increased 20% due to increased manufacturing revenues of $4.4 million for Suboxone, increased revenues of $2.1 million for Ondif for Hypera subsequent to receiving foreign regulatory approval in February 2022, and increased revenues of $0.6 million for Sympazan. License and royalty revenue increased 129%, or $3.0 million, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. This increase was primarily due to $1.5 million in milestone licensing revenues for Azstarys from Zevra Therapeutics and increased licensing and royalty revenue of $1.3 million for Sympazan. The Company’s net loss for the full year 2023 was $7.9 million, or $0.13 loss per share. The net loss for the full year 2022 was $54.4 million, or $1.12 loss per share. The reduction in net loss was primarily driven by $14.5 million of other income which consisted of $6.0 million from an amendment to the Indivior Commercial Exploitation Agreement, and $8.5 million from the patent litigation settlement with BioDelivery Sciences International, increases in revenue described above, decrease in selling, general and administrative expense, including severance costs and significantly lower administrative costs in the commercial organization subsequent to the outlicensing of Sympazan, a decrease in research and development cost and expenses and lower interest expense related to the KYNMOBI® monetization transaction, partially offset by a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.4 million and higher interest expense related to the amortization of debt discount related to the 13.5% Notes payable. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss was $11.6 million in the full year 2023, compared to a loss of $35.3 million in the full year 2022. The year-over-year change in non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by the items described above. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA income excluding adjusted R&D expenses was $1.0 million in the full year 2023, compared to a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss excluding adjusted R&D expenses of $18.7 million in the full year 2022. As of December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents were $23.9 million. During the fourth quarter 2023, the Company accessed capital net proceeds of $3.7 million under its ""At-the-Market"" (ATM) facility. 2024 Outlook Aquestive is providing its full year 2024 financial outlook. The Company expects: GuidanceTotal revenue (in millions)$48 to $51Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss (in millions)$22 to $26 Revenue guidance does not include any revenue for Libervant.

For more information, visit Aquestive.com and follow us on LinkedIn. Non-GAAP Financial InformationThis press release and our webcast earnings call regarding our quarterly financial results contains financial measures that do not comply with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), such as non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss excluding adjusted R&D expenses, non-GAAP adjusted gross margins, non-GAAP adjusted costs and expenses and other adjusted expense measures, because such measures exclude, as applicable, share-based compensation expense, interest expense, interest expense related to the sale of future revenue, interest income, depreciation, amortization, and income taxes. Specifically, the Company adjusts net income (loss) for loss on the extinguishment of debt; certain non-cash expenses, including share-based compensation expenses; depreciation and amortization; and interest expense related to the sale of future revenue, interest income and other income (expense), net and income taxes, with a result of adjusted EBITDA loss. Similarly, manufacture and supply expense, research and development expense, and selling, general and administrative expense were adjusted for certain non-cash expenses of share-based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA loss and these non-GAAP expense categories are used as a supplement to the corresponding GAAP measures to provide additional insight regarding the Company’s ongoing operating performance. These measures supplement the Company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Aquestive management uses these measures to analyze its financial results, and its future manufacture and supply expenses, gross margins, research and development expense and selling, general and administrative expense and to help make managerial decisions. In management’s opinion, these non-GAAP measures provide added transparency into the operating performance of Aquestive and added insight into the effectiveness of our operating strategies and actions. The Company may provide one or more revenue measures adjusted for certain discrete items, such as fees collected on certain licensed products, in order to provide investors added insight into our revenue stream and breakdown, along with providing our GAAP revenue. Such measures are intended to supplement, not act as substitutes for, comparable GAAP measures and should not be read as a measure of liquidity for Aquestive. Adjusted EBITDA loss and the other non-GAAP measures are also likely calculated in a way that is not comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Non-GAAP Outlook In providing the outlook for non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP gross margin, we exclude certain items which are otherwise included in determining the comparable GAAP financial measures. In order to inform our outlook measures of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP gross margin, a description of the adjustments which have been applicable in determining non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP gross margin for these periods are reflected in the tables below. In providing outlook for non-GAAP gross margin, the Company adjusts for non-cash share-based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization. The Company is providing such outlook only on a non-GAAP basis because the Company is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the totality or ultimate outcome or occurrence of these adjustments for the forward-looking period such as share-based compensation expense, income tax, amortization, and certain other adjusted items, which can be dependent on future events that may not be reliably predicted. Based on past reported results, where one or more of these items have been applicable, such excluded items could be material, individually or in the aggregate, to reported results.

Financial Analyst The release of Rogers Communications Inc.'s audited annual consolidated financial statements and management's discussion and analysis (MD&A) is a crucial piece of information for stakeholders. The MD&A offers a detailed examination of the financial results, providing context and management's perspective on the year's performance, including explanations of variances and underlying business drivers. This document is instrumental for investors as it provides insights into the company's operational results, financial condition and future prospects.From a financial analysis standpoint, the inclusion of the sustainability and social impact report within the annual report is a noteworthy development. It signifies an increasing trend among corporations to integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into their core business strategy. This may influence investors who prioritize ESG considerations in their investment decisions, potentially impacting the company's stock valuation.Long-term implications include the potential for improved risk management and corporate reputation, as companies that effectively implement ESG practices may be better positioned to mitigate risks and capitalize on new market opportunities. However, investors should also be aware of the costs associated with these initiatives and assess whether they align with the company's overall strategic objectives and contribute to shareholder value. Market Research Analyst Analyzing the impact of Rogers Communications Inc.'s annual report on the stock market requires understanding the investor sentiment and market expectations prior to the release. The stock market's reaction to the report can be influenced by factors such as whether the financial results met, exceeded, or fell short of analyst expectations. Additionally, the market will consider the company's forward-looking statements and guidance for the upcoming year, as these can indicate the management's confidence in the company's growth trajectory and potential headwinds or tailwinds.It is also important to consider the competitive landscape within the telecommunications industry. Rogers' performance should be evaluated in the context of its peers, as relative performance can shift market share and investor preference. Any significant deviations from industry norms, particularly in key performance indicators like subscriber growth, average revenue per user (ARPU) and capital expenditures, could lead to stock price volatility.Lastly, the market will likely scrutinize the sustainability and social impact report for insights into how Rogers is addressing industry-specific challenges such as digital inclusion, privacy and cybersecurity. These issues are increasingly important to consumers and regulators and thus, have a growing impact on business strategy and investor perceptions. 03/05/2024 - 07:45 PM Includes Annual Financial Statements, MD&A and 2023 Sustainability and Social Impact ReportTORONTO, March 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rogers Communications Inc.

Rithm Capital Corp. Announces Pricing of Offering of Senior Unsecured Notes,2024-03-05T22:15:00.000Z,Low,Negative,"Rithm Capital Corp. (NYSE: RITM) announces the pricing of $775 million senior unsecured notes due 2029 to reduce indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. The offering will close on March 19, 2024, targeting qualified institutional buyers in the U.S. and international buyers under Regulation S.","Rithm Capital Corp. Announces Pricing of Offering of Senior Unsecured Notes Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Rithm Capital Corp. (NYSE: RITM) announces the pricing of $775 million senior unsecured notes due 2029 to reduce indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. The offering will close on March 19, 2024, targeting qualified institutional buyers in the U.S. and international buyers under Regulation S. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The pricing of Rithm Capital Corp's $775 million senior unsecured notes at 8.000% is a significant financial move that warrants a detailed analysis. The interest rate, set at 8.000%, is notably higher than the 6.250% of the notes due in 2025, which the company is looking to repurchase. This indicates a possible increase in borrowing costs for Rithm, potentially reflecting a higher risk perception among investors or a general rise in market interest rates.From a financial perspective, the use of proceeds to reduce indebtedness is a prudent strategy, particularly when addressing higher-interest debt. However, the decision to issue new debt at a higher rate to pay off older debt might suggest a refinancing risk or a strategic move to extend debt maturities. Investors and analysts should examine the company's leverage ratios and interest coverage metrics post-transaction to assess the impact on financial health.Moreover, the lack of registration rights implies that the notes are subject to liquidity constraints, which might affect their marketability. This could be a downside for investors looking for more liquid investment options. The closing of the offering by March 19, 2024 and the restriction on sales to qualified institutional buyers and non-U.S. persons under Rule 144A and Regulation S signify a targeted investment audience, which may limit the potential buyer pool. Market Research Analyst The corporate bond market where Rithm Capital Corp. is making its offering is influenced by various macroeconomic factors. The 8.000% interest rate on these senior unsecured notes is indicative of the current credit market conditions. Analysts should compare this rate with the prevailing rates for similar maturities and credit ratings to determine if Rithm is paying a premium or if the rate is in line with market trends.Furthermore, the decision to issue notes without registration rights suggests that Rithm is leveraging the private placement market. This move can be advantageous for companies seeking to raise capital more quickly and with fewer disclosure requirements than public offerings. However, it's important to consider the broader market implications, such as investor appetite for private placements and the potential impact on Rithm's liquidity and capital structure.Investors should also assess the overall corporate bond market's health, particularly in the context of economic cycles, interest rate forecasts and inflationary pressures. These factors can significantly influence the demand for and pricing of corporate debt offerings like the one Rithm is conducting. 03/05/2024 - 05:15 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Rithm Capital Corp. (NYSE: RITM; “Rithm” or the “Company”) announced today that it has priced its previously announced offering of $775 million aggregate principal amount of 8.000% senior unsecured notes due 2029 (the “notes”). The Company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering for the reduction of indebtedness, including in connection with the Company’s tender offer for up to $275 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.250% senior unsecured notes due 2025, with the remainder of the net proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes. The notes will not have any registration rights. The offering is expected to close on March 19, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. The notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), any state securities laws or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration.

Financial Analyst The declaration of a quarterly cash dividend by Allient Inc. is a tangible return to shareholders, indicating the company's current cash flow allows for capital distribution. Dividends are generally seen as a sign of a company's financial health and stability and they can affect the stock's attractiveness to income-focused investors. This move could potentially signal confidence from the Board in the company's ongoing profitability and financial management.However, the size of the dividend, $0.03 per share, is relatively modest and must be evaluated in the context of the company's payout ratio, yield and historical dividend patterns. Investors will also consider the dividend in relation to the company's earnings, capital expenditure requirements and future growth opportunities to assess whether the capital return strategy aligns with long-term value creation.

Dividend announcements can lead to short-term price fluctuations as investors adjust their positions based on the new information. In some cases, a dividend announcement can be interpreted as a positive signal about the company's market position and strategic direction, especially within the Motion, Controls and Power products sector, where consistent performance is key.It is crucial to analyze industry benchmarks to understand how Allient's dividend compares to its peers. A lower or higher dividend yield can impact investor perception, potentially making the stock more or less attractive compared to competitors.

The offering is managed by Citizens JMP Securities, LLC, StoneX Financial Inc., FHN Financial Securities Corp., Wedbush Securities Inc., and TCBI Securities, Inc. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The upsizing and pricing of CoreCivic's senior notes offering from $450 million to $500 million at an interest rate of 8.25% signifies a strategic capital restructuring. This move likely reflects the company's intent to manage its debt profile by refinancing the existing 2026 Notes, which could potentially lead to a reduction in interest expenses and an extension of debt maturities. The high interest rate might indicate the market's view of the risk associated with the company's credit profile. Investors should consider the implications of this debt issuance on the company's leverage and interest coverage ratios, which are critical indicators of financial health. Debt Market Analyst CoreCivic's decision to guarantee the newly issued notes on a senior unsecured basis by its subsidiaries, which also guarantee existing senior secured credit facilities, is a noteworthy development. This structure provides a degree of protection for investors and indicates the company's confidence in its operational cash flow to meet obligations. However, the guarantee does not elevate the notes to a secured status, which would typically offer greater reassurance to debt holders. The tender offer for the 2026 Notes, combined with the redemption strategy, suggests an active approach to liability management, aiming to streamline the company's debt profile ahead of maturity. Market Research Analyst Understanding the broader context of CoreCivic's business model, which involves the ownership and management of privatized correctional and detention facilities, is essential for evaluating the potential risk factors associated with this debt issuance. The industry faces unique regulatory and public policy challenges that could impact the company's future earnings and cash flow stability. These factors, combined with the current interest rate environment, can influence investor perception and the demand for the notes. It's important for stakeholders to assess how these dynamics may affect the company's financial performance and its ability to fulfill debt obligations. 03/05/2024 - 06:12 PM BRENTWOOD, Tenn., March 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CoreCivic, Inc.

(Nasdaq: VWE) provides an update on streamlining its business model, focusing on branded Super Premium+ wine and cider across wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels. The company is making progress on monetizing non-core production services to reduce debt. The leadership is aligned with lenders on a turnaround plan, with a forbearance agreement in place. Vintage Wine Estates plans to report its second quarter fiscal 2024 results on March 12, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst To assess the financial implications of Vintage Wine Estates' restructuring efforts, it is crucial to consider the impact of the divestment of high-cost operations on the company's profitability. The strategic shift towards a more focused business model, centered on Super Premium+ wine and cider, aims to improve the company's financial profile by reducing operating expenses and enhancing cash generation. The anticipated sale of non-core assets with unfavorable cost structures is expected to lower debt and increase liquidity, which could lead to a more streamlined and efficient operation.Furthermore, the involvement of Oppenheimer & Co. in facilitating asset sales and the reported interest exceeding expectations suggest a favorable market response to the company's assets. The non-binding letter of intent and attractive bids indicate potential for successful transactions that could provide the necessary capital to meet the company's financial objectives. However, the true measure of success will depend on the final terms of the sales and their alignment with the company's valuation and return expectations. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Vintage Wine Estates' pivot towards a branded Super Premium+ wine and cider business model could signify an attempt to capture higher-margin segments of the market. This move may be driven by consumer trends favoring premium products and unique brand experiences. By concentrating on direct-to-consumer channels, VWE could potentially build stronger customer relationships and brand loyalty, which are critical in the competitive wine industry.It is also important to note the potential market share gains and margin expansion that could arise from this strategic realignment. If executed effectively, VWE's approach to focus on differentiated brands could resonate with consumers, leading to increased demand and a stronger competitive position within the industry. However, this will require careful brand management and marketing strategies to ensure that the new focus does not alienate existing customers while attracting new ones. Legal Expert The forbearance agreement with lenders is a significant aspect of Vintage Wine Estates' financial restructuring. This agreement indicates the lenders' willingness to work with the company through its transformation, providing a temporary reprieve from debt obligations. The terms of the forbearance agreement, which delay the exercise of lenders' rights and remedies until a specified date or the occurrence of another event of default, afford VWE crucial time to amend its credit agreement and execute its asset sale plan.It is imperative for investors to understand the legal implications of such an agreement, as it reflects both the current financial distress of the company and the confidence of the lenders in its turnaround strategy. The successful renegotiation of the credit agreement could be a pivotal factor in the company's ability to stabilize its operations and pursue its targeted business model. However, the consequences of failing to meet the conditions of the forbearance agreement could result in accelerated debt obligations and potential litigation, which would have a substantial negative impact on the company's financial stability and stock performance. 03/05/2024 - 04:15 PM Leadership accelerating efforts to streamline business model with focus on branded Super Premium+ wine and cider across wholesale and direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) channels Measurable progress on monetization of non-core production services and stand-alone DTC platforms to support debt reduction Lenders aligned on turnaround and restructuring plan; forbearance agreement provides time for amendment discussions Planning to report second quarter fiscal 2024 results on March 12, 2024 SANTA ROSA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Vintage Wine Estates, Inc. (Nasdaq: VWE and VWEWW) (“VWE” or the “Company”), one of the top wine producers in the U.S., today provided an update on the business to include its progress with restructuring and asset sales, discussions with its lenders and financial reporting timing expectations. Streamlined business offers commercial/operational focus and improved financial profile, supported by divestment of high-cost operations Seth Kaufman, President and CEO of Vintage Wine Estates, commented, “To reposition VWE as an omnichannel wine and cider company that offers the highest quality Super Premium+ products in the U.S., we are aggressively advancing on our top priorities to: improve profitability and build a strong go-to-market capability that supports differentiated brands, sell non-core assets to measurably reduce debt, and optimize operations to improve cash generation. We are actively executing against our planned roadmap to engage potential acquirers for our stand-alone DTC and certain production services businesses, in addition to other assets. This will generate needed focus and allow us to strategically deploy our resources to support a unique branded wine and cider business which we believe can offer accelerated top-line growth, gains in market share, expanded margins, and improved cash generation. We anticipate that selling these non-core assets with unfavorable cost structures will materially reduce operating expenses and help transform VWE into a much smaller, but more profitable business, that can consistently generate cash. And, perhaps most importantly, these actions can allow us to return our focus to developing and scaling unique brands that delight consumers with highly-rated wines and ciders.” Sale of assets update The Company retained Oppenheimer & Co. in January 2024 to aggressively pursue the sale of several assets and to date has received numerous attractive bids as well as a non-binding letter of intent. The Company believes it is well positioned to close certain of these transactions over the next few months. There is also an ongoing evaluation of interest in other assets, which could be opportunistically sold if offers exceed valuation and return hurdles. Mr. Kaufmann noted, “The level of interest in our non-core businesses and other assets has exceeded our expectations in terms of the quantity and quality of discussions. We remain optimistic in our ability to monetize these assets, which will allow us to pay down debt and increase liquidity.” Forbearance agreement with lenders The Company also announced that its plans to reorganize and dispose of certain assets through sales were accepted by its lender group. The lender group subsequently provided an agreement to forbear exercising their rights and remedies under the Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement as amended on October 12, 2023 (the “Second A&R Loan and Security Agreement”), in respect of, or arising out of, certain defaults under the Second A&R Loan and Security Agreement until the earlier of March 31, 2024 or in the event of any other event of default other than those designated in the agreement. The Second A&R Loan and Security Agreement currently has principal amounts outstanding of $324.3 million as of February 29, 2024. The forbearance agreement provides flexibility for the Company to continue executing the previously announced restructuring and transformation while working with its lenders on an amended credit agreement. Kristina L. Johnston, Chief Financial Officer of VWE, commented, “Our lenders remain fully engaged with us and we appreciate the progress we are making with discussions to further amend our credit agreement to reflect our current business operations as we execute our restructuring roadmap and advance asset sales.” The Company will provide an update when further disclosure is required or otherwise appropriate. Second quarter fiscal 2024 financial results timing As previously announced, the Company has not yet filed its financial results for the period ended December 31, 2023. It expects to report these results and file its Form 10-Q on March 12, 2024. About Vintage Wine Estates, Inc.

Marathon Digital Holdings Announces Bitcoin Production and Mining Operation Updates for February 2024,2024-03-05T22:23:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. (MARA) reported a 9% increase in energized hash rate to 28.7 EH/s and a rise in BTC holdings to 16,930 BTC, with total cash and BTC of $1.5B as of February 29, 2024.

(MARA) reported a 9% increase in energized hash rate to 28.7 EH/s and a rise in BTC holdings to 16,930 BTC, with total cash and BTC of $1.5B as of February 29, 2024. Despite operational challenges affecting bitcoin production, the company remains focused on strengthening its balance sheet and launching new tools and services for the Bitcoin ecosystem. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent operational update from Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. provides significant insights into the company's financial health and operational efficiency. The increase in total cash and BTC holdings to $1.5 billion is a robust indicator of the company's liquidity and asset accumulation strategy. This financial buffer could potentially provide resilience against market volatility and facilitate strategic investments or acquisitions, particularly as the industry prepares for the next Bitcoin network halving. The sale of 290 BTC suggests a proactive treasury management approach, aiming to balance asset appreciation with operational cash flow needs.Marathon's adoption of the FASB's new accounting standard for crypto assets, ASU 2023-08, reflects a forward-looking compliance posture and may enhance the transparency of its financial reporting, potentially affecting investor perception and stock valuation. The increase in unrestricted cash by 33% year-over-year is a positive signal for investors, indicating a solid financial position and the ability to weather operational challenges. Market Research Analyst Marathon's operational challenges, including unplanned outages at key sites, have resulted in a reduction of the operational hash rate and a 23% decrease in Bitcoin production from the previous month. This dip, however, is contrasted by a significant year-over-year increase in bitcoin production, showcasing the company's growth trajectory. The operational hash rate issues highlight the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency mining operations, such as reliance on physical infrastructure and the impact of maintenance or technical difficulties.Despite these challenges, Marathon's strategic focus on launching new tools and services like Slipstream and Anduro illustrates an effort to diversify and innovate within the Bitcoin ecosystem. This could enhance the company's competitive edge and create additional revenue streams. The company's role in converting energy into economic value is central to its value proposition, especially in the context of the broader discussion on the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining. Cryptocurrency Analyst The update on Marathon's energized hash rate increasing by 9% to 28.7 EH/s is a crucial metric for understanding the company's mining capacity and potential revenue generation from Bitcoin mining. The hash rate is a measure of the computational power per second used when mining and an increase in this rate generally correlates with a higher probability of earning Bitcoin rewards.The operational highlights reveal a strategic emphasis on scaling operations, as evidenced by the year-over-year growth in energized hash rate and installed hash rate. However, the average operational hash rate's decline indicates that not all installed capacity is being utilized effectively, which could point to inefficiencies or ongoing maintenance issues. The share of available miner rewards and the number of blocks won are critical for assessing Marathon's performance within the competitive mining landscape and its ability to capitalize on its increased hash rate. 03/05/2024 - 05:23 PM - Increased Energized Hash Rate 9% M/M to 28.7 EH/s - Increased BTC Holdings to 16,930 BTC; Total Cash and BTC of $1.5B as of February 29, 2024 Fort Lauderdale, FL, March 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MARA) (""Marathon"" or ""Company""), a leader in supporting and securing the Bitcoin ecosystem, today published unaudited bitcoin (“BTC”) production and miner installation updates for February 2024. Management Commentary“The operational challenges that commenced in January, continued into February and reduced our operational hash rate and our bitcoin production for the month,” said Fred Thiel, Marathon’s chairman and CEO. “The Garden City and Ellendale sites, which are operated by Applied Digital and collectively represent approximately 43% of our energized hash rate, experienced unplanned outages due to transformer and transmission line maintenance. Last week, Garden City was re-energized and Ellendale was nearly back to full strength. However, while Garden City is now fully operational, infrastructure issues at Ellendale are still being resolved as capacity at that site is being ramped up. ""Largely due to these maintenance issues, we operated at an average of 61% of our total energized capacity in February. As a result, we produced 833 bitcoin last month. Our team is actively working with our hosting providers to bring sites back to full strength and to make the necessary repairs to mitigate these issues in the future. We will continue to provide updates on our progress as they materialize. While we work through these issues, we increased our hash rate another 9% to 28.7 exahash. ""We have also continued to strengthen our balance sheet by increasing our bitcoin holdings to 16,930 BTC and bringing our combined cash and bitcoin to approximately $1.5 billion. As we look to capitalize on strategic opportunities, we have also begun launching new tools and services for those who are building the future of Bitcoin, including Slipstream and Anduro. While both are in early stages, we are confident that these innovations and others, which we expect to announce later this year, will help differentiate Marathon and add to our our position as a leader in converting energy into economic value.""

Financial Analyst A critical aspect of One Liberty Properties' report is their high occupancy rate at 98.8%, which is indicative of strong property demand and management efficiency. This level of occupancy is typically associated with stable revenue streams and can be a positive signal to investors about the company's operational health.Moreover, the repayment of $21.8 million in credit facility debt signifies a strategic move towards deleveraging, which can improve the company's debt-to-equity ratio and potentially result in lower interest expenses in future periods. This is a prudent step, especially in an environment where interest rates may fluctuate, impacting debt servicing costs.The declaration of the 125th consecutive quarterly dividend demonstrates a commitment to returning value to shareholders and may be seen as a sign of financial stability. However, investors should consider the sustainability of such dividends, especially in the context of the company's overall financial strategy and market conditions.The share repurchase program, where $9.6 million of shares were bought back, may indicate management's confidence in the intrinsic value of the company. Share repurchases can lead to an increase in earnings per share over time, as they reduce the number of shares outstanding. Real Estate Market Analyst The gain on sale of real estate for the fourth quarter and the full year reflects a strategic disposition of assets, which resulted in significant income recognition. This gain is a testament to the company's ability to capitalize on their property investments and can be a positive indicator of management's expertise in timing and executing property sales.However, the decrease in rental income year-over-year may warrant attention. While some of this decrease can be attributed to non-recurring items such as the Beachwood Settlement, it is essential to analyze whether this trend is due to asset dispositions or other underlying factors that could affect future revenue streams.Furthermore, the acquisition of an industrial property and the anticipated rental income from it is a strategic move, aligning with the company's focus on net leased industrial properties. Industrial real estate has been a robust sector and the company's investment could capitalize on the growing e-commerce and logistics demand. Accounting Expert Analyzing the non-GAAP financial measures such as FFO and AFFO is crucial for understanding the company's operating performance. These measures adjust for non-cash items and are widely used in the real estate industry to provide a clearer view of operating performance and cash flows from the property portfolio.While FFO saw a decrease, primarily due to non-recurring items from the previous year, AFFO saw slight growth, which may be more indicative of the company's operational cash flow trends. It is important to note that these metrics should be used in conjunction with GAAP measures to get a comprehensive view of the company's financial health.The increase in operating expenses across several categories, including depreciation, amortization and general and administrative expenses, could be a concern if these trends continue, as they could impact net income and cash flow margins. 03/05/2024 - 04:15 PM – Occupancy at 98.8% – – Paid-Off $21.8 Million of Credit Facility Debt – – Declared 125th Consecutive Quarterly Dividend – – Repurchased $9.6 Million of Shares in 2023 – GREAT NECK, N.Y., March 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- One Liberty Properties, Inc.

The change was due primarily to a $259,000 increase in interest expense, a net $234,000 decrease in equity in earnings from the Manahawkin, NJ multi-tenant shopping center, and a $108,000 loss from the sale of the Manahawkin property. Gain-on-sale of real estate Gain on sale of real estate was $12.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. There was no comparable gain in the corresponding period of the prior year. Net income, FFO1 and AFFO Net income attributable to One Liberty in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $15.0 million, or $0.71 per diluted share, compared to net income in the corresponding period of the prior year of $8.9 million, or $0.42 per diluted share. The increase is due primarily to the gain-on-sale of real estate of $12 million from the sale of eight properties, including an out-parcel. Net income from the corresponding period in 2022 includes $4.6 million of rental income from the Beachwood Settlement. Funds from Operations, or FFO, was $9.6 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to $15.1 million, or $0.71 per diluted share, in the corresponding quarter of 2022. The change is due primarily to the inclusion, in the quarter ended December 31, 2022, of $4.6 million from the Beachwood Settlement. Adjusted Funds from Operations, or AFFO, was $10.6 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to $11.0 million, or $0.52 per diluted share in the corresponding quarter of the prior year. The change is due primarily to the decrease in equity in earnings from the Manahawkin property and the increase in interest expense. Full Year 2023 Operating Results: Revenues and Operating Expenses Rental income in 2023 was $90.6 million compared to $92.2 million in 2022. The change is due primarily to the inclusion, in 2022, of $4.6 million from the Beachwood Settlement. Acquisitions and dispositions in 2022 and 2023 contributed, on a net basis, approximately $1.8 million to 2023 rental income. Total operating expenses in 2023 were $57.3 million compared to $54.8 million in 2022. The change is due to net increases of $1.0 million of depreciation and amortization expenses, $936,000 of real estate expenses, and $564,000 of general and administrative expenses. Gain on sale of real estate In 2023, net gain on sale of real estate was $17.0 million from the sale of 10 properties and an out-parcel, compared to a net gain on the sale of real estate in 2022 of $16.8 million from the sale of seven properties. Other income and expenses Other income and expenses for 2023 were a net expense of $20.4 million compared to a net expense of $11.9 million in 2022. The change is due primarily to the inclusion, in 2022, of an aggregate of $6.3 million from insurance recoveries and a litigation settlement related to a property the Company owned in Round Rock, Texas, and in 2023, a $1.2 million increase in interest expense and the Company’s $850,000 joint venture share of the non-cash impairment charge at the Manahawkin property. Net income, FFO and AFFO Net income attributable to One Liberty in 2023 was $29.6 million, or $1.38 per diluted share, compared to $42.2 million, or $1.99 per diluted share, in 2022. FFO for 2023 was $39.0 million, or $1.82 per diluted share, compared to 2022 FFO of $49.7 million, or $2.34 per diluted share. The change was due primarily to the inclusion, in 2022, of an aggregate of $10.9 million from litigation settlements and insurance recovery and a $1.2 million increase in interest expense in 2023, offset by a $3.1 million increase in rental income in 2023. AFFO for 2023 was $42.6 million or $1.99 per diluted share compared to $42.1 million, or $1.98 per diluted share in the prior year. The growth in AFFO is due to the factors impacting FFO as described immediately above, excluding the litigation settlements and insurance recovery. Acquisitions and Dispositions in 2023: The Company acquired one industrial property for $13.4 million, from which the Company expects to recognize approximately $951,000 of rental income in 2024, excluding tenant reimbursements. This property contributed $611,000 of rental income in 2023 because it was only owned for a portion of the year. The Company sold seven restaurant properties, three retail properties, and an out-parcel, for a net gain of $17.0 million. The properties sold accounted for $2.5 million and $3.0 million of rental income in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Balance Sheet: At December 31, 2023, the Company had $26.4 million of cash and cash equivalents, total assets of $761.6 million, total debt of $418.3 million, and total stockholders’ equity of $306.7 million. During 2023, the Company used the net proceeds of its property sales to pay-off $21.8 million of credit facility debt. Moving forward, this should lower interest expense while adding financial capacity to acquire properties. At March 1, 2024, One Liberty’s available liquidity was $123.9 million, including $23.9 million of cash and cash equivalents (including the credit facility’s required $3.0 million deposit maintenance balance) and up to $100 million available under its credit facility. Share Repurchase and Dividends: During 2023, approximately 499,000 shares of common stock were repurchased for approximately $9.6 million, at an average cost per share of approximately $19.24. On March 4, 2024, the Board of Directors declared the Company’s 125th consecutive quarterly dividend. The $0.45 per share cash dividend is payable April 4, 2024, to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 27, 2024. Subsequent Events: The Company entered into a contract to sell for $2.9 million a pad site at a multi-tenant retail shopping center in Lakewood, Colorado, which it owns through a consolidated joint venture. The sale is anticipated to close during the quarter ending March 31, 2024. The Company anticipates recognizing its approximate $1.6 million share of the gain on this sale during the three months ending March 31, 2024. Non-GAAP Financial Measures: One Liberty computes FFO in accordance with the “White Paper on Funds from Operations” issued by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) and NAREIT’s related guidance. FFO is defined in the White Paper as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities where the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. One Liberty computes AFFO by adjusting from FFO for straight-line rent accruals and amortization of lease intangibles, deducting income from additional rent from ground lease tenant, income on settlement of litigation, income on insurance recoveries from casualties, lease termination and assignment fees, and adding back amortization of restricted stock and restricted stock unit compensation expense, amortization of costs in connection with its financing activities (including its share of its unconsolidated joint ventures), debt prepayment costs and amortization of lease incentives and mortgage intangible assets. Since the NAREIT White Paper does not provide guidelines for computing AFFO, the computation of AFFO varies from one REIT to another. One Liberty believes that FFO and AFFO are useful and standard supplemental measures of the operating performance for equity REITs and are used frequently by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating equity REITs, many of which present FFO and AFFO when reporting their operating results. FFO and AFFO are intended to exclude GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminish predictability over time. In fact, real estate values have historically risen and fallen with market conditions. As a result, management believes that FFO and AFFO provide a performance measure that when compared year-over-year, should reflect the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, interest costs and other matters without the inclusion of depreciation and amortization, providing a perspective that may not be necessarily apparent from net income. Management also considers FFO and AFFO to be useful in evaluating potential property acquisitions. FFO and AFFO do not represent net income or cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as defined by GAAP. FFO and AFFO should not be considered an alternative to net income as a reliable measure of our operating performance nor as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as measures of liquidity. FFO and AFFO do not measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all of the Company’s cash needs, including principal amortization, capital improvements and distributions to stockholders. Management recognizes that there are limitations in the use of FFO and AFFO. In evaluating the Company’s performance, management is careful to examine GAAP measures such as net income and cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.

(""Cboe BZX"") notifying the Company that its common stock did not maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 over 30 consecutive business days as required by Cboe BZX Listing Rule 14.9(e)(1)(B) (the ""Minimum Bid Price Requirement""). The receipt of the Cboe notification letter does not result in the immediate delisting of the Company's common stock from the Cboe BZX and has no current immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company's common stock on the Cboe BZX Exchange, under symbol ""SING."" This determination starts a 180-day period ending on August 26, 2024, for the Company to comply with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. If at any time before August 26, 2024, the closing bid price of the Company's Common Stock is at least $1.00 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, unless the Cboe BZX exercises its discretion to extend this 10 day period, the Company will be deemed to have regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, following which, Cboe BZX will provide a written confirmation of compliance and the matter will be closed. In the event that the Company does not regain compliance by August 26, 2024, the Company may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar day grace period provided that it meets the applicable market value of publicly held shares required for continued listing and other applicable standards for initial listing of its common stock on the Cboe BZX (other than the Minimum Bid Price Requirement). To be eligible, the Company will also need to provide a written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during this second compliance period. If the Company does not regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement during the second 180 calendar day grace period, and is ineligible for an additional grace period, Cboe BZX will provide written notice that the common stock of the Company is subject to delisting from the Cboe BZX Exchange. In that event, the Company may appeal the determination to a Cboe BZX hearings panel. ""We are and have been taking decisive action to address this and improve our stock price. With a current market cap of approximately $2 million against revenues of over $25 million, we firmly believe the company is significantly undervalued. At a simple 0.4 revenue multiplier, we believe we would be achieving compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, and surpassing a stock price of a dollar is not only attainable, but a testament to the underlying value and opportunity we believe SinglePoint presents to its current and future shareholders,"" commented Wil Ralston CEO, SinglePoint. ""Our recent successes and planned profitability achievements are set to address the current market cap issues head-on,"" Ralston added.

Financial Analyst flyExclusive's recent transaction with EnTrust Global, involving the sale of Series A Non-Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock, represents a strategic capital infusion aimed at bolstering the company's working capital and supporting its aircraft acquisition strategy. The complexity of the financial instrument used here indicates a tailored approach to financing that aligns with the company's growth objectives while offering the investor a structured return profile.The escalating dividend structure, starting at 10% and potentially reaching 16% per annum, suggests a high cost of capital, which could reflect the risk profile associated with the private aviation industry or flyExclusive's specific business model. The capital raised could enable flyExclusive to expand its fractional ownership program, potentially increasing market share and enhancing customer service reliability. However, it's crucial to monitor the company's ability to meet these dividend obligations, as they represent a significant financial commitment.Additionally, the issuance of a warrant to the investor provides a potential future equity stake, which could dilute existing shareholders but also aligns investor interests with the long-term performance of the company. The exercise price of $0.01 per share is nominal, indicating a strong incentive for the investor to capitalize on the warrant if the company's stock performs well. Market Research Analyst The private jet charter industry is marked by high capital expenditure and sensitivity to economic cycles. flyExclusive's move to expand its fleet through this capital raise is indicative of an aggressive growth strategy in a competitive market. The decision to issue preferred stock rather than common equity or debt could be a strategic one, aimed at preserving shareholder value and avoiding the dilution of control.From a market perspective, the success of flyExclusive's expansion plans will depend on the demand for private aviation services, which is influenced by factors such as corporate travel budgets, economic conditions and consumer preferences. The fractional ownership model they aim to enhance is becoming increasingly popular as it provides access to private aviation without the full cost of ownership, which could be a significant growth driver for flyExclusive.The investor's consent rights and the structured redemption options provide a layer of protection and exit strategy, which is a prudent move in a market where liquidity can be a concern. These terms suggest a careful balance between investor security and company flexibility. Aviation Industry Expert The aviation sector requires substantial investment for fleet expansion and operational scalability. flyExclusive's strategy to become a vertically integrated private aviation company is ambitious, as it involves controlling all aspects of the service from aircraft acquisition to customer experience. This integration could lead to cost efficiencies and provide a competitive edge in the luxury travel market.However, the industry is also subject to stringent regulatory requirements and the impact of such a capital raise must be evaluated in the context of regulatory compliance and safety standards. The company's ability to deploy the capital effectively to meet these standards while expanding its fleet will be critical to its success.The high dividend rates on the preferred stock issued may also reflect the inherent risks of the aviation industry, such as fuel price volatility, maintenance costs and the impact of economic downturns on luxury travel demand. Investors and stakeholders should closely monitor how these funds are allocated to ensure that they contribute to sustainable growth rather than just short-term expansion. 03/05/2024 - 04:15 PM Capital to fund flyExclusive’s working capital, including aircraft acquisition plans KINSTON, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- flyExclusive, Inc.

The company reported no debt and $1.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2023. Despite challenges at Cobre Panama, the business is resilient and poised for growth with new mine projects. However, the company recognized significant impairment losses due to the production halt, impacting financial results. Positive Franco-Nevada reported a robust financial position with no debt and $1.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2023. The company's revenue in Q4 2023 decreased by 5.3% compared to Q4 2022, primarily due to lower gas, oil, and PGM prices. Impairment losses of $1,169.2 million were recognized for Cobre Panama due to the production halt and political environment, leading to a net loss of $982.5 million in Q4 2023. Franco-Nevada is pursuing legal avenues to protect its investment in Cobre Panama and estimates damages to be at least $5 billion. The company's 2024 guidance and 5-year outlook are based on assumptions of commodity prices and do not include revenue from potential acquisitions or additional contributions to the Royalty Acquisition Venture. Negative Significant impairment losses of $1,169.2 million for Cobre Panama impacted the company's financial results negatively. The production halt at Cobre Panama led to a net loss of $982.5 million in Q4 2023. Franco-Nevada's revenue in Q4 2023 decreased by 5.3% compared to Q4 2022, reflecting challenges in the precious metal market. Financial Analyst The reported impairment loss of $1.173 billion by the company, primarily due to the production halt at Cobre Panama, is a significant financial event that merits a detailed analysis. The impairment reflects a sizable reduction in the asset's recoverable amount, suggesting a substantial change in the company's valuation of its investment. This event is likely to influence investor sentiment and could impact the company's stock price. The full impairment indicates a conservative approach to the asset's valuation, potentially mitigating future risk of additional write-downs.Furthermore, the robust cash position, with $1.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents and no debt, provides the company with a strong balance sheet that could reassure investors about its financial health and ability to withstand adverse conditions. However, the net loss of $982.5 million for Q4 2023 is a stark contrast to the adjusted net income figures, which may require investors to delve deeper into the non-cash and one-time items affecting reported profitability. Legal Expert The legal proceedings initiated by the company under the Canada-Panama Free Trade Agreement signify a proactive approach to protect its investment, indicating a high stakes dispute given the preliminary estimate of damages at $5 billion. The outcome of these proceedings will be critical in determining the future recoverability of the Cobre Panama asset. Investors should closely monitor developments, as a favorable legal outcome could lead to a significant reversal of the impairment loss, while an unfavorable one could cement the write-down.Presidential and legislative elections in Panama could also introduce political risk, as changes in administration may affect mining policies and negotiations. The company’s expressed preference for a resolution that benefits all stakeholders suggests a willingness to engage in dialogue, which may lead to a non-litigious resolution, potentially reducing legal costs and uncertainty. Market Research Analyst The company's diversified portfolio and the completion of new mines are positioned to drive growth, which is a positive indicator for future revenue streams. The focus on ESG and diversity, with leading ratings from Sustainalytics, MSCI and ISS ESG, could enhance the company's reputation and appeal to socially responsible investors. The 5-year growth outlook, driven by mine expansions and new mines, provides a forward-looking perspective that can help investors gauge the company's growth trajectory.The company's guidance for 2024 and beyond, based on assumptions about commodity prices, indicates a level of confidence in the market's direction. However, the volatile nature of commodity markets necessitates a cautious interpretation of these projections. The company's reliance on third-party forecasts and disclosures for its outlook further introduces a degree of uncertainty, as these are subject to change based on market conditions. 03/05/2024 - 05:16 PM Business Remains Robust Despite Production Halt at Cobre Panama (in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted) TORONTO, March 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - ""In late 2023, we were challenged by the unprecedented production halt at Cobre Panama. We are hopeful that the issues can be resolved, although we have taken a prudent approach for the carrying value of the asset"", stated Paul Brink, CEO. ""Despite the issue at Cobre Panama, our business remains robust and we continue to benefit from a long-duration, diversified portfolio. We finished the year with no debt and $1.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents.

Our growth outlook through 2028 is driven by numerous new mines and mine expansions. $2.4 billion of available capital positions us well for attractive acquisitions in an environment where many project developers are capital constrained.""

The decrease in our revenue is primarily attributed to lower gas, oil and PGM prices, partly offset by higher gold prices. Precious Metal revenue accounted for 78.7% of our revenue (65.5% gold, 10.3% silver, 2.9% PGM). Revenue was sourced 86.6% from the Americas (31.9% South America, 23.6% Central America & Mexico, 16.7% U.S. and 14.4% Canada). Cobre Panama Updates As previously disclosed, Cobre Panama has been in preservation and safe management (""P&SM"") with production halted since November 2023. On November 28, 2023, following protests and President Cortizo's call for a mining moratorium, the Supreme Court of Justice of Panama (the ""Supreme Court"") released its ruling declaring Law 406 unconstitutional. In light of these events, we carried out an impairment assessment of our Cobre Panama streams at December 31, 2023. We took a prudent approach in our judgement of the facts and circumstances, and based on the halting of production and the political environment surrounding the ruling by the Supreme Court, we determined the recoverable amount under applicable accounting standards to be nil as at December 31, 2023. As a result, we recognized a full impairment loss of $1,169.2 million. This impairment has been taken without prejudice to, or without at present attributing any specific value to, the legal remedies that may be obtained through any arbitration proceedings or otherwise. Presidential and national legislative elections are scheduled to take place in May 2024, with a new president, Government of Panama cabinet and National Assembly expected to assume office in July 2024. In the event that there is a change in the facts and circumstances surrounding the halting of production at Cobre Panama and there is a resumption of precious metal stream deliveries to Franco-Nevada, we will assess the recoverable amount of our Cobre Panama streams at that time, which may lead to a reversal of part or all of the impairment loss we have recognized. We are pursuing legal avenues to protect our investment in Cobre Panama. We have notified the Ministry of Commerce and Industries of Panama (""MICI"") of our intent to initiate arbitration pursuant to the Canada-Panama Free Trade Agreement. As announced to MICI, Franco-Nevada presently and preliminarily estimates its damages to be at least $5 billion, subject to further analysis and development. While we continue to pursue these legal remedies, we strongly prefer and hope for a resolution with the State of Panama that results in the best outcome for the Panamanian people and all parties involved. 2024 Guidance For both our 2024 guidance and 5-year outlook, when reflecting revenue from gold, silver, platinum, palladium, iron ore, oil and gas commodities to GEOs, we assumed the following prices: $1,950/oz Au, $22.50/oz Ag, $850/oz Pt, $900/oz Pd, $115/tonne Fe 62% CFR China, $75/bbl WTI oil and $2.50/mcf Henry Hub natural gas. In addition, we do not assume any other acquisitions and do not reflect any incremental revenue from additional contributions we may make to the Royalty Acquisition Venture with Continental as part of our remaining commitment of $69.8 million. The 2024 guidance and 5-year outlook are based on public forecasts and other disclosure by the third-party owners and operators of our assets and our assessment thereof. Please see our MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2023 for more details on our guidance and see ""Forward-Looking Statements"" below. We present our guidance in reference to GEO sales. For streams, our projected GEOs reflect GEOs we acquire from the operators of our assets and subsequently sell. Our GEO sales may differ from operators' production based on timing of deliveries, and are presented net of recovery and payability factors. We assume Cobre Panama will remain in P&SM through 2024 and have not included any contributions from the asset in our guidance. We expect an increase in GEO sales from the balance of our Precious Metal assets in 2024. The net increase reflects initial contributions from new mines including Tocantinzinho, Greenstone and Salares Norte. We are guiding towards lower GEOs from our Energy assets based on lower assumed oil and gas prices. 2024 guidance 2023 actual Cobre Panama GEO sales - 128,598 Precious Metal GEO sales (excluding Cobre Panama) 360,000 - 400,000 359,591 Total GEO sales (excluding Cobre Panama) 480,000 - 540,000 498,447 We estimate depletion expense to be between $230 and $260 million. Our remaining capital commitment to the Royalty Acquisition Venture with Continental is $69.8 million, of which between $10.0 million and $20.0 million is expected to be deployed in 2024. In addition, we expect to fulfill our $75.0 million term loan commitment to G Mining Ventures, of which approximately $42.0 million was advanced in January 2024. 5-Year Outlook We expect our portfolio to generate sales between 540,000 and 600,000 GEOs in 2028, of which 385,000 to 425,000 GEOs are expected to be generated from Precious Metal assets. This outlook assumes the commencement of production at Valentine Gold, Stibnite Gold, Eskay Creek, Castle Mountain Phase 2, and Copper World. It includes an expected increase in attributable sales from Vale's Northern and Southeastern systems, higher production from Guadalupe-Palmarejo and Antamina, and continued production from Sudbury through the end of 2028. Production growth from the continued development of our U.S. Energy assets is expected to be partly offset by lower assumed commodity prices when compared to 2023. The outlook anticipates that our Candelaria stream will step down in 2027 from 68% to 40% of gold and silver produced and that our deliveries from Antapaccay will be based on 30% of gold and silver produced rather than indexed to copper production in 2028. At this stage, our outlook does not assume any deliveries from Cobre Panama. Had Cobre Panama remained in production, we would have expected deliveries and sales of between 130,000 and 150,000 GEOs. Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Updates During the quarter, we partnered with G Mining Ventures at Tocantinzinho to help fund infrastructure and other community initiatives in Para, Brazil and with Endeavour Mining on their Great Green Wall reforestation initiative and 'Elites de Demain' educational assistance initiative, both in Senegal. We also renewed our funding support for the Enseña Perú education initiative in Peru. We continue to rank highly with leading ESG rating agencies. We were ranked by Sustainalytics as the #1 precious metals company and the #1 gold company for 2024 and we tied for the second ranked mining company in The Globe and Mail's 2023 Board Games. Portfolio Additions Financing package with Skeena Resources on the Eskay Creek Gold Project – British Columbia: On December 18, 2023, we acquired an incremental 1.0% NSR on Skeena Resources' Eskay Creek project for a purchase price of $41.8 million (C$56.0 million). We now hold a 2.5% NSR covering Skeena's Eskay Creek properties. Additionally, we advanced $18.7 million (C$25.0 million) to Skeena and received a convertible debenture.Acquisition of Additional Natural Gas Royalty in the Haynesville – U.S.: On November 21, 2023, we agreed to acquire a royalty portfolio in the Haynesville gas play in Louisiana and Texas for $125.0 million. The royalties are complementary to our existing Haynesville acreage and provide additional exposure to a diverse set of operators and a basin that is expected to help supply a growing LNG export capacity from the U.S. Gulf Coast. The transaction closed subsequent to year-end, on January 2, 2024.Acquisition of Additional Royalty on the Magino Gold Mine – Ontario: As previously announced, we acquired an additional 1.0% NSR on Argonaut's Magino gold mine for a purchase price of $28.0 million. The transaction closed on November 15, 2023. Inclusive of our initial 2.0% NSR, we now hold an aggregate 3.0% NSR on Magino.Funding of G Mining Ventures Term Loan: Subsequent to year-end, on January 29, 2024, we funded approximately $42.0 million under our term loan commitment to G Mining Ventures. The term loan is part of a financing package we provided to G Mining Ventures in July 2022 in connection with the Tocantinzinho gold project, in Brazil.Q4 2023 Portfolio Updates Precious Metal assets: GEOs sold from our Precious Metal assets were 119,581, compared to 129,642 GEOs in Q4 2022. Higher contributions from Antapaccay, MWS and Hemlo were more than offset by lower deliveries from Cobre Panama, Candelaria and Stillwater. South America: Candelaria (gold and silver stream) – GEOs delivered and sold in Q4 2023 were lower than in Q4 2022. For 2024, we forecast GEO sales of between 72,500 and 82,500 GEOs, an increase compared to 66,710 GEOs sold in 2023, based on higher expected production due to mine sequencing and the mine plan grade profile. Debottlenecking initiatives of the Candelaria plant pebble crushing circuit were also completed in 2023. Lundin Mining received an approval of its Environmental Impact Assessment, allowing the extension of Candelaria's mine life to 2040 and include various measures that will support sustainable social, economic, and environmental development in the Atacama Region.Antapaccay (gold and silver stream) – GEOs delivered and sold were higher in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022 due to higher grades. For 2024, we anticipate GEOs sold to decrease from 61,158 GEOs in 2023 to between 50,000 and 60,000 GEOs reflecting lower expected production based on the mining sequence.Antamina (22.5% silver stream) – GEOs delivered and sold were lower in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022. For 2024, we anticipate between 2.0 to 2.4 million silver ounces, consistent with silver ounces sold in 2023. We expect this to be equivalent to between 22,500 and 27,500 GEOs based on the commodity prices we assumed for 2024. Teck Resources announced that Antamina's Modification of Environmental Impact Assessment was approved in February 2024, allowing the extension of the Antamina mine life from 2028 to 2036.Tocantinzinho (gold stream) – G Mining Ventures reported the physical construction of the Tocantinzinho project was 76% complete as of the end of December 2023 and remains on track for commercial production in H2 2024.Salares Norte (1-2% royalties) – Gold Fields announced a delay in first gold production from December 2023 to April 2024, with production in 2024 now expected to be approximately 250,000 gold equivalent ounces. Once steady state production is reached, production is expected to increase to 580,000 gold equivalent ounces in 2025 and 600,000 gold equivalent ounces in 2026.Posse (Mara Rosa) (1% royalty) – Hochschild Mining announced that the first gold pour took place on February 20, 2024, with commercial production expected towards the end of Q2 2024. Mara Rosa is expected to produce between 83,000 to 93,000 gold ounces in 2024 and has reported average annual production of approximately 80,000 gold ounces over an initial mine life of 10 years, with approximately 100,000 gold ounces annually over the first four years.Cascabel (1% royalty) – In February 2024, SolGold announced the completion of a new pre-feasibility study, which outlined reduced initial capital costs and a 28-year mine plan containing 3.2 million tonnes of copper, 9.4 million ounces of gold, and 28 million ounces of silver (540 million tonnes grading 0.60% copper, 0.54 g/t gold, and 1.62 g/t silver).Pascua-Lama (2.9% gold & 0.6% copper royalties) – Barrick reported that it anticipates an updated Pascua preliminary economic assessment in 2024 to outline potential scope options. A closure environmental impact assessment for the existing site was submitted in January 2024 specifically regarding water management.Central America & Mexico: Cobre Panama (gold and silver stream) – GEOs delivered and sold were lower in Q4 2023 than in Q4 2022. During the quarter, Cobre Panama experienced illegal blockades at the Punta Rincón port and on the roads to the site. Production was halted at the end of November 2023 and the mine is currently on P&SM. At the request of MICI, First Quantum delivered a preliminary draft for the first phase of a formalized P&SM on January 16, 2024.Guadalupe-Palmarejo (50% gold stream) – GEOs sold from Guadalupe-Palmarejo decreased in Q4 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due to lower production at the mine. For 2024, we anticipate gold deliveries to remain relatively consistent with those received in 2023, ranging between 32,500 and 37,500 GEOs.U.S.: Stillwater (5% royalty) – PGM production improved over the course of 2023, as operations recovered from a shaft incident that occurred in Q1 2023. For 2024, we expect increased PGM production at the mine, offset by the impact of PGM prices. Sibanye-Stillwater also announced a restructuring at its US PGM operations in light of the lower palladium price environment.Marigold (0.5-5% royalties) – SSR Mining forecasts lower production in 2024 when compared to the record production achieved at Marigold in 2023. Further, we expect production to take place on ground that carries a lower royalty rate.Stibnite Gold (1.7% royalty) – Perpetua Resources announced that it was conditionally awarded up to $34.6 million in additional funding under the U.S. Defense Production Act. Perpetua anticipates that the U.S. Forest Service will publish a Final Environmental Impact Statement and Draft Record of Decision in Q2 2024 and a Final Record of Decision in Q4 2024.Copper World Project (2.085% royalty) – Hudbay provided an updated pre-feasibility study for the Copper World project in September 2023. The study outlined an extended 20-year mine life for Phase I, where only state and local permits are required, lower initial capital expenditures, and a higher mill feed grade than was previously contemplated.Canada: Detour Lake (2% royalty) – Agnico Eagle reported it now expects the mill to reach a throughput of 28.0 million tonnes per annum in Q2 2024, previously expected in 2025. Agnico Eagle also reported an initial underground inferred mineral resource totaling 1.56 million ounces of gold (21.8 million tonnes grading 2.23 g/t gold) and continues to evaluate the potential for underground mining, with continued exploration success outside of the mineral resources open pit. Mill optimization to reach 29.0 million tonnes per annum is expected in 2026, with an internal analysis for expansion expected in H1 2024 including potential underground mining scenarios.Hemlo (3% royalty & 50% NPI) – Barrick anticipates production at Hemlo to improve relative to 2023, where production was impacted by interruptions to the underground operations.Brucejack (1.2% royalty) – Newmont, which acquired Brucejack through its acquisition of Newcrest Mining in November 2023, anticipates an increase in production in 2024 compared to 2023, where operations were impacted by a fatality in December 2023.Macassa (Kirkland Lake) (1.5-5.5% royalty & 20% NPI) – Agnico Eagle reported that the Macassa mill is expected to reach full capacity of 1,650 tonnes per day by mid-2024. The AK deposit contributed approximately 160,000 ounces of gold in Mineral Reserves (0.74 million tonnes grading 6.69 g/t gold) to the Macassa complex, and was incorporated in Agnico Eagle's production guidance for 2024 to 2026 with production expected in H2 2024.Canadian Malartic (1.5% royalty) – Agnico Eagle reported that the planned mining rate of 3,500 tonnes per day at Odyssey South was reached earlier than anticipated and that ramp development also exceeded target. Agnico Eagle also declared an initial mineral reserve in the central portion of the East Gouldie deposit of 5.17 million ounces of gold (47.0 million tonnes grading 3.42 g/t gold).Greenstone (3% royalty) – Equinox Gold reported that construction at Greenstone was on schedule with installation activities effectively completed at December 31, 2023 and commissioning underway to pour first gold in H1 2024. On a 100% basis, Greenstone is expected to produce between approximately 175,000 and 208,000 gold ounces in 2024 and average annual production of approximately 400,000 gold ounces over an initial mine life of 14 years.Magino (3% royalty) – Argonaut anticipates 2024 production guidance at Magino to be between 120,000 and 130,000 gold equivalent ounces, reflecting a full first year of production since achieving commercial production in November 2023. An updated NI 43-101 technical report is expected in H2 2024.Valentine Gold (3% royalty) – Production at Valentine Gold continues to be anticipated in H1 2025. The project is now owned by Calibre Mining, which acquired Marathon Gold in January 2024. Average annual production of approximately 195,000 gold ounces is expected, over an initial mine life of 12 years.Eskay Creek (2.5% royalty) – Skeena Resources filed an updated feasibility study outlining Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves for open-pit mining of 3.3 million ounces of gold and 88.0 million ounces of silver (39.8 million tonnes grading 2.6 g/t gold and 68.7 g/t silver).Rest of World: MWS (25% stream) – We forecast MWS to deliver slightly fewer GEOs compared to 2023 as we anticipate that the stream will have reached its cap towards the end of 2024.Tasiast (2% royalty) – Kinross reported record annual production at Tasiast as a result of strong grades, higher recoveries and record throughput following the completion of the Tasiast 24k project. For 2024, Tasiast is expected to deliver another strong year of production.Subika (2% royalty) – Newmont reported that production at Subika is expected to increase relative to 2023 due to higher open pit grade, strong underground mining rate, and reaching full processing rates in Q2 2024 after the planned delivery of a replacement girth gear.Seguela (1.2% royalty) – Fortuna Silver Mines reported that Seguela contributed over 78,600 gold ounces in 2023, exceeding the upper range of its 2023 production guidance. Fortuna Silver Mines also indicated that it had reclassified 206,000 ounces of gold related to the Sunbird deposit from Indicated Mineral Resources to Probable Reserves.Diversified assets: Our Diversified assets, primarily comprising our Iron Ore and Energy interests, generated $64.6 million in revenue, down from $94.0 million in Q4 2022, largely as a result of lower gas and oil prices compared to the relative highs of the prior year. Iron Ore: Vale Royalty (iron ore royalty) – Revenue from the Vale royalty increased compared to Q4 2022 as a result of higher estimated iron ore prices.LIORC – LIORC declared a cash dividend of C$0.45 per common share in Q4 2023 compared to C$0.75 per common share in Q4 2022.Caserones (0.57% effective NSR) – Lundin Mining reported it had launched one of the largest exploration programs at the mine since it began operation in 2013 and announced an increase in copper Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves. At December 31, 2023, Franco-Nevada owned a 0.57% effective NSR interest on Caserones. Subsequent to quarter-end, on January 19, 2024, EMX Corporation exercised an option to acquire a portion of our interest for a sale price of $4.7 million, such that our effective NSR on Caserones is now 0.517%.Energy: U.S. (various royalty rates) – Revenue from our U.S. Energy interests decreased compared to Q4 2022, largely due to lower realized oil and gas prices. Production was lower in a number of basins, with the Permian Basin assets being the exception due to the completion of new wells.Canada (various royalty rates) – Revenue from our Canadian Energy interests was relatively consistent with Q4 2022. For our Weyburn NRI, the impact of lower prices was partly offset by lower operating and capital expenditures. Production at our Orion asset improved relative to the prior year quarter, more than offsetting the decrease in realized prices.Shareholder Information The complete audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis can be found on our website at www.franco-nevada.com, on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.com and on EDGAR at www.sec.gov.

ENDNOTES: GEOs: Gold equivalent ounces (""GEOs"") include Franco-Nevada's attributable share of production from our Mining and Energy assets after applicable recovery and payability factors. GEOs are estimated on a gross basis for NSRs and, in the case of stream ounces, before the payment of the per ounce contractual price paid by the Company. For NPI royalties, GEOs are calculated taking into account the NPI economics. Silver, platinum, palladium, iron ore, oil, gas and other commodities are converted to GEOs by dividing associated revenue, which includes settlement adjustments, by the relevant gold price. The price used in the computation of GEOs varies depending on the royalty or stream agreement of each particular asset, which may make reference to the market price realized by the operator, or the average price for the month, quarter, or year in which the commodity was produced or sold. For Q4 2023, the average commodity prices were as follows: $1,976/oz gold (Q4 2022 - $1,729), $23.23/oz silver (Q4 2022 - $21.20), $912/oz platinum (Q4 2022 - $971) and $1,085/oz palladium (Q4 2022 - $1,940), $127/t Fe 62% CFR China (Q4 2022 - $98), $78.32/bbl WTI oil (Q4 2022 - $82.65) and $2.91/mcf Henry Hub natural gas (Q4 2022 - $6.09). For 2023 prices, the average commodity prices were as follows: $1,943/oz gold (2022 - $1,801), $23.39/oz silver (2022 - $21.75), $967/oz platinum (2022 - $961) and $1,338/oz palladium (2022 - $2,107), $119/t Fe 62% CFR China (2022 - $122), $77.62/bbl WTI oil (2022 - $94.23) and $2.66/mcf Henry Hub natural gas (2022 - $6.51).NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES: Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share, Adjusted Net Income Margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA per share, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures with no standardized meaning under International Financial Reporting Standards (""IFRS Accounting Standards"") and might not be comparable to similar financial measures disclosed by other issuers.

MetLife Confirms First Quarter 2024 Series A Preferred Stock Dividend,2024-03-05T21:15:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"MetLife, Inc. (MET) confirms the first quarter 2024 dividend of $0.42000544 per share on its Series A preferred stock. The dividend will be payable on March 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of Feb. 29, 2024.","MetLife Confirms First Quarter 2024 Series A Preferred Stock Dividend Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags dividends earnings Rhea-AI Summary MetLife, Inc. (MET) confirms the first quarter 2024 dividend of $0.42000544 per share on its Series A preferred stock. The dividend will be payable on March 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of Feb. 29, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by MetLife, Inc. regarding the confirmation of its dividend on preferred stock is a signal of the company's current financial stability and its ability to return value to its shareholders. Preferred stock dividends are typically more stable than common stock dividends, providing a predictable income stream to investors. This particular dividend declaration also reflects the company's adherence to its dividend policy, which can be seen as a positive indicator of MetLife's commitment to maintaining shareholder value.In assessing the impact on the stock market, investors often view such confirmations as a reaffirmation of a company's financial health. However, the specific rate of $0.42000544 per share, when compared to the liquidation preference of $25 per share, results in an annualized yield that should be evaluated against current market interest rates and yields offered by other financial instruments. This analysis would enable investors to understand the attractiveness of MetLife's preferred stock in the context of their investment portfolios. Market Research Analyst The setting of an ex-dividend date by the New York Stock Exchange is a procedural aspect that affects the stock's trading dynamics. Once the ex-dividend date is established, the stock price is expected to adjust to reflect the payout. For traders and short-term investors, the timing of this date is critical as it determines eligibility for the dividend payment. The announcement of the dividend payable on March 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of February 29, 2024, provides a clear timeline for investors, which is important for planning and decision-making processes.Long-term investors might be less concerned with the specifics of the ex-dividend date but will be more interested in the continuity of such dividends as part of their income strategy. From a market research perspective, analyzing the historical dividend patterns of MetLife can provide insights into the company's long-term financial strategies and how they align with market expectations and sector performance. 03/05/2024 - 04:15 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- MetLife, Inc.

The notes are intended for general corporate purposes, including debt repayment. The offering is expected to close on March 14, 2024, with BNP Paribas, BofA Securities, and Citigroup as joint book-running managers. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The decision by Magna International Inc. to issue U.S.$400 million in senior unsecured notes with a 5.050% interest rate due in 2029 is a strategic move to bolster the company's capital structure. This approach is indicative of a company proactively managing its liquidity and debt profile. By opting to repay existing indebtedness, Magna can potentially reduce its interest expenses and improve its net income over time, assuming the new notes have a lower interest rate than the debt being paid off. This could lead to an improved debt-to-equity ratio, a key metric that investors monitor as it indicates the financial health of a company.Furthermore, the involvement of reputable financial institutions such as BNP Paribas, BofA Securities and Citigroup as joint book-running managers lends credibility to the offering. This could reassure investors about the process and potentially increase demand for the notes. However, it is crucial to monitor the closing of the offering on March 14, 2024, as any deviations from the expected timeline could affect investor sentiment and the company's immediate financial plans. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Magna International's actions reflect a broader trend in the automotive industry towards consolidation of capital for future growth and innovation. As a mobility technology company, Magna is likely to allocate some of the net proceeds towards research and development in emerging automotive technologies such as electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous driving systems. This aligns with industry shifts and consumer demand patterns, where there is a growing emphasis on sustainable and intelligent transportation solutions.The private placement of notes in Canada to accredited investors is a targeted strategy that may appeal to those looking for stable investment opportunities within the country. It is important to note that the automotive supply industry is highly competitive and Magna's ability to secure funding at a reasonable interest rate can provide them with a competitive edge in terms of investing in new technologies and maintaining a strong position in the market. Legal Expert In the context of securities law and compliance, Magna International's adherence to the registration requirements with the SEC and the filing of a prospectus supplement with the Ontario Securities Commission is a critical step in ensuring the legality of the offering. The fact that the notes are not being qualified for distribution in Canada but are instead offered on a private placement basis to certain accredited investors underlines the company's understanding of and compliance with Canadian securities laws.Investors should be aware that the securities are being offered in accordance with the legal frameworks governing such transactions, which helps to mitigate the risk of regulatory issues that could adversely impact the offering's success. While the legal text stipulates that the release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation, the availability of prospectus copies through the SEC's EDGAR system and directly from the banks involved provides transparency and access to essential information for due diligence. 03/05/2024 - 05:10 PM AURORA, Ontario, March 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Magna International Inc.

Financial Analyst The reported financial results from PlayAGS, Inc. indicate a robust performance, with a 15% year-over-year increase in total revenue to $94.2 million. This growth is significant as it reflects the company's ability to expand its market share and improve its top-line figures consistently over eleven consecutive quarters, which is a strong indicator of the company's market position and operational efficiency. The record-setting global EGM sales, which saw over a 30% increase for the third consecutive quarter, suggest a growing demand for the company's products, potentially leading to increased market penetration.However, the net income figure presents a contrasting narrative, as it shows a substantial decline from $2.5 million in Q4 2022 to just $67 thousand in Q4 2023. This sharp decrease raises questions about rising costs or other financial pressures, such as higher interest expenses, that may be impacting the company's bottom line. The reported net leverage reduction from 3.8x to 3.2x is a positive sign of debt management, but the net income figure suggests that profitability is not keeping pace with revenue growth, which could be a concern for investors focused on long-term financial health. Market Research Analyst PlayAGS's performance in the gaming operations sector, with a notable 4% increase in recurring revenue, highlights the company's strategic positioning in the market. The emphasis on the Interactive and Table Products segments, which have seen significant revenue increases of 34% and 7% respectively, indicates a successful diversification of the company's product portfolio. This diversification is likely to provide resilience against market volatility and could be appealing to investors looking for companies with a stable revenue stream.Another aspect worth noting is the company's efficient capital expenditure management and working capital optimization, which have contributed to a strong free cash flow performance. Three consecutive quarters of free cash flow exceeding $10 million underscore the company's ability to generate cash from its operations, which is a critical factor for sustaining growth and potentially funding future investments without the need for additional debt. Gaming Industry Analyst The reported results show that PlayAGS has a strong foothold in the gaming equipment sector, with its Spectra family of EGM cabinets performing exceptionally well. The Spectra UR43 and UR49's top-five ranking in the Eilers-Fantini Cabinet Performance Report is a testament to the company's competitive product offerings and innovation within the gaming industry. The emphasis on premium game content, such as the Pinata Pays game family, suggests a focus on high-margin products that can drive profitability.However, the global EGM unit sales growth and the increase in the average sales price (ASP) need to be balanced against the potential market saturation and the competitive dynamics of the gaming industry. The company's strategic focus on broadening customer account penetration and leveraging a diverse suite of game content and cabinet variety will be critical in maintaining its growth trajectory in a highly competitive market. 03/05/2024 - 04:15 PM Fourth Quarter 2023 Highlights: •Total Revenue Increased 15% Y/Y to a Record $94.2 Million; Eleventh Consecutive Quarter of Double-Digit Y/Y Growth •Global EGM Sales Reached a Record 1,519 Units; Up by Over 30% Y/Y for the Third Straight Quarter •Table Products Revenue Surged 24% Y/Y to a New Record; Supported by Accelerating PAX S Adoption •Interactive Revenue Grew More than 30% Y/Y to a Record $3.4 Million; Up 8% Versus Q3 2023 •Income From Operations Increased 19% Y/Y to $16.0 Million; Net Income Totaled $67 Thousand •Total Adjusted EBITDA Advanced to a Record $42.8 Million; Total Adjusted EBITDA Margin Exceeded 45% •Cash From Operating Activities Totaled $26.4 Million; Free Cash Flow Topped $10 Million for the Third Quarter in a Row •Net Leverage Fell to 3.2x at Quarter End; Targeting Year End 2024 Net Leverage in the Range of 2.75x to 3.00x LAS VEGAS, March 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PlayAGS, Inc. (NYSE: AGS) (""AGS"", ""us"", ""we"" or the ""Company""), a designer and developer of equipment and services solutions for the global gaming industry, today reported operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Commenting upon the Company's fourth quarter financial performance, AGS President and Chief Executive Officer David Lopez said, ""The strength in our four quarter results was broad-based, with all three operating segments setting new quarterly records for revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. The quality and consistency of our recent financial performance is a true reflection of our incredibly talented and focused team, increasingly deep and diverse product offering across all three segments, and the improving efficiency and effectiveness of our execution."" Kimo Akiona, AGS Chief Financial Officer added, ""We exited 2023 with a total net debt leverage ratio of 3.2 times, down from 3.8 times at the start of the year. Supported by our consistent operating momentum and execution, heightened focus on efficient and effective working capital management, continued capex deployment discipline, and anticipated cash interest savings from our recent debt repricing and repayment; a path to below 3.0 times remains well within our sight.""

All three operating segments delivered double-digit growth rates versus the prior year, with Interactive, Table Products and Electronic Gaming Machines (""EGM"") revenue increasing 34%, 24% and 14% year-over-year, respectively. Total revenue grew approximately 5% relative to the $89.4 million delivered in Q3 2023 and has now established a new Company record in four of the past five quarters. •Gaming operations, or recurring revenue, totaled $59.6 million, approximately 4% ahead of the $57.4 million achieved in Q4 2022. Interactive and Table Products recurring revenue increased 34% and 7% year-over-year, respectively, with each establishing new records within their respective segments. EGM gaming operations revenue advanced 2% versus the prior year, setting a new Q4 high-water mark of $52.3 million. Recurring revenue accounted for over 60% of the Company's consolidated Q4 2023 revenue mix. Gaming operations revenue declined modestly relative to the $61.0 million achieved in Q3 2023, consistent with historically normal seasonal trends within the business. •Equipment sales revenue increased more than 40% year-over-year to a record $34.6 million, with EGM and Table Products sales revenue reaching records of $33.7 million and $893 thousand, respectively. Global EGM unit sales eclipsed 1,500 units for the first time ever, advancing approximately 36% year-over-year. Global EGM unit sales growth has surpassed 30% in each of the past three quarters. Equipment sales revenue increased over 20% relative to the $28.4 million delivered in Q3 2023, supported by strong growth in both EGM and Table Products sales revenue. •The Company generated near breakeven net income in Q4 2023 compared to $2.5 million in Q4 2022. Higher interest expense, commensurate with an increase in market-level rates, and an approximately $2 million unfavorable swing in income tax expense more than offset a nearly 20% year-over-year increase in income from operations. •Total Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)(1) increased approximately 15% year-over-year to a record $42.8 million, marking our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit Adjusted EBITDA growth. All three segments contributed to the record-setting performance, led by a more than doubling of Interactive Adjusted EBITDA to $1.3 million, while Table Products and EGM Adjusted EBITDA increased approximately 20% and 12% year-over-year, respectively. Q4 2023 Total Adjusted EBITDA surpassed the prior record of $40.1 million, delivered in Q3 2023, by approximately 7%. The Company has now established new Total Adjusted EBITDA records in four of the past five quarters. •Total Adjusted EBITDA margin (non-GAAP)(1) was 45.4%, surpassing the 45% level for the first time since Q4 2022. Q4 2023 margin performance reflects the improving margin profile of the Company's Interactive business, supported by the segment's recent outsized revenue growth; superior gross margins on the highly-modular and efficiently designed Spectra family of EGM cabinets; and operating leverage resulting from the over 15% year-over-year increase in total revenues. For the full year 2023, Adjusted EBITDA margin was 44.6%, placing it in the upper half of the Company's targeted 44% to 45% range articulated at the start of the year. •Net cash provided by operating activities increased approximately 10% year-over-year to $26.4 million. Q4 2023 free cash flow (non-GAAP)(2) totaled $11.0 million, up more than 45% compared to the $7.6 million delivered in the prior year period. The year-over-year improvement in free cash flow generation reflects the Company's record-setting operating performance, heightened focus on efficient and effective working capital management, and continued capex deployment discipline. The Company has now generated over $10 million of free cash flow in three consecutive quarters.

A 15% year-over-year increase in our higher-yielding premium EGM installed base, further deployment of Spectra UR43 and initial deployment of Spectra UR 49, both of which are delivering per unit performance comparable to our premium products, and continuous installed base optimization contributed to our improved gaming operations revenue performance in the quarter. Domestic EGM recurring revenue topped $45 million for the seventh consecutive quarter and accounted for approximately 60% of the total domestic EGM revenue generated in Q4 2023. •The domestic EGM installed base expanded to 16,443 units at the end of Q4 2023, representing an increase of 117 units versus the prior year and up sequentially for the seventh consecutive quarter. Outsized premium EGM footprint growth and deployment of our high-performing Spectra UR43 and Spectra UR49 cabinets drove the expansion of our domestic EGM installed base in both the year-over-year and quarterly sequential periods. •Domestic EGM RPD increased approximately 1% year-over-year to a fourth-quarter record $31.68, exceeding $30 for the eleventh consecutive quarter. Outsized premium unit growth, further capital efficient installed base optimization, deployment of our high-performing Spectra UR43 and Spectra UR49 cabinets and a relatively stable gaming macroeconomic environment paced our improved Q4 2023 domestic EGM RPD performance versus the prior year. Domestic EGM RPD decreased modestly relative from the $32.57 achieved in Q3 2023, reflecting historically normal seasonality in market-level Gross Gaming Revenue (""GGR"") trends. •Our installed base of high-performing premium EGM units increased 15% year-over-year and accounted for over 17% of our domestic EGM installed base at the end of Q4 2023 compared to approximately 15% at the end of Q4 2022. Our premium EGM installed base grew sequentially for the sixteenth consecutive quarter. Supported by our deep pipeline of new premium game content, including the recently-launched Pinata Pays game family, which placed two titles in the top five of the ""New-Premium Leased"" category within the January 2024 Eilers-Fantini Game Performance Report, and our increasingly diverse portfolio of premium cabinet offerings, with several new premium form factors scheduled to launch throughout 2024, we continue to believe we are poised to benefit from a compelling multi-year growth runway within the higher-yielding, higher-return premium game market segment. International Gaming Operations •International EGM gaming operations, or recurring revenue, totaled $5.1 million, up 16% versus the $4.4 million delivered in Q4 2022. The sustained relative outperformance of established AGS franchise game themes throughout the Mexico casino market, further execution of our global installed base optimization initiatives, a stable macroeconomic backdrop, and favorable foreign exchange fluctuations all contributed to our year-over-year revenue increase. International EGM recurring revenue declined approximately 5% relative to the $5.4 million delivered in Q3 2023, with the decrease largely attributable to historically normal seasonality and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable foreign exchange movements. •The international EGM installed base totaled 6,126 units at December 31, 2023, representing a quarterly sequential increase of 43 units. New casino openings paced the installed base growth realized in the quarter. •International EGM RPD increased approximately 16% year-over-year to $8.86, establishing a new fourth quarter record. The Company estimates International EGM RPD grew approximately 4% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. Anticipated seasonality and unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations led to an approximately 6% quarterly sequential decline in Q4 2023 International EGM RPD. EGM Equipment Sales •Global EGM sales reached a record 1,519 units in Q4 2023, representing an increase of over 35% compared to the 1,116 units sold in Q4 2022. Sustained Spectra UR43 demand momentum, supported by the continued strong performance of multiple titles on the cabinet; initial sales of our recently-launched Spectra UR49 cabinet; a strategic focus on broadening our customer account penetration, particularly with larger multi-site corporate operators; the ability to leverage a deeper and more diverse suite of game content and cabinet variety to increase average order size; and continued outsized penetration of the Historical Horse Racing (""HHR"") market, aided by the strength of our game performance, contributed to our improved EGM unit sales performance versus the prior year. Global EGM unit sales increased approximately 13% relative to the 1,345 units sold in Q3 2023 and have now grown sequentially in eleven of the past twelve quarters. •The average sales price (""ASP"") in Q4 2023 was $20,677 versus $19,382 in Q4 2022, surpassing the $20,000 level for the second time in the past three quarters. Our improved quarterly ASP performance reflects the superior pricing we have been able to command on our high-performing Spectra family of cabinets and continued implementation of our price integrity initiatives. ASP increased approximately 7% relative to the $19,380 delivered in Q3 2023, with the lift largely attributable to a greater mix of Spectra family cabinet sales, including our premium-priced Spectra UR49, and a decrease in the relative weighting of lower-priced convert-to-sale unit sales. •The Company sold units into 30 U.S. states, four Canadian provinces and four international jurisdictions outside of the U.S. and Canada throughout Q4 2023, supported by further successful execution of our strategic initiative to broaden our customer account penetration, particularly with larger corporate buyers. To that end, we sold units to nearly 180 unique customers in Q4 2023, representing an increase of more than 70% versus the prior year and over 60% higher than the number sold to in Q4 2019. Product Highlights •The Company's Spectra family of gaming cabinets continues to take the gaming industry by storm, with both Spectra UR49 and UR43 achieving a top-five ranking in the January 2024 Eilers-Fantini Cabinet Performance Report, with reported theoretical index performance of 1.62 times and 1.51 times zone average, respectively. The Spectra duo's exceptional performance put AGS in an enviable position as the only manufacturer with two cabinets in the top five of any category within the Eilers Report. The Spectra UR43 footprint surpassed 4,000 units at year end 2023, while Spectra UR49 continued to gain steam with nearly 170 units deployed. With multiple game themes in various stages of the field testing process and several new additions to the cabinet lineup scheduled for release in 2024, the Company believes it remains in the very early innings of realizing the Spectra family's true growth potential. •AGS' decision to strategically transform the scale and scope of its game development team beginning in the back half of 2019 has provided the Company with the content needed to consistently scale the business. The byproduct of this multi-year effort was well-represented within the January 2024 Eilers-Fantini Game Performance Report, as the Company placed seven titles in the Quarterly Top-50 New Core games, while also producing two top-five titles in the report's New Premium Leased category. Supported by the breadth, depth and quality of its current game portfolio, which features contributions from each of the Company's game development studios, AGS has uniquely armed itself with the tools needed to simultaneously execute its recurring revenue yield optimization initiatives, while also positioning the Company to emerge as the middle-tier provider of choice in the North American slot sales market.

Gaming operations, or recurring, revenue accounted for over 80% of Q4 2023 segment-level revenue. Total table products revenue advanced approximately 10% relative to the $4.4 million achieved in Q3 2023. •Gaming operations revenue reached a record $3.9 million, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately 7%. Growth across all major segments of our table products installed base, including an over 65% increase in the number of shufflers installed on lease, drove our improved recurring revenue performance versus the prior year. Broad-based installed base growth also paced a 2% increase in recurring revenue on a quarterly sequential basis. •The table products installed base totaled 5,415 units at the end of Q4 2023, up 364 units, or approximately 7%, versus the prior year. A more than 65% increase in both our PAX S and DEX S shuffler lease bases, further customer adoption of our all-inclusive AGS Arsenal site license offering, which contributed to outsized premium game growth of approximately 19%, and an over 30% increase in our Bonus Spin Xtreme (""BSX"") progressive installed base combined to drive our year-over-year installed base growth. This same set of growth catalysts, along with new casino opening activity, contributed to an over 100 unit increase in our installed base versus the prior sequential quarter. •The average monthly lease price (""ALP"") was relatively consistent versus the prior year and prior sequential quarter at $239. •Equipment sales revenue more than quadrupled year-over-year to a record $893 thousand, exceeding the prior record, established in Q2 2023, by nearly 70%. Supported by new casino opening activity, PAX S sales surpassed 35 units, while we also benefitted from the sale of 13 DEX S units in the quarter. • Table Products Adjusted EBITDA increased 20% year-over-year to a record $2.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 58.9% compared to 60.9% in Q4 2022, reflecting a higher allocation of field service expense to the segment to better align with the current composition of the installed base and a greater mix of equipment sales revenue. Table Products Adjusted EBITDA increased by more than 15% versus the $2.4 million delivered in Q3 2023, representing our third consecutive quarter of sequential Adjusted EBITDA growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by over 300bps sequentially, reflecting the operating leverage realized as a result of our outsized revenue growth. •The PAX S specialty game card shuffler footprint surpassed 330 units at the end of Q4 2023, with units live in over 65 unique casinos across more than 20 states and provinces. The PAX S footprint expanded by over 40 units, or approximately 14%, sequentially in Q4 2023, supported by the activation of more than 20 units in conjunction with a recent high-profile new casino opening. With PAX S approved in all major North American markets and supported by the overwhelmingly positive customer feedback received on the product to date, the Company believes it remains in the early stages of realizing PAX's true growth potential. •The Bonus Spin Xtreme progressive installed base increased by over 30% year-over-year and approximately 5% sequentially to 530 units. BSX is currently installed in over 50 casinos across nearly 20 jurisdictions. The enhanced BSX features and functionality scheduled to launch in 2024 should allow the product to resonate with an even broader audience, helping to drive additional customer adoption in the quarters ahead. •At quarter end, the Company was live with over 20 AGS Arsenal site licenses across a variety of tribal and commercial end markets. The Arsenal's compelling value proposition and our organizational commitment to investing in table product innovation continue to drive interest in our site license offering.

Real-money gaming (""RMG"") revenue accounted for over 90% of Q4 2023 segment-level revenue, with the balance derived from the Company's B2C social casino platform. •RMG revenue increased 46% year-over-year and more than 20% sequentially to a record $3.1 million. An accelerating cadence of new game launches, including the introduction of the Company's first ever online-first game theme, Double Shamrock; more tactical and targeted business development activities with our B2C operator partners; the continued strong performance of franchise brands, including Capital Gains, in the online channel; and the activation of more than 10 new B2C operator partners globally paced our record-setting Q4 2023 RMG revenue performance. Revenues earned from North American-facing customers accounted for over 90% of Q4 2023 RMG revenue mix. •Interactive Adjusted EBITDA more than doubled versus the prior year to a record $1.3 million, reflecting our ability to flow through a significant portion of the RMG revenue growth achieved in the quarter while simultaneously providing our team with the financial resources necessary to support achievement of our multi-year growth objectives. Adjusted EBITDA increased by over 40% compared to the $902 thousand delivered in Q3 2023, supported by further returns on the tactical investments in technical and customer-facing talent initiated in the back half of 2022. The Interactive segment has generated positive Adjusted EBITDA for sixteen consecutive quarters, consistent with the Company's commitment to profitably scaling revenues within the segment. •AGS maintained its position near the top of the charts in the February 2024 Eilers-Fantini Online Game Performance Report, with the exceptional performance of its new and proven online brands producing a top-five overall slot index ranking for the fourth consecutive month. The Company's ""New"" game performance told a similar story within the February report, ranking second best for the fourth month in a row with a reported theoretical win index of over 3 times site average. Three AGS game themes achieved a top-15 ranking within the February report's ""New"" game category, including Platinum 8x8x8x, Mega Diamond and 8x Crystal Bells, while its established online franchise brand, Capital Gains, ranked second in the overall slots category with a reported theoretical win index of more than 14 times site average. Looking ahead, the Company remains committed to further diversifying its online content offering to include online-first game themes, bespoke product, simple slots, instant win, and table games to further solidify its position as a partner of choice to the industry's leading B2C i-casino operators. •The Company's growing suite of RMG game content, consisting of over 60 proven AGS land-based titles, was live in nearly all of the most prominent regulated North American online jurisdictions and with over 80 i-gaming operators globally as of December 31, 2023. Pennsylvania, Michigan and Canada represented the Company's highest revenue generating end markets in Q4 2023. Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights As of December 31, 2023, the Company had an available cash balance of $50.9 million and $40.0 million of availability under its undrawn revolving credit facility, resulting in total available liquidity of over $90 million. The total principal amount of debt outstanding, as of December 31, 2023, was $566.8 million compared to $571.4 million at December 31, 2022. Total net debt, which is the principal amount of debt outstanding less cash and cash equivalents, was $515.8 million as of December 31, 2023, conveying a total net debt leverage ratio of 3.2 times compared to 3.8 times as of December 31, 2022(4). Fourth quarter 2023 capital expenditures totaled $15.4 million, bringing full year 2023 capital expenditures to $61.9 million. Growth capital expenditures, which primarily relate to gaming equipment-related investments into the Company's EGM and Table Product installed bases, accounted for approximately 60% of the total capital expenditures incurred for the full year 2023, with the balance attributable to capitalized research and development (""R&D"") expenditures and investment in long-lived assets intended to support various corporate operations. The Company expects full year 2024 capital expenditures, inclusive of anticipated capitalized R&D and corporate operation expenditures, to land in the range of $65 million to $70 million. Free cash flow(4) reached $11.0 million in Q4 2023 compared to $7.6 million in Q4 2022, pushing full year 2023 free cash flow to $27.4 million. February 2024 Debt Repricing and Voluntary Repayment On February 5, 2024, the Company successfully completed a repricing of its term loan credit facility. Among other things, the repricing removed the credit spread adjustment with respect to term loan borrowings and reduced the interest rate applied to such borrowings to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus 3.75%. Additionally, in conjunction with the repricing transaction, the Company elected to voluntarily repay $15 million of its total debt outstanding. 2024 Net Leverage Target Supported by the relative resiliency observed across the broader North American gaming complex 2024-to-date, both with respect to GGR trends and customer purchasing demand; the growing appeal and strong performance of AGS's deeper and more diverse suite of EGM gaming cabinets and game content; the anticipated continued outsized growth in Interactive revenues; an unwavering commitment to cost containment and operational efficiency; and steadily improving free cash flow conversion, the Company expects to exit 2024 with a total net debt leverage ratio in the range of 2.75 times to 3.00 times. (4) Total Adjusted EBITDA, Total Net Debt Leverage Ratio and Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures; see non-GAAP reconciliation below.

These measures are not financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss), income from operations, cash flows, or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Total Adjusted EBITDA This press release and accompanying schedules provide certain information regarding Adjusted EBITDA, which is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. We believe that the presentation of total Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain material non-cash items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future, as well as other items we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance. Further, we believe total Adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful measure of operating profitability because we use it for evaluating our business performance, making budgeting decisions, and comparing our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. It also provides management and investors with additional information to estimate our value. Total Adjusted EBITDA is not a presentation made in accordance with GAAP. Our use of the term total Adjusted EBITDA may vary from others in our industry. Total Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or net income. Total Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for the analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our definition of total Adjusted EBITDA allows us to add back certain non-cash charges that are deducted in calculating net income and to deduct certain gains that are included in calculating net income. However, these expenses and gains vary greatly, and are difficult to predict. They can represent the effect of long-term strategies as opposed to short-term results. In addition, in the case of charges or expenses, these items can represent the reduction of cash that could be used for other corporate purposes. Due to these limitations, we rely primarily on our GAAP results, such as net income (loss), income from operations, EGM Adjusted EBITDA, Table Products Adjusted EBITDA or Interactive Adjusted EBITDA and use Total Adjusted EBITDA only supplementally. The total Adjusted EBITDA discussion above is also applicable to its margin measure, which is calculated as total Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue. The following table presents a reconciliation of total Adjusted EBITDA to net income, which is the most comparable GAAP measure: Total Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation Three Months Ended December 31,(Amounts in thousands) 2023 2022 $ Change % ChangeNet income $67 $2,541 $(2,474) (97.4)%Income tax benefit (expense) 1,049 (937) 1,986 (212.0)%Depreciation and amortization 20,272 18,537 1,735 9.4%Interest expense, net of interest income and other 14,932 11,843 3,089 26.1%Write-downs and other (gains) charges(6) 810 99 711 718.2%Other adjustments(7) 500 1,228 (728) (59.3)%Other non-cash charges(8) 2,452 2,648 (196) (7.4)%Non-cash stock-based compensation(9) 2,678 1,321 1,357 102.7%Total Adjusted EBITDA $42,760 $37,280 $5,480 14.7% Three Months Ended December 31, (Amounts in thousands, except total Adjusted EBITDA margin) 2023 2022 $ Change % ChangeTotal revenues $94,151 $81,736 $12,415 15.2%Total Adjusted EBITDA $42,760 $37,280 $5,480 14.7%Total Adjusted EBITDA margin 45.4% 45.6% (0.2)% (20 bps) (6) Write-downs and other includes items related to loss on disposal or impairment of long-lived assets and fair value adjustments to contingent consideration.(7) Other adjustments are primarily composed of the following: •Costs and inventory and receivable valuation charges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, professional fees incurred for projects, costs incurred related to public offerings, contract cancellation fees and other transaction costs deemed to be non-operating in nature;•Acquisition and integration related costs related to the purchase of businesses and to integrate operations and obtain costs synergies;•Restructuring and severance costs, which primarily relate to costs incurred through the restructuring of the Company’s operations from time to time and other employee severance costs recognized in the periods presented; and•Legal and litigation related costs, which consist of payments to law firms and settlements for matters that are outside the normal course of business. (8) Other non-cash charges are costs related to non-cash charges and losses on the disposition of assets, non-cash charges on capitalized installation and delivery, which primarily includes the costs to acquire contracts that are expensed over the estimated life of each contract, and non-cash charges related to accretion of contract rights under development agreements.(9) Non-cash stock-based compensation includes non-cash compensation expense related to grants of options, restricted stock, and other equity awards. Total Net Debt Leverage Ratio Reconciliation The following table presents a reconciliation of total net debt and total net debt leverage ratio: (Amounts in thousands, except total net debt leverage ratio) December 31, December 31, 2023 2022Total principal amount of debt $566,754 $571,376 Less: Cash and cash equivalents 50,936 37,891 Total net debt $515,818 $533,485 LTM Adjusted EBITDA $158,967 $138,643 Total net debt leverage ratio 3.2 3.8 Free Cash Flow This schedule provides certain information regarding Free Cash Flow, which is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from payments on customer notes receivable less cash outlays related to capital expenditures. We define capital expenditures to include purchase of intangible assets, software development and other expenditures, and purchases of property and equipment. In arriving at Free Cash Flow, we subtract cash outlays related to capital expenditures and add proceeds from payments on customer notes receivable to net cash provided by operating activities because they represent long-term investments that are required for normal business activities. As a result, subject to the limitations described below, Free Cash Flow is a useful measure of our cash available to repay debt and/or make other investments. Free Cash Flow adjusts for cash items that are ultimately within management’s discretion to direct, and therefore, may imply that there is less or more cash that is available than the most comparable GAAP measure. Free Cash Flow is not intended to represent residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures since debt repayment requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures are not deducted. These limitations are best addressed by using Free Cash Flow in combination with the GAAP cash flow numbers.

Financial Analyst The financial results reported by Allient Inc. show significant growth in revenue, net income and cash flow, which are critical indicators of the company's financial health and operational efficiency. The 15% increase in revenue, alongside a 36% increase in net income per diluted share, reflects robust demand in the company's target markets and effective integration of recent acquisitions such as Sierramotion Inc.Margin expansion, particularly the 40 basis point increase in gross margin, indicates Allient's ability to control costs and improve profitability. The reduction in debt balance by $17.1 million suggests prudent financial management and a strategic approach to leveraging. These positive financial metrics could signal to investors the potential for increased shareholder value and might influence the stock's attractiveness in the market.Furthermore, the 'Simplify to Accelerate' strategy, focusing on footprint rationalization and organizational simplification, could lead to operational efficiencies and cost savings. However, it's essential to monitor how these strategic changes will be implemented amidst the challenges posed by macroeconomic uncertainties and geopolitical disruptions. Market Research Analyst Allient's strategic focus on organic growth, margin expansion and cash generation is commendable, especially in the context of a challenging macroeconomic environment. The organic growth rate of 13% on a constant currency basis is particularly impressive, surpassing double the industry average, which suggests a strong competitive position and effective business strategy.The company's emphasis on lean manufacturing and working capital reduction may enhance operational efficiency and contribute to cash flow improvement. This could be a compelling narrative for investors looking for companies with a clear path to value creation through internal optimization.However, investors should be aware of the potential impact of the normalizing customer order patterns and the right-sizing of backlogs, which may affect future revenue streams. The company's outlook for 2024, including the focus on reducing redundant costs and realigning the organization, will be crucial in maintaining the growth momentum and should be closely watched. Economist While Allient's strategic initiatives and financial performance are strong, external economic factors such as supply chain improvements, normalization of customer order patterns and geopolitical tensions could influence the company's performance. The mention of 'macro uncertainty' by the CEO acknowledges the external risks that could potentially disrupt the company's trajectory.The extended maturity on the existing revolving credit facility is a strategic financial move that could provide Allient with greater financial flexibility. However, it is important to consider the broader economic context, including interest rate trends and credit market conditions, which could affect the cost of capital and borrowing conditions in the future.Investors should also consider the potential impacts of currency exchange rate fluctuations, which have been noted to have a favorable impact on fourth quarter orders. Currency volatility can have both positive and negative effects on international revenue streams and should be factored into the assessment of the company's financial outlook. 03/05/2024 - 05:02 PM “Simplify to Accelerate” sets strategic imperatives for 2024: footprint rationalization and organizational simplification, improved customer interaction, margin expansion and cash generation to reduce debt 2023 results validate strategic efforts to drive growth, margin expansion and cash flow Revenue increased 15% to record $578.6 million with organic growth of 13% on a constant currency basis Achieved record gross margin of 31.7% in 2023, 40 basis point expansion year over year Net income per diluted share increased 36% to $1.48; Adjusted net income per share was $2.30, up 22% for the year Generated a record $45.0 million of cash from operations in 2023 and reduced debt balance by $17.1 million Fourth quarter 2023 demonstrated continued progress Revenue grew 8% with organic growth of 6% on a constant currency basis Gross margin expanded 40 basis points to 31.5% Fourth quarter net income per diluted share increased 13% to $0.26 per diluted share; Adjusted net income per diluted share improved $0.12 to $0.55 Subsequent to year-end, extended the maturity on the existing revolving credit facility BUFFALO, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Allient Inc. (Nasdaq: ALNT) (“Allient” or the “Company”), a global designer and manufacturer of precision and specialty Motion, Controls and Power products and solutions for targeted industries and applications, today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Results include the Sierramotion Inc. acquisition, which was completed in September 2023. “With a backdrop of macro uncertainty and other challenges, the Allient team once again delivered on a number of successes during the past year,” commented Dick Warzala, Chairman and CEO. “We embarked on our next stage of growth with a refined strategy and new name while continuing to drive organic growth at more than double the industry and executing on key acquisitions. We added Sierramotion to advance our integrated motion solutions strategy and extend our reach into key target markets in 2023 and acquired SNC Manufacturing in early January 2024. SNC was our first tuck in acquisition for our Power technology pillar. Ultimately, our top-line growth combined with margin expansion translated into stronger earnings and a record level of cash generation enabling us to further strengthen our balance sheet.” Commenting on the near-term outlook, Mr. Warzala added, “We are intent upon creating stronger earnings momentum with our Simplify to Accelerate strategy. 2024 is the year to drive out redundant costs, realign the organization to consolidate like businesses, rationalize our footprint and ultimately simplify our operating structure. By rethinking how we operate, we believe we can accelerate our efforts to achieve top-tier financial performance. While some of the actions will take time to fully execute, there is a strong sense of urgency throughout the organization to deliver on our goals. The year will have its challenges given the changing dynamics of our backlog, which is right-sizing as supply chains improve and customer order patterns normalize; as well as the unknown impacts of the ongoing geopolitical disruptions. However, it also presents the opportunity to reduce our working capital requirements and strengthen cash flow. Finally, we are well situated as we realign the organization to support the significant opportunities that we are bidding on across our targeted verticals.” Allient’s “Simplify to Accelerate” strategy is centered on three high-level strategic initiatives: Realign and right-size the Company’s footprint to better align with its markets and customers. Initiatives are already underway and are expected to continue with earnest throughout 2024 and beyond. Reinforce lean manufacturing disciplines throughout the Company to accelerate margin expansion. Focus on working capital reduction to drive additional cash generation and de-lever the balance sheet. Fourth Quarter 2023 Results (Narrative compares with prior-year period unless otherwise noted) Revenue increased 8%, or $9.9 million, to $141.0 million and reflected strong Industrial market sales, which included shipping some long lead products that were in backlog, and improved demand within the Vehicle market. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenue of $1.6 million, organic growth was approximately 6%. Sales to U.S. customers were 59% of total sales compared with 57% in the fourth quarter last year, with the balance of sales to customers primarily in Europe, Canada and Asia-Pacific. See the attached table for a description of non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliation of revenue excluding foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Industrial markets sales were up 23% in the quarter, benefiting from strong end market demand within industrial automation, vehicle handling, and power quality solutions focused on the oil & gas, and HVAC markets. Sales in the Vehicle markets increased 17% due to higher demand within commercial automotive and powersports, partially offset by lower demand within agricultural vehicles, which primarily reflected softness in Europe, largely influenced by the Ukrainian conflict. Aerospace & Defense sales decreased 19%, largely due to program timing within the defense and space industry. Medical market revenue was down 16%, as softer medical mobility demand more than offset a more normalized pre COVID-19 sales environment focused on surgical and instrumentation related end markets. Sales through the Distribution channel, which are a small component of total sales, were up 4%. Gross margin was 31.5%, up 40 basis points from the prior-year period as higher volume and favorable mix more than offset elevated raw material costs. Operating costs and expenses were 26.5% of revenue, up 170 basis points, of which 110 basis points was attributable to higher business development costs in the quarter due to an earnout for a prior acquisition, M&A activity, and rationalization efforts. Also contributing to the total expense increase was higher incentive compensation expense reflecting strong Company performance. As a result, operating income was $7.0 million, or 5.0% of revenue, compared with $8.2 million, or 6.2% of revenue. Net income increased 18% to $4.3 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, from $3.7 million, or $0.23 per share, in the prior-year period. Adjusted net income, which excludes amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions, business development costs and other non-recurring items, increased to $9.1 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, compared with adjusted net income of $6.9 million, or $0.43 per diluted share. Included in the fourth quarter’s results was a tax benefit of $0.4 million, which reflected realization of certain NOLs and R&D credits and incentives. See the attached tables for a description of non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliation table for Adjusted Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, business development costs, and foreign currency gains/losses (“Adjusted EBITDA”) was $16.9 million, up $0.3 million or 2%. As a percentage of revenue, Adjusted EBITDA was 12.0%, down 70 basis points. The Company believes that, when used in conjunction with measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure, helps in the understanding of its operating performance. See the attached table for a description of non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliation table for Adjusted EBITDA. Full Year 2023 Results (Narrative compares with prior-year period unless otherwise noted) Revenue of $578.6 million increased $75.6 million, or 15%, reflecting strong demand in Industrial markets, higher sales within Aerospace & Defense and Vehicle markets, and incremental sales from acquisitions. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on revenue of $0.3 million, organic growth was 13%. Sales to U.S. customers were 59% of total sales compared with 58% last year, with the balance of sales to customers primarily in Europe, Canada and Asia-Pacific. Gross margin was 31.7%, up 40 basis points due to higher volume and mix. Operating costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue were 24.4%, down 60 basis points due to operating leverage partially offset by higher business development costs. As a result, operating income increased 34% to $42.3 million, or 7.3% of sales, compared with $31.7 million, or 6.3% of sales. Net income increased 39% to $24.1 million, or $1.48 per diluted share, compared with $17.4 million, or $1.09 per diluted share. The effective tax rate was 18.9% in 2023, which reflected the tax benefit from the fourth quarter. This compared with an effective tax rate of 26.6% during 2022. The Company expects its income tax rate for the full year 2024 to be approximately 21% to 23%. Excluding amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions, business development costs and other non-recurring items, adjusted net income increased 25% to $37.5 million, or $2.30 per diluted share, compared with $30.0 million, or $1.88 per diluted share, in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA increased 18% to $77.2 million from $65.5 million, and as a percentage of revenue was 13.3%, up 30 basis points. Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Review Cash and cash equivalents were $31.9 million compared with $30.6 million at year-end 2022. Cash provided by operating activities improved to a record $45.0 million for the year compared with $5.6 million in 2022. The increase reflected higher net income and stronger inventory turns. Capital expenditures were $11.6 million for 2023 and largely focused on new customer projects. The Company expects 2024 capital expenditures to be in the range of $16 million to $20 million. Total debt of $218.4 million was down $17.1 million from year-end 2022. Debt, net of cash, was $186.5 million, or 42.6% of net debt to capitalization. The Company’s leverage ratio, as defined in its credit agreement, was 2.8x at year-end. On March 1, 2024, the Company extended the maturity of its existing $280 million revolving credit facility for five years to March 2029. Borrowings for the revolving facility will bear interest on a sliding-scale rate based on leverage of 1.25% to 2.50% over SOFR. In addition, the Company has entered into a $150 million fixed-rate private shelf facility under which no note borrowings have occurred to date. Orders and Backlog Summary ($ in thousands) Q4 2023 Q3 2023 Q2 2023 Q1 2023 Q4 2022 Orders $ 105,162 $ 154,908 $ 137,008 $ 123,198 $ 145,564 Backlog $ 276,093 $ 309,636 $ 298,695 $ 308,635 $ 330,078 Foreign currency translation had a favorable $1.4 million impact on fourth quarter orders compared with the prior-year period. The sequential decline in backlog reflects the continued improvements within the supply chain, which has enabled the reduction of long-lead times for industrial market projects. Given improved lead times, customer order patterns are normalizing to a pre-pandemic environment and excess supply is now being taken out of the channel, which does impact the current order rates. The time to convert the majority of the backlog to sales is approximately three to nine months.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures (In thousands) (Unaudited) In addition to reporting revenue and net income, which are U.S. generally accepted accounting principle (“GAAP”) measures, the Company presents Revenue excluding foreign currency exchange rate impacts, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, business development costs, and foreign currency gains/losses), which are non-GAAP measures. The Company believes that Revenue excluding foreign currency exchange rate impacts is a useful measure in analyzing organic sales results. The Company excludes the effect of currency translation from revenue for this measure because currency translation is not fully under management’s control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. The portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between the current period revenue and the current period revenue after applying foreign exchange rates from the prior period. Organic growth is reported revenues adjusted for the impact of foreign currency and the revenue contribution from acquisitions. The Company believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are often a useful measure of a Company’s operating performance and are a significant basis used by the Company’s management to evaluate and compare the core operating performance of its business from period to period by removing the impact of the capital structure (interest), tangible and intangible asset base (depreciation and amortization), taxes, stock-based compensation expense, business development costs, foreign currency gains/losses on short-term assets and liabilities, and other items that are not indicative of the Company’s core operating performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure for determining operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s calculation of Revenue excluding foreign currency exchange impacts for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023 is as follows: Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 December 31, 2023 Revenue as reported $ 140,997 $ 578,634 Foreign currency impact (1,611) 258 Revenue excluding foreign currency exchange impacts $ 139,386 $ 578,892 The Company’s calculation of organic growth for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023 is as follows: Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 December 31, 2023 Revenue increase year over year 7.6% 15.0% Less: Impact of acquisitions and foreign currency 2.0% 1.9% Organic growth 5.6% 13.1% The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 is as follows: Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net income $ 4,347 $ 3,696 $ 24,097 $ 17,389 Interest expense 3,074 2,792 12,383 7,692 (Benefit) provision for income tax (424) 1,414 5,603 6,292 Depreciation and amortization 6,112 6,264 25,068 25,486 EBITDA 13,109 14,166 67,151 56,859 Stock-based compensation expense 1,312 1,321 5,477 5,073 Foreign currency loss 24 244 281 298 Business development costs 2,484 855 4,275 3,319 Adjusted EBITDA $ 16,929 $ 16,586 $ 77,184 $ 65,549 ALLIENT INC. Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share to Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share (In thousands, except per share data) (Unaudited) The Company’s calculation of Adjusted net income and Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 is as follows: Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 Per diluted share 2022 Per diluted share Net income as reported $ 4,347 $ 0.26 $ 3,696 $ 0.23 Non-GAAP adjustments, net of tax (1) Amortization of intangible assets - net 2,685 0.16 2,395 0.15 Foreign currency gain/ loss - net 26 - 187 0.01 Business development costs - net 2,014 0.13 655 0.04 Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS $ 9,072 $ 0.55 $ 6,933 $ 0.43 Weighted average diluted shares outstanding 16,505 16,145 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 Per diluted share 2022 Per diluted share Net income as reported $ 24,097 $ 1.48 $ 17,389 $ 1.09 Non-GAAP adjustments, net of tax (1) Amortization of intangible assets - net 9,752 0.60 9,812 0.62 Foreign currency gain/ loss - net 223 0.01 228 0.01 Business development costs - net 3,386 0.21 2,542 0.16 Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS $ 37,458 $ 2.30 $ 29,971 $ 1.88 Weighted average diluted shares outstanding 16,272 15,951 _________________________ (1) Applies a blended federal, state, and foreign tax rate of 21% for 2023 and 23% for 2022 applicable to the non-GAAP adjustments. Adjusted net income and diluted EPS are defined as net income as reported, adjusted for certain items, including amortization of intangible assets and unusual non-recurring items. Adjusted net income and diluted EPS are not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP in the United States, and may not be comparable to the measure as used by other companies. Nevertheless, the Company believes that providing non-GAAP information, such as adjusted net income and diluted EPS are important for investors and other readers of the Company’s financial statements and assists in understanding the comparison of the current quarter’s and current year’s net income and diluted EPS to the historical periods’ net income and diluted EPS.

Completed sale of Aluminum Products business and acquired EMA Indutec GmbH for approximately $14 million. Conference call to discuss Q4 and full year 2023 results scheduled for March 6, 10:00 am ET. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in net sales and GAAP EPS from Park-Ohio Holdings Corp. suggests a positive trajectory for the company's financial health. The transition from a loss in the previous year to profit per diluted share indicates a turnaround in operations. The record net sales in each business segment and overall gross margin improvement by 200 basis points year-over-year are significant indicators of efficient cost management and potential pricing power.However, the impact of the UAW strike, which reduced net sales and EPS, highlights the company's susceptibility to labor disputes. Investors should consider the resilience of Park-Ohio's supply chain and labor relations as factors in the company's future performance. Additionally, the strong operating cash flow and free cash flow demonstrate the company's ability to generate liquidity, which has been strategically used to reduce debt and potentially fund further growth. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Park-Ohio's diversified operations across Supply Technologies, Assembly Components and Engineered Products allow it to mitigate risks associated with demand fluctuations in any single market. The reported strong demand in key end markets, such as power sports and aerospace, is indicative of the company's alignment with industry growth areas.Furthermore, the divestiture of the Aluminum Products business, which was generating losses, reflects a strategic move to streamline operations and focus on more profitable segments. The mid-single digit revenue growth projection for 2024, along with expected improvements in EPS and EBITDA, suggests confidence in the company's strategic direction and operational execution, which could influence investor sentiment positively. Legal Expert Regarding the sale of the Aluminum Products business and the subsequent acquisition of EMA Indutec GmbH, these transactions demonstrate proactive corporate restructuring. The divestiture of a loss-making segment and the acquisition aimed at expanding global induction heating expertise could be seen as strategic moves to optimize the company's portfolio. The contingent nature of part of the sale proceeds based on future performance introduces a variable to consider when evaluating the company's expected cash inflows.Legal diligence in such transactions is critical to ensure compliance with international trade and merger regulations. The acquisition of EMA also suggests an expansion of intellectual property assets, which could benefit Park-Ohio's competitive positioning in the induction heating market. 03/05/2024 - 04:10 PM Fourth quarter: Net sales from continuing operations of $389 million, up 2% year-over-year GAAP EPS from continuing operations of $0.54 per diluted share, up from a loss of $(0.58) per diluted share a year ago Q4 results impacted by United Auto Workers strike at light vehicle and heavy truck plants Strong Q4 operating cash flows of $29 million and free cash flow of $22 million Completed sale of Aluminum Products business Full year: Record net sales from continuing operations of $1.7 billion, up 11% YOY, and record net sales in each business segment GAAP EPS from continuing operations of $2.72 per diluted share compared to $0.83 in 2022 Adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $3.07 per diluted share, up 74% compared to $1.76 per diluted share in 2022 EBITDA from continuing operations improved 33% to $134 million in 2023 Strong full year operating cash flows of $53 million and free cash flow of $25 million 2024 Outlook: Revenues expected to grow in the mid-single digit range year-over-year, driven primarily by continued strong demand expected in Supply Technologies and strong backlogs in Engineered Products Expected year-over-year improvement in EPS and EBITDA CLEVELAND, OHIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Park-Ohio Holdings Corp. (NASDAQ: PKOH) today announced its results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. “Our team delivered strong growth of 11% during 2023 even with the adverse impact of the UAW strikes during the fourth quarter. These results represented record revenue for our business in total and for every business segment. Additionally, gross margin increased more than 200 basis points over 2022, and operating cash flow exceeded $53 million, which was used to grow our business and reduce debt. Our strong performance is a testament to the hard work of our teams and strong positioning in the market of our portfolio of brands,” said Matthew V. Crawford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “While we expect our sales growth to moderate during 2024, we will use this opportunity to build on our progress in 2023 to further improve our operating execution and drive further improvements in profitability and cash flow.” FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS In the fourth quarter of 2023, net sales from continuing operations were $389.3 million compared to $381.6 million in the 2022 period, an increase of 2%. Gross margin increased 200 basis points in the 2023 period compared to the 2022 period. Income from continuing operations attributable to ParkOhio common shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $6.9 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $7.0 million, or $0.58 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2022. Excluding special items, adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.54 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to a loss of $0.09 per diluted share in the 2022 period. Our net sales and income in the fourth quarter of 2023 were negatively impacted by the United Auto Workers (“UAW”) strike in September-October 2023, which negatively impacted several OEM customer plants and reduced our net sales and EPS by approximately $25 million and approximately $0.20 per diluted share, respectively. Please refer to the table that follows for a reconciliation of income (loss) from continuing operations to adjusted income (loss) from continuing operations. Full year 2023 net sales were $1.7 billion compared to $1.5 billion in 2022, an increase of 11%. Our 2023 net sales performance was a record for our continuing operations on a consolidated basis, and a record in each of our three individual business segments. Gross margin increased 230 basis points in 2023 compared to 2022. Income from continuing operations attributable to ParkOhio common shareholders in 2023 was $34.0 million, or $2.72 per diluted share, compared to $10.1 million, or $0.83 per diluted share in 2022. Excluding special items, adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $3.07 per diluted share in 2023, an increase of 74% compared to $1.76 per diluted share in 2022. EBITDA, as defined in 2023 was $134.2 million, an increase of 33% compared to $101.0 million in 2022. Please refer to the tables that follow for a reconciliation of income from continuing operations to adjusted income from continuing operations and income from continuing operations attributable to ParkOhio common shareholders to EBITDA, as defined. FOURTH QUARTER SEGMENT RESULTS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS In our Supply Technologies segment, net sales in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $177.5 million, a decrease of 2% compared to $181.0 million in the fourth quarter a year ago, driven by the impact of the UAW strike and lower demand primarily in the heavy-duty truck end market. Our net sales in the quarter were impacted by the UAW strike affecting several OEM vehicle assembly plants. Segment operating income was $14.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $10.3 million in the fourth quarter 2022. Operating income margin was 220 basis points higher in the 2023 fourth quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago due primarily to customer price increases and other profit-enhancement actions. For the full year 2023, net sales increased 7% to a record $763.4 million, as we benefited from strong demand in most key end markets, most notably in power sports, heavy-duty truck, and commercial aerospace, and increased demand for our proprietary fastener products. Operating margin improved 130 basis points to 7.7%, driven by the higher sales and the impact of profit-enhancement actions, including increased product pricing. In Assembly Components, which excludes the Aluminum Products business for all periods presented, net sales were $97.0 million, up 3% compared to $94.6 million in the 2022 fourth quarter. Our net sales in the quarter were impacted by the UAW strike affecting several OEM vehicle assembly plants. Segment operating income was $6.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $0.4 million in the 2022 quarter. On an adjusted basis excluding special charges in the 2022 period related to plant consolidation, operating income was $6.5 million in the 2023 period compared to $1.8 million in the 2022 period. The improvement in segment operating results in the 2023 period compared to the same period a year ago was driven by the benefit of profit-improvement initiatives implemented over the past two years, including increased product pricing and plant consolidation actions, and the profit flow-through from the higher sales levels. For the full year 2023, net sales increased 10% to a record $427.8 million, driven by increased customer pricing and new programs implemented during the year. Operating margin improved 750 basis points to 7.8%, driven by the benefit of profit-improvement initiatives implemented over the past two years, including increased product pricing, and the higher sales levels. In Engineered Products, net sales were $114.8 million in the 2023 fourth quarter, up 8% compared to $106.0 million in last year's fourth quarter, driven by strong demand in both our capital equipment business and our forged and machined products business. In our capital equipment business, new equipment backlog totaled $162 million at December 31, 2023 compared to $163 million at December 31, 2022. Bookings of new equipment in 2023 totaled $175 million compared to $201 million in 2022. Aftermarket net sales continued to be strong and were $40.5 million in the 2023 fourth quarter, up 12% compared to $36.1 million in last year’s fourth quarter. In our forged and machined products business, fourth quarter 2023 sales were up 12% compared to the same quarter a year ago, driven by continued strong demand in certain key end markets, primarily rail and aerospace and defense. Segment operating income in the 2023 fourth quarter was $3.8 million compared to $0.1 million in the 2022 quarter. On an adjusted basis excluding special charges in 2022 related to plant consolidation, segment operating income was $3.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $5.6 million in the 2022 period. Excluding special charges, the profitability decline in the 2023 fourth quarter was driven by lower profitability in our forged and machined products business, which more than offset the strong performance in our capital equipment business. For the full year 2023, net sales increased 19% to a record $468.5 million, driven by our backlogs at the start of the year and higher customer demand in both our capital equipment business and our forged and machined products business. Operating margin improved 30 basis points to 4.1%, driven by profit flow-through from the higher sales levels and implemented operational improvements, which more than offset the lower margins in forged and machined products. LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW At December 31, 2023, our total liquidity was $166 million, which included cash on hand of $54.8 million and $111.2 million of unused borrowing availability under our credit arrangements. In 2023, operating cash flows were $53.4 million and free cash flow was $25.2 million, up significantly compared to 2022. SALE OF ALUMINUM PRODUCTS BUSINESS Effective December 29, 2023, the Company completed the divestiture of its Aluminum Products business to Angstrom Automotive Group (the “Buyer”) for approximately $50 million in cash and promissory notes, plus the assumption of approximately $3 million of finance lease obligations by the Buyer. The loss on sale of the Aluminum Products business was $23.6 million. In 2023, the business generated an EBITDA loss of $0.2 million and negative free cash flow of $6.8 million. The sale proceeds, which were and will be used to repay a portion of the Company’s outstanding indebtedness, consisted of a cash down payment of $20.0 million paid to the Company in December 2022; cash of $15.5 million paid to the Company at closing; and promissory notes totaling $15 million payable to the Company on December 31, 2024, of which $10 million is contingent on the Aluminum Products business attaining certain purchase commitments during 2024. 2024 OUTLOOK - CONTINUING OPERATIONS For 2024, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digit range year-over-year, driven by continued strong demand expected in most end markets in Supply Technologies and Assembly Components and the strength of our backlog in Engineered Products. In addition, we expect year-over-year improvement in EPS and EBITDA. SUBSEQUENT EVENT – ACQUISITION OF EMA INDUTEC GmbH Effective February 29, 2024, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of EMA Indutec GmbH (“EMA”), headquartered in Meckesheim, Germany, from the Aichelin Group, headquartered in Modling, Austria. EMA, a leading manufacturer of induction heating equipment and converters, operates through its two locations in Meckesheim, Germany and Beijing, China. The acquisition strengthens our global induction heating expertise throughout Europe and expands our portfolio of induction equipment brands and our aftermarket service capabilities. The cash purchase price was approximately $14 million. Mr. Crawford stated, “The strategic acquisition of EMA will expand our leading global induction business throughout Germany and will be immediately accretive to our margins. We expect revenues from EMA over the next twelve months to exceed $30 million.""

Adjusted earnings (loss) is not a measure of performance under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, income (loss) from continuing operations calculated in accordance with GAAP.

The Company presents this non-GAAP financial measure because management uses EBITDA, as defined to assess the Company's performance and believes that EBITDA is useful to investors as an indication of the Company's compliance with its Debt Service Ratio covenant in its revolving credit facility. Additionally, EBITDA, as defined is a measure used under the Company's revolving credit facility to determine whether the Company may incur additional debt under such facility. EBITDA, as defined is not a measure of performance under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, net loss or cash flow information calculated in accordance with GAAP.

The underwriters have a 30-day option to purchase more shares. The Company's senior management team, board of directors, and Chairman's family member plan to buy $867,000 worth of shares at the offering price. The Offering is not by the Company itself, and it will not receive any proceeds from the sale. The Offering is made under a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC. Positive None. Negative None. Market Analyst The announcement of a secondary offering by Landsea Homes Corporation's largest stockholder is a significant event with potential implications for the stock's liquidity and market perception. The offering of 2,434,783 shares, with an additional option for underwriters to purchase up to 365,217 shares, could lead to an increase in the stock's float, which is the number of shares available for public trading. A larger float often results in reduced volatility and potentially more gradual price movements. However, it may also dilute existing shareholders' equity if the market perceives the offering as a sign that the largest stockholder is reducing their stake due to a lack of confidence in the company's future prospects.Furthermore, the participation of senior management and a family member of the Chairman in purchasing a substantial amount of shares could be interpreted as a vote of confidence, potentially offsetting negative investor sentiment. The pricing of these shares at the same level as the offering price suggests alignment with external investors, which might be viewed favorably by the market. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the fact that Landsea Homes will not receive any proceeds from the sale is crucial. This means the company's capital structure and cash reserves are not directly affected by this transaction. However, the secondary offering could impact the company's stock price, as the market absorbs the additional shares. The involvement of reputable financial institutions as bookrunners and co-managers, such as B. Riley Securities and BofA Securities, indicates a well-structured offering that might be executed efficiently.Investors should closely monitor the aftermarket performance of the stock following the offering. The shelf registration statement on Form S-3 suggests that the company has prepared for potential future securities offerings, which could indicate strategic financial planning for growth or acquisitions. Legal Expert Legally, the offering is structured to comply with SEC regulations, as evidenced by the use of a shelf registration statement on Form S-3. This form is commonly used by public companies to register securities that may be offered in one or more future transactions. The effectiveness of the registration statement and the role of the prospectus supplement are key in ensuring that all transactions are conducted lawfully and transparently.It's also important to note that the press release explicitly states that this shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy in any state or jurisdiction where such an offer would be unlawful. This caution highlights the company's compliance with state and federal securities laws, which is a critical aspect for investor confidence. 03/05/2024 - 05:00 PM DALLAS, March 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Landsea Homes Corporation (Nasdaq: LSEA) (“Landsea Homes” or the “Company”), a publicly traded residential homebuilder, announced today that its largest stockholder, Landsea Holdings Corporation (the “Selling Stockholder”), has commenced a secondary offering of 2,434,783 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Offering”).

Financial Analyst The reported financial results of Greenlight Capital Re, Ltd. indicate a significant turnaround in underwriting performance, with a full-year underwriting income of $32.0 million compared to a loss in the previous year. This is a critical metric for assessing the health of an insurance company, as underwriting income reflects the profitability of its core business operations, excluding investment activities. The improvement in the combined ratio from 102.3% to 94.5% suggests increased underwriting efficiency and pricing accuracy. However, the decrease in total investment income year-over-year, from $69.0 million to $66.1 million, warrants attention as it may signal a potential area of concern in the company's investment strategy or market volatility.From an investor's perspective, the substantial increase in net income and the 16.8% rise in fully diluted book value per share are positive indicators of the company's financial strength and shareholder value creation. These figures are especially important when evaluating the company's performance relative to its peers and the broader insurance sector. The reported growth in gross premiums written across all categories signifies market expansion and the ability to attract new business, which is essential for long-term sustainability. Market Research Analyst Greenlight Capital Re's performance reflects broader trends in the reinsurance industry, where companies have been adjusting their pricing models in response to past catastrophic events and market conditions. The reported increase in underwriting income and improved combined ratio are indicative of successful repricing and risk management strategies. Such strategies are particularly relevant in today's insurance market, which has been affected by various global challenges, including climate change and geopolitical tensions.It's also noteworthy that the company's net premiums earned outpaced the growth of gross premiums written, suggesting that the company's underwriting book is maturing and that there is effective management of premium recognition over time. This could point to a stable revenue base for future quarters. The reported reduction in gross premiums written in the fourth quarter, attributed to timing-related premium adjustments, may raise questions about the predictability of premium flows, but the overall annual growth trend remains positive. Economist The reported foreign exchange gains, largely attributed to the strengthening of the pound sterling, highlight the influence of currency fluctuations on international businesses like Greenlight Capital Re. While beneficial in this reporting period, reliance on such gains can introduce volatility to net income. It is essential for stakeholders to consider the potential impact of ongoing currency and geopolitical risks on future financial performance.Additionally, the overall economic environment, including interest rate movements and investment market dynamics, will continue to play a significant role in the performance of the company's investment portfolio. The modest return of 0.3% from the Solasglas fund, managed by DME Advisors, may reflect cautious investment strategies or underperforming markets. Stakeholders should monitor these aspects, as they could affect the company's investment income and, consequently, its comprehensive income. 03/05/2024 - 04:15 PM Achieves Record Underwriting Income of $32.0 million for Full Year 2023GRAND CAYMAN, Cayman Islands, March 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Greenlight Capital Re, Ltd.

We successfully executed several executive management transitions and believe we are well positioned going into 2024.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Results Gross premiums written in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $112.3 million, compared to $127.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The $15.1 million decrease, or 11.8%, was timing-related primarily due to premium adjustments recorded in the fourth quarter based on revised premium estimates and updated reporting received from cedents. Earned premiums increased by $26.1 million, or 23.4%, to $137.4 million as the growth in premiums written throughout 2023 continued to earn out. The Company recognized net underwriting income of $11.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. By comparison, the equivalent period in 2022 recognized net underwriting income of $6.5 million. The combined ratio for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 91.4%, compared to 94.2% for the equivalent period in 2022. The current-year loss ratio improved by 3.8%, driven by improved pricing on the in-force underwriting book. The Company’s total investment income during the fourth quarter of 2023 was $13.6 million. The Company’s investment in the Solasglas fund, managed by DME Advisors, returned 0.3%, representing net income of $0.9 million. The Company reported $12.7 million of other investment income, primarily from interest earned on its restricted cash and cash equivalents. The Company reported foreign exchange gains $3.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2023, due primarily to the pound sterling strengthening. The net income of $17.6 million contributed to the 3.7% increase in fully diluted book value per share for the quarter, which increased to $16.74 per share at December 31, 2023. Full Year 2023 Results Gross premiums written were $636.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $73.6 million, or 13.1%, compared to the comparable 2022 period. The increase was across all three categories as Property, Casualty, and Specialty premiums written increased 32.8%, 8.0%, and 12.9%, respectively. Net premiums earned were $583.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $113.7 million, or 24.2%, compared to the equivalent 2022 period. The Company reported an underwriting income for the year ended December 31, 2023, of $32.0 million, which equates to a combined ratio of 94.5%. The equivalent 2022 period incurred an underwriting loss of $10.7 million, representing a combined ratio of 102.3%. The underwriting income for the year ended December 31, 2023, was driven primarily by lower catastrophe losses and favorable pricing in 2023, partially offset by strengthened reserves relating to prior years. By comparison, the underwriting loss for the year ended December 31, 2022, included losses related to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict and various natural catastrophe events. Total investment income for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $66.1 million, compared to $69.0 million during the equivalent 2022 period. The Company’s investment in the Solasglas fund generated income of $28.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $54.8 million during the equivalent 2022 period. The Company reported foreign exchange gains of $11.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, due primarily to the pound sterling strengthening. The net income of $86.8 million contributed to the 16.8% increase in fully diluted book value per share for the year, which increased to $16.74 per share at December 31, 2023.

Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure, as defined in SEC Regulation G, is a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented under U.S. GAAP. We believe that these measures, which may be calculated or defined differently by other companies, provide consistent and comparable metrics of our business performance to help shareholders understand performance trends and facilitate a more thorough understanding of the Company’s business. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as substitutes for those determined under U.S. GAAP. The key non-GAAP financial measures used in this Annual Report are: Fully diluted book value per share; andNet underwriting income (loss). These non-GAAP financial measures are described below. Fully Diluted Book Value Per Share Our primary financial goal is to increase fully diluted book value per share over the long term. We use fully diluted book value as a financial measure in our incentive compensation plan. We believe that long-term growth in fully diluted book value per share is the most relevant measure of our financial performance because it provides management and investors a yardstick to monitor the shareholder value generated. Fully diluted book value per share may also help our investors, shareholders, and other interested parties form a basis of comparison with other companies within the property and casualty reinsurance industry. Fully diluted book value per share should not be viewed as a substitute for the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure, which in our view is the basic book value per share. We calculate basic book value per share as (a) ending shareholders' equity, divided by (b) the total ordinary shares issued and outstanding, as reported in the consolidated financial statements. In prior years, we calculated the basic book value per share by modifying the denominator to exclude unearned performance-based restricted shares granted after December 31, 2021. We have revised this calculation in 2023 to eliminate the basic book value per share non-GAAP financial measure and have restated the 2022 comparative basic book value per share in the table below and elsewhere in this Annual Report to conform with the current presentation. Fully diluted book value per share represents basic book value per share combined with any dilutive impact of in-the-money stock options and all outstanding restricted stock units “RSUs”. We believe these adjustments better reflect the ultimate dilution to our shareholders. The following table presents a reconciliation of the fully diluted book value per share to basic book value per share (the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure): December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 June 30, 2023 March 31, 2023December 31, 2022Numerator for basic and fully diluted book value per share: Total equity as reported under U.S. GAAP$596,095 $575,865 $561,121 $510,041$503,120Denominator for basic and fully diluted book value per share: Ordinary shares issued and outstanding as reported and denominator for basic book value per share 35,336,732 35,337,407 35,272,013 35,262,678 34,824,061Add: In-the-money stock options and all outstanding RSUs 264,870 312,409 312,409 312,409 277,960Denominator for fully diluted book value per share 35,601,602 35,649,816 35,584,422 35,575,087 35,102,021 Basic book value per share$16.87 $16.30 $15.91 $14.46$14.45Fully diluted book value per share$16.74 $16.15 $15.77 $14.34$14.33 Net Underwriting Income (Loss) One way that we evaluate the Company’s underwriting performance is by measuring net underwriting income (loss). We do not use premiums written as a measure of performance. Net underwriting income (loss) is a performance measure used by management to evaluate the fundamentals underlying the Company’s underwriting operations. We believe that the use of net underwriting income (loss) enables investors and other users of the Company’s financial information to analyze our performance in a manner similar to how management analyzes performance. Management also believes this measure follows industry practice and allows the users of financial information to compare the Company’s performance with that of our industry peer group. Net underwriting income (loss) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes items used to calculate net income before taxes under U.S. GAAP. We calculate net underwriting income (loss) as net premiums earned less net loss and loss adjustment expenses, acquisition costs, underwriting expenses (including related G&A expenses), and deposit interest expense. The measure excludes, on a recurring basis: (1) investment income (loss); (2) other income (expense) not related to underwriting, including foreign exchange gains or losses, and Lloyd’s interest income and expense; (3) corporate G&A expenses; and (4) interest expense. We exclude total investment income or loss, foreign exchange gains or losses, and Lloyd’s interest income or expense as we believe these items are influenced by market conditions and other factors unrelated to underwriting decisions. Additionally, we exclude corporate G&A and interest expenses because these costs are generally fixed and not incremental to or directly related to our underwriting operations. We believe all of these amounts are largely independent of our underwriting process, and including them could hinder the analysis of trends in our underwriting operations. Net underwriting income (loss) should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP net income before income taxes. The reconciliations of net underwriting income (loss) to income (loss) before income taxes (the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) on a consolidated basis are shown below: Three months ended December 31 Year ended December 31 2023 2022 2023 2022 ($ in thousands)Income (loss) before income tax$17,595 $34,757 $86,930 $24,526 Add (subtract): Total investment (income) loss (13,567) (32,531) (66,063) (68,983)Other non-underwriting (income) expense (4,473) (1,597) (17,872) 11,777 Corporate expenses 9,833 5,100 23,653 17,793 Interest expense 2,367 790 5,344 4,201 Net underwriting income (loss)$11,755 $6,519 $31,992 $(10,686) What was Greenlight Capital Re, Ltd.'s underwriting income for full year 2023?

(FLXS) announces a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. The dividend is payable on April 4, 2024, to shareholders of record as of March 26, 2024. This marks the 329th consecutive quarterly cash dividend for Flexsteel. Flexsteel has a strong track record of paying cash dividends on its common stock since 1938. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a quarterly dividend by Flexsteel Industries represents a signal of stability and shareholder value proposition. The consistency of dividend payments since 1938, including the 329th consecutive payment, is a testament to the company's financial health and commitment to returning capital to shareholders. It's crucial to examine the dividend yield, which is calculated by dividing the annual dividends per share by the stock's price. This metric can be compared against industry averages and fixed income alternatives to assess the attractiveness of Flexsteel's stock as an income-generating investment.Moreover, the dividend policy can also be reflective of the company's capital allocation strategy. A stable or increasing dividend may indicate that the company has a steady cash flow and a mature business model, whereas companies in growth phases might reinvest profits back into the business rather than pay out dividends. Investors should consider the payout ratio, the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends, to evaluate the sustainability of these payments in the long term. Market Research Analyst Flexsteel Industries' dividend announcement can also be viewed from a market sentiment perspective. Dividends are often seen as a barometer for a company's confidence in its future earnings. A consistent dividend history can enhance the company's reputation among investors as a reliable stock, potentially attracting a certain class of income-focused investors. This could have implications for the stock's liquidity and volatility.However, it is important to contextualize this dividend announcement within the broader furniture industry. Factors such as consumer spending trends, housing market health and import tariffs can significantly impact the industry's performance. Understanding these macroeconomic indicators and industry-specific challenges is crucial for a holistic analysis of Flexsteel's financial outlook and the potential impact of this dividend declaration on its stock performance. 03/05/2024 - 04:10 PM DUBUQUE, Iowa--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Flexsteel Industries, Inc.

(NASDAQ:PCT) provided a corporate update for Q4 and FY 2023, focusing on improvements made to the Ironton purification facility. The CEO highlighted progress towards expected capacity rates and ongoing work to address operational limitations.","PureCycle Technologies Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year Ending 2023 Update Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary PureCycle Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:PCT) provided a corporate update for Q4 and FY 2023, focusing on improvements made to the Ironton purification facility. The CEO highlighted progress towards expected capacity rates and ongoing work to address operational limitations. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst PureCycle Technologies' recent update on their Ironton purification facility indicates a strategic move to optimize operations. The improvements made in the fourth quarter are aimed at enhancing the facility's capacity rates, which is crucial for the company's scalability and future revenue potential. The focus on addressing the displacement rate of co-product two suggests that PureCycle is not only improving current processes but also preemptively tackling potential bottlenecks that could affect production efficiency. From a market perspective, these operational advancements are likely to be viewed positively by investors, as they demonstrate the company's commitment to refining its technological edge and maintaining competitive advantage. The proactive approach to engineering solutions may also signal to the market that management is effectively controlling operational risks, which is pivotal for investor confidence. Financial Analyst Operational efficiency directly influences the cost structure and profit margins of a company like PureCycle Technologies. The enhancements to the Ironton facility, particularly the corrective engineering designs, suggest a capital expenditure that should be scrutinized for its return on investment. If the upgrades lead to a sustained increase in capacity utilization, this could translate to higher throughput and better economies of scale, potentially improving the company's financial outlook. Investors should consider the timing of these upgrades and the expected completion date in relation to the company's financial reporting cycle. Any delays or cost overruns could impact financial projections and stock performance. Conversely, successful implementation within budget and time constraints could enhance PureCycle's fiscal health and its ability to attract further investment. Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Analyst PureCycle's focus on plastic recycling positions the company within the broader context of environmental sustainability, a factor increasingly important to socially responsible investors. Enhancing the efficiency of the Ironton facility not only has potential business benefits but also aligns with environmental objectives by potentially reducing waste and improving the sustainability of plastic products. This could have positive implications for the company's ESG ratings. ESG-conscious investors often look for companies that demonstrate clear progress towards sustainability goals. PureCycle's improvements and engineering upgrades may reflect a commitment to reducing the environmental footprint of their operations, which can contribute to a positive perception among this investor demographic. 03/05/2024 - 04:05 PM ORLANDO, FL / ACCESSWIRE / March 5, 2024 / PureCycle Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:PCT), a U.S.-based company revolutionizing plastic recycling, today, announced a corporate update for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ending December 31, 2023.Management CommentaryPureCycle Chief Executive Officer Dustin Olson said, ""Our team made several improvements to the Ironton purification facility in the fourth quarter, which allowed us to make good progress towards continuously running the Ironton Facility at expected capacity rates. We continue to work through some limitations, such as the rate of displacement of co-product two from the system. Corrective engineering designs have been completed for an upgrade to the co-product area and work has already begun on the installation. I am proud of what the Ironton team has accomplished to date, and I am excited about our opportunities in 2024.""Olson added, ""In early March, the Company purchased approximately 99% of its $249.5 million revenue bonds that were issued to fund construction of the Ironton Facility. The purchase of the revenue bonds removed substantially all restrictive covenants and events of default and should lead us to an improved capital structure with greater operational flexibility.""Ironton Facility UpdateA majority of the fourth quarter was spent making improvements to the Ironton Facility, including the installation of an automatic screen changer on the final product extruder. Downtime in the fourth quarter plus a planned outage in November limited the total pellet production to approximately 200,000 pounds in the quarter. The improvements made during the outage have led to increases in production levels. The Company produced more than one million pounds of pellets in the first two months of 2024. The Company believes that it continues to make good progress towards sustained commercial operations.Ironton Bond PurchaseAs previously disclosed, the Company purchased $246.7 million of its $249.5 million Southern Ohio Port Authority revenue bonds, which included approximately 99% of the Series A issues, and 100% of each of the Series B and C issues.

Financial Analyst The secondary public offering by a significant shareholder of NAPCO Security Technologies represents a notable event for current and potential investors. It is critical to assess the liquidity and market conditions that could influence the success of this offering. The involvement of established financial institutions as book-runners and lead managers, such as Needham & Company and TD Cowen, suggests a structured approach to the sale, likely aimed at optimizing the offering price and ensuring a smooth transaction process.Investors should consider the implications of this offering on share price volatility in the short term, as large volume trades can lead to price movements. However, since NAPCO is not issuing new shares, there will be no dilution of existing shareholders' equity, which is a positive aspect for current investors. The decision by the Selling Stockholder to sell a portion of their holdings may be interpreted in various ways, but without further information, it is speculative to conclude the rationale behind this move. Market Research Analyst Understanding the context within the security technology industry is essential when evaluating the potential impact of the secondary public offering. NAPCO's position as a leading provider of high-tech electronic security devices and school safety solutions places it within a market that is sensitive to both technological advancements and regulatory changes. This offering could be indicative of the Selling Stockholder's belief in the need to reallocate assets or diversify their investment portfolio, rather than a reflection on NAPCO's future prospects.Market trends in security technology show a growing demand for innovative solutions, which could imply a positive long-term outlook for NAPCO. However, potential investors should conduct due diligence on the company's performance, competitive position and growth strategy to make informed decisions.

This process allows for a quicker response to market conditions, as it is already pre-filed with the SEC and automatically effective.

Full-year 2023 net sales were $594 million, with net income of $28 million. The company repurchased shares, reduced debt, and advanced low-carbon projects. Market outlook shows expectations for strong demand for nitrogen fertilizers and ammonia pricing moderation in 2024. Positive Strong net sales of $133 million in Q4 2023 despite a net loss of $5 million for LSB Industries. Full-year 2023 results saw net sales of $594 million and net income of $28 million. LSB repurchased shares, reduced debt by 18%, and had total cash of $306 million as of December 31, 2023. Advancing low-carbon projects like the Houston Ship Channel ammonia plant and El Dorado carbon capture project. Market outlook indicates strong demand for nitrogen fertilizers and moderation in ammonia pricing in 2024. Negative Net loss of $5 million in Q4 2023 compared to net income of $66 million in Q4 2022. Significant decline in net sales from $902 million in full-year 2022 to $594 million in full-year 2023. Lower adjusted EBITDA of $133 million in 2023 compared to $415 million in 2022. Delay in the expansion of the El Dorado facility's production capacity. Financial Analyst The reported financial results from LSB Industries indicate a substantial year-over-year decline in net sales and net income for both the fourth quarter and the full year of 2023. This decline is particularly notable given the 43% decrease in net sales in Q4 and the 34% decrease in annual net sales, alongside a sharp drop in net income from $66 million in Q4 2022 to a net loss of $5 million in Q4 2023. The earnings per share (EPS) also reflected this downturn, moving from $0.83 in Q4 2022 to -$0.07 in Q4 2023.From a financial perspective, the repurchasing of shares and reduction of total debt by 18% are positive steps towards strengthening the balance sheet. However, the decline in average selling prices for their products, particularly ammonia, which saw a 62% reduction, is concerning as it suggests a weaker pricing environment. This could be indicative of broader market challenges or increased competition. The company's focus on safety and operational improvements, as reflected in the 'world-class' TRIR, is commendable and may contribute to long-term operational efficiency and cost savings. Market Research Analyst LSB Industries' performance must be contextualized within the broader market trends affecting the chemical and agricultural sectors. The increase in urea prices, due in part to Chinese export limitations and the anticipated strong demand for nitrogen fertilizers in the upcoming planting season, could provide a tailwind for the company in 2024. However, the reported moderation in ammonia pricing and the sluggish demand from the industrial sector in Europe and Asia pose risks to the company's international sales prospects.Moreover, the company's strategic pivot towards low-carbon ammonia production aligns with the growing global emphasis on clean energy and sustainability. The collaboration with INPEX, Air Liquide and Vopak Exolum Houston, along with the progress on the carbon capture and sequestration project at El Dorado, positions LSB to potentially capitalize on the anticipated demand for clean energy solutions. The success of these projects could significantly impact the company's growth profile and offer a competitive advantage in the emerging market for low-carbon products. Energy Sector Analyst LSB Industries' investment in a large-scale, low-carbon ammonia project on the Houston Ship Channel is a strategic move that reflects the ongoing energy transition. The company's selection of KBR for the technology licensing and proprietary engineering design and the progress towards the pre-FEED stage are critical steps in project development. These initiatives indicate a forward-looking approach to capitalizing on the growing demand for clean energy solutions, particularly in the context of the global push for carbon reduction.Furthermore, the company's advancement of the carbon capture and sequestration project with Lapis Energy at the El Dorado facility is a significant development. Awaiting EPA approval, this project could enhance LSB's environmental credentials and potentially provide financial benefits through the 45Q federal tax credits for sequestered CO2. The company's ability to secure long-term off-take agreements for low-carbon products could offer a steady revenue stream and contribute to a more sustainable business model. 03/05/2024 - 04:10 PM OKLAHOMA CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- LSB Industries, Inc. (NYSE: LXU) (“LSB” or the “Company”) today announced results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023. Fourth Quarter 2023 Results and Recent Highlights Net sales of $133 million compared to $234 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 Net loss of $5 million compared to net income $66 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 Diluted EPS of ($0.07) compared to $0.83 for the fourth quarter of 2022 Adjusted EBITDA(1) of $25 million compared to $105 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 Cash Flow from Operations of $17 million with Capital Expenditures of $26 million Repurchased 1.2 million shares of common stock for approximately $10 million Advancing new large-scale, low-carbon ammonia project on the Houston Ship Channel Full Year 2023 Results and Highlights Net sales of $594 million compared to $902 million in the full year 2022 Net income of $28 million compared to net income $230 million in the full year 2022 Diluted EPS of $0.37 compared to $2.68 for the full year 2022 Adjusted EBITDA(1) of $133 million compared to $415 million in the full year 2022 Cash Flow from Operations of $138 million and Capital Expenditures of $68 million with Cash Flow Conversion rate of 53% Repurchased $125 million in principal amount of Senior Secured Notes for approximately $114 million reducing our total debt by 18% compared to the end of 2022 Repurchased approximately 3.1 million shares of common stock for approximately $29 million in 2023 Total cash and short-term investments of approximately $306 million as of December 31, 2023 Total Recordable Injury Rate of 0.33 (""TRIR"") for the full year 2023 __________________ (1) This is a Non-GAAP measure. Refer to the Non-GAAP Reconciliation section. “Our fourth quarter results were consistent with our expectations,"" stated Mark Behrman, LSB Industries’ President and CEO. ""While we continued to experience a weaker pricing environment relative to 2022, pricing rebounded off of third quarter lows enabling us to generate a significant sequential top and bottom line improvement. Our fourth quarter results benefited from increased production and sales volumes of downstream products reflecting improved manufacturing operations.” ""Our continued focus on safety resulted in a TRIR of 0.33 for the year representing 'world class' performance. I want to thank our team for all their efforts towards this accomplishment. We generated solid cash flow in 2023 in spite of the headwinds encountered throughout the year. As a result, we were able to further strengthen our balance sheet, positioning us to continue to invest in the reliability and safety of our facilities and return value to shareholders. In addition to the two Turnarounds we'll be conducting at our Pryor and Cherokee facilities during this year's third quarter, we also expect to complete multiple projects that we believe will deliver incremental EBITDA beginning in the second half of the year."" ""We have elected to delay the expansion of the production capacity of our El Dorado facility. After reviewing numerous factors, including current commodity market conditions and the other initiatives we have underway, we've determined that delaying the El Dorado expansion enables us to more effectively deploy resources to our other projects, while allowing us to maintain the strength of our balance sheet.” ""We made meaningful progress in 2023 in achieving our vision to be an industry leader in the energy transition. In October we announced our collaboration with INPEX, Air Liquide and Vopak Exolum Houston to develop a world-scale low-carbon ammonia production and export facility on the Houston Ship Channel. This project will be transformative to LSB’s growth profile given the anticipated demand for clean energy. In the fourth quarter of 2023 we achieved an important step in the project development process when we selected KBR to provide the technology licensing and proprietary engineering design for the ammonia loop portion of the plant. We also recently selected an engineering firm to perform the pre-FEED on our ammonia loop. We expect to complete the pre-FEED during this year's third quarter."" ""We continue to make good progress in the advancement of our carbon capture and sequestration project with our partner, Lapis Energy, at our El Dorado facility. We are focused on completing that project in the first quarter of 2026, subject to the EPA’s approval of our application for a Class VI injection well permit. We’ve been pleased with our commercial team’s ability to leverage this project as part of our new business development efforts as we have been receiving strong expressions of interest in potential long-term off-take agreements for the low-carbon products we will be producing at El Dorado.” Market Outlook Urea prices have moved up recently due, in part, to Chinese urea export limitations; UAN prices are starting to follow Expectations are for strong demand for nitrogen fertilizers in the Spring 2024 planting season: - Current prices for ammonia and other nitrogen products should prove attractive to retailers and farmers - Attractive U.S. corn prices providing support for fertilizer demand Industrial and mining business is robust reflecting: - Steady demand for industrial products supported by resilient U.S. economy - Stable nitric acid demand as impacts of high inflation in the U.S. are offset by global producers shifting production from international facilities to U.S. operations to take advantage of lower energy prices - Demand for AN for mining applications is steady due to attractive market fundamentals for quarrying, aggregate production and U.S. metals Ammonia pricing is expected to moderate further in 2024 after recent pricing declines reflecting: - Heavy ammonia application by U.S. farmers in Fall of 2023 - Natural gas prices in Europe have declined to their lowest levels since 2021 as a result of warm weather and high gas storage levels in the region - Sluggish demand from the industrial sector in Europe and Asia Progress on Low-Carbon Ammonia Projects Houston Ship Channel Blue Ammonia with INPEX, Air Liquide and Vopak Exolum Houston - Feasibility study completed during Q1'23 on a 1.1 million metric ton per year blue ammonia plant utilizing blue hydrogen provided by Air Liquide/INPEX (JV) - Selected KBR to provide the technology licensing and proprietary engineering design for the ammonia loop portion of the plant - Selected engineering firm to perform a Pre-FEED (Front End Engineering Design) to refine cost estimate for ammonia loop underway with expected completion during Q3'24 - FEED study expected to begin in Q4'24 with expected completion during Q3'25 and final investment decision in Q4'25 El Dorado Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) Project with Lapis Energy - Awaiting approval of Class VI permit to construct application by the EPA - Lapis Energy, our partner, will begin construction of the CCS equipment upon approval of Class VI permit to construct - Lapis has ordered long lead time items - Focused on beginning operations in Q1'26 - Expect Lapis, the owner of the CCS equipment, to receive the 45Q federal tax credits for sequestered CO2 and pay LSB a fee for each ton of CO2 captured and permanently sequestered MOU with Amogy to Develop Ammonia as a Marine Fuel - Collaborating on the evaluation and development of pilot program that would combine LSB's low-carbon ammonia and Amogy's ammonia-to-power engine solution - Amogy to test tugboat with engine retrofitted for ammonia as a fuel during Q3'24 Fourth Quarter Results Overview Three Months Ended December 31, Product Sales ($ in Thousands) 2023 2022 % Change AN & Nitric Acid $ 47,959 $ 81,576 (41 )% Urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) 36,621 55,449 (34 )% Ammonia 36,731 83,144 (56 )% Other 11,302 13,485 (16 )% Total Net Sales $ 132,613 $ 233,654 (43 )% Comparison of 2023 to 2022 quarterly periods: Net sales and operating income declined during the quarter driven by lower pricing for all of our products.

These non-GAAP measures are calculated using GAAP amounts in our consolidated financial statements. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) plus interest expense and interest income, net, less gain on extinguishment of debt, plus depreciation and amortization (D&A) (which includes D&A of property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible and other assets), plus provision (benefit) for income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA is reported to show the impact of non-cash stock-based compensation, one time/non-cash or non-operating items-such as, one-time income or fees, loss (gain) on sale of a business and/or other property and equipment, certain fair market value (FMV) adjustments, and consulting costs associated with reliability and purchasing initiatives (Initiatives). We historically have performed turnaround activities on an annual basis; however, we have moved towards extending turnarounds to a two or three-year cycle. Rather than being capitalized and amortized over the period of benefit, our accounting policy is to recognize the costs as incurred. Given these turnarounds are essentially investments that provide benefits over multiple years, they are not reflective of our operating performance in a given year. We believe that certain investors consider EBITDA a useful means of measuring our ability to meet our debt service obligations and evaluating our financial performance. In addition, we believe that certain investors consider adjusted EBITDA as more meaningful to further assess our performance. We believe that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain items. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flow from operations or other consolidated income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, this presentation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of other companies. The following table provides a reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated.

Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Manulife Investment Management closes Manulife Capital Partners VII, a US$752 million private credit fund focusing on high yield with equity upside for U.S. middle market companies. The fund attracted a global investor base and aims for double-digit yields. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The final closure of Manulife Capital Partners VII, a private credit fund of US$752 million, signifies a substantial capital mobilization effort within the private credit sector. The fund's focus on junior credit capital for U.S. middle market companies aligns with a growing trend in private financing where investors seek higher yields coupled with equity upside potential.Investors should note the fund's strategy to target investments in companies with more than $20 million in EBITDA across various industries, which implies a careful selection process aimed at identifying firms with stable cash flows and potential for growth. The diversification across sectors such as Business Services, Industrial Manufacturing, Aerospace & Defense and Building Products could mitigate sector-specific risks and contribute to the fund's overall stability.The commitment from Manulife itself to the fund underscores the confidence of the fund managers in their investment strategy. This co-investment could be perceived as a positive signal to other investors regarding the fund's prospects. Market Research Analyst Manulife Investment Management's announcement reflects the broader industry's appetite for alternative investment vehicles that offer a balance of yield and growth potential. With the private credit market expanding, institutional and private investors are increasingly drawn to opportunities outside of traditional public equity and bond markets.The fund's strategy to deploy capital towards a mix of subordinated and second-lien debt, along with structured and common equity, suggests a nuanced approach to capital structuring that can appeal to investors seeking diversification in their portfolio. The potential for double-digit yield, as mentioned by the co-head of junior credit, indicates a competitive return profile that could attract yield-seeking capital in a low-interest-rate environment.

The agreements span three years and involve a range of services for residential and commercial customers. ICF's proprietary technology platform will enable real-time program monitoring for optimized decision-making. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Market Analyst The contract awarded by Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE) to ICF for implementing the EmPOWER Maryland program represents a significant investment in energy efficiency and demand response initiatives. This move by BGE is indicative of the growing trend among utilities to focus on sustainable energy solutions. The $65 million contracts will likely have a positive impact on ICF's financial performance, considering the size of the deal and the multi-year duration. It also solidifies ICF's position in the market as a provider of energy efficiency services.In the context of the energy sector, demand response programs are critical as they help utilities manage peak load demands without having to invest in new generation capacity, which can be costly and time-consuming to build. This approach is not only cost-effective but also aligns with regulatory pressures to reduce carbon footprints. As utilities are increasingly held accountable for their environmental impact, contracts like these could become more common, potentially opening up new revenue streams for companies like ICF. Environmental Policy Expert ICF's role in supporting BGE's transition to a clean energy future is particularly noteworthy given the current regulatory environment. Maryland's commitment to reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions creates a favorable backdrop for energy efficiency programs. ICF's expertise in navigating this regulatory landscape is invaluable to BGE. The ability to implement programs that align with state policies can enhance BGE's compliance with environmental regulations and contribute to statewide goals for reducing energy consumption.Furthermore, the emphasis on customer acquisition and contractor training indicates a holistic approach to energy efficiency. By focusing on the entire value chain, from customer engagement to the technical implementation of energy-saving measures, ICF is poised to create a more sustainable impact. This strategy not only benefits BGE and its customers but also supports Maryland's broader environmental objectives. Technology Implementation Specialist ICF's utilization of a proprietary utility technology platform to monitor program performance in real time is a significant aspect of this contract. The integration of technology in energy programs is a key differentiator in the market, enabling utilities like BGE to optimize their services dynamically. Real-time monitoring allows for immediate adjustments to improve program effectiveness and customer satisfaction. The ability to streamline customer experience through technology enhances the likelihood of program success and can lead to increased participation rates, thereby amplifying energy savings.The technical and engineering support mentioned, along with rebate processing, underscores the complexity of implementing large-scale energy efficiency programs. ICF's role goes beyond mere consultancy to encompass hands-on operational support, which is crucial for the practical realization of BGE's program goals. The expertise required to manage these technical aspects is specialized and underscores the importance of ICF's role in the successful execution of the EmPOWER Maryland program. 03/05/2024 - 04:05 PM Company Will Implement Statewide Residential and Commercial Programs RESTON, Va., March 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE) has awarded global consulting and technology services provider ICF (NASDAQ:ICFI) over $65 million in re-compete and new contracts to implement EmPOWER Maryland, the utility's statewide energy efficiency and demand response program.

Net loss of $6.3 million for 2023, with adjusted earnings of $2.4 million. Total assets of $82 million, liabilities of $53 million, and shareholders' equity of $30 million at the end of 2023. Negative None. Financial Analyst An analysis of Cumberland Pharmaceuticals' financial results for 2023 reveals a company in a transitional phase. The reported net revenues of $40 million, while substantial, are overshadowed by the operating expenses of $49.1 million, resulting in a net loss of $6.3 million for the year. This loss includes a one-time non-cash charge to intangible assets, which is a common accounting practice when assets become impaired. However, the adjusted earnings of $2.4 million, or $0.17 a share, suggest a more positive outlook when excluding certain non-recurring costs.The balance sheet presents a healthy liquidity position with $18 million in cash and cash equivalents, although the $53 million in liabilities, with $12.8 million on the company's credit facility, indicates a leveraged position. The total shareholders' equity of $30 million provides some cushion, but stakeholders should monitor the company's debt levels and ability to generate cash flow from operations, which stood at $6 million for the year. Medical Research Analyst The expanded FDA approval of Caldolor for use in infants is a strategic development, as it positions the product as the only non-opioid injectable approved for this demographic. This could lead to increased market share in pediatric pain management, especially with the NOPAIN Act potentially offering favorable reimbursement for non-opioid treatments starting in 2025. The published study in Pediatric Drugs supports the safety and efficacy of Caldolor in newborns, bolstering the drug's clinical credibility.Furthermore, the progression of Cumberland's clinical development programs, particularly the Phase II trials for ifetroban, indicates a commitment to addressing orphan diseases with unmet medical needs. The successful dosing of nearly 1,400 subjects and the initiation of the Phase II FIGHTING FIBROSIS trial for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis signal a forward momentum in the company's R&D pipeline, which could lead to long-term growth if these trials result in successful product launches. Market Research Analyst The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and Cumberland's efforts to refine its mission statement and update its sustainability metrics reflect an understanding of the importance of corporate responsibility and brand differentiation. The expansion of the oncology sales division and the introduction of Sancuso to the chemotherapy support market show Cumberland's strategic targeting of niche markets. Sancuso, being the first and only FDA-approved prescription patch for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, could capture a significant market segment if effectively marketed.The company's strategic movements, including the expansion of its product labeling and the progression of its clinical programs, indicate a potential for growth. However, the impact of these initiatives on the company's market position will depend on the successful execution of its sales strategies and the outcomes of its clinical trials. 03/05/2024 - 04:05 PM 2023 highlights include expanded FDA approval and new study publications NASHVILLE, Tenn., March 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: CPIX), a specialty pharmaceutical company, announced today that its product portfolio of FDA-approved brands delivered combined revenues of $40 million in 2023 and provided $6 million in cash generated from operations. Cumberland ended the year with $82 million in total assets – including $18 million in cash, $53 million in liabilities and $30 million of shareholders' equity. ""In many ways 2023 was a building year for Cumberland, as we continued to integrate our newest products, while also delivering several significant achievements,"" said Cumberland Pharmaceuticals CEO A.J. Kazimi. ""We were pleased to expand the labeling for our Caldolor product to include use in infants, while continuing to build our other brands and progress our clinical programs."" Cumberland will report its 2023 financial results and provide a Company update via a conference call today, March 5, 2024, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE YEAR INCLUDE: New Mission Statement In 2023, Cumberland refined its mission statement to better capture the spirit of the Company. It now reads: working together to provide unique products that improve the quality of patient care. In designing this statement, Cumberland considered several factors. The Company wanted its mission to address the constituencies it serves, which include patients in need of care, as well as health care providers and its employees, shareholders, partners and community. It needed to reflect Cumberland's culture, where teamwork is prized, emphasized and expected – in order to achieve the company's goals. It also demonstrates Cumberland's focus on developing, acquiring and distributing differentiated brands. And finally, Cumberland wanted to emphasize that the patient is at the core of everything it does. Its collective efforts are directed at providing unique products that serve as better alternatives for poorly met medical needs. Caldolor® FDA Approval for Treating Infants and Supporting Study Publication The FDA approved expanded labeling for Cumberland's Caldolor product, an intravenously delivered formulation of ibuprofen, to include its use in infants. The non-narcotic agent may now be administered for the treatment of pain and fever in patients 3 to 6 months of age. With this newly approved labeling, Caldolor is the only non-opioid product approved to treat pain in infants that is delivered through injection. Cumberland also announced positive results from a clinical study investigating the safety and pharmacokinetics of Caldolor in newborns, published in the journal Pediatric Drugs. The results of the study support the growing body of evidence that demonstrates Caldolor is a safe therapeutic option available to practitioners for the treatment of fever and pain in infants, children and adults. Federal NOPAIN Act In early 2023, the federal NOPAIN Act was passed, which the Company expects, will provide special, favorable reimbursement for non-opioid products like Caldolor. Cumberland submitted a request to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), to include Caldolor in the favorable reimbursement and expects to learn more this year in preparation for the Act's implementation in 2025. Expanded Oncology Sales Division Cumberland expanded its oncology sales division as it works to deliver its newest brand – Sancuso® – to help cancer patients tolerate their chemotherapy treatments. Sancuso is the first and only FDA-approved prescription patch for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in patients receiving certain types of chemotherapy. Vibativ® Pediatric Study Results Published Cumberland announced a new publication in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy detailing the results of the first clinical study investigating the safety and pharmacokinetics of its Vibativ product in children 2 to 17 years of age. Vibativ is an intravenous antibiotic approved by the FDA for the treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia, as well as complicated skin and skin structure infections caused by certain gram-positive bacteria. The results of the study suggest that a single dose of Vibativ is safe in children and they experience reduced exposure to Vibativ, compared with the same body weight-based dosing in adults. 2023 Sustainability Metrics Cumberland updated its annual sustainability metrics, detailing the company's activities pertaining to its environmental, social and governance matters. Cumberland reported its key findings for 2023, including providing 3 million doses of its FDA-approved products to patients and safely disposing of nearly 6,000 pounds of damaged and expired products. Additionally, Cumberland had no products recalled and no clinical trials terminated due to failure to practice good clinical standards in 2023. Clinical Development Programs Throughout 2023, Cumberland continued to progress its pipeline of innovative products designed to improve patient care and patients' quality of life. Cumberland's ifetroban product candidate – a potent and selective thromboxane receptor antagonist – is being evaluated in three Phase II clinical trials for patients with a series of unmet medical needs. It has now been dosed in nearly 1,400 subjects and has been found to be safe and well tolerated in those individuals. Patient enrollment is well underway in two of those Company-sponsored Phase II clinical programs. The first clinical program involves patients with Systemic Sclerosis or scleroderma, a debilitating autoimmune disorder characterized by diffuse fibrosis of the skin and internal organs. The other clinical program is evaluating ifetroban in patients with cardiomyopathy associated with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, or DMD. DMD is a rare and fatal genetic neuromuscular disease that results in deterioration of the skeletal, heart and lung muscles. Cumberland is sponsoring the FIGHT DMD™ trial, a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase II study enrolling patients across 10 centers in the United States that specialize in DMD. The Company has completed enrollment in the younger age group of patients and now is working to finish enrollment in the older patient group with DMD. The FDA has provided grant awards of over $1 million to support this study. Cumberland is also developing an oral capsule to treat Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, or IPF, the most common form of progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease. Following FDA clearance of its investigational new drug application in May 2023, the Company is now in the process of initiating its Phase II FIGHTING FIBROSIS trial designed to enroll 128 patients in over 20 medical centers of excellence across the United States. Recent studies have shown ifetroban can both prevent and enhance resolution of lung fibrosis in multiple preclinical models. The Company's plan going forward is to complete each of its company-sponsored studies, analyze their final data, announce top-line results and decide on the best development path for the registration of ifetroban, which the Company continues to believe has the potential to benefit many patients with orphan diseases that represent unmet medical needs. FINANCIAL RESULTS: Net Revenue: For 2023, net revenues were $40 million and included $16 million for Kristalose®, $8.8 million for Vibativ®, $8.1 million for Sancuso® and $4.3 million for Caldolor®. Operating Expenses: Total operating expenses for 2023 were $49.1 million. Net Income (Loss): The net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2023, was approximately $6.3 million. Results include a one time non-cash charge to intangible assets of $3.3 million associated with a product discontinuation. Adjusted earnings: Adjusted earnings for the year ended December 31, 2023, were $2.4 million, or $0.17 a share.

These financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""). The definition of these supplemental measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. Because these supplemental financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease the Company's reported results of operations, management encourages investors to review the Company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. A reconciliation of the supplemental financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the tables accompanying this release. Cumberland's management believes these supplemental financial performance measures are important as they are used by management, along with financial measures in accordance with GAAP, to evaluate the Company's operating performance. In addition, Cumberland believes that they will be used by certain investors to measure the Company's operating results. Management believes that presenting these supplemental measures provides useful information about the Company's underlying performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that Cumberland does not believe are indicative of its core business performance or reflect long-term strategic activities. Certain of these items are not settled through cash payments and include: depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation expense and income taxes. Cumberland utilizes its net operating loss carryforwards to pay minimal income taxes. In addition, the use of these financial measures provides greater transparency to investors of supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, including the evaluation of the Company's operating performance. The Company defines these supplemental financial measures as follows: Adjusted Earnings: Net income (loss) adjusted for the impact of income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, share-based compensation, interest income and interest expense. The definition of Adjusted Earnings has been changed to include all gains and losses, as gains are occurring more frequently for the Company. The financial information presented for the year ended December 31, 2022, has been adjusted to be consistent with the current year presentation.(a) Includes $3.3 million impairment loss on intangible assets. (b) Represents the share-based compensation of Cumberland. (c) Represents the write-down of expired inventory. (d) Year-to-date Adjusted Earnings includes a litigation settlement based on two $500,000 milestone payments due to the Company for the license associated with its Vibativ product. (e) Year-to-date Adjusted Earnings includes a gain on the refund of 2022 and 2023 FDA fees in the amount of $2.8 million. Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share: Adjusted Earnings (loss) divided by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding.

(BASE) reports strong financial results for Q4 and FY 2024 with 25% ARR growth, Capella milestone, and revenue increases. Despite positive growth, the company faces operational losses and negative cash flow. Positive Revenue increased by 20% YoY in Q4, reaching $50.1 million, with subscription revenue up by 26% YoY. Annual recurring revenue (ARR) grew by 25% YoY to $204.2 million as of January 31, 2024. Gross margin improved to 89.7% in Q4, with non-GAAP gross margin at 90.4%. RPO increased by 46% YoY to $241.8 million as of January 31, 2024. Full-year revenue increased by 16% YoY to $180.0 million, with subscription revenue up by 20% YoY. Despite revenue growth, the company faced operational losses of $22.6 million in Q4 and $84.5 million for FY 2024. Cash flow used in operating activities was $6.5 million in Q4 and $26.9 million for FY 2024, leading to negative free cash flow. Couchbase announced new features in Capella and Server, extended AI partner ecosystem, and new enterprise features. The company provided financial outlook for Q1 and FY 2025, expecting total revenue and ARR growth while anticipating non-GAAP operating losses. Couchbase won the Best Cloud Data Management Solution award at the 2023-2024 Cloud Awards for Capella's performance. The company will host a conference call on March 5, 2024, to discuss financial results and business highlights. Negative Operational losses of $22.6 million in Q4 and $84.5 million for FY 2024. Negative free cash flow of $7.7 million in Q4 and $31.6 million for FY 2024. Difficulty in providing GAAP targets for operating loss due to unpredictable items like stock-based compensation expenses. Financial Analyst An analysis of Couchbase, Inc.'s financial results indicates a robust year-over-year growth in total revenue and annual recurring revenue (ARR), with a notable 25% increase in ARR. The company's focus on subscription revenue, which grew by 26%, suggests a strategic shift towards stable, predictable income streams. The improvement in gross margin from the previous fiscal year, reaching nearly 90%, reflects operational efficiency and cost management effectiveness.However, the reported operating losses and negative free cash flow raise concerns about the company's current profitability. While the reduction in operating losses and less cash used in operating activities compared to the previous fiscal year signals progress towards financial stability, investors should consider the company's long-term strategy for achieving profitability and the implications of continued investments in growth.The financial outlook for the upcoming fiscal year suggests a conservative revenue growth projection, with an anticipated increase in ARR. The expected decrease in non-GAAP operating loss may indicate management's confidence in continued margin improvement and operational control. However, the inability to provide GAAP targets due to uncertain stock-based compensation charges could introduce volatility in the company's financial reporting and should be monitored closely by investors. Market Research Analyst The introduction of vector search in Couchbase Capella™ and the expansion of the AI partner ecosystem are significant technological advancements that could enhance Couchbase's competitive positioning in the cloud database market. The ability to run adaptive applications across various environments, including offline, positions Couchbase as an innovator in the space, potentially attracting new customers seeking advanced AI-powered database solutions.The enterprise feature enhancements and the launch of Capella iQ indicate a strong focus on improving user experience and developer productivity, which are critical factors in customer retention and acquisition. The recognition as Best Cloud Data Management Solution may further validate the company's product offerings and could act as a catalyst for market expansion and brand credibility.The company's strategic partnerships and integrations, such as those with LangChain and LlamaIndex, demonstrate a proactive approach to leveraging emerging technologies like large language models (LLMs) to drive developer engagement and innovation. The potential impact of these initiatives on market share and customer adoption rates should be assessed over the coming quarters. Legal Expert The mention of non-GAAP financial measures and the exclusion of certain items such as stock-based compensation expense from these measures necessitates a critical examination. The use of non-GAAP metrics can provide a clearer picture of operational performance by excluding non-recurring or variable expenses. However, investors should be aware of the limitations of these measures and consider the full financial picture, including GAAP results, when evaluating the company's performance.It is also important to note the legal and regulatory environment surrounding financial reporting and the implications of using non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results should be transparent and easily understandable to ensure compliance with SEC guidelines and to maintain investor trust. 03/05/2024 - 04:05 PM SANTA CLARA, Calif., March 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Couchbase, Inc.

Couchbase is the first database company to announce it will offer vector search optimized for running onsite, across clouds and to mobile and IoT devices at the edge, paving the way for organizations to run adaptive applications anywhere, including offline.Announced it is extending its AI partner ecosystem with LangChain and LlamaIndex support to further boost developer productivity. The integration with LangChain enables a common API interface to converse with a broad library of large language models (LLMs). Similarly, the integration with LlamaIndex will provide developers with even more choices for LLMs when building adaptive applications. These ecosystem integrations will accelerate query prompt assembly, improve response validation and facilitate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications.Announced new enterprise features, including new file-based index rebalancing, reducing times by up to 80%, one-step upgrade from Couchstore to Magma storage engine without stopping the front-end workloads, faster failover times and query simplification. Couchbase continues to invest at a rapid pace to enhance its platform with new enterprise and developer features.Announced the general availability of Capella iQ, a co-pilot for coding. Capella iQ allows developers to interact with Couchbase Capella using natural language conversation, making database interactions more intuitive, efficient and accessible.Couchbase Capella was named Best Cloud Data Management Solution at the 2023-2024 Cloud Awards for its performance, versatility and community.Financial Outlook For the first quarter and full year of fiscal 2025, Couchbase expects: Q1 FY2025 Outlook FY2025 Outlook Total Revenue $48.1-48.9 million $203.0-207.0 million Total ARR $206.5-209.5 million $235.5-240.5 million Non-GAAP Operating Loss $8.5-7.5 million $27.5-22.5 million The guidance provided above is based on several assumptions that are subject to change and many of which are outside our control. If actual results vary from these assumptions, our expectations may change. There can be no assurance that we will achieve these results. Couchbase is not able, at this time, to provide GAAP targets for operating loss for the first quarter or full year of fiscal 2025 because of the difficulty of estimating certain items excluded from non-GAAP operating loss that cannot be reasonably predicted, such as charges related to stock-based compensation expense. The effect of these excluded items may be significant.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, we believe certain non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance. We use certain non-GAAP financial measures, collectively, to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, may be helpful to investors because they provide consistency and comparability with past financial performance and meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our business, results of operations or outlook. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only, have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly-titled non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures (provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release), and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. Non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating loss, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share: We define these non-GAAP financial measures as their respective GAAP measures, excluding expenses related to stock-based compensation expense, employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions, restructuring charges and impairment of capitalized internal-use software. We use these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP measures to assess our performance, including in the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. Beginning with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we have excluded the impairment of capitalized internal-use software, a non-cash operating expense, from our non-GAAP results as it is not reflective of ongoing operating results. This impairment charge relates to certain previously capitalized internal-use software that we determined would no longer be placed into service. Prior period non-GAAP financial measures have not been adjusted to reflect this change as we did not incur impairment of capitalized internal-use software in any prior period presented. Free cash flow: We define free cash flow as cash used in operating activities less additions to property and equipment, which includes capitalized internal-use software costs. We believe free cash flow is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides our management, board of directors and investors with information about our future ability to generate or use cash to enhance the strength of our balance sheet and further invest in our business and pursue potential strategic initiatives. Please see the reconciliation tables at the end of this press release for the reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results. Key Business Metrics We review a number of operating and financial metrics, including ARR, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions. We define ARR as of a given date as the annualized recurring revenue that we would contractually receive from our customers in the month ending 12 months following such date. Based on historical experience with customers, we assume all contracts will be automatically renewed at the same levels unless we receive notification of non-renewal and are no longer in negotiations prior to the measurement date. ARR also includes revenue from consumption-based cloud credits of Couchbase Capella products. ARR for Couchbase Capella products in a customer's initial year is calculated as described above; after a customer's initial year it is calculated by annualizing the prior 90 days of actual consumption, assuming no increases or reductions in usage. ARR excludes revenue derived from the use of cloud products only based on on-demand arrangements and services revenue. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, and does not represent our revenue under GAAP on an annualized basis, as it is an operating metric that can be impacted by contract start and end dates and renewal dates. ARR is not intended to be a replacement for forecasts of revenue. Although we seek to increase ARR as part of our strategy of targeting large enterprise customers, this metric may fluctuate from period to period based on our ability to acquire new customers and expand within our existing customers. We believe that our ARR is an important indicator of the growth and performance of our business. We also attempt to represent the changes in the underlying business operations by eliminating fluctuations caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates within the current period. We calculate constant currency growth rates by applying the applicable prior period exchange rates to current period results. Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains ""forward-looking"" statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are based on management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, quotations of management, the section titled ""Financial Outlook"" above and statements about Couchbase's market position, strategies and potential market opportunities. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and, in some cases, can be identified by terms such as ""anticipate,"" ""expect,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""believe,"" ""continue,"" ""could,"" ""potential,"" ""remain,"" ""may,"" ""might,"" ""will,"" ""would"" or similar expressions and the negatives of those terms. However, not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including factors beyond our control, which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These risks include, but are not limited to: our history of net losses and ability to achieve or maintain profitability in the future; our ability to continue to grow on pace with historical rates; our ability to manage our growth effectively; intense competition and our ability to compete effectively; cost-effectively acquiring new customers or obtaining renewals, upgrades or expansions from our existing customers; the market for our products and services being relatively new and evolving, and our future success depending on the growth and expansion of this market; our ability to innovate in response to changing customer needs, new technologies or other market requirements, including new capabilities, programs and partnerships and their impact on our customers and our business; our limited operating history, which makes it difficult to predict our future results of operations; the significant fluctuation of our future results of operations and ability to meet the expectations of analysts or investors; our significant reliance on revenue from subscriptions, which may decline and, the recognition of a significant portion of revenue from subscriptions over the term of the relevant subscription period, which means downturns or upturns in sales are not immediately reflected in full in our results of operations; and the impact of geopolitical and macroeconomic factors. Further information on risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from forecasted results are included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that we may file from time to time, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2023. Additional information will be made available in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2024 that will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which should be read in conjunction with this press release and the financial results included herein. Any forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons if actual results differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.

Secures $15.0 Million in Private and Non-Recourse Debt Transaction, Propelling Strategic Growth Initiatives Rhea-AI Impact (High) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Air T, Inc. (NASDAQ:AIRT) closed a $15 million private note transaction with a major pension plan, issuing 7-year notes at 8.5% interest. The transaction allows the company to securitize its ownership in aviation-related joint ventures to raise non-recourse debt, pay down existing debt, and make further investments. Proceeds were used to pay off revolving debt with Minnesota Bank & Trust. CEO Nick Swenson views the transaction positively as a strategic move for the company's growth and future opportunities. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The completion of a $15 million private note transaction by Air T, Inc. with a major pension plan is a significant financial event that merits close examination. This type of transaction typically indicates a strategic move by a company to optimize its capital structure. By securing a 7-year note at 8.5% interest, Air T has locked in a long-term financing rate that, depending on the current interest rate environment, could be advantageous or costly. This rate must be compared to current market rates for similar debt instruments to assess its competitiveness.Securitizing joint venture interests to raise non-recourse debt is a sophisticated financial strategy that may allow the company to leverage its assets without directly affecting its creditworthiness. It's also noteworthy that the company used part of the proceeds to pay down its revolving debt facility. This action could indicate a strategic shift from variable-rate to fixed-rate debt, potentially reducing exposure to interest rate fluctuations. However, it is essential to consider the opportunity cost of this capital reallocation and whether the redeployed capital will generate sufficient returns to justify the transaction. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the announcement by Air T, Inc. may signal to investors and analysts that the company is actively managing its portfolio and seeking to reinvest in its core aviation-related business. This could be interpreted as a positive indicator of the company's growth prospects and confidence in its joint venture interests. The involvement of an experienced aviation investor also adds credibility to the transaction, potentially attracting further investment into the company.However, the specific impact on the stock market will depend on how the transaction aligns with the company's overall strategy and the market's perception of the aviation industry's health. It's also critical to monitor the company's performance in managing the securitized assets, as the success of this transaction hinges on the cash flows generated from these joint venture interests. In the long term, the ability to make additional investments within the structure could lead to diversification and growth, but it also introduces risks associated with the performance of new ventures. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the transaction's structure as a non-recourse debt is particularly interesting. Non-recourse financing is typically less risky for borrowers, as the lender's recourse is limited to the collateral—in this case, the securitized joint venture interests—rather than the borrower's other assets. This structure can be advantageous for Air T, Inc. as it potentially limits the company's liability. However, stakeholders should be aware of the terms and conditions associated with the securitization, as they can significantly impact the company's operational flexibility and financial obligations.Additionally, the use of proceeds to pay down existing debt suggests a strategic approach to liability management. It is important for investors to review the 8-K filing for details on the terms of the notes, the identity of the pension plan investor and the nature of the joint venture interests involved, as these details will provide a fuller understanding of the transaction's legal and financial implications. 03/05/2024 - 04:05 PM MINNEAPOLIS, MN / ACCESSWIRE / March 5, 2024 / Air T, Inc. (NASDAQ:AIRT) (the ""Company"") recently announced the closing of a direct, structured $15,000,000 private note transaction with a major pension plan on February 22, 2024 (the ""Transaction""). The Transaction involved 7-year notes bearing 8.5% interest per annum.The Company believes that the Transaction represents an important step forward as it allows the Company to securitize its ownership in more than fifteen aviation-related joint venture interests, currently managed by its subsidiaries, in order to raise non-recourse debt which the Company can use to pay down other debt, as well as make further aviation-related investments. As part of the Transaction, all of the cash flows from the securitized joint venture interests will be used to pay interest and principal, with the excess available to make additional aviation-related joint venture investments within the structure. The Transaction will also allow the Company to redeploy capital into other opportunities. Some of the proceeds from the Transaction were used to fully pay down the Company's revolving debt facility with Minnesota Bank & Trust.""We believe this transaction represents a win-win result for all parties. We are pleased that we were able to close a transaction of this strategic importance with an experienced aviation investor.

The company is on track for significant growth in the automotive industry. Positive Aeva secures a major production win with Daimler Truck for long and ultra-long range LiDARs and perception software with a $1 billion order book. The company introduces Aeva Atlas™, the first automotive-grade 4D LiDAR powered by cutting-edge silicon innovations. Aeva reports revenue of $1.6 million in Q4 2023 and $4.3 million for full year 2023, showing growth compared to the previous year. The company maintains a strong financial position with cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $221.0 million as of December 31, 2023, and an undrawn facility of $125.0 million. Aeva's GAAP and non-GAAP operating loss decreases in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022, showcasing improved financial performance. The company's non-GAAP net loss per share also improves in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022, indicating positive growth. Aeva is positioned for further growth in the automotive industry with multiple passenger vehicle RFQs and industrial program deployment plans by the end of 2024. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The announcement of Aeva's selection by Daimler Truck for a series production program, accompanied by a significant $1 billion order book, marks a pivotal development for the company. This partnership with one of the world's largest commercial trucking OEMs signals a strong vote of confidence in Aeva's LiDAR technology and its potential for large-scale deployment in the automotive industry. The move towards highway speed autonomy represents a growing market segment and Aeva's positioning within this space is critical as it indicates the company's potential to capture a substantial market share.The introduction of the Aeva Atlas™, touted as the world's first automotive-grade 4D LiDAR, showcases Aeva's commitment to innovation and could serve as a differentiator in a competitive landscape. The integration of Aeva's latest silicon innovations such as the CoreVision™ and X1™ System-on-Chip processor, may provide Aeva with a technological edge, potentially leading to increased market penetration and future revenue streams. Financial Analyst Examining Aeva's financial health, the reported cash reserves of $221.0 million, bolstered by an undrawn facility of $125.0 million, suggest a solid liquidity position that could support the company's operational needs in the near term. However, the reported GAAP operating loss of $36.8 million for Q4 2023 and $147.8 million for the full year, despite being an improvement from the previous year, indicates ongoing challenges in achieving profitability. The non-GAAP figures, which exclude certain expenses, also reflect a similar trend of operational losses.While the revenue growth from $0.2 million in Q4 2022 to $1.6 million in Q4 2023 shows progress, it remains modest relative to the scale of the company's ambitions and the size of the automotive market. The relatively flat year-over-year revenue underscores the need for Aeva to convert its technological advancements and partnerships into substantial revenue growth to reassure investors of its long-term viability. Automotive Industry Expert The adoption of Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) technology, which Aeva's 4D LiDAR utilizes, is significant for the automotive industry. FMCW offers advantages over traditional time-of-flight (ToF) systems, such as improved velocity measurement and resistance to interference from sunlight or other LiDAR systems. Aeva's emphasis on this technology and its integration into Daimler Truck's series production vehicles could catalyze wider industry adoption, potentially setting new standards for autonomous vehicle sensor technology.The strategic partnership with a heavyweight like Daimler Truck not only validates Aeva's technology but could also serve as a catalyst for further deals within the OEM space. The reference to 'multiple passenger vehicle RFQs' suggests that Aeva is actively expanding its customer base, which could lead to diversification of revenue sources and reduced dependency on single contracts, thereby mitigating business risks. 03/05/2024 - 04:05 PM Selected by Daimler Truck for Series Production Program with an Order Book* of $1Bn Announced and Demonstrated Atlas, World’s First Automotive-Grade 4D LiDAR for Mass Production Growing Momentum in Automotive with Multiple Passenger Vehicle RFQs, Including with a New Global Top 10 Passenger Vehicle OEM MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Aeva® (NYSE: AEVA), a leader in next-generation sensing and perception systems, today announced its fourth quarter and full year 2023 results.

Despite lower sales, the company achieved a 7th consecutive year of profitability, with net income of $53.6 million. Paid subscribers increased to 2.77 million, and total users grew to over 8.9 million. The company intends to boost marketing efforts in 2024 to drive interest and demand. Positive Cricut reported a 14% decline in revenue for FY 2023 compared to FY 2022. Net income for the year was $53.6 million, marking the 7th consecutive year of profitability. Paid subscribers increased to 2.77 million, up 6% over FY 2022. Total users grew to over 8.9 million, a 13% increase over FY 2022. The company plans to enhance marketing efforts in 2024 to drive interest and demand. Negative Revenue fell by 18% in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022. Operating income increased by 49% in Q4 2023, but sales declined. The company's promotions uplift was lower than expected due to inventory issues. Financial Analyst The reported net income of $53.6 million and a 7.0% margin for Cricut, Inc. reflects the company's ability to maintain profitability despite a challenging year. The 13% growth in total users and 6% increase in paid subscribers indicate a strengthening customer base. However, the 14% decline in FY 2023 revenue is a significant concern, especially given the competitive creative technology market. The company's operating cash flow of $288.1 million is robust, providing ample liquidity for strategic investments or additional share repurchases. The shift in reporting to 'Platform and Products' segments could provide clearer insights into the company's revenue streams and strategic focus areas.Investors should note the mixed signals: while user growth and operating income are positive, the overall decline in revenue and earnings per share may raise questions about the company's growth trajectory. The 66% of users actively engaging with the product is a strong indicator of customer retention and potential for future revenue through accessory and material sales. The buyback of shares suggests management's confidence in the company's valuation and could be a positive signal to the market. Market Research Analyst Cricut's increased international revenue, which now constitutes 20% of total revenue, showcases the company's expanding global footprint. The launch of new machines like the Cricut Joy Xtra and Cricut Venture could invigorate product lines and potentially attract a broader customer base. However, the decline in attach rates from 33% to 31% might indicate a need for more compelling subscription offerings or marketing strategies to boost this key revenue stream.Understanding the serviceable addressable market is critical and Cricut's reported 7% market penetration in its top 6 markets suggests room for growth. The company's commitment to enhancing marketing efforts and promotional strategies in 2024 is a response to the softer baseline run rate and could be pivotal in driving future sales and user engagement. Economist The reported financials of Cricut, Inc. must be contextualized within the broader economic environment, particularly the consumer discretionary sector. The company's performance amidst a dynamic consumer discretionary environment suggests resilience, but the decline in sales raises concerns about consumer spending patterns and potential economic headwinds. The increased operating income and gross margin improvements reflect cost management and pricing discipline, which are crucial in periods of economic uncertainty.Investors should consider macroeconomic factors such as disposable income levels, consumer confidence and competition within the creative technology space when evaluating Cricut's future prospects. The company's strategic focus on maintaining profitability while navigating market fluctuations demonstrates a prudent approach, but the need to stimulate demand through marketing and promotions indicates sensitivity to consumer spending behavior. 03/05/2024 - 04:05 PM Delivered 7th consecutive year of profitability with net income of $53.6 million, or 7.0% margin Generated $288.1 million in Cash from Operations in 2023 Total users grew to over 8.9 million, up 13% over FY 2022 Paid subscribers increased to 2.77 million, up 6% over FY 2022 Delivered FY 2023 revenue of $765.1 million, 14% decline compared to FY 2022 66% of total users cut on their Connected Machine in 2023 SOUTH JORDAN, Utah, March 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cricut, Inc.

We are encouraged by our 49% operating income increase in Q4 year over year and the positive uplift from our promotions in Q4. However, we were disappointed that sales fell in the quarter and full year by 18% and 14%, respectively. Our promotions uplift was smaller than we expected and is attributable in part to lower retailer inventory, but in hindsight, we could have conducted more aggressive marketing and promotions,” Cricut's Chief Executive Officer, Ashish Arora, said. “We intend to boost our marketing efforts and spending in 2024 to generate more interest and demand throughout the funnel. We will continue our deeper promotional strategy while focusing on maintaining great pricing discipline.

""Although sales were below expectations and the baseline run rate outside of promotional periods continues to be softer than we would have expected, I am encouraged by operating income, which rose 49% in Q4, and we achieved our 20th consecutive quarter of positive net income. We continue to produce strong cash flow on a yearly basis, which supports inventory needs and investments for long-term growth. In 2023, we generated $288 million in cash from operations, compared to $118 million in 2022. We closed 2023 with a cash and cash equivalents balance of $245 million. We have no debt,"" said Kimball Shill, Chief Financial Officer. ""During Q4, we spent $15.7 million of cash to buy back 2.1 million shares of our stock. After the quarter ended and through March 1, we spent $10.8 million of cash to buy back 1.7 million more shares of our stock, which effectively finishes our $50 million approved stock repurchase program that was authorized in August 2022. After three years of business evolution, we are planning to change some parts of our quarterly information package for 2024. We increasingly see Cricut as a platform business with physical products.

The Company provides a fiscal 2024 outlook with revenue expected to decline by 2.0% to grow by 1.0%, and EPS projected at $1.65 to $2.05. Nordstrom focuses on growth strategies including new Rack store openings and digital sales to drive profitability. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported net earnings and diluted EPS for Nordstrom, Inc. align with the company's fiscal 2023 outlook, which could be seen as a positive indicator of stability and a reflection of management's ability to forecast and meet financial targets. A sequential improvement in sales and a double-digit growth for Nordstrom Rack suggests a successful strategy in this segment, potentially due to the value proposition and consumer demand for off-price retail. However, the decline in digital sales may raise concerns about the company's online competitiveness and adaptability to e-commerce trends, especially given the current retail landscape's shift towards digital channels.The 53rd week accounting, which can introduce variability in year-over-year comparisons, is an important consideration for investors as it impacts the revenue figures reported. The impact of the wind-down of Canadian operations is also notable, as it suggests a strategic consolidation and focus on core markets. The gross profit margin improvement, driven by lower markdowns and buying costs, indicates effective inventory management and operational efficiency, a key point for investor confidence in the company's cost control measures.Looking forward, the fiscal 2024 outlook provided by the company, including an expected EBIT margin of 3.5 to 4.0 percent of sales and an EPS range of $1.65 to $2.05, sets a benchmark for future performance. The absence of share repurchase activity in the EPS guidance could imply a more conservative capital allocation strategy. The projected income tax rate of approximately 27 percent aligns with corporate tax norms and should be factored into valuation models. Market Research Analyst The 14.6 percent growth in Nordstrom Rack sales reflects a consumer trend towards value-oriented shopping, which has been particularly strong in the off-price retail sector. This performance is a key driver of optimism for the company's growth strategy, which includes new Rack store openings. The focus on categories like active, beauty and women's apparel where Nordstrom saw the strongest growth could indicate a strategic alignment with consumer preferences and market trends.Despite the positive growth in certain areas, the overall decrease in Nordstrom banner net sales and GMV raises questions about the brand's premium segment's resilience and its ability to compete with luxury retailers and direct-to-consumer brands. The company's emphasis on improving the customer experience and merchandise assortment could be a response to these challenges.The store expansion strategy with 20 new or relocated stores and the announcement of additional store openings could indicate a bullish stance on brick-and-mortar retail, countering the industry's shift to online shopping. This could be a double-edged sword, as physical stores increase operational costs, but also offer a competitive advantage in customer experience. Retail Industry Analyst The decline in Nordstrom's full-price banner sales, both in net and GMV terms, may suggest a need for reevaluation of their full-price strategy, especially in light of the success of the off-price Rack banner. The contrast between the performance of the two banners could reflect differing consumer behaviors and economic conditions, where consumers are seeking value without compromising on brand quality.The store update section highlights an aggressive expansion plan for Nordstrom Rack, which aligns with the current retail trend of investing in off-price formats. However, the closure of one ASOS | Nordstrom store and one Nordstrom Rack store may indicate a recalibration of the company's physical footprint to optimize performance.The supply chain asset impairment charge and its exclusion from adjusted EBIT and EPS figures suggest one-time costs that investors should be aware of, as they can distort the operational profitability picture. The liquidity position, with $1.4 billion available, provides the company with a buffer to navigate market uncertainties and invest in growth initiatives. 03/05/2024 - 04:05 PM Revenue and earnings in line with fiscal 2023 outlookSales in both banners improve sequentially, Nordstrom Rack posts double-digit growth during quarterCompany provides fiscal 2024 outlookSEATTLE, March 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Nordstrom, Inc.

""In 2023, we continued to make progress against the priorities we identified at the outset of the year to improve the customer experience and drive better financial results. Across both banners, we improved our merchandise assortment by effectively managing our inventory levels and investing in the products and brands we know our customers respond to,"" said Pete Nordstrom, president of Nordstrom, Inc. ""This year, we'll build on that progress in merchandising and other green shoots across our business as we focus our efforts on our refreshed 2024 priorities."" As previously announced on February 28, 2024, the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share to be paid to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 12, 2024, payable on March 27, 2024. FOURTH QUARTER 2023 SUMMARY Total Company net sales in the fourth quarter increased 2.2 percent, inclusive of 460 basis points related to the 53rd week, compared with the same period in fiscal 2022. The wind-down of Canadian operations had a negative impact on total Company fourth quarter net sales of 250 basis points. GMV increased 2.0 percent in the fourth quarter and decreased 6.1 percent in fiscal 2023 when compared with the same periods in 2022. Full-year revenue for fiscal 2023, including retail sales and credit card revenues, decreased 5.4 percent.Nordstrom banner net sales in the fourth quarter decreased 3.0 percent, inclusive of 410 basis points related to the 53rd week, compared with the same period in fiscal 2022, improving sequentially from the third quarter. The wind-down of Canadian operations had a negative impact on Nordstrom banner fourth quarter net sales of 355 basis points. GMV decreased 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter and decreased 8.5 percent in fiscal 2023 when compared with the same periods in 2022.Nordstrom Rack banner net sales in the fourth quarter increased 14.6 percent, inclusive of 580 basis points related to the 53rd week, compared with the same period in fiscal 2022, improving sequentially from the third quarter.Digital sales in the fourth quarter decreased 1.7 percent compared with the same period in fiscal 2022. Digital sales represented 38 percent of total sales during the quarter and 36 percent of sales for the fiscal year.Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, of 34.4 percent increased 125 basis points compared with the same period in fiscal 2022 due to lower markdowns, lower buying and occupancy costs and leverage on higher sales.Ending inventory decreased 2.7 percent compared with the same period in fiscal 2022, versus a 2.2 percent increase in sales.Selling, general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses, as a percentage of net sales, of 32.4 percent increased 85 basis points compared with the same period in fiscal 2022, primarily due to higher labor costs and a supply chain asset impairment charge, partially offset by improvements in variable costs from supply chain efficiencies and leverage on higher sales. Excluding the $32 million supply chain asset impairment and related charge, adjusted SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 31.6 percent.EBIT was $215 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with $187 million during the same period in fiscal 2022. Adjusted EBIT of $247 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 excluded a supply chain asset impairment charge. EBIT was $251 million for fiscal 2023, and adjusted EBIT of $567 million excluded charges related to the wind-down of Canadian operations reported in the first and third quarters and a supply chain asset impairment charge in the fourth quarter. EBIT margin and adjusted EBIT margin for the quarter were 5.0 percent and 5.7 percent of sales, respectively. EBIT margin and adjusted EBIT margin for the fiscal year were 1.8 percent and 4.0 percent, respectively.2Interest expense, net, of $26 million decreased from $27 million during the same period in fiscal 2022.Income tax expense during the fourth quarter was $55 million, or 29.1 percent of pretax earnings, compared with $41 million, or 25.2 percent of pretax earnings, in the same period of fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to unfavorable provision-to-return adjustments recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with the same quarter in fiscal 2022.

Adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBIT margin and adjusted EPS exclude certain items that we do not consider representative of our core operating performance. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA is net earnings. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to adjusted EBIT margin is net earnings as a percent of net sales. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to adjusted EPS is diluted EPS. Adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBIT margin and adjusted EPS are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, net earnings, net earnings as a percent of net sales, operating cash flows, earnings per share, earnings per diluted share or other financial measures performed in accordance with GAAP. Our method of determining non-GAAP financial measures may differ from other companies' financial measures and therefore may not be comparable to methods used by other companies. The following is a reconciliation of net earnings to adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA and net earnings as a percent of net sales to adjusted EBIT margin: Quarter Ended Year Ended February 3, 2024 January 28, 2023 February 3, 2024 January 28, 2023 Net earnings $134 $119 $134 $245 Income tax expense 55 41 13 92 Interest expense, net 26 27 104 128 Earnings before interest and income taxes 215 187 251 465 Supply chain asset impairment and related charges 32 — 32 70 Canada wind-down costs — — 284 — Trunk Club wind-down costs — — — 18 Gain on sale of interest in a corporate office building — — — (51) Adjusted EBIT 247 187 567 502 Depreciation and amortization expenses 156 151 586 604 Amortization of developer reimbursements (17) (17) (69) (72) Adjusted EBITDA $386 $321 $1,084 $1,034 Net sales $4,293 $4,200 $14,219 $15,092 Net earnings as a % of net sales 3.1 % 2.8 % 0.9 % 1.6 % EBIT margin % 5.0 % 4.5 % 1.8 % 3.1 % Adjusted EBIT margin % 5.7 % 4.5 % 4.0 % 3.3 % The following is a reconciliation of diluted EPS to adjusted EPS: Quarter Ended Year Ended February 3, 2024 January 28, 2023 February 3, 2024 January 28, 2023 Diluted EPS $0.82 $0.74 $0.82 $1.51 Supply chain asset impairment and related charges 0.19 — 0.19 0.44 Canada wind-down costs — — 1.74 — Trunk Club wind-down costs — — — 0.11 Gain on sale of interest in a corporate office building — — — (0.31) Income tax impact on adjustments1 (0.05) — (0.63) (0.06) Adjusted EPS $0.96 $0.74 $2.12 $1.69 1 The income tax impact of non-GAAP adjustments is calculated using the estimated tax rate for the respective non-GAAP adjustment. NORDSTROM, INC.SUMMARY OF NET SALES(unaudited; amounts in millions) Our Nordstrom brand includes Nordstrom.com, Nordstrom U.S. stores and Nordstrom Local. Nordstrom also included Canada operations prior to March 2, 2023, inclusive of Nordstrom.ca, Nordstrom Canadian stores and Nordstrom Rack Canadian stores, ASOS | Nordstrom prior to December 2023 and TrunkClub.com prior to October 2022. Our Nordstrom Rack brand includes NordstromRack.com, Nordstrom Rack U.S. stores and Last Chance clearance stores. The following table summarizes net sales for the quarter and year ended February 3, 2024, compared with the quarter and year ended January 28, 2023: Quarter Ended Year Ended February 3, 2024 January 28, 2023 February 3, 2024 January 28, 2023 Net sales: Nordstrom $2,866 $2,955 $9,436 $10,279 Nordstrom Rack 1,427 1,245 4,783 4,813 Total net sales $4,293 $4,200 $14,219 $15,092 Net sales (decrease) increase: Nordstrom (3.0 %) (2.4 %) (8.2 %) 6.6 % Nordstrom Rack 14.6 % (8.1 %) (0.6 %) 1.1 % Total Company 2.2 % (4.1 %) (5.8 %) 4.8 % Digital sales as % of total net sales1 38 % 40 % 36 % 38 % 1 Sales conducted through a digital platform such as our websites or mobile apps. Digital sales may be self-guided by the customer, as in a traditional online order, or facilitated by a salesperson using a virtual styling or selling tool. Digital sales may be delivered to the customer or picked up in our Nordstrom stores, Nordstrom Rack stores or Nordstrom Local service hubs. Digital sales also includes a reserve for estimated returns. NORDSTROM, INC.ADJUSTED RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL (""ADJUSTED ROIC"")(NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE)(unaudited; amounts in millions) We believe that Adjusted ROIC is a useful financial measure for investors in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the capital we have invested in our business to generate returns over time. In addition, we have incorporated it in our executive incentive measures and we believe it is an important indicator of shareholders' return over the long term. Beginning in the second quarter of 2023, the Adjusted ROIC calculation was updated to exclude certain items that we do not consider representative of our core operating performance. Refer to non-operating related adjustments included within adjusted net operating profit after tax and adjusted average invested capital. Prior periods have been modified to conform with current period presentation. Adjusted ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, return on assets, net earnings, total assets or other GAAP financial measures. Our method of calculating a non-GAAP financial measure may differ from other companies' methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to Adjusted ROIC is return on assets. The following shows the components to reconcile the return on assets calculation to Adjusted ROIC: Four Quarters Ended February 3, 2024 January 28, 2023 Net earnings $134 $245 Income tax expense 13 92 Interest expense 137 138 Earnings before interest and income tax expense 284 475 Operating lease interest1 86 85 Non-operating related adjustments2 316 38 Adjusted net operating profit 686 598 Adjusted estimated income tax expense3 (172) (162) Adjusted net operating profit after tax $514 $436 Average total assets $8,766 $9,069 Average noncurrent deferred property incentives in excess of operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets4 (157) (197) Average non-interest bearing current liabilities (2,954) (3,185) Non-operating related adjustments5 394 — Adjusted average invested capital $6,049 $5,687 Return on assets 1.5 % 2.7 % Adjusted ROIC 8.5 % 7.7 % 1 Operating lease interest is a component of operating lease cost recorded in occupancy costs. We add back operating lease interest for purposes of calculating adjusted net operating profit for consistency with the treatment of interest expense on our debt. 2 Non-operating related adjustments primarily relate to the wind-down of our Canadian operations for the four quarters ended February 3, 2024 and supply chain impairment and related charges, partially offset by the gain on sale of our interest in a corporate office building for the four quarters ended January 28, 2023. See the Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA section, as well as our 2022 Annual Report, for detailed information on certain non-operating related adjustments. 3 Adjusted estimated income tax expense is calculated by multiplying the adjusted net operating profit by the adjusted effective tax rate (which removes the impact of non-operating related adjustments) for the trailing twelve-month periods ended February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023. The adjusted effective tax rate is calculated by dividing adjusted income tax by adjusted earnings before income taxes for the same trailing twelve-month periods. 4 For leases with property incentives that exceed the ROU assets, we reclassify the amount from assets to other current liabilities and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current and noncurrent amounts are used to reduce average total assets above, as this better reflects how we manage our business. 5 Non-operating related adjustments primarily relate to the wind-down of our Canadian operations for the trailing twelve-month period ended February 3, 2024. NORDSTROM, INC.ADJUSTED DEBT TO EBITDAR (NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE)(unaudited; dollars in millions) Adjusted debt to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent (""EBITDAR"") is one of our key financial metrics and we believe that our debt levels are best analyzed using this measure, as it provides a reflection of our creditworthiness which could impact our credit ratings and borrowing costs. This metric is calculated in accordance with the updates in our Revolver covenant and is a key component in assessing whether our revolving credit facility is secured or unsecured, as well as our ability to make dividend payments and share repurchases. Our goal is to manage debt levels to achieve and maintain investment-grade credit ratings while operating with an efficient capital structure. Adjusted debt to EBITDAR is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, debt to net earnings, net earnings, debt or other GAAP financial measures. Our method of calculating a non-GAAP financial measure may differ from other companies' methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to Adjusted debt to EBITDAR is debt to net earnings. The following shows the components to reconcile the debt to net earnings calculation to Adjusted debt to EBITDAR: February 3, 2024 Debt $2,862 Operating lease liabilities 1,617 Adjusted debt $4,479 Four Quarters Ended February 3, 2024 Net earnings $134 Income tax expense 13 Interest expense, net 104 Earnings before interest and income taxes $251 Depreciation and amortization expenses 586 Operating lease cost1 278 Amortization of developer reimbursements2 69 Canada wind-down costs 284 Supply chain asset impairment and related charge 32 Other Revolver covenant adjustments3 36 Adjusted EBITDAR $1,536 Debt to Net Earnings 21.4 Adjusted debt to EBITDAR 2.9 1 Operating lease cost is fixed rent expense, including fixed common area maintenance expense, net of developer reimbursement amortization. 2 Amortization of developer reimbursements is a non-cash reduction of operating lease cost and is therefore added back to operating lease cost for purposes of our Revolver covenant calculation. 3 Other adjusting items to reconcile net earnings to Adjusted EBITDAR as defined by our Revolver covenant include interest income, certain non-cash charges and other gains and losses where relevant. For the four quarters ended February 3, 2024, other Revolver covenant adjustments primarily included interest income. NORDSTROM, INC.FREE CASH FLOW (NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE)(unaudited; amounts in millions) Free Cash Flow is one of our key liquidity measures and, when used in conjunction with GAAP measures, we believe it provides investors with a meaningful analysis of our ability to generate cash from our business. Free Cash Flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, operating cash flows or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our method of calculating a non-GAAP financial measure may differ from other companies' methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to Free Cash Flow is net cash provided by operating activities. The following is a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to Free Cash Flow: Year Ended February 3, 2024 January 28, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities $621 $946 Capital expenditures (569) (473) Change in cash book overdrafts 2 (14) Free Cash Flow $54 $459 INVESTOR CONTACT: James Duies Nordstrom, Inc.

(WHLR) releases financial and operating results for 2023, accessible on their website. Contact investor relations for more information. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The disclosure of Wheeler Real Estate Investment Trust's annual financial and operating results is a pivotal event for stakeholders, providing a comprehensive overview of the company's fiscal health and operational performance. A Financial Analyst would scrutinize the data within the Form 10-K, which is a detailed report of a company's financial performance, required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for publicly traded companies. This document includes critical information such as revenue, profit margins, debt levels and cash flow statements.Analyzing the year-over-year changes in these figures can reveal the company's growth trajectory or expose potential issues. For instance, an increase in revenue coupled with stable or improving profit margins could signal effective management and a positive market response to the company's properties. Conversely, an uptick in debt or declining cash flows might raise red flags about financial sustainability.Moreover, given the real estate sector's sensitivity to interest rate changes, the current economic climate, with its fluctuating interest rates, could have a significant impact on WHLR's financials, particularly concerning debt servicing costs and property valuation. The analyst would also compare WHLR's performance against industry benchmarks and competitors to contextualize its market position. Market Research Analyst From a Market Research Analyst's perspective, the release of WHLR's financial and operating results offers insights into broader market trends within the real estate investment trust (REIT) industry. This sector is known for its high dividend yields and the potential for capital appreciation, making it a focus for income-seeking investors. The analyst would examine the supplemental information provided, which could include occupancy rates, average lease terms and portfolio diversification, to evaluate the REIT's market strategy and risk profile.Occupancy rates are particularly telling, as they directly affect rental income stability. A high occupancy rate suggests strong demand for the company's properties, which is a positive indicator for revenue sustainability. The average lease term is another critical factor, as longer leases can provide more predictable income streams. Portfolio diversification, in terms of geography and property type, can mitigate risks and enhance resilience against economic downturns.The analyst would also assess the impact of macroeconomic factors such as consumer spending habits, e-commerce growth and urbanization trends on the REIT's portfolio. These factors can influence the demand for different types of real estate, such as retail spaces, office buildings, or industrial properties. Real Estate Economist A Real Estate Economist would concentrate on the economic implications of WHLR's financial results, particularly how they reflect and potentially influence real estate market dynamics. They would evaluate the company's performance in the context of supply and demand fundamentals, real estate cycles and regulatory changes that could affect property investment and management.For example, the economist would analyze whether WHLR's financial results indicate a bullish or bearish outlook on commercial real estate, which could be influenced by current economic policies, demographic shifts and urban planning developments. Additionally, they might explore the effects of tax reforms or zoning laws on WHLR's profitability and asset valuation.Long-term trends such as the shift towards remote work or changes in consumer behavior could also be assessed for their impact on commercial real estate demand. The economist's insights would help stakeholders understand the potential risks and opportunities that lie ahead for WHLR in an evolving economic landscape. 03/05/2024 - 04:05 PM VIRGINIA BEACH, VA / ACCESSWIRE / March 5, 2024 / Wheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc.

(MLNK) reports a 6% year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter, reaching $74.6 million, driven by lending software solutions revenue of $59.5 million.

MeridianLink will host a conference call to discuss its results. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported revenue growth of MeridianLink, particularly in its lending software solutions, is a positive indicator of the company's market position and operational efficiency. The 8% year-over-year increase in this segment suggests that MeridianLink is successfully capitalizing on the demand for financial technology solutions. However, the reported net loss of $(29.6) million, primarily due to a one-time non-cash tax expense, warrants a deeper look into the company's tax strategy and the sustainability of its financial structure. While this loss significantly impacts the reported earnings, it's important to note that the adjusted EBITDA remains strong at 42% of revenue, indicating healthy underlying operational profitability.From a cash flow perspective, the positive cash flows from operations and free cash flow percentages reflect solid liquidity and financial flexibility. These metrics are particularly important for investors as they provide insight into the company's ability to generate cash and potentially return value to shareholders or reinvest in the business. The guidance for the upcoming fiscal year suggests a continuation of revenue growth, which may be a sign of confidence from the management in the company's strategic direction and market opportunities. Market Research Analyst MeridianLink's performance in the financial technology sector should be evaluated against broader industry trends. The company's focus on cross-sell momentum and the expansion of its product suite, such as the integrations with Zest AI and Workato, indicates a strategic move to enhance its competitive edge and deepen its market penetration. The adoption of MeridianLink One and the successful signing of new customers for its point-of-sale solutions suggest that the company is effectively addressing market needs for integrated, efficient lending solutions.Furthermore, the go-live of A+ Federal Credit Union and the reported doubling of instant approval rates for consumer loans highlight the tangible benefits of MeridianLink's offerings to its clients. As financial institutions continue to seek out technological advancements to improve their operations, MeridianLink's ability to deliver results can be a significant factor in its growth trajectory. The company's proactive approach to product and partner expansions is likely to resonate well with current and potential clients, potentially leading to increased market share. Legal Expert The one-time non-cash tax expense that resulted in a net loss for the period is an accounting recognition that requires careful examination. It's indicative of a conservative approach to the valuation of deferred tax assets, which may reflect changes in expected future profitability or tax planning strategies. Stakeholders should consider the implications of such tax treatments and any potential impact on future financial statements. It's also crucial to assess the company's compliance with relevant tax laws and financial regulations, especially as they pertain to non-GAAP financial measures like adjusted EBITDA that are used to evaluate business performance.While non-GAAP measures can provide additional insight into a company's operational efficiency, they should be considered alongside GAAP results for a comprehensive understanding of financial health. The discrepancy between GAAP and non-GAAP operating income highlights the importance of transparency in financial reporting and the need for stakeholders to understand the adjustments made. 03/05/2024 - 04:05 PM Fourth quarter revenue of $74.6 million grows 6% year-over-year driven by lending software solutions revenue of $59.5 million, reflecting growth of 8% year-over-year COSTA MESA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- MeridianLink, Inc.

Internal Controls While we are still completing our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, we expect to report a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as of December 31, 2023. We have identified multiple control deficiencies that aggregate to a material weakness related to the design and operating effectiveness of controls over revenue as of December 31, 2023. This was primarily caused by insufficient controls over the set-up of customer contracts for billing and maintaining complete contract support that were not operating effectively. We can confirm that there has been no restatement of prior period financial statements and no change to our previously released financial results as a result of these control deficiencies. Remediation efforts are currently underway, which include designing and implementing additional review processes, enhanced procedures, and controls, including with respect to customer contracts, as well as system improvements and implementations, staffing and training. Operational Measures Definitions We reference bookings, which is an internal operational measure of the business. Bookings is defined as the total of the minimum annual contracted value for newly sold capabilities of our software-as-a-service, or SaaS, products over a given time period, inclusive of any corresponding vendor fees owed to Third Parties. Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement the financial measures presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we provide certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin; non-GAAP operating income (loss); non-GAAP net income (loss); non-GAAP cost of revenue; non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses; non-GAAP research and development expenses; non-GAAP general and administrative expenses; and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Rather, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when viewed in addition to and not in lieu of our reported GAAP financial results, provide investors with additional meaningful information to assess our financial performance and trends, enable comparison of financial results between periods, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics utilized internally in analyzing and operating our business. The following definitions are provided: Non-GAAP operating income (loss): GAAP operating income (loss), excluding the impact of share-based compensation, employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions, restructuring related costs, and sponsor and third-party acquisition-related costs. Non-GAAP net income (loss): GAAP net income (loss), excluding the impact of share-based compensation, employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions, restructuring related costs, sponsor and third-party acquisition-related costs, and the effect of income taxes, including the partial valuation allowance, on non-GAAP items. The effects of income taxes on non-GAAP items reflect a fixed long-term projected tax rate of 24%. The Company employs a structural long-term projected non-GAAP income tax rate of 24% for greater consistency across reporting periods, eliminating effects of items not directly related to the Company's operating structure that may vary in size and frequency. This long-term projected non-GAAP income tax rate is determined by analyzing a mix of historical and projected tax filing positions, assumes no additional acquisitions during the projection period or include the impact from the partial deferred tax asset valuation allowance, and takes into account various factors, including the Company’s anticipated tax structure, its tax positions in different jurisdictions, and current impacts from key U.S. legislation where the Company operates. We will reevaluate this tax rate, as necessary, for significant events such as significant alterations in the U.S. tax environment, substantial changes in the Company’s geographic earnings mix due to acquisition activity, or other shifts in the Company’s strategy or business operations. Adjusted EBITDA: net income (loss) before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions, restructuring related costs, sponsor and third-party acquisition related costs, and deferred revenue reductions from purchase accounting for acquisitions prior to the adoption of ASU 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers,” which we early adopted on January 1, 2022 on a prospective basis. Deferred revenue from acquisitions prior to the adoption of ASU 2021-08 was recognized on a straight line basis through December 31, 2023. Non-GAAP cost of revenue: GAAP cost of revenue, excluding the impact of share-based compensation, employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions, and amortization of developed technology. Non-GAAP operating expenses: GAAP operating expenses, excluding the impact of share-based compensation, employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions, and depreciation and amortization, as applicable. Free cash flow: GAAP cash flow from operating activities less GAAP purchases of property and equipment (Capital Expenditures) and capitalized costs related to developed technology (Capitalized Software).

No reconciliation is provided with respect to certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures as the GAAP measures are not accessible on a forward-looking basis. We cannot reliably predict all necessary components or their impact to reconcile such financial measures without unreasonable effort.

(NYSE:BOX) reported fourth-quarter revenue of $263 million and fiscal 2024 revenue of $1.04 billion, meeting guidance. The company achieved GAAP operating margin of 8% and non-GAAP operating margin of 26.7%, exceeding expectations. Box also announced a $100 million expansion of its stock repurchase program.","Box Reports Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Box, Inc. (NYSE:BOX) reported fourth-quarter revenue of $263 million and fiscal 2024 revenue of $1.04 billion, meeting guidance. The company achieved GAAP operating margin of 8% and non-GAAP operating margin of 26.7%, exceeding expectations. Box also announced a $100 million expansion of its stock repurchase program. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Examining the reported financial metrics, Box Inc.'s performance indicates a positive trajectory in revenue growth, operating margins and net income per share. The revenue increase of 5% year-over-year and the surpassing of the billion-dollar mark in annual revenue is a testament to the company's scalability and market penetration. The expansion in both GAAP and Non-GAAP operating margins suggests improved operational efficiency, which is particularly notable given the macroeconomic pressures on IT budgets. The company's ability to exceed guidance on these fronts may be indicative of conservative forecasting or operational outperformance, which can be a positive signal to investors regarding management's execution capabilities.Furthermore, the announcement of a new $100 million stock repurchase program could be interpreted as a signal of confidence from management in the company's financial health and future prospects. Stock repurchase programs often aim to return value to shareholders and can potentially lead to earnings per share accretion. However, it's important to consider the opportunity cost of such programs, as these funds could alternatively be invested in growth initiatives. Market Research Analyst The increase in Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) and billings growth suggests a healthy demand for Box's services. RPO growth indicates a strong future revenue pipeline, which is crucial for long-term sustainability. In the context of the industry, the shift towards cloud services and the integration of AI into enterprise operations align with broader digital transformation trends. Box's positioning at the intersection of these trends could be leveraged to capture increased market share. Nevertheless, it's crucial to monitor competitive dynamics as the cloud storage and content management space is highly competitive, with several large players.The mention of advancements in AI and the digitization of business processes aligns with current enterprise needs, potentially increasing Box's relevance in the market. The emphasis on enabling enterprises to address trends in technology underscores the strategic focus on innovation and may resonate with investors looking for growth in the tech sector amidst a digital transformation wave. Economist The reported financial results must be contextualized within the broader macroeconomic environment. Despite persistent macroeconomic pressures, Box Inc.'s performance shows resilience, which could be indicative of strong product-market fit and pricing power. The ability to grow in a challenging economic climate speaks to the essential nature of cloud services for enterprise customers. However, the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates, as noted in the report, is a reminder of the vulnerability of global businesses to currency fluctuations. This could have implications for future earnings, especially if currency volatility persists.It's also notable that the operating cash flow and free cash flow have seen increases, which are critical indicators of the company's liquidity and its ability to self-finance operations and growth. In the long term, sustained free cash flow generation can provide the company with strategic flexibility to navigate economic cycles and invest in growth opportunities without the need for external financing. 03/05/2024 - 04:05 PM Fourth Quarter Revenue of $263 Million and Fiscal 2024 Revenue of $1.04 Billion, In Line with Guidance Fourth Quarter GAAP Operating Margin of 8% and Non-GAAP Operating Margin of 26.7%, Exceeds Guidance Fiscal 2024 GAAP Operating Margin of 5% and Non-GAAP Operating Margin of 24.7%, Exceeds Guidance Fourth Quarter GAAP Net Income Per Share of $0.57 and Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share of $0.42, Exceeds Guidance Fiscal 2024 GAAP Net Income Per Share of $0.67 and Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share of $1.46, Exceeds Guidance New $100 Million Expansion of Stock Repurchase Program REDWOOD CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Box, Inc. (NYSE:BOX), the leading Content Cloud, today announced preliminary financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024, which ended January 31, 2024. “With advancements in AI, companies are accelerating their adoption of the cloud and transforming how they work with their content,” said Aaron Levie, co-founder and CEO of Box. “Box is at the center of some of the most important trends in technology history as companies look to digitize and automate their businesses, accelerate innovation with the power of AI and protect their most important data.

Outlook As a reminder, approximately one third of Box’s revenue is generated outside of the U.S., of which approximately 60% is in Japanese Yen. The following guidance includes the expected impact of FX headwinds, assuming present foreign currency exchange rates. Due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the Yen, we now expect FX to be a 170 basis point headwind to full fiscal year 2025 revenue growth, 70 basis points higher than our previous expectations. For full fiscal year 2025 GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin, we now expect FX to be a headwind slightly more than 100 basis points, incrementally higher than our previous expectations. Additionally, as we have become consistently profitable in our international business, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 we released the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the United Kingdom. Accordingly, in fiscal year 2025 we will be recognizing deferred tax expense in the United Kingdom. This non-cash expense is reflected in our GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per share guidance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and full fiscal year 2025. Q1 FY25 Guidance Revenue is expected to be in the range of $261 million to $263 million, up 4% year-over-year at the high-end of the range, or 7% growth on a constant currency basis. GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately 5.5%, and non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately 25%. GAAP net income per share attributable to common stockholders is expected to be in the range of $0.04 to $0.05. GAAP EPS guidance includes an expected negative impact of $0.04 from unfavorable exchange rates and $0.02 from the recognition of deferred tax expenses in international countries. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders is expected to be in the range of $0.35 to $0.36. Non-GAAP EPS guidance includes an expected negative impact of $0.04 from unfavorable exchange rates and $0.02 from the recognition of deferred tax expenses in international countries. Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 147 million. Full Year FY25 Guidance Revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.08 billion to $1.085 billion, up 5% year-over-year at the high-end of the range, or 6% growth on a constant currency basis. GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately 7%, and non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately 27%. GAAP net income per share attributable to common stockholders is expected to be in the range of $0.22 to $0.26. FY25 GAAP EPS guidance includes an expected negative impact of $0.10 from unfavorable exchange rates and $0.06 from the recognition of deferred tax expenses in international countries. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders is expected to be in the range of $1.53 to $1.57. FY25 non-GAAP EPS guidance includes an expected negative impact of $0.10 from unfavorable exchange rates and $0.06 from the recognition of deferred tax expenses in international countries. Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 149 million. All forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures contained in this section titled “Outlook” exclude estimates for stock-based compensation expense, intangible assets amortization, and as applicable, other special items. Box has provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income per share and operating margin guidance at the end of this press release.

There are a significant number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from statements made in this press release, including: (1) adverse changes in general economic or market conditions, including those caused by the Hamas-Israel and Russia-Ukraine conflicts, inflation, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; (2) delays or reductions in information technology spending; (3) factors related to Box’s highly competitive market, including but not limited to pricing pressures, industry consolidation, entry of new competitors and new applications and marketing initiatives by Box’s current or future competitors; (4) the development of the cloud content management market; (5) the risk that Box’s customers do not renew their subscriptions, expand their use of Box’s services, or adopt new products offered by Box on a timely basis, or at all; (6) Box’s ability to provide timely and successful enhancements, integrations, new features and modifications to its platform and services; (7) actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in Box’s services or any breaches of Box’s security controls; (8) Box’s ability to realize the expected benefits of its third-party partnerships; and (9) Box’s ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and achieve the expected benefits from those acquisitions. In addition, the preliminary financial results set forth in this release are estimates based on information currently available to Box. While Box believes these estimates are meaningful, they could differ from the actual amounts that Box ultimately reports in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024. Box assumes no obligations and does not intend to update these estimates prior to filing its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024. Additional information on potential factors that could affect Box’s financial results is included in the reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K and in other filings Box makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed for the fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2023.

Box does not assume any obligation to update the forward-looking statements contained in this press release to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made. About Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Key Metrics To supplement Box’s consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, Box provides investors with certain non-GAAP financial measures and other key metrics, including non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, non-GAAP net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders, billings, remaining performance obligations, non-GAAP free cash flow and free cash flow margin. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics, please see the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures and certain key metrics to their nearest comparable GAAP financial measures at the end of this press release. Box uses these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics for financial and operational decision-making (including for purposes of determining variable compensation of members of management and other employees) and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Box’s management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Box’s performance by excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of Box’s recurring core business operating results. Box believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics in assessing Box’s performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Box’s historical performance as well as comparisons to Box’s competitors' operating results. Box believes these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics are useful to investors both because they (1) allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) are used by Box’s institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of Box’s business. A limitation of non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics is that they do not have uniform definitions. Further, Box’s definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Thus, Box’s non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, in the case of stock-based compensation expense, if Box did not pay a portion of compensation in the form of stock-based compensation expense, the cash salary expense included in cost of revenue and operating expenses would be higher, which would affect Box’s cash position. The accompanying tables have more details on the reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and certain key metrics to their nearest comparable GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin. Box defines non-GAAP gross profit as GAAP gross profit excluding expenses related to stock-based compensation (“SBC”) included in cost of revenue, intangible assets amortization, and as applicable, other special items. Non-GAAP gross margin is defined as non-GAAP gross profit divided by revenue. Although SBC is an important aspect of the compensation of Box’s employees and executives, determining the fair value of certain of the stock-based instruments Box utilizes estimation and the expense recorded may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the vesting or future exercise of the related stock-based awards. Management believes it is useful to exclude SBC in order to better understand the long-term performance of Box’s core business and to facilitate comparison of Box’s results to those of peer companies. Management also views amortization of acquired intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s developed technology and trade names, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While these intangible assets are continually evaluated for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. Box also excludes expenses associated with a non-recurring workforce reorganization from non-GAAP gross profit as they are considered by management to be special items outside of Box’s core operating results. Non-GAAP operating income (loss) and non-GAAP operating margin. Box defines non-GAAP operating income (loss) as operating income (loss) excluding expenses related to SBC, intangible assets amortization, and as applicable, other special items. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income (loss) divided by revenue. Box excludes the following expenses as they are considered by management to be special items outside of Box’s core operating results: (1) fees related to shareholder activism (2) expenses related to certain litigation, (3) expenses associated with a non-recurring workforce reorganization, consisting primarily of severance and other personnel-related costs, and (4) expenses related to acquisitions. Non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders. Box defines non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders as GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders excluding expenses related to SBC, intangible assets amortization, amortization of debt issuance costs, the income tax benefit from the release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, undistributed earnings attributable to preferred stockholders, and as applicable, other special items as described in the preceding paragraph. Box defines non-GAAP net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders as non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders divided by the weighted-average outstanding shares. Billings. Billings reflect, in any particular period, (1) sales to new customers, plus (2) subscription renewals and (3) expansion within existing customers, and represent amounts invoiced for all products and professional services. Box calculates billings for a period by adding changes in deferred revenue and contract assets in that period to revenue. Box believes that billings help investors better understand sales activity for a particular period, which is not necessarily reflected in revenue as a result of the fact that Box recognizes subscription revenue ratably over the subscription term. Box considers billings a significant performance measure. Box monitors billings to manage the business, make planning decisions, evaluate performance and allocate resources. Box believes that billings offers valuable supplemental information regarding the performance of the business and helps investors better understand the sales volumes and performance of the business. Although Box considers billings to be a significant performance measure, Box does not consider it to be a non-GAAP financial measure because it is calculated using exclusively revenue, deferred revenue, and contract assets, all of which are financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Remaining performance obligations. Remaining performance obligations (“RPO”) represent, at a point in time, contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized. RPO consists of deferred revenue and backlog. Backlog is defined as non-cancellable contracts deemed certain to be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. Future invoicing is determined to be certain when we have an executed non-cancellable contract or a significant penalty that is due upon cancellation. While Box believes RPO is a leading indicator of revenue as it represents sales activity not yet recognized in revenue, it is not necessarily indicative of future revenue growth as it is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, contract renewal timing, average contract terms and foreign currency exchange rates. Box monitors RPO to manage the business and evaluate performance. Box considers RPO to be a significant performance measure. Box does not consider RPO to be a non-GAAP financial measure because it is calculated in accordance with GAAP, specifically under ASC Topic 606. Non-GAAP free cash flow and free cash flow margin. Box defines non-GAAP free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, principal payments of finance lease liabilities, capitalized internal-use software costs, and other items that did not or are not expected to require cash settlement and that management considers to be outside of Box’s core business. Free cash flow margin is calculated as non-GAAP free cash flow divided by revenue. Box specifically identifies adjusting items in the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. Box considers non-GAAP free cash flow to be a profitability and liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can possibly be used for investing in Box's business and strengthening its balance sheet, but it is not intended to represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is also not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.

Priced between $225-$255, the sneakers cater to individuals seeking style and functionality, available at select retailers and online from March 14. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The launch of the AHNU Sequence 1 sneaker represents a strategic move by Deckers Brands to capture a niche in the high-performance footwear market. The emphasis on blending style with cutting-edge technology addresses a growing consumer demand for versatile products that serve both aesthetic and functional purposes. This trend is particularly pronounced among millennial and Gen Z demographics, who prioritize both style and performance in their purchasing decisions.Deckers Brands' decision to leverage the expertise from established brands like UGG and HOKA could provide a competitive edge in terms of design and innovation credibility. The synergistic use of Deckers X Lab's innovation hub suggests a commitment to continuous improvement and could signal future growth potential in the high-performance segment.However, the pricing strategy for the Sequence 1 sneakers, ranging from $225 to $255, positions the product in the premium market segment. This could limit the potential customer base to higher-income individuals or those who are willing to invest in high-quality footwear. Market penetration will likely depend on the brand's ability to differentiate itself and justify the premium pricing through superior product performance and design. Financial Analyst Deckers Brands' launch of AHNU and the Sequence 1 sneaker may have implications for the company's financial performance. By entering the high-performance footwear market, Deckers is diversifying its product portfolio, which could lead to revenue growth and reduce reliance on their existing product lines. The initial availability at select premium retailers, followed by online sales, is a strategic rollout that could generate early buzz and establish brand presence in key markets.Investors should monitor consumer reception and sales data following the product's release to gauge the impact on Deckers Brands' revenue streams. The investment in research and development, as well as marketing for the new line, will initially affect operating expenses. However, if the Sequence 1 sneakers are well-received, they could contribute positively to the company's profit margins, given the premium pricing.It is also important to consider the potential risks, such as the high competition in the sneaker market and the need for the brand to quickly establish a strong identity to sustain sales beyond the initial launch period. Fashion Industry Expert The introduction of AHNU's Sequence 1 sneaker is indicative of the evolving fashion industry, where the lines between high fashion and athletic wear continue to blur. Deckers Brands is tapping into the 'athleisure' trend, which has seen robust growth over the past decade. The use of innovative materials like PEBA foam and carbon-fiber plates in a vintage silhouette demonstrates an acute awareness of current fashion sensibilities that favor retro styles with modern enhancements.For industry insiders, the success of AHNU could hinge on the brand's ability to maintain the delicate balance between performance technology and aesthetic appeal. The brand's narrative, focusing on all-day wear for individuals who are 'always moving forward,' aligns with contemporary lifestyle branding that promotes both functionality and fashion.The fashion industry will be watching AHNU's market performance closely, as it could set a precedent for future product developments that similarly aim to merge high-performance technology with timeless style. 03/05/2024 - 04:05 PM Fusing High-Performance Technology with Timeless Style, AHNU Is Designed For Those Always Moving Forward GOLETA, Calif., March 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- AHNU®, a division of Deckers Brands (NYSE: DECK), launches today and introduces the star of its inaugural capsule, the Sequence 1 sneaker.

Full House Resorts Announces Fourth Quarter and Full-Year Results,2024-03-05T21:05:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Full House Resorts, Inc. (Nasdaq: FLL) reported a 66.4% revenue increase to $60 million in Q4 2023, with annual revenues growing by 47.6%. The company opened two new casinos in 2023, American Place and Chamonix Casino Hotel, showing positive revenue growth and operational progress. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 87.4% in Q4 2023. Despite a net loss, the company is optimistic about future cash flows and construction plans for the permanent American Place facility.","Full House Resorts Announces Fourth Quarter and Full-Year Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Full House Resorts, Inc. (Nasdaq: FLL) reported a 66.4% revenue increase to $60 million in Q4 2023, with annual revenues growing by 47.6%. The company opened two new casinos in 2023, American Place and Chamonix Casino Hotel, showing positive revenue growth and operational progress. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 87.4% in Q4 2023. Despite a net loss, the company is optimistic about future cash flows and construction plans for the permanent American Place facility. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported 66.4% increase in quarterly revenues and 47.6% annual revenue growth for Full House Resorts, Inc. are significant metrics that demonstrate robust top-line growth. This performance is largely attributable to the strategic expansion with the opening of new casinos such as American Place and Chamonix Casino Hotel. The record gaming revenue reported in February 2024 by American Place, despite it being a shorter month, is indicative of strong consumer demand and operational ramp-up at the new facility.However, the net loss widening both quarterly and annually suggests that the company is facing substantial preopening and development costs, as well as depreciation and amortization expenses associated with the new facilities. While these costs are expected during expansion phases, investors should monitor whether the new properties can transition to profitability and how quickly they can do so. The Adjusted EBITDA growth is a positive sign, showing improved operational efficiency and the potential for future earnings to absorb the initial costs.The extended approval to operate American Place in its temporary configuration until August 2027 provides a cushion for Full House Resorts to optimize its operations without the immediate pressure of completing the permanent facility. This could be beneficial for the company's cash flow management and reduce the risk of operational disruptions. Market Research Analyst Full House Resorts' expansion strategy, particularly in the Midwest & South segment, is a clear response to the burgeoning demand for gaming and leisure experiences in the region. The 78.8% revenue increase in this segment underscores the potential market share capture by the new American Place casino. The seasonality effect and elevated marketing expenses are typical challenges in the gaming industry; however, these investments are essential for long-term customer acquisition and brand establishment.The West segment's performance, with a moderate revenue increase, highlights the competitive nature of the gaming industry in areas like Colorado. The strategic integration of Bronco Billy's with the newly opened Chamonix could enhance the overall customer experience and create synergies between the properties. The anticipated dissipation of construction-related disruptions at Bronco Billy's in 2024 is expected to further stabilize this segment's performance.The contracted sports wagering segment reflects the growing importance of online and on-site sports betting as a revenue stream. The growth in this segment, despite the provision for credit losses, suggests that Full House Resorts is effectively leveraging its licenses and partnerships in the sports betting domain. Legal Expert The ongoing lawsuit regarding the Waukegan gaming license, in which Full House Resorts was selected over a tribal entity, is a matter of concern that could have implications for the company's operations in Illinois. While the company believes the lawsuit is without merit, the outcome of the Illinois Supreme Court ruling expected by early 2025 remains uncertain and could impact the stability and future prospects of American Place. This legal uncertainty may influence investor sentiment and the company's strategic decisions regarding its Illinois operations.Additionally, the legislative approval allowing the operation of the temporary American Place facility until August 2027 may offer some legal respite and operational continuity. However, it is crucial for investors to stay informed about the legal proceedings as they could have material effects on the company's financials and strategic outlook. 03/05/2024 - 04:05 PM - Revenues Increased 66.4% to $60.0 Million in the Fourth Quarter of 2023;Annual Revenues Grew 47.6% - Chamonix Casino Hotel Began Its Phased Opening on December 27, 2023 - Approvals Received to Operate American Place in Its Temporary Configuration Until August 2027 LAS VEGAS, March 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Full House Resorts, Inc. (Nasdaq: FLL) today announced results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. “After several years of construction, we are entering a new phase for our company,” said Daniel R. Lee, President and Chief Executive Officer of Full House Resorts. “We opened two new casinos during 2023: American Place in Waukegan, Illinois, and Chamonix, in Cripple Creek, Colorado. Our first new casino – American Place – celebrated its one-year anniversary a few weeks ago. As expected, it continues to ramp up its operations. In December 2023, American Place reached a new monthly gaming revenue record of $8.2 million, as reported by the Illinois Gaming Board. It subsequently set a new monthly all-time record for revenues in February 2024, despite it being a short month. We expect American Place’s gaming revenues to continue to grow in 2024, with the property’s high-end North Shore Steaks & Seafood now open and overall awareness continuing to improve. American Place is currently in a temporary facility, built in less than one year after being chosen by the Illinois Gaming Board to develop this newly-created license. We recently received the necessary approvals to operate the temporary facility until August 2027, providing us with meaningful additional time before the anticipated opening of the permanent American Place facility. “On December 27, we welcomed guests to our newest casino, Chamonix Casino Hotel in Cripple Creek, Colorado, which is less than one hour from Colorado Springs and approximately two hours from Denver. By design, it was a soft opening, with the casino, meeting rooms, and approximately 40% of the property’s guest rooms initially open. Over the past few weeks, we have continued the rollout of the property’s amenities, including completion of the destination’s remaining hotel rooms and its parking garage. We are currently putting the finishing touches on 980 Prime, Chamonix’s high-end steakhouse led by famed chef Barry Dakake. We expect it to open in late March. Chamonix was designed to be the most beautiful casino in the state of Colorado, and we look forward to the completion of all of its amenities over the next few months.” On a consolidated basis, revenues in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $60.0 million, a 66.4% increase from $36.1 million in the prior-year period. These results primarily reflect the February 2023 opening of American Place. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $12.5 million, or $(0.36) per diluted common share, which includes $3.1 million of preopening and development costs, primarily related to the phased opening of our Chamonix project, and significant depreciation and amortization charges related to the temporary American Place facility. In the prior-year period, net loss was $7.0 million, or $(0.20) per diluted common share, reflecting $4.8 million of preopening and development costs. Adjusted EBITDA(a) rose 87.4% in the fourth quarter of 2023 to $7.3 million, compared to $3.9 million in the prior-year period. For the full year, revenues in 2023 were $241.1 million, a 47.6% increase from $163.3 million in the prior year. These results reflect the February 2023 opening of American Place, as well as $5.8 million of accelerated revenue under two of our sports wagering agreements with third-party operators that ceased operations during the third quarter of 2023. Net loss in 2023 was $24.9 million, or $(0.72) per diluted common share, which includes $15.7 million of preopening and development costs, primarily related to our Chamonix construction project, and significant depreciation and amortization charges related to the temporary American Place facility. For 2022, net loss was $14.8 million, or $(0.43) per diluted common share, reflecting $9.8 million of preopening and development costs. Adjusted EBITDA was $48.6 million in 2023, rising 51.1% from $32.1 million in the prior-year period, reflecting the items mentioned above. “Our Company recently reached an inflection point,” noted Mr. Lee. “In 2023, our total cash interest expense was approximately $38.4 million and Adjusted EBITDA, as noted, was $48.6 million, despite construction disruptions in Colorado and the gradual ramp-up of operations at American Place. Our debt during that period included substantially all of the funding for Chamonix, which did not open until year-end. While some construction continues at Chamonix, the bulk of our capital expenditures for these projects is behind us. This fact, along with expected future earnings from these new facilities, should result in the generation of significant free cash flow over the next few years. Also, recognize that we continue to have significant tax-loss carryforwards and we benefit, for tax purposes, from accelerated depreciation related to our new developments.” Added Mr. Lee, “Regarding American Place, the State of Illinois recently passed legislation allowing us to operate our temporary facility until August 2027. This was because a tribal entity that operates a competing casino in Wisconsin filed a lawsuit against the City of Waukegan and the Illinois Gaming Board, alleging that the tribe was not provided due consideration in its effort to obtain the Waukegan gaming license. We were chosen for that license after a robust public process, whereby an independent consultant hired by the City of Waukegan rated the tribal proposal as being inferior in most respects to all four of the other proposals, including that of Full House Resorts. We believe the lawsuit is without merit. The City and the Illinois Gaming Board have sought review of the dispute by the Illinois Supreme Court, which has agreed to hear the case. We anticipate a ruling by that court by early 2025.” Concluded Mr. Lee, “We estimate that construction of the permanent American Place facility will require approximately two years, with a significant portion of the project’s capital expenditures not expected until the second half of 2026 and during 2027. We believe that the Company’s operating cash flows should be able to fund significant portions of the construction cost for the permanent American Place facility between now and its anticipated opening in 2027. For the remaining balance, we remain highly confident in our ability to fund it entirely in the debt capital markets at the appropriate time.” Fourth Quarter Highlights and Subsequent Events Midwest & South. This segment includes Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel, Rising Star Casino Resort, and American Place. Revenues for the segment were $49.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, a 78.8% increase from $27.5 million in the prior-year period. Adjusted Segment EBITDA rose to $7.2 million, a 57.9% increase from $4.6 million in the prior-year period. These results reflect the February 17, 2023 opening of American Place, our casino located in Waukegan, Illinois. In the fourth quarter of 2023, American Place generated $22.4 million of revenue and $3.9 million of Adjusted Property EBITDA. American Place’s results reflect some winter seasonality, as well as elevated marketing expenses related to a marketing campaign that is expected to benefit the casino in the longer-run. For the full year, this segment similarly benefited from the opening of American Place in February 2023. Revenues increased 60.4% from $120.0 million to $192.4 million, and Adjusted Segment EBITDA grew 48.0% from $26.4 million to $39.0 million. Of such amount, American Place contributed $77.0 million and $18.4 million to the segment’s revenues and Adjusted Segment EBITDA, respectively.West. This segment includes Grand Lodge Casino (located within the Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe resort in Incline Village), Stockman’s Casino, Bronco Billy’s Casino and Hotel, and Chamonix Casino Hotel, which opened on December 27, 2023. Revenues for the segment rose 14.0% to $8.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, versus $7.5 million in the prior-year period. Adjusted Segment EBITDA of $(0.1) million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compares to $(0.3) million in the prior-year period. Results in both periods reflect the temporary loss of all on-site parking and on-site hotel rooms at Bronco Billy’s to accommodate the construction of neighboring Chamonix. With Chamonix now open, Bronco Billy’s is benefiting from its integration with Chamonix, including its new parking garage and approximately 300 on-site guest rooms.For the year, revenues and Adjusted Segment EBITDA were $35.9 million and $2.4 million in 2023, respectively. In 2022, such amounts were $36.1 million and $4.2 million, respectively. As noted above, construction-related disruptions at Bronco Billy’s are expected to dissipate in 2024 with the return of on-site guest rooms and on-site parking. Contracted Sports Wagering. This segment consists of our on-site and online sports wagering “skins” (akin to websites) in Colorado, Indiana, and Illinois. Revenues and Adjusted Segment EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $2.3 million and $1.3 million, respectively. These results reflect the contractual launch of our permitted Illinois sports skin in August 2023, as well as a provision for credit losses on sports wagering receivables of $1.0 million, which negatively affected Adjusted Segment EBITDA. For the fourth quarter of 2022, both revenues and Adjusted Segment EBITDA were $1.1 million.For the year, this segment’s revenues grew 78.1%, from $7.2 million in 2022 to $12.8 million in 2023, and Adjusted Segment EBITDA rose 63.6%, from $7.1 million to $11.7 million. Results for 2022 reflect the acceleration of revenues under two of our sports wagering agreements with third-party operators that ceased operations in May 2022. In 2023, results increased due to the launch of our Illinois sports skin noted above, the launch of a replacement operator in Colorado in March 2023, and accelerated revenues related to two other sports wagering agreements with operators that ceased operations during the third quarter of 2023. Additionally, the $1.0 million provision for credit losses, as mentioned, negatively affected Adjusted Segment EBITDA during 2023.The Company is currently permitted to operate three sports skins in Colorado, three in Indiana, and one in Illinois. Of such permitted skins, two sports skins are currently live in Colorado, one in Indiana, and one in Illinois. Under our agreements with various third parties to operate such skins, we receive a percentage of revenues, as defined in the contracts, subject to an annualized minimum amount that currently totals $8 million. We continue to evaluate whether to operate our remaining idle skins ourselves or to have other third parties operate them. However, there is no certainty that we will be able to enter into agreements with replacement operators or successfully operate the skins ourselves. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of December 31, 2023, we had $73.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, including $37.6 million of cash reserved under our bond indentures to complete the construction of Chamonix. Our debt consisted primarily of $450.0 million in outstanding senior secured notes due 2028, which became callable at specified premiums in February 2024, and $27.0 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility.

(a) Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresOur presentation of non-GAAP Measures may be different from the presentation used by other companies, and therefore, comparability may be limited. While excluded from certain non-GAAP Measures, depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, income taxes and other items have been and will be incurred. Each of these items should also be considered in the overall evaluation of our results. Additionally, our non-GAAP Measures do not consider capital expenditures and other investing activities and should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity. We compensate for these limitations by providing the relevant disclosure of our depreciation and amortization, interest and income taxes, and other items both in our reconciliations to the historical GAAP financial measures and in our consolidated financial statements, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance. Our non-GAAP Measures are to be used in addition to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP Measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, or any other operating performance measure prescribed by GAAP, nor should these measures be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP Measures reflect additional ways of viewing our operations that we believe, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to the corresponding historical GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. Management strongly encourages investors to review our financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure. Adjusted Segment EBITDA. We utilize Adjusted Segment EBITDA as the measure of segment profitability in assessing performance and allocating resources at the reportable segment level. Adjusted Segment EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening expenses, certain impairment charges, asset write-offs, recoveries, gain (loss) from asset disposals, project development and acquisition costs, non-cash share-based compensation expense, and corporate-related costs and expenses that are not allocated to each segment. Same-store Adjusted Segment EBITDA. Same-store Adjusted Segment EBITDA is Adjusted Segment EBITDA further adjusted to exclude the Adjusted Property EBITDA of properties that have not been in operation for a full year. Adjusted Property EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening expenses, certain impairment charges, asset write-offs, recoveries, gain (loss) from asset disposals, project development and acquisition costs, non-cash share-based compensation expense, and corporate-related costs and expenses that are not allocated to each property. Adjusted EBITDA. We also utilize Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as Adjusted Segment EBITDA, net of corporate-related costs and expenses. Although Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP, we believe this non-GAAP financial measure provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity. We utilize this metric or measure internally to focus management on year-over-year changes in core operating performance, which we consider our ordinary, ongoing and customary operations, and which we believe is useful information to investors. Accordingly, management excludes certain items when analyzing core operating performance, such as the items mentioned above, that management believes are not reflective of ordinary, ongoing and customary operations.

Grant revenue of $4.9 million recognized in 2023 compared to $0.2 million in 2022. Oncology Doctor An Oncology Doctor would note the progression of Plus Therapeutics' ReSPECT-LM Phase 1 trial as a significant step towards addressing the unmet medical needs in leptomeningeal metastases (LM), a serious and often terminal complication of cancer. The use of rhenium (186Re) obisbemeda, a targeted radiotherapeutic, represents an innovative approach that could potentially improve survival rates and quality of life for patients with LM, particularly those with breast cancer. The safety and efficacy signals are crucial at this stage, as they will determine the future clinical development and potential of the drug. The FDA's Orphan Drug Designation is also pivotal, as it may expedite the drug's approval process and provide market exclusivity benefits upon approval. Financial Analyst From a Financial Analyst's perspective, the company's current financial forecast showing a runway into the second half of 2025 is reassuring for investors, indicating a reduced risk of near-term dilution. The cash balance decrease from $18.1 million to $8.6 million year-over-year may initially seem concerning, but the recognition of $4.9 million in grant revenue, primarily from CPRIT, offsets this concern to an extent. Additionally, the reduced net loss per share from $(11.58) to $(4.24) is a positive sign of financial stabilization. However, the company's ability to manage cash burn and secure additional funding or partnerships will be critical for sustaining operations and advancing clinical trials. Market Research Analyst A Market Research Analyst would highlight the strategic importance of the company's expansion of the ReSPECT-GBM Phase 2 trial and the addition of new sites, which may increase patient enrollment rates and data diversity. The anticipation of presenting interim safety and efficacy data at major conferences could generate interest from potential partners or investors. Moreover, the planned FDA meetings to discuss pivotal trial designs for both LM and recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM) treatments are key milestones that could significantly impact the company's market valuation and partnership potential, depending on the outcomes of these discussions. 03/05/2024 - 04:05 PM Began enrollment of the 5th of an anticipated 7 planned dosing cohorts for the ReSPECT-LM Phase 1 dose escalation trial with rhenium (186Re) obisbemeda for leptomeningeal metastases (LM) Reached agreement to expand ReSPECT-GBM Phase 2 trial and add new sites Current financial forecast for sufficient runway to fund operations into 2H 2025 Management to Host Conference Call March 5, 2024 at 5:00 p.m. ET AUSTIN, Texas, March 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Plus Therapeutics, Inc.

XPO Provides North American LTL Operating Data for February 2024,2024-03-05T21:05:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"XPO reports a 3.5% increase in LTL tonnage per day in February 2024 compared to the previous year, driven by a rise in shipments per day and a decrease in weight per shipment.","XPO Provides North American LTL Operating Data for February 2024 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary XPO reports a 3.5% increase in LTL tonnage per day in February 2024 compared to the previous year, driven by a rise in shipments per day and a decrease in weight per shipment. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst An uptick in LTL (Less-Than-Truckload) tonnage per day suggests a positive shift in XPO's operational performance. This metric is crucial as it indicates the volume of goods transported, which directly correlates with revenue. The reported 3.5% increase, coupled with a 5.8% rise in shipments per day, reflects an expanding customer base or increased demand for XPO's services. However, the decrease in weight per shipment by 2.2% could signal a shift in the type of goods being transported or a strategic move to optimize shipment consolidation.Investors should note that an increase in tonnage and shipments can lead to higher revenues, but it's also essential to consider the cost implications. More shipments typically mean more stops and potentially higher operational costs. It's important to analyze future financial statements to assess whether the increased volume translates into net positive earnings. Financial Analyst The preliminary operating metrics provide a snapshot of XPO's current financial health. The growth in LTL tonnage and shipments suggests that XPO is successfully capturing market share or benefiting from an uptick in the freight industry. Investors should monitor the final reported results for February 2024 to confirm these trends. Additionally, comparing these results with competitors' performance can offer a benchmark for XPO's operational efficiency.From a valuation standpoint, if the positive trend in tonnage and shipments continues and is reflected in the bottom line, there could be an upward pressure on XPO's stock price. However, the preliminary nature of these metrics warrants caution, as the actual results may vary. Investors should look for consistency in these metrics over subsequent quarters to confirm a sustainable growth trajectory. Economist The increase in LTL tonnage and shipments per day is indicative of broader economic trends. A rise in freight activity often corresponds with increased commercial activity and consumer spending, which are positive indicators for the economy. This microeconomic data point could be reflective of macroeconomic conditions, such as economic growth or recovery.However, the decrease in weight per shipment raises questions about the nature of economic activity. It could suggest a shift towards lighter goods, which are typically less capital-intensive, or it could reflect efficiency improvements in supply chain management. Stakeholders should consider these metrics in the context of broader economic indicators to assess the sustainability of this growth. 03/05/2024 - 04:05 PM GREENWICH, Conn. , March 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- XPO (NYSE: XPO), a leading provider of freight transportation in North America, today reported certain preliminary LTL segment operating metrics for February 2024. LTL tonnage per day increased 3.5%, as compared with February 2023, attributable to a year-over-year increase of 5.8% in shipments per day and a decrease of 2.2% in weight per shipment. Actual results for February 2024 may vary from the preliminary results reported above. About XPO XPO, Inc. (NYSE: XPO) is one of the largest providers of asset-based less-than-truckload (LTL) transportation in North America, with proprietary technology that moves goods efficiently through its network.

Financial Analyst The reported revenue growth for NeuroPace, Inc. is a significant indicator of the company's current financial health and future prospects. The 41% increase in Q4 revenue and 44% increase for the full year suggest a robust demand for the company's RNS System and its diagnostic electrodes and related products for epilepsy. The provided guidance for 2024 projects a continued upward trajectory, albeit at a slower pace, with an expected 12% to 18% growth. This deceleration could be indicative of market saturation, increased competition, or the lifecycle stage of the company's products. The gross margin improvement from 68.8% to 75.2% in Q4 and 71.4% to 73.6% for the full year reflects efficient cost management and economies of scale achieved through increased sales volume.Investors should note the reduction in cash burn from $7.9 million in Q4 2022 to $3.4 million in Q4 2023 which demonstrates the company's improved operational efficiency and financial discipline. However, the company still operates at a loss, with a net loss of $6.2 million in Q4 2023 and $33.0 million for the full year. The long-term borrowings of $57.0 million as of December 31, 2023, should also be carefully considered, as they may affect future financial flexibility and profitability. Market Research Analyst NeuroPace's strategic focus on expanding the market usage of the RNS System outside of Level 4 comprehensive epilepsy centers could potentially open up a broader market segment, tapping into the approximately 700,000 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy in the United States. The initiation of Project CARE pilot activities is a forward-looking step that could significantly impact the company's market share and penetration. The strategic collaboration with a biotechnology company to leverage the RNS System's data monitoring and analysis capabilities may also open new revenue streams and partnerships, further diversifying the company's business model.The completion of enrollment for the pivotal NAUTILUS study is a critical milestone for the company. If the FDA submission leads to approval, this could be a catalyst for future growth, as there are currently no neuromodulation products indicated for generalized epilepsy in the United States. The potential expansion of approved indications for the RNS System represents a significant opportunity for NeuroPace to address a larger patient population and further solidify its position in the neuromodulation market. Medical Device Industry Expert The medical device sector, particularly in the field of neuromodulation for epilepsy, is highly specialized and competitive. NeuroPace's reported revenue growth reflects a strong performance within this niche market. The company's RNS System is an implantable device designed to prevent epileptic seizures by providing responsive neurostimulation. The increase in gross margin suggests that NeuroPace has been successful in optimizing its production processes and managing the costs associated with manufacturing and distributing its products.The strategic integration of DIXI Medical's SEEG electrodes into NeuroPace's product portfolio and the expansion of sales highlight the company's ability to effectively leverage partnerships to enhance its product offerings and market reach. The successful execution of a three-part growth strategy focused on increasing adoption, expanding therapy utilization and extending approved indications is a testament to the company's innovative approach and commitment to addressing unmet medical needs in epilepsy care. 03/05/2024 - 04:05 PM -- Revenue increased to $18.0 million in Q4 2023, a 41% increase over Q4 2022 -- -- Revenue increased to $65.4 million in 2023, a 44% increase over 2022 -- -- Provides full-year 2024 revenue guidance of between $73-$77 million -- -- Management scheduled to host a conference call today at 4:30 p.m. ET -- MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., March 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NeuroPace, Inc. (Nasdaq: NPCE), a medical device company focused on transforming the lives of people living with epilepsy, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Recent Highlights Reported total revenue of $18.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, a 41% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2022, and a 10% increase over the third quarter of 2023Reported total revenue of $65.4 million in 2023, a 44% increase compared with 2022Initiated pilot program activities for expanding access to the RNS System to patients outside of Level 4 comprehensive epilepsy centers, under its Project CARE programPivotal NAUTILUS study completed enrollment and subsequently, the number of implants required for FDA submission, during the fourth quarter of 2023Continued revenue growth from the Company’s exclusive partnership with DIXI Medical to market and sell their diagnostic electrodes and related products for epilepsyAnnounced entering into a first of its kind strategic collaboration with a biotechnology company, which will leverage the RNS System’s unique data monitoring and analysis capabilities “This is an exciting period in our Company’s history as we grew total revenue by 44% in 2023, which was driven by the execution of our strategy to expand market usage of our RNS System, while maintaining financial discipline and reducing our cash burn to $3.4 million in the fourth quarter,” said Joel Becker, Chief Executive Officer of NeuroPace. “In 2023, we successfully implemented the first part of our three-part growth strategy for developing the market for our RNS System, aimed at increasing adoption across clinicians and expanding therapy utilization by current prescribers under what we call the ‘modern RNS story.’ We also successfully integrated DIXI Medical SEEG electrodes into our product portfolio and expanded sales throughout the year.” “The second phase of our strategy, called ‘Project CARE,’ shifts the treatment paradigm to a much broader set of epilepsy specialists outside of Level 4 centers, and provides access to the approximately 700,000 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy in the United States that are not currently treated in Level 4 centers. We have initiated activities for the Project CARE pilot, and plan to expand these activities as we gain experience.” “The third phase of our growth strategy is based on expanding the approved indications for our RNS System, currently focused on the ongoing pivotal NAUTILUS study, an IDE study for patients 12 years and older with drug resistant idiopathic generalized epilepsy, in which we have completed enrollment and the number of implants required for FDA submission. Approximately 40% of patients are diagnosed with generalized epilepsy. There are no neuromodulation products currently indicated for generalized epilepsy in the United States.” “We are energized by the strong momentum that was built in 2023 and look forward to continuing to both increase adoption and utilization of the RNS System and to expand access to RNS therapy in the large community of drug-resistant epilepsy patients while maintaining financial discipline,” concluded Mr. Becker. Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial ResultsTotal revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 grew 41% to $18.0 million, compared with $12.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, and increased 10% compared with $16.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. The Company’s strong fourth quarter revenue growth was primarily driven by increased sales of the RNS System. The Company also continued to generate meaningful revenue from DIXI Medical products. This growth was partially offset by the previously guided decline in replacement implant revenue, representing approximately 4% of total revenue. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 75.2% compared to 68.8% in the fourth quarter of 2022. The Company’s gross margin increased primarily due to the increase in RNS products produced and sold, thereby spreading its fixed manufacturing overhead costs across more units. The increase in RNS gross margin was partially offset by the lower gross margin for distribution of DIXI Medical products. Total operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $18.6 million compared with $18.7 million in the same period of the prior year. R&D expense in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $5.4 million compared with $5.1 million in the same period of 2022. SG&A expense in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $13.2 million compared with $13.6 million in the prior year period. Consistent with prior quarters this year, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were lower for both R&D and SG&A expenses. The Company maintained its focus on appropriate resource allocation and cash management and remains committed to effectively managing its operating expenses without compromising revenue growth. Loss from operations was $5.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with $9.9 million in the prior year period. Net loss was $6.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with $11.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance as of December 31, 2023, was $66.5 million. Long-term borrowings totaled $57.0 million as of December 31, 2023. The Company’s cash burn in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $3.4 million, compared with cash burn of $7.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, representing another quarter of meaningful improvement attributable to the Company’s focus on operating discipline. Full Year 2023 Financial ResultsTotal revenue in 2023 grew 44% to $65.4 million, compared with $45.5 million in 2022. The Company’s strong revenue growth was primarily driven by increased sales of the RNS System. The Company also generated meaningful revenue from sales of DIXI Medical products in its first full year of serving as DIXI Medical’s exclusive U.S. distributor, which began in and contributed a small amount of revenue to the fourth quarter of 2022. This growth was partially offset by the previously guided decline in replacement implant revenue, representing approximately 5% of total revenue for the full year. Gross margin for 2023 was 73.6% compared to 71.4% in 2022. The Company’s gross margin increased primarily due to the increase in RNS products produced and sold, thereby spreading its fixed manufacturing overhead costs across more units. The increase in RNS gross margin was partially offset by the lower gross margin for distribution of DIXI Medical products. Total operating expenses in 2023 were $75.3 million compared with $73.3 million in 2022. R&D expense in 2023 was $20.8 million compared with $21.9 million in 2022. SG&A expense in 2023 was $54.5 million compared with $51.3 million in 2022. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were lower for both R&D and SG&A expenses. Loss from operations was $27.2 million in 2023, including $9.6 million of stock-based compensation, compared with $40.8 million in 2022. Net loss was $33.0 million for 2023 compared with $47.1 million in 2022. Full Year 2024 Financial Guidance Total revenue to range between $73 million and $77 million, representing growth of 12% to 18% over 2023Gross margin to range between 72% and 74%Total operating expenses to range between $80 million and $84 million, including approximately $12 million in stock-based compensation, a noncash expense NeuroPace continues to expect revenue growth to be primarily driven by increasing sales of its RNS System and higher sales of DIXI Medical stereo EEG products, while replacement implant revenue is expected to decline in 2024 versus 2023.

The company expanded its product portfolio with the acquisition of GAVRETO, focusing on commercial expansion and strategic collaborations.

Positive Increased net product sales of $104.3 million in 2023, a 36% increase from 2022. Acquisition of U.S. rights to GAVRETO, an FDA-approved therapy for NSCLC and thyroid cancer. Strategic collaborations with MD Anderson and CONNECT for clinical development. Highest number of TAVALISSE bottles shipped in Q4 2023 and 47% growth in REZLIDHIA sales. Net income of $0.7 million for Q4 2023 and net loss of $25.1 million for full year 2023. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $56.9 million as of December 31, 2023. Negative None. Financial Analyst The disclosed financial results from Rigel Pharmaceuticals indicate a significant uptick in net product sales, particularly with TAVALISSE and REZLIDHIA, which are critical for the company's revenue stream. The reported year-over-year sales growth of 36% for TAVALISSE is a robust indicator of the product's market acceptance and physician adoption. Similarly, REZLIDHIA's net sales increase is notable, suggesting effective market penetration and potential for future revenue contributions.From a cost perspective, the reduction in total costs and expenses, primarily from decreased research and development costs, is a positive sign for operational efficiency and could lead to improved margins if sustained. However, investors should consider the sustainability of these reduced costs and whether they represent a strategic scaling back or simply a temporary lull in R&D activity.The acquisition of GAVRETO rights could be a strategic move to diversify and strengthen Rigel's oncology portfolio. The financial implications of this acquisition will likely become clearer in future quarters as Rigel starts recognizing product sales. It's essential to monitor how this acquisition integrates with their existing operations and whether it will indeed result in the anticipated top-line growth. Market Research Analyst The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and Rigel's strategic development collaborations, such as those with MD Anderson and CONNECT, could be pivotal in enhancing their product pipeline and securing a competitive edge. These collaborations can lead to the development of novel therapies, which could open up new market segments for Rigel. The focus on combination therapies and expanding indications, such as the use of REZLIDHIA in high-grade glioma, reflects a trend in oncology treatment towards personalized medicine.However, the long-term success of these collaborations will depend on clinical trial outcomes and subsequent regulatory approvals. Investors should track the progress of these trials as they have the potential to significantly impact Rigel's future growth and market positioning. Furthermore, the ability to increase the number of bottles shipped is a positive indicator of operational capabilities and market demand, which is essential for maintaining growth momentum. Medical Research Analyst Rigel's focus on hematology and oncology, particularly with drugs like TAVALISSE for chronic immune thrombocytopenia and REZLIDHIA for acute myeloid leukemia, is indicative of their specialized approach in areas with unmet medical needs. The reported growth in product sales reflects not only the commercial success but also the therapeutic value these drugs are providing to patients who have had an insufficient response to previous treatments.The acquisition of GAVRETO and its potential to treat RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer and advanced thyroid cancer could significantly impact the treatment landscape for these cancers. As an FDA-approved targeted therapy, GAVRETO's integration into Rigel's portfolio could enhance the company's reputation as a provider of innovative oncology treatments and potentially lead to increased market share in these niches.Investors should be aware of the clinical data presented at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting, as such data can influence medical community perceptions and, by extension, drug adoption rates. The positive post hoc analyses of olutasidenib suggest potential for expanded use in challenging cases such as those refractory to hematopoietic stem cell transplant, which could have meaningful implications for patient care and Rigel's market presence. 03/05/2024 - 04:01 PM Fourth quarter 2023 Total Revenue of $35.8 million which includes TAVALISSE® net product sales of $25.7 million and REZLIDHIA® net product sales of $3.9 millionExpanded product portfolio with acquisition of U.S. rights to GAVRETO®, an FDA approved targeted therapy for the treatment of RET fusion-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and advanced or metastatic thyroid cancer Conference call and webcast scheduled today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern TimeSOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., March 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Rigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: RIGL) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023, including sales of TAVALISSE® (fostamatinib disodium hexahydrate) tablets for the treatment of adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) who have had an insufficient response to a previous treatment and sales of REZLIDHIA® (olutasidenib) capsules for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with a susceptible isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test. ""In 2023, fueled by increased physician awareness and adoption for both TAVALISSE and REZLIDHIA, we achieved net product sales of $104.3 million, an increase of 36% compared to 2022,"" said Raul Rodriguez, Rigel's president and CEO. ""We recently expanded our hematology and oncology portfolio with the addition of GAVRETO, a U.S. marketed product for the treatment of RET fusion-positive NSCLC. This addition is highly synergistic with our current portfolio and existing infrastructure, which we believe will further support top line growth. In 2024, we are focused on commercial expansion and execution, while advancing our pipeline with more strategic collaborations like MD Anderson and CONNECT."" Business Update In the fourth quarter of 2023, we achieved the highest number of TAVALISSE bottles shipped to patients and clinics in a quarter since launch. A total of 2,671 bottles were sold in the U.S., 2,463 of which were shipped directly to patients and clinics. For the full year ended December 31, 2023, 9,396 bottles of TAVALISSE were shipped directly to patients and clinics, representing an increase of 16% compared to 2022.During the fourth quarter of 2023, we achieved 47% growth in total REZLIDHIA bottles sold compared to the third quarter of 2023. A total of 308 bottles were sold in the U.S., 278 of which were shipped directly to patients and clinics. For the full year ended December 31, 2023, 795 bottles of REZLIDHIA were shipped directly to patients and clinics.In February 2024, Rigel announced the acquisition of the U.S. rights to GAVRETO® (pralsetinib). GAVRETO is a once daily, small molecule, oral, kinase inhibitor of wild-type RET (rearranged during transfection) and oncogenic RET fusions. GAVRETO is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and advanced thyroid cancer. The acquisition of this product further expands Rigel's portfolio and leverages Rigel's existing infrastructure in both the institutional and community medical practice settings. Rigel expects to complete the transition of the asset and start recognizing product sales in the third quarter of 2024.In January 2024, Rigel and CONNECT announced a strategic development collaboration to evaluate REZLIDHIA (olutasidenib) in combination with temozolomide as maintenance therapy in patients with high-grade glioma (HGG) harboring an isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) mutation. Under the collaboration, CONNECT will include olutasidenib in CONNECT's TarGeT-D, a molecularly guided Phase 2 umbrella clinical trial for HGG. The Rigel-sponsored arm will study post-radiotherapy administration of olutasidenib in combination with temozolomide followed by olutasidenib monotherapy as maintenance treatment in newly diagnosed pediatric and young adult patients (<39 years old) with IDH1 mutation positive HGG, including diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), an aggressive brain tumor with limited treatment options. Rigel will provide CONNECT funding up to $3 million and study material over the four-year collaboration.In December 2023, Rigel and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson) announced a multi-year strategic development collaboration to expand the evaluation of REZLIDHIA (olutasidenib) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other hematologic cancers. Under the strategic collaboration, Rigel and MD Anderson will evaluate the potential of olutasidenib to treat newly diagnosed and relapsed or refractory (R/R) patients with AML, higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and advanced myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), in combination with other agents. The collaboration will also support the evaluation of olutasidenib as monotherapy in lower-risk MDS and maintenance therapy in post-hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients. Rigel will provide MD Anderson $15 million in time-based milestone payments and study material over the five-year collaboration.In December 2023, Rigel also presented four posters highlighting data from the Company's commercial and clinical-stage hematology-oncology portfolio at the 65th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition. Included was a poster, Abstract #2888, reporting post hoc analyses in a subset of patients with mIDH1 R/R AML or MDS that were R/R to HSCT, ivosidenib, or venetoclax. The analyses suggest that olutasidenib alone or in combination with azacitidine may induce complete remissions in these patients.Financial UpdateFor the fourth quarter of 2023, Rigel reported a net income of $0.7 million, or $0.00 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net income of $1.4 million, or $0.01 per basic and diluted share, for the same period of 2022. For the fourth quarter of 2023, total revenues were $35.8 million, consisting of $25.7 million in TAVALISSE net product sales, $3.9 million in REZLIDHIA net product sales, $6.2 million in contract revenue from collaborations, and $0.1 million in government contract revenue. TAVALISSE net product sales of $25.7 million represents a 17% increase compared to $21.9 million in the same period of 2022. REZLIDHIA net product sales were $3.9 million compared to $0.9 million in the same period of 2022. Contract revenue from collaborations for the fourth quarter of 2023 consisted of $3.7 million of revenue from Grifols S.A. (Grifols) and $0.3 million of revenue from Medison Pharma Trading AG (Medison) related to delivery of drug supplies and earned royalties, as well as $2.2 million of revenue from Kissei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Kissei) related to delivery of drug supplies. For the fourth quarter of 2023, total costs and expenses were $33.8 million, compared to $49.2 million for the same period of 2022. The decrease in costs and expenses was partly due to decreased research and development costs due to the timing of trial completion activities related to the Phase 3 clinical trials of fostamatinib in patients with COVID-19 and wAIHA, as well as the timing of clinical trial activities related to the IRAK 1/4 inhibitor program. In addition, the decrease was also due to lower facility-related costs, and a milestone payment to Forma Therapeutics Inc. (Forma), now Novo Nordisk, recorded as in-process research and development (IPR&D) included within cost and expenses in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year 2023, Rigel reported a net loss of $25.1 million, or $0.14 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $58.6 million, or $0.34 per basic and diluted share, for the full year 2022. For the full year 2023, total revenues were $116.9 million, consisting of $93.7 million in TAVALISSE net product sales, $10.6 million in REZLIDHIA net product sales, $11.5 million in contract revenue from collaborations, and $1.1 million in government contract revenue. TAVALISSE net product sales of $93.7 million represents a 24% increase compared to $75.8 million in full year 2022. REZLIDHIA net product sales of $10.6 million increased by $9.7 million compared to $0.9 million in the full year 2022. Contract revenue from collaborations for the full year 2023, consisted of $8.8 million of revenue from Grifols related to the delivery of drug supplies and earned royalties, $2.2 million of revenue from Kissei related to the delivery of drug supplies, and $0.5 million of revenue from Medison related to delivery of drug supplies, earned royalties, and a milestone payment. Government contract revenue for the full year 2023 was primarily related to income recognized in the second quarter of 2023 pursuant to the agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense to support Rigel's Phase 3 clinical trial of fostamatinib in high-risk hospitalized patients with COVID-19. For the full year 2023, total costs and expenses were $137.4 million, compared to $175.8 million for the full year 2022. The decrease in costs and expenses was partly due to decreased research and development costs due to the completion of trial activities related to the Phase 3 clinical trials of fostamatinib in patients with COVID-19 and wAIHA, as well as timing of clinical trial activities related to the IRAK 1/4 inhibitor program. In addition, the decrease was also due to lower facility-related costs, and an upfront and a milestone payment to Forma recorded as IPR&D included within cost and expenses in the full year 2022. As of December 31, 2023, Rigel had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $56.9 million, compared to $58.2 million as of December 31, 2022.

About ITPIn patients with ITP (immune thrombocytopenia), the immune system attacks and destroys the body's own blood platelets, which play an active role in blood clotting and healing. Common symptoms of ITP are excessive bruising and bleeding. People suffering with chronic ITP may live with an increased risk of severe bleeding events that can result in serious medical complications or even death. Current therapies for ITP include steroids, blood platelet production boosters (TPO-RAs), and splenectomy. However, not all patients respond to existing therapies. As a result, there remains a significant medical need for additional treatment options for patients with ITP. About AMLAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a rapidly progressing cancer of the blood and bone marrow that affects myeloid cells, which normally develop into various types of mature blood cells. AML occurs primarily in adults and accounts for about 1 percent of all adult cancers. The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be about 20,800 new cases in the United States, most in adults, in 2024.1 Relapsed AML affects about half of all patients who, following treatment and remission, experience a return of leukemia cells in the bone marrow.2 Refractory AML, which affects between 10 and 40 percent of newly diagnosed patients, occurs when a patient fails to achieve remission even after intensive treatment.3 Quality of life declines for patients with each successive line of treatment for AML, and well-tolerated treatments in relapsed or refractory disease remain an unmet need. About NSCLCIt is estimated that over 230,000 adults in the U.S. will be diagnosed with lung cancer in 2024. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the U.S, with NSCLC being the most common type accounting for 80-85% of all lung cancer diagnoses.4 RET fusions are implicated in approximately 1-2% of patients with NSCLC.5 About TAVALISSE®IndicationTAVALISSE (fostamatinib disodium hexahydrate) tablets is indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) who have had an insufficient response to a previous treatment. Important Safety InformationWarnings and Precautions Hypertension can occur with TAVALISSE treatment. Patients with pre-existing hypertension may be more susceptible to the hypertensive effects. Monitor blood pressure every 2 weeks until stable, then monthly, and adjust or initiate antihypertensive therapy for blood pressure control maintenance during therapy. If increased blood pressure persists, TAVALISSE interruption, reduction, or discontinuation may be required.Elevated liver function tests (LFTs), mainly ALT and AST, can occur with TAVALISSE. Monitor LFTs monthly during treatment. If ALT or AST increase to ≥3 x upper limit of normal, manage hepatotoxicity using TAVALISSE interruption, reduction, or discontinuation.Diarrhea occurred in 31% of patients and severe diarrhea occurred in 1% of patients treated with TAVALISSE. Monitor patients for the development of diarrhea and manage using supportive care measures early after the onset of symptoms. If diarrhea becomes severe (≥Grade 3), interrupt, reduce dose or discontinue TAVALISSE.Neutropenia occurred in 6% of patients treated with TAVALISSE; febrile neutropenia occurred in 1% of patients. Monitor the ANC monthly and for infection during treatment. Manage toxicity with TAVALISSE interruption, reduction, or discontinuation.TAVALISSE can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Advise pregnant women the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 1 month after the last dose. Verify pregnancy status prior to initiating TAVALISSE. It is unknown if TAVALISSE or its metabolite is present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise a lactating woman not to breastfeed during TAVALISSE treatment and for at least 1 month after the last dose.Drug Interactions Concomitant use of TAVALISSE with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increases exposure to the major active metabolite of TAVALISSE (R406), which may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Monitor for toxicities that may require a reduction in TAVALISSE dose.It is not recommended to use TAVALISSE with strong CYP3A4 inducers, as concomitant use reduces exposure to R406.Concomitant use of TAVALISSE may increase concentrations of some CYP3A4 substrate drugs and may require a dose reduction of the CYP3A4 substrate drug.Concomitant use of TAVALISSE may increase concentrations of BCRP substrate drugs (eg, rosuvastatin) and P-Glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate drugs (eg, digoxin), which may require a dose reduction of the BCRP and P-gp substrate drug.Adverse Reactions Serious adverse drug reactions in the ITP double-blind studies were febrile neutropenia, diarrhea, pneumonia, and hypertensive crisis, which occurred in 1% of TAVALISSE patients. In addition, severe adverse reactions occurred including dyspnea and hypertension (both 2%), neutropenia, arthralgia, chest pain, diarrhea, dizziness, nephrolithiasis, pain in extremity, toothache, syncope, and hypoxia (all 1%).Common adverse reactions (≥5% and more common than placebo) from FIT-1 and FIT-2 included: diarrhea, hypertension, nausea, dizziness, ALT and AST increased, respiratory infection, rash, abdominal pain, fatigue, chest pain, and neutropenia.Please see www.TAVALISSEUSPI.com for Full Prescribing Information.

About REZLIDHIA®INDICATIONREZLIDHIA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with a susceptible isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION WARNING: DIFFERENTIATION SYNDROMEDifferentiation syndrome, which can be fatal, can occur with REZLIDHIA treatment. Symptoms may include dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates/pleuropericardial effusion, kidney injury, hypotension, fever, and weight gain. If differentiation syndrome is suspected, withhold REZLIDHIA and initiate treatment with corticosteroids and hemodynamic monitoring until symptom resolution. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSDifferentiation SyndromeREZLIDHIA can cause differentiation syndrome. In the clinical trial of REZLIDHIA in patients with relapsed or refractory AML, differentiation syndrome occurred in 16% of patients, with grade 3 or 4 differentiation syndrome occurring in 8% of patients treated, and fatalities in 1% of patients. Differentiation syndrome is associated with rapid proliferation and differentiation of myeloid cells and may be life-threatening or fatal. Symptoms of differentiation syndrome in patients treated with REZLIDHIA included leukocytosis, dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates/pleuropericardial effusion, kidney injury, fever, edema, pyrexia, and weight gain. Of the 25 patients who experienced differentiation syndrome, 19 (76%) recovered after treatment or after dose interruption of REZLIDHIA. Differentiation syndrome occurred as early as 1 day and up to 18 months after REZLIDHIA initiation and has been observed with or without concomitant leukocytosis. If differentiation syndrome is suspected, temporarily withhold REZLIDHIA and initiate systemic corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone 10 mg IV every 12 hours) for a minimum of 3 days and until resolution of signs and symptoms. If concomitant leukocytosis is observed, initiate treatment with hydroxyurea, as clinically indicated. Taper corticosteroids and hydroxyurea after resolution of symptoms. Differentiation syndrome may recur with premature discontinuation of corticosteroids and/or hydroxyurea treatment. Institute supportive measures and hemodynamic monitoring until improvement; withhold dose of REZLIDHIA and consider dose reduction based on recurrence. HepatotoxicityREZLIDHIA can cause hepatotoxicity, presenting as increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), increased blood alkaline phosphatase, and/or elevated bilirubin. Of 153 patients with relapsed or refractory AML who received REZLIDHIA, hepatotoxicity occurred in 23% of patients; 13% experienced grade 3 or 4 hepatotoxicity. One patient treated with REZLIDHIA in combination with azacitidine in the clinical trial, a combination for which REZLIDHIA is not indicated, died from complications of drug-induced liver injury. The median time to onset of hepatotoxicity in patients with relapsed or refractory AML treated with REZLIDHIA was 1.2 months (range: 1 day to 17.5 months) after REZLIDHIA initiation, and the median time to resolution was 12 days (range: 1 day to 17 months). The most common hepatotoxicities were elevations of ALT, AST, blood alkaline phosphatase, and blood bilirubin. Monitor patients frequently for clinical symptoms of hepatic dysfunction such as fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine, or jaundice. Obtain baseline liver function tests prior to initiation of REZLIDHIA, at least once weekly for the first two months, once every other week for the third month, once in the fourth month, and once every other month for the duration of therapy. If hepatic dysfunction occurs, withhold, reduce, or permanently discontinue REZLIDHIA based on recurrence/severity. ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were aspartate aminotransferase increased, alanine aminotransferase increased, potassium decreased, sodium decreased, alkaline phosphatase increased, nausea, creatinine increased, fatigue/malaise, arthralgia, constipation, lymphocytes increased, bilirubin increased, leukocytosis, uric acid increased, dyspnea, pyrexia, rash, lipase increased, mucositis, diarrhea and transaminitis. DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid concomitant use of REZLIDHIA with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers.Avoid concomitant use of REZLIDHIA with sensitive CYP3A substrates unless otherwise instructed in the substrates prescribing information. If concomitant use is unavoidable, monitor patients for loss of therapeutic effect of these drugs.LACTATIONAdvise women not to breastfeed during treatment with REZLIDHIA and for 2 weeks after the last dose. GERIATRIC USENo overall differences in effectiveness were observed between patients 65 years and older and younger patients. Compared to patients younger than 65 years of age, an increase in incidence of hepatotoxicity and hypertension was observed in patients ≥65 years of age. HEPATIC IMPAIRMENTIn patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, closely monitor for increased probability of differentiation syndrome.

Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial(s). IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis: Severe, life-threatening, and fatal ILD/pneumonitis can occur in patients treated with GAVRETO. Pneumonitis occurred in 12% of patients who received GAVRETO, including 3.3% with Grade 3-4, and 0.2% with fatal reactions. Monitor for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis. Withhold GAVRETO and promptly investigate for ILD in any patient who presents with acute or worsening of respiratory symptoms (e.g., dyspnea, cough, and fever). Withhold, reduce dose or permanently discontinue GAVRETO based on severity of confirmed ILD.Hypertension: Occurred in 35% of patients, including Grade 3 hypertension in 18% of patients. Overall, 8% had their dose interrupted and 4.8% had their dose reduced for hypertension. Treatment-emergent hypertension was most commonly managed with anti-hypertension medications. Do not initiate GAVRETO in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Optimize blood pressure prior to initiating GAVRETO. Monitor blood pressure after 1 week, at least monthly thereafter and as clinically indicated. Initiate or adjust anti-hypertensive therapy as appropriate. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue GAVRETO based on the severity.Hepatotoxicity: Serious hepatic adverse reactions occurred in 1.5% of patients treated with GAVRETO. Increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) occurred in 49% of patients, including Grade 3 or 4 in 7% and increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) occurred in 37% of patients, including Grade 3 or 4 in 4.8%. The median time to first onset for increased AST was 15 days (range: 5 days to 2.5 years) and increased ALT was 24 days (range: 7 days to 3.7 years). Monitor AST and ALT prior to initiating GAVRETO, every 2 weeks during the first 3 months, then monthly thereafter and as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce dose or permanently discontinue GAVRETO based on severity.Hemorrhagic Events: Serious, including fatal, hemorrhagic events can occur with GAVRETO. Grade ≥3 events occurred in 4.1% of patients treated with GAVRETO including one patient with a fatal hemorrhagic event. Permanently discontinue GAVRETO in patients with severe or life-threatening hemorrhage.Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS): Cases of TLS have been reported in patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma receiving GAVRETO. Patients may be at risk of TLS if they have rapidly growing tumors, a high tumor burden, renal dysfunction, or dehydration. Closely monitor patients at risk, consider appropriate prophylaxis including hydration, and treat as clinically indicated.Risk of Impaired Wound Healing: Impaired wound healing can occur in patients who receive drugs that inhibit the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway. Therefore, GAVRETO has the potential to adversely affect wound healing. Withhold GAVRETO for at least 5 days prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of GAVRETO after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established.Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, GAVRETO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective non-hormonal contraception during treatment with GAVRETO and for 2 weeks after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with GAVRETO and for 1 week after the last dose.Common adverse reactions (≥25%) were musculoskeletal pain, constipation, hypertension, diarrhea, fatigue, edema, pyrexia, and cough. Common Grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities (≥2%) were decreased lymphocytes, decreased neutrophils, decreased hemoglobin, decreased phosphate, decreased leukocytes, decreased sodium, increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), decreased calcium (corrected), decreased platelets, increased alkaline phosphatase, increased potassium, decreased potassium, and increased bilirubin.Avoid coadministration of GAVRETO with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors, P-gp inhibitors, or combined P-gp and strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors. If coadministration cannot be avoided, reduce the GAVRETO dose. Avoid coadministration of GAVRETO with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers.

The company filed the third out of four modules in the U.S. modular PMA submission and ended the year with a total cash position of €57.7 million. Nyxoah plans to report DREAM U.S. pivotal study efficacy and safety data by early April and accelerate investments in the U.S. commercial organization for a late 2024 launch. Positive Nyxoah achieved record quarterly sales of €1.8 million, representing 87% sequential quarterly growth and 42% year-over-year increase. The company filed the third out of four modules in the U.S. modular PMA submission and ended 2023 with a total cash position of €57.7 million. Nyxoah plans to report DREAM U.S. pivotal study efficacy and safety data by early April and accelerate investments in the U.S. commercial organization for a late 2024 launch. Negative Research and development expenses increased to €26.7 million for the full year of 2023, compared to €15.9 million in 2022. Total operating loss for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 was €10.8 million and €45.1 million, respectively, driven by increased R&D spending. Cash and financial assets decreased to €57.7 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to €94.9 million on December 31, 2022. Financial Analyst The reported financial results of Nyxoah SA for the fourth quarter and financial year 2023 indicate a significant sequential quarterly growth of 87% and a year-over-year revenue increase of 41%. This performance is particularly noteworthy in the context of the medical technology industry, where product adoption rates and market penetration are critical growth indicators. The company's sales figures, primarily driven by the commercialization of the Genio® system in Germany, suggest an effective market strategy and increasing demand for their Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) treatment solutions.However, the substantial increase in research and development expenses, from €15.9 million in 2022 to €26.7 million in 2023, reflects the company's continued investment in innovation and clinical trials. While this is a positive sign of commitment to product development, it has contributed to an operating loss increase. The cash burn rate of approximately €4.6 million per month is also a critical factor for investors to consider, as it impacts the company's runway and future financing needs. The decrease in cash and financial assets from €94.9 million at the end of 2022 to €57.7 million at the end of 2023 raises questions about long-term financial sustainability and the potential need for additional capital infusions. Medical Research Analyst The upcoming report on the efficacy and safety data from the DREAM U.S. pivotal study is a pivotal event for Nyxoah. The study's outcome will likely influence the FDA's decision on the Pre-Market Approval (PMA) for the Genio® system. In the medical device sector, such regulatory milestones are critical as they can significantly alter the company's market access and competitive landscape. The Genio® system's approval in the U.S. could open up a substantial market for Nyxoah, considering the prevalence of OSA and the need for innovative treatments.Furthermore, the initiation of the ACCCESS U.S. pivotal study for complete concentric collapse (CCC) indicates Nyxoah's strategic focus on addressing more complex OSA cases, potentially differentiating their product in a crowded market. The company's R&D investments seem aligned with these strategic priorities, which may justify the increased expenditure in this area despite the current operating losses. Market Research Analyst Nyxoah's record quarterly sales and the growth in active German accounts from 38 to 48 suggest successful market penetration strategies in Europe. The targeted direct-to-consumer (DTC) efforts and partnership with ResMed in Germany are likely contributing factors to this growth. In the medical technology market, such partnerships and marketing strategies are essential for product adoption, especially when entering new markets or expanding within existing ones.The hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HGNS) market is still emerging and Nyxoah's Genio system is part of a niche segment within the broader OSA treatment landscape. The company's ability to increase its market share in Europe and potentially in the U.S. post-regulatory approval, will be critical for its long-term success. Investors should monitor the company's commercialization efforts and market reception of the Genio system closely, as these will be key drivers of future revenue growth. 03/05/2024 - 04:05 PM Nyxoah Reports Fourth Quarter and Financial Year 2023 Financial and Operating ResultsExpect to report DREAM U.S. pivotal study efficacy and safety data by early AprilAchieved record quarterly sales of €1.8 million Mont-Saint-Guibert, Belgium – March 5, 2024 10:05pm CET / 4:05pm ET – Nyxoah SA (Euronext Brussels/Nasdaq: NYXH) (“Nyxoah” or the “Company”), a medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative solutions to treat Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), today reported financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and financial year 2023.

(MRNS) achieves Phase 3 RAISE trial enrollment target, expects topline results in Q2 2024. ZTALMY® (ganaxolone) nets $6.6 million in Q4 2023 and $19.6 million in 2023. Cash runway into Q4 2024 with $150.3 million. Positive Marinus achieves enrollment target for Phase 3 RAISE trial in refractory status epilepticus ZTALMY® (ganaxolone) shows significant revenue growth in Q4 2023 and full year 2023 Cash balance of $150.3 million as of December 31, 2023, projected to fund operations into Q4 2024 Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results and revenue guidance provided by Marinus Pharmaceuticals indicate a significant year-over-year growth in net product revenues, from $2.9 million in 2022 to $19.6 million in 2023. This is a noteworthy increase, signaling strong market adoption of ZTALMY® and potentially reflecting the company's effective commercial strategy. Looking ahead, the projected net product revenue guidance for 2024 suggests continued growth, which could positively influence investor sentiment and the company's valuation. However, it's important to consider the increased R&D and SG&A expenses, which have contributed to the net losses reported. The cash runway into Q4 2024, supported by $150.3 million in cash and short-term investments, provides the company with a buffer to pursue its clinical and commercial objectives, but investors should monitor the burn rate and any potential need for additional financing. Medical Research Analyst The successful enrollment of the Phase 3 RAISE trial and the anticipated topline data release in Q2 2024 represent critical milestones for Marinus Pharmaceuticals in the development of ganaxolone for refractory status epilepticus (RSE). If the data are positive and the NDA submission is successful, this could lead to a new treatment option for a life-threatening condition, potentially impacting the standard of care and creating a new revenue stream for the company. The TrustTSC trial's progress is also significant, as tuberous sclerosis complex is a rare genetic condition with limited treatment options. The potential expansion of ganaxolone's indications could further drive revenue growth. However, the outcomes of these trials are uncertain and any setbacks could have adverse effects on the company's prospects. Market Research Analyst Marinus Pharmaceuticals' strategic partnerships, such as with Orion Corporation for the commercial launch of ZTALMY® in Europe, could open new markets and diversify revenue sources. The company's focus on rare genetic epilepsies, including a proof-of-concept study for epileptic encephalopathies, suggests an aim to capture niche markets with high unmet medical needs. This approach can be advantageous but also carries higher risks due to the specialized nature of the treatments and the smaller patient populations. The broader market implications of Marinus' developments will depend on the competitive landscape, regulatory approvals and the effectiveness of their commercialization efforts in these targeted areas. 03/05/2024 - 04:01 PM Phase 3 RAISE trial interim analysis enrollment target achieved with Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) review scheduled and topline results expected in first half of Q2 2024 Phase 3 TrustTSC trial approximately 85% enrolled with topline data now expected in first half of Q4 2024 ZTALMY® (ganaxolone) net product revenue of $6.6 million for Q4 2023 and $19.6 million for the full year ended December 31, 2023 Full year 2024 U.S. ZTALMY net product revenue guidance of between $32 and $34 million Cash runway projected into Q4 2024 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $150.3 million as of December 31, 2023 Marinus to host conference call today at 4:30 p.m. ET RADNOR, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: MRNS), a pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of innovative therapeutics to treat seizure disorders, today reported business highlights and financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. “We are thrilled to announce we have exceeded the enrollment threshold required to conduct an interim analysis in the Phase 3 RAISE trial in refractory status epilepticus, a life-threatening condition,” said Scott Braunstein, M.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Marinus. “With over 90 patients now randomized following several months of increasingly strong enrollment trends, we are on track to announce topline data in the second quarter, assuming efficacy criteria for the interim analysis are met. We also remain focused on advancing the Phase 3 TrustTSC trial in tuberous sclerosis complex and are confident that the new titration schedule is having the desired effect with the current discontinuation rate below 7%. We continue to see steady adoption of ZTALMY in CDKL5 deficiency disorder and are eager to build on this momentum throughout 2024 as we grow the ZTALMY franchise and prepare for RSE and TSC data this year.” ZTALMY® ZTALMY® (ganaxolone) oral suspension CV net product revenue of $6.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $19.6 million for the full year ended December 31, 2023 Continued growth in commercial patients with more than 165 patients active on therapy at the end of 2023 Full year 2024 projected U.S. ZTALMY net product revenues of between $32 and $34 million Orion Corporation continues to prepare for commercial launches of ZTALMY in select European countries in 2024 Clinical Pipeline Status Epilepticus Achieved enrollment target required for an interim analysis in the Phase 3 RAISE trial of intravenous (IV) ganaxolone in refractory status epilepticus (RSE) If pre-defined stopping criteria for the interim analysis are met, the Company expects to report topline data in the first half of the second quarter of 2024 Strong enrollment trends have continued and now expect approximately 100 patients to be randomized by the conclusion of the interim analysis; this larger database will support health economic outcomes Targeting submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in early 2025 with priority review expected Phase 3 RAISE II trial in RSE (for European registration) underway with enrollment expected to complete in the fourth quarter of 2025 Trial design underway with plans to submit a new protocol for IV ganaxolone in super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) to the FDA in the second quarter of 2024 To date, the Company has received over 25 physician requests for the use of IV ganaxolone to treat SRSE patients Ganaxolone development in the RAISE trial is being supported or in part by the Department of Health and Human Services; Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response; Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) under contract number 75A50120C00159.

For the fiscal year 2024, the Company expects ZTALMY U.S. net product revenues of between $32 and $34 million. Financial Results Recognized $6.6 million and $19.6 million in net product revenues for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, respectively, as compared to $2.3 million and $2.9 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022, respectively. Recognized $0.6 million and $11.4 million in Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) federal contract revenue for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, respectively, as compared to $1.8 million and $6.9 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022, respectively. Research and development (R&D) expenses were $26.4 million and $99.4 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, respectively, as compared to $21.4 million and $79.9 million, respectively, for the same periods in the prior year; the increase was due primarily to increased costs associated with our API onshoring effort, increased TSC and RSE clinical trial activity, and increased headcount. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $15.4 million and $61.2 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, respectively, as compared to $14.7 million and $56.8 million, respectively, for the same periods in the prior year; the primary drivers of the change were annualization of the U.S. ZTALMY launch costs and increased headcount.

Positive outlook for net revenue, gross margins, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted diluted EPS in 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported full-year net revenue increase of 57% and net income surge of 169% for ODDITY Tech Ltd. are indicative of a robust financial performance, substantially outpacing the company's own guidance. This performance is particularly noteworthy given the crossing of the $500 million net revenue threshold and the $100 million adjusted EBITDA milestone. The free cash flow generation of $85 million signals a strong liquidity position, which is essential for supporting ongoing investments and operational flexibility.From a financial analysis perspective, the significant improvement in gross margin, which expanded by 400 basis points year-over-year in the fourth quarter, suggests improved operational efficiency or pricing power. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 21% for the full year reflects a healthy profitability level that exceeds the industry standard for tech companies, which typically ranges from 15% to 25%. The company's strong balance sheet, characterized by $168 million in cash and equivalents and the absence of debt, positions it well for future growth initiatives without the immediate need for external financing. Market Research Analyst ODDITY's emphasis on technology investment and product development, as highlighted by the CEO, aligns with current market trends towards digital consumer platforms and innovative high-performance products. The company's strategic positioning within a large Total Addressable Market (TAM) and its focus on two transformative pillars—online consumer shift and science-backed product development—could potentially disrupt the market and capture significant market share.The establishment of ODDITY LABS as a leading molecule discovery platform, bolstered by the acquisition of Revela, is an aggressive move into R&D that could yield long-term competitive advantages. However, the substantial year-over-year increase in adjusted net income and EBITDA margins will set high expectations for the company's performance moving forward and maintaining this growth trajectory could be challenging as the company scales. Legal Expert While the financial results are strong, the lack of quantitative reconciliation for Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted diluted EPS to GAAP measures, due to the unpredictability of certain items, is a point of caution. Investors and stakeholders should be aware that non-GAAP measures can provide a different picture of financial health compared to GAAP measures. The company's disclaimer regarding the potential impact of these non-reconciled items on future GAAP results suggests that there may be significant one-time costs or adjustments that could affect future financials.Furthermore, the company's compliance with NASDAQ listing standards and reporting requirements, as evidenced by the successful completion of its IPO, is crucial for investor confidence. The addition of a $100 million credit facility, despite having no outstanding debt, provides a safety net that could be beneficial for navigating potential future market volatility or financing unforeseen investments. 03/05/2024 - 04:05 PM Record full year net revenue of $509 million, up 57% from year agoRecord net income of $59 million, up 169% from year ago, and record adjusted net income of $77 million, up 181% from year agoRecord adjusted EBITDA of $107 million, up 172% from year agoRecord $85 million of free cash flow generation NEW YORK, March 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ODDITY Tech Ltd.

We are playing in a huge TAM that is being transformed,” Holtzman continued. “And we have positioned our business to lead in two pillars of this transformation.

Please see the sections titled “Non GAAP Financial Measures” and “Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures” below for more information regarding ODDITY’s use of non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. ODDITY has not provided a quantitative reconciliation of its Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted diluted EPS outlook to the corresponding net income and diluted EPS GAAP measures, because the quantification of certain items included in the calculation of GAAP net income and GAAP diluted EPS cannot be calculated or predicted at this time without unreasonable efforts. ODDITY is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable reconciling items, which could have a potentially unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on its future GAAP financial results. The financial outlook figures presented above are forward-looking statements that are subject to a variety of assumptions and estimates. Actual results may differ materially from ODDITY’s financial outlook as a result of, among other things, the factors described under “Forward-Looking Statements” below.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures: In addition to the GAAP financial measures set forth in this press release, ODDITY has included the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income margin and Adjusted diluted EPS. ODDITY believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to management and investors to help evaluate ODDITY’s business, measure its performance, identify trends, prepare financial projections and make business decisions. ODDITY defines “Adjusted EBITDA” as net income before financial expenses (income), net, taxes on income, and depreciation and amortization as further adjusted to exclude share-based compensation expense and non-recurring items. “Adjusted EBITDA margin” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenue. ODDITY believes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are useful for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. By excluding certain items that may not be indicative of its recurring core operating results, ODDITY believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and interest income, which can vary substantially from company to company depending on their financing and capital structures and the method by which their assets were acquired. ODDITY defines “Adjusted net income” as net income adjusted for the impact of share-based compensation, non-recurring items and the tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments and “Adjusted net income margin” as Adjusted net income divided by net revenue. In addition, ODDITY defines “Adjusted diluted earnings per share” as Adjusted net income divided by diluted shares outstanding. ODDITY believes the presentations of Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income margin, and Adjusted diluted earnings per share are useful because they are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. Further, ODDITY believes these measures are helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results, because they exclude the impact of items that are outside the control of management or not reflective of our ongoing operations and performance. ODDITY’s non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, its financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these measures differently or not at all, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included with the financial tables at the end of this release under the heading “Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures.” Forward-Looking Statements: Certain statements in this press release may constitute “forward-looking” statements and information, within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that relate to our current expectations and views of future events.

(ROST) reported strong fourth-quarter and fiscal year 2023 results, with earnings per share rising to $1.82 for the quarter and $5.56 for the year. Net income increased to $610 million for the quarter and $1.9 billion for the year. The company also announced a new two-year $2.1 billion stock repurchase program and a 10% increase in the quarterly cash dividend. Fiscal 2024 guidance projects earnings per share of $5.64 to $5.89 for the year. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Ross Stores, Inc.'s announcement of increased earnings per share (EPS) and net income, alongside robust sales growth, indicates a strong performance in the retail sector. The significant rise from $1.31 to $1.82 EPS for the quarter and a 5% increase in comparable store sales for the fiscal year underscore the company's efficient operations and appeal to consumers. The $308 million sales benefit from the 53rd week provides a one-time boost, but even excluding this, the underlying performance remains solid. The improved operating margin, up by 165 basis points, suggests effective cost management, particularly in the context of lower freight costs.The new $2.1 billion stock repurchase program and increased quarterly dividend signal the board's confidence in the company's financial health and commitment to shareholder returns. This strategy may also be indicative of the company's assessment that its stock is undervalued or that it is an optimal use of excess cash to deliver shareholder value.However, the conservative guidance for fiscal 2024, anticipating a 2% to 3% growth in same store sales, reflects cautious optimism amid macroeconomic uncertainties. It's important for investors to monitor how the company navigates inflationary pressures and consumer spending patterns, especially given their target demographic's sensitivity to economic fluctuations. Market Research Analyst Ross Stores' performance can be attributed to their 'treasure hunt' retail model, which resonates well with cost-conscious consumers looking for quality branded items at discounted prices. This model has proven to be particularly effective during economic downturns or periods of weak consumer confidence, as it attracts bargain hunters and value-focused shoppers.The company's ability to deliver an appealing assortment of products is crucial for its continued market share growth. By maintaining this strategy, Ross Stores positions itself well against both traditional and online competitors, leveraging the persistent consumer demand for value deals.The retail landscape is increasingly competitive and Ross Stores' focus on enhancing customer experience and value proposition is vital. Their performance relative to other discount retailers will be a key indicator of their ability to sustain growth and market share gains in the long term. Economist The conservative guidance for the coming fiscal year, despite strong past performance, suggests that Ross Stores is aware of the broader economic headwinds that could impact discretionary consumer spending. While the company has fared well, the mention of ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic and geopolitical environments, as well as continued high costs for housing, food and gasoline, indicates an understanding that the retail sector is not immune to such pressures.Consumer spending, particularly among Ross Stores' core demographic of low-to-moderate income customers, is highly sensitive to economic conditions. Inflationary pressures can quickly erode disposable income, leading to reduced spending on non-essential goods. The company's strategy to take a conservative approach to forecasting may be prudent in preparing for potential downturns or shifts in consumer behavior.Analysis of the broader economic trends and their potential effects on the retail sector will be essential in evaluating the resilience of Ross Stores' business model in the face of these challenges. Monitoring inflation trends, consumer confidence indices and employment data will provide further context to the company's financial outlook and strategic decisions. 03/05/2024 - 04:01 PM Announces New Two-year Stock Repurchase Authorization and Raises Quarterly Cash Dividend Provides First Quarter and Fiscal 2024 Guidance DUBLIN, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: ROST) today reported earnings per share for the 14 weeks ended February 3, 2024 of $1.82, up from $1.31 per share for the 13 weeks ended January 28, 2023. Net income for the period rose to $610 million versus $447 million last year. Sales for the 14 weeks ended February 3, 2024 grew to $6.0 billion, with comparable store sales for the 13 weeks ended January 27, 2024 up a robust 7% over the same period last year. Fiscal 2023 earnings per share for the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2024 grew to $5.56, up from $4.38 in the 52-week fiscal 2022 year ended January 28, 2023. Net earnings for fiscal 2023 were $1.9 billion on sales of $20.4 billion, up from net earnings of $1.5 billion in fiscal 2022 on sales of $18.7 billion. Comparable store sales for the 52 weeks ended January 27, 2024 grew a solid 5%. The sales results for both the 2023 fourth quarter and fiscal year included a $308 million benefit from the 53rd week. Earnings per share for both periods also benefited from the extra week by approximately $0.20 per share. Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We are pleased with our fourth quarter sales and earnings results that were well ahead of our expectations. Our above-plan sales were driven by customers’ positive response to our improved assortments of quality branded bargains throughout our stores.” Ms. Rentler continued, “Fourth quarter operating margin grew 165 basis points to 12.4%, up from 10.7% in the prior year. This improvement was mainly due to the strong gains in same store sales and lower freight costs that were partially offset by higher incentives. The 53rd week also benefited operating margin by 80 basis points."" Board Approves New Two-Year Stock Repurchase Authorization and Increase in Quarterly Dividend During the recently completed fourth quarter, 1.9 million shares were repurchased for a total price of $247 million. For fiscal 2023, a total of 8.2 million shares of common stock were repurchased for an aggregate purchase price of $950 million, completing the two-year stock repurchase program as planned. The Company’s Board of Directors recently approved a new two-year $2.1 billion stock repurchase authorization for fiscal 2024 and 2025. This new program represents an 11% increase over the recently completed repurchase of $1.9 billion of common stock during 2022 and 2023 combined. The Board also authorized a 10% increase in the Company’s quarterly cash dividend to $0.3675 per share. This higher quarterly dividend amount is payable on March 29, 2024 to stockholders of record as of March 15, 2024. Ms. Rentler noted, “The increases to our stock repurchase and dividend programs reflect our continued commitment to enhancing stockholder value and returns given the strength of our balance sheet and our ongoing ability to generate significant amounts of cash after funding growth and other capital needs of the business.” Fiscal 2024 Guidance Looking ahead, Ms. Rentler said, “While we are encouraged by the sustained sales momentum that began in the second quarter of 2023 and continued through the holiday season, there remains ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic and geopolitical environments. In addition, while inflation has moderated, housing, food, and gasoline costs remain elevated and continue to pressure our low-to-moderate income customers’ discretionary spend. As a result, while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to continue to take a conservative approach to forecasting our business in 2024.” For the 52 weeks ending February 1, 2025, the Company is planning same store sales to grow 2% to 3% on top of a solid 5% gain in 2023. Based on these assumptions, fiscal 2024 earnings per share are projected to be $5.64 to $5.89 compared to $5.56 for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024. Again, last year’s results included an estimated per share benefit of $0.20 from the 53rd week. For the 13 weeks ending May 4, 2024, comparable store sales are forecast to be up 2% to 3% with earnings per share projected to be $1.29 to $1.35, up from $1.09 in the first quarter ended April 29, 2023. Ms. Rentler concluded, “As we move through the coming year, we remain focused on delivering a wide assortment of quality branded bargains for our customers. We believe this will be the most important driver of our ability to gain market share over both the short and long term.” The Company will host a conference call on Tuesday, March 5, 2024 at 4:15 p.m. Eastern time to provide additional details concerning its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 results, and management’s outlook for fiscal 2024.

Financial Analyst The reported financial results of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. demonstrate a robust year-over-year growth in both revenue and profitability metrics which are critical indicators of the company's financial health and operational efficiency. The 34% increase in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) to $3.44 billion is particularly notable as ARR is a key metric for software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies like CrowdStrike, reflecting the predictable and sustainable revenue stream from subscription-based services. The acceleration of net new ARR growth to 27% signifies a strong market demand for CrowdStrike's cybersecurity solutions.The company's achievement of a 31% free cash flow margin, which exceeds their target, alongside four consecutive quarters of GAAP net income, indicates effective cost management and the ability to generate cash while scaling operations. The substantial improvement from a GAAP net loss in fiscal 2023 to a GAAP net income in fiscal 2024 suggests that the company has reached a pivotal point in its growth trajectory, transitioning from a phase of heavy investment towards profitability.Investors may view these results favorably as they suggest that CrowdStrike is not only growing its customer base but also increasing its operational efficiency. However, it is important to monitor the company's future investments in innovation and market expansion to ensure that these do not adversely affect its newfound profitability. Market Research Analyst The cybersecurity landscape is rapidly evolving, with increasing threats and a growing need for comprehensive security solutions. CrowdStrike's financial results indicate that the company is effectively capitalizing on this market demand. The record figures reported for revenue, ARR and net income reflect CrowdStrike's competitive positioning in the cybersecurity industry. Their single platform approach to cloud security, identity protection and next-gen SIEM solutions, accounting for over $850 million of ending ARR, suggests a successful strategy in cross-selling and up-selling to their existing customer base.Additionally, CrowdStrike's strategic acquisitions, such as Flow Security and partnerships, like the one with Dell for Managed Detection and Response (MDR) services, demonstrate the company's commitment to expanding its product offerings and market reach. The recognition by Gartner and Forrester further solidifies CrowdStrike's reputation as a leader in the cybersecurity space. This diverse approach to growth through innovation, strategic acquisitions and partnerships may contribute to sustained growth and resilience against competitive pressures.For stakeholders, the positive financial outlook for the first quarter and full year of fiscal 2025 suggests continued confidence in the company's ability to grow and scale profitably. However, it is important to consider the broader economic conditions and potential market saturation as cybersecurity becomes an increasingly crowded space. Cybersecurity Expert CrowdStrike's robust performance, as indicated by the reported financial results, is a testament to the increasing importance of cybersecurity solutions in protecting endpoints, cloud workloads, identity and data. The company's module adoption rates, with 64% for five or more modules, suggest that customers are not only choosing CrowdStrike as their security provider but are also leveraging multiple solutions within their platform. This level of integration is indicative of customer trust in CrowdStrike's comprehensive security offerings and suggests a deepening reliance on their ecosystem.The company's focus on cloud data runtime security through the acquisition of Flow Security aligns with the industry trend towards securing cloud environments, which are becoming more prevalent as businesses continue their digital transformation journeys. The successful completion of IRAP and TISAX assessments further demonstrates CrowdStrike's commitment to meeting rigorous security standards, which can be a differentiating factor in winning business from security-conscious enterprises and government entities.While the financial results and strategic moves are promising, it is critical for CrowdStrike to maintain its innovative edge and adapt to emerging threats. The cybersecurity industry is highly dynamic and continuous investment in research and development is crucial to stay ahead of sophisticated cyber adversaries. 03/05/2024 - 04:05 PM Ending ARR grows 34% year-over-year to reach $3.44 billion Net new ARR growth accelerates to 27% year-over-year and reaches a record $282 million Achieves fourth consecutive quarter of both record GAAP and non-GAAP net income Delivers record operating and free cash flow AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.

The tax costs for intellectual property integration relating to acquisitions are included in the GAAP provision for income taxes. The income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles assets, including purchased patents, acquisition related expenses, amortization of debt issuance costs and discount, gains and other income from strategic investments attributable to CrowdStrike and legal reserve and settlement charges or benefits included in the GAAP provision for income taxes were not material for all periods presented. (2) For periods in which we had diluted non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike common stockholders, the sum of the impact of individual reconciling items may not total to diluted Non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike common stockholders because of rounding differences or because the basic share counts used to calculate GAAP net loss per share attributable to CrowdStrike common stockholders differ from the diluted share counts used to calculate non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike common stockholders. The GAAP net loss per share attributable to CrowdStrike common stockholders calculation uses a lower share count as it excludes dilutive shares which are included in calculating the non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike common stockholders.

CrowdStrike uses the following non-GAAP financial information to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. CrowdStrike believes that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as these measures eliminate the effects of certain variables unrelated to CrowdStrike’s overall operating performance. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Other companies, including companies in CrowdStrike’s industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of CrowdStrike’s non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate CrowdStrike’s business. Non-GAAP Subscription Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Subscription Gross Margin CrowdStrike defines non-GAAP subscription gross profit and non-GAAP subscription gross margin as GAAP subscription gross profit and GAAP subscription gross margin, respectively, excluding stock-based compensation expense, and amortization of acquired intangible assets. Non-GAAP Income from Operations CrowdStrike defines non-GAAP income from operations as GAAP income (loss) from operations excluding stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets (including purchased patents), acquisition-related expenses (credits), mark-to-market adjustments on deferred compensation liabilities, and legal reserve and settlement charges. Non-GAAP Net Income Attributable to CrowdStrike The company defines non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike as GAAP net income (loss) attributable to CrowdStrike excluding stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets (including purchased patents), acquisition-related expenses (credits), net, amortization of debt issuance costs and discount, mark-to-market adjustments on deferred compensation liabilities, legal reserve and settlement charges or benefits, acquisition-related provision (benefit) for income taxes, losses (gains) and other income from strategic investments, and losses (gains) on deferred compensation assets. Non-GAAP Net Income per Share Attributable to CrowdStrike Common Stockholders, Diluted CrowdStrike defines non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike common stockholders, as non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike divided by the weighted-average shares outstanding, which includes the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that CrowdStrike defines as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, capitalized internal-use software and website development costs, and purchases of deferred compensation investments. CrowdStrike monitors free cash flow as one measure of its overall business performance, which enables CrowdStrike to analyze its future performance without the effects of non-cash items and allow CrowdStrike to better understand the cash needs of its business. While CrowdStrike believes that free cash flow is useful in evaluating its business, free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that has limitations as an analytical tool, and free cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to, or substitute for, net cash provided by operating activities in accordance with GAAP. The utility of free cash flow as a measure of CrowdStrike’s liquidity is further limited as it does not represent the total increase or decrease in CrowdStrike’s cash balance for any given period. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate free cash flow differently or not at all, which reduces the usefulness of free cash flow as a tool for comparison. Explanation of Operational Measures Annual Recurring Revenue ARR is calculated as the annualized value of CrowdStrike’s customer subscription contracts as of the measurement date, assuming any contract that expires during the next 12 months is renewed on its existing terms. To the extent that CrowdStrike is negotiating a renewal with a customer after the expiration of the subscription, CrowdStrike continues to include that revenue in ARR if CrowdStrike is actively in discussion with such an organization for a new subscription or renewal, or until such organization notifies CrowdStrike that it is not renewing its subscription. Magic Number Magic Number is calculated by performing the following calculation for the most recent four quarters and taking the average: annualizing the difference between a quarter’s Subscription Revenue and the prior quarter’s Subscription Revenue, and then dividing the resulting number by the previous quarter’s Non-GAAP Sales & Marketing Expense. Magic Number = Average of previous four quarters: ((Quarter Subscription Revenue – Prior Quarter Subscription Revenue) x 4) / Prior Quarter Non-GAAP Sales & Marketing Expense. Free Cash Flow Rule of 40 Free cash flow rule of 40 is calculated by taking the current quarter total revenue year-over-year growth rate percentage and summing it with the current quarter free cash flow margin percentage.

Decrease in Adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share compared to the prior year. Agiliti will no longer be publicly listed or traded on the NYSE. Financial Analyst The reported financial results of Agiliti Inc. reflect a mixed performance, with a modest revenue growth of 4% to 5% for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively, but a concerning shift from net income in the previous year to a net loss in the current reporting period. This divergence suggests that while top-line growth is present, it could be overshadowed by rising costs or potential inefficiencies that have impacted the bottom line. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA by 5.7% and 10% for the respective periods further underscores the pressure on profitability.The announcement of Agiliti's acquisition by THL Partners at $10.00 per share, which is a critical strategic move, carries implications for the company's valuation and the stock market. The implied enterprise value of approximately $2.5 billion will need to be evaluated against the company's assets, debt and future earning potential. The net leverage ratio of 3.97x is a crucial indicator of the company's debt level relative to its EBITDA, which stakeholders should monitor closely in the context of the buyout. Market Research Analyst Agiliti's position as a provider of healthcare technology management and service solutions places it within a growing industry that is becoming increasingly essential due to technological advancements in healthcare. However, the transition from a public to a private entity could lead to changes in strategic direction, investment in innovation, or customer engagement models. It is important to assess whether the private ownership will enable Agiliti to be more agile and responsive to market demands without the pressure of quarterly financial reporting.Given that the transaction does not require further shareholder approval, it is likely to proceed without significant hurdles. The removal from public listing will also mean that Agiliti's performance will no longer be under the scrutiny of public investors, which may affect the transparency and availability of information about the company's operations and financial health in the future. Legal Expert The definitive merger agreement between Agiliti and THL Partners, L.P. is a legal transaction that must adhere to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. The fact that the majority shareholder has approved the transaction simplifies the approval process, but it is still subject to antitrust and other regulatory reviews. The legal ramifications of the transaction, including any potential changes in contracts, liabilities and corporate governance, will be of interest to stakeholders.It is also noteworthy that Agiliti will not hold a conference call to discuss the financial results, which is an atypical approach and may raise questions about transparency and stakeholder communication during this transitional period. 03/05/2024 - 04:05 PM EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Agiliti Inc.

We use these internally as measures of operational performance, or liquidity, as applicable, and disclose them externally to assist analysts, investors and lenders in their comparisons of operational performance, valuation and debt capacity across companies with differing capital, tax and legal structures. We believe the investment community frequently uses these measures in the evaluation of similarly situated companies. Adjusted EBITDA is also used by the Company as a factor to determine the total amount of incentive compensation to be awarded to executive officers and other employees. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, Net Debt and Net Leverage Ratio, however, are not measures of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, net income as measures of operating performance or to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities or to total debt as measures of liquidity or debt capacity. Since EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, Net Debt and Net Leverage Ratio are not measures determined in accordance with GAAP and are thus susceptible to varying interpretations and calculations, these measures, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Net Income do not represent amounts of funds that are available for management’s discretionary use. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA presented may not be the same as EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA calculations as defined in the First Lien Credit Facilities. EBITDA is defined as earnings attributable to Agiliti, Inc. before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding non-cash share-based compensation expense, management fees and other non-recurring gains, expenses, or losses, transaction costs, remeasurement of the tax receivable agreement and loss on extinguishment of debt.
