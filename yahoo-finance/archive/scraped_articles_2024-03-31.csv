Motley Fool,Better Dividend Stock to Buy Now: Medtronic vs. Walgreens Boots Alliance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-dividend-stock-buy-now-181700854.html,Which dividend-paying healthcare stock is better positioned to produce a rapidly growing payout?,"If you're an everyday investor looking for stocks that can deliver steadily rising dividend payouts over long periods, the healthcare sector is the right place to begin your search. People get sick during economic downturns just as often as they do when businesses are booming.Medtronic (NYSE: MDT) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) are two dividend-paying giants of the healthcare sector. Both offer yields that are far more attractive than the paltry 1.4% yield you can receive from the average stock in the benchmark S&P 500 index.Here's a closer look at their recent performances to see which is most likely to deliver steadily growing payouts in the years ahead.The case for MedtronicMedtronic's focus on developing new medical technology has served its shareholders well. The company has been able to raise its quarterly dividend payout for 46 consecutive years. The stock offers a 3.2% yield at recent prices.Medtronic's dividend payout has grown 146% over the past 10 years but that pace slowed down. The payout has grown just 9.5% over the past three years.MDT Dividend ChartMany of the devices Medtronic sells, such as pacemakers and spinal stimulators, aren't implanted into patients until after they jump through a lot of medical hoops. The COVID-19 pandemic threw a wrench in the company's gearbox, but investors will be glad to learn that total sales are up 7% over the past three years.Medtronic sales and earnings have a strong chance to continue moving in the right direction. The company's product lineup has expanded significantly in recent months. During its fiscal third quarter that ended Jan. 26, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the company's new pulsed field ablation system and a new neurostimulator. More recently, the FDA approved the company's new aortic valve replacement system.The case for Walgreens Boots AllianceThe past several years have been difficult ones for Walgreens Boots Alliance shareholders. In a nutshell, the company's attempt to become more than a chain of retail pharmacies isn't working out. As a result, it reduced its dividend by 48% this year. At recent prices, the stock offers a 4.6% yield.Story continuesInvestors who follow Walgreens closely will remember it had planned to launch 1,000 primary care practices in partnership with VillageMD, a joint venture partly owned by Cigna. Walgreens plowed billions into VillageMD but has nothing but losses to show for it. During Walgreens' fiscal second quarter that ended Feb. 29, the partners wrote down the value of VillageMD by $12.4 billion.WBA Dividend ChartWalgreens' portion of the latest VillageMD impairment charge worked out to $5.8 billion and led to a reported net loss of $5.9 billion in its fiscal second quarter. Even after adjusting for non-cash impairment charges, the company reported second-quarter operating income that sank 26.5% year over year to just $900 million.Retail pharmacies are increasingly at the whim of pharmacy benefits managers, or PBMs, that essentially determine how much they receive for dispensing prescription drugs. Without a PBM of its own, it's hard to see how Walgreens will grow its bottom line in the years ahead.The better dividend stock to buy nowWalgreens offers a higher yield, but shrinking profit margin in the retail pharmacy space could make growing its bottom line, and dividend payout, next to impossible over the long run.Medtronic's not growing as quickly as it used to, but developing new medical technology is a more lucrative endeavor than the troubled retail pharmacy business. With its dividend-raising streak still intact, and plenty of newly approved products to market, Medtronic looks like a much better dividend stock to buy.Should you invest $1,000 in Medtronic right now?Before you buy stock in Medtronic, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Medtronic wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,2 Risks Investors Should Know Before Buying Pinduoduo Stock,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-risks-investors-know-buying-180700198.html,Investors in Pinduoduo stock will need to have a strong gut.,
Motley Fool,Bull Market Buys: 2 Dividend Stocks to Own for the Long Run,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bull-market-buys-2-dividend-180300228.html,"If you are looking for reliable dividend stocks, then these two historically high-yielders will be right up your alley.","If you are a dividend investor like me, you prize consistency in all market environments, bull or bear. A high yield backed by a dividend that gets cut is likely to lead to less income and a loss of capital. No thanks! This is why one of the first screens I use when looking for a stock is a company's history of increasing its dividend. Then, I look at the businesses behind the dividend. Enbridge (NYSE: ENB) and NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) both come out looking like stocks that dividend investors would want to own for the long run.Enbridge is a slow and steady tortoiseCanadian Enbridge is lumped together with the midstream energy sector. That's an appropriate place for it, given that around 57% of the company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) comes from oil pipelines and another 28% from natural gas pipelines. It is, in fact, one of the largest midstream companies in North America, with a portfolio of energy infrastructure that would be difficult, if not impossible, to replace or replicate.The pipelines and other midstream assets it owns are largely fee-driven, which results in fairly consistent cash flow regardless of what is going on with energy prices. But do the quick math -- this side of the company makes up 85% of EBITDA. The rest comes from a regulated natural gas utility (12% of EBITDA) and renewable power assets (the remainder). Regulated utilities are super boring and reliable cash flow generators, and the renewable power assets Enbridge owns are under long-term contracts.There's plenty of cash flow coming in to cover the historically high 7.5% dividend yield, noting that the distributable cash flow payout ratio is comfortably in the middle of the company's target 60% to 70% range. The dividend, meanwhile, has been increased annually for 29 consecutive years. There's no indication that the dividend streak is anywhere near ending.That said, Enbridge is about to get even more boring and reliable with the planned purchase of three additional regulated natural gas utilities in 2024. That will shift the business mix to 50% oil pipes, 25% gas pipes, 22% gas utilities, and 3% clean energy. Being a conservative and steady dividend payer is clearly a high priority for management. While the high yield is likely to make up the lion's share of your total return here, that should be a net positive for investors seeking to maximize the income they generate from their portfolios.Story continuesNEE Dividend Yield ChartNextEra is a great option for dividend growth investorsNot everyone is looking for stocks that have high yields; some prefer to own companies that reward income investors with rapid dividend growth. That is exactly what you'll get with NextEra Energy, one of the largest utilities in the United States. A high-dividend-growth utility may sound too good to be true, but NextEra Energy's dividend has been increased at a 10% annualized clip over the past decade. That's pretty good for any company, but extra impressive for a utility. In fact, half that dividend growth rate would be strong for a utility!Better yet, NextEra Energy's management team is projecting dividend growth to be around 10% per year all the way out to 2026. So there are more sizable dividend hikes to come, backed by earnings growth of between 6% and 8% a year. For reference, the dividend has been increased each year for 29 consecutive years, and the dividend yield is a historically high 3.3% or so right now. While a 3.3% yield won't excite income-focused investors, combined with the robust dividend growth rate, NextEra Energy should be quite alluring to dividend growth and growth and income investors.The key to the growth story here is that NextEra Energy actually mixes a slow and steady regulated utility operation with a fast growing renewable power business. Since the clean energy transition that's taking shape will be a decades-long affair, there's no reason to believe that NextEra Energy's growth runway will come to a sudden halt anytime soon.You pick: High yield or high growthEnbridge and NextEra Energy will probably appeal to different types of investors. But they share some very important traits. Both have impressive dividend histories, strong and reliable businesses, and historically high yields. They are the types of dividend stocks that you buy and hold for the long run, particularly if you acquire them while they appear to be on sale.Should you invest $1,000 in Enbridge right now?Before you buy stock in Enbridge, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Enbridge wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Forget Apple: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Now,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-apple-2-artificial-intelligence-171700786.html,Apple isn't what it once was. Here are two AI stocks that could take its place.,"For years, Apple has been the top dog. But, as they say, the times are a-changin'.iPhones are old news. Unit sales of the devices have leveled off after years of growth. What's more, the company is now embroiled in an antitrust case with the U.S. Department of Justice that could last years and cost millions -- or billions -- in legal costs and fines.The time may finally be here for investors to look elsewhere for outperformance. Let's have a look at two artificial intelligence (AI) stocks that could be suitable portfolio replacements for Apple.Image source: Getty Images.1. MicrosoftFirst up is Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). In the decades-old battle between Microsoft and Apple, Microsoft has taken the upper hand in recent months as its market cap has once again surpassed its rival.In part, that's down to Microsoft's competitive advantages in the field of AI. The company has several AI initiatives that are already bearing fruit.Microsoft is leaning into the AI chatbot craze with its Copilot assistant. With its ability to generate images, compose emails, code, and shop, Microsoft is hoping Copilot can become many people's ""everyday AI companion."" The company's close partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI puts Microsoft on the front lines of AI innovation. One year ago, after ChatGPT took the world by storm, Microsoft integrated some ChatGPT features into its Office software suite -- quickly capitalizing on the buzz.Finally, thanks to Microsoft's large cloud services business, the company should expect to benefit from the growth of the overall AI market. As AI start-ups look to scale their models, they will turn to Microsoft -- which, as the No. 2 cloud services provider, controls many of the high-performance computers needed to run the latest and greatest AI models.Microsoft has several ways to win as the AI revolution rolls on. Accordingly, it may be time for investors to load up on Microsoft and leave Apple behind.Story continues2. Super Micro ComputerYes, it's true: Super Micro Computer's (NASDAQ: SMCI) stock is up more than 800% in a year.However, that incredible outperformance shouldn't scare off long-term investors. Here's why: Super Micro Computer's overall business model is straightforward. The company makes the physical hardware that holds and cools the enormously complex -- and expensive -- graphics processing units (GPUs) that power the most complex AI models.In other words, Super Micro Computer is rolling like an ice cream shop in the middle of a heatwave.Granted, that boom won't last forever. However, it could last a lot longer than many think. That's because the overall GPU market is expected to grow 10 times from 2022 through 2032. What's more, those estimates might actually be too conservative. Some industry insiders think the market might grow from $40 billion to $400 billion by 2027, not 2032.Either way, there is an avalanche of demand for high-powered GPUs, and consequently, for the server racks to house them.That's why analysts expect Super Micro Computer's total sales to skyrocket from $7.1 billion to $14.6 billion this year. By 2025, Wall Street expects sales to surpass $20.7 billion.For long-term investors looking for a growth stock with serious legs, Super Micro Computer is a name to consider.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Yahoo Finance,Market strategist explains the 3 hallmarks of meme stocks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/market-strategist-explains-the-3-hallmarks-of-meme-stocks-163031097.html,"Meme stocks are back, and these Wall Street strategists have advice on how to evaluate volatile trades.","Meme stocks are making a resurgence as the broader stock market ends the first quarter on a strong note.Though the meme stock frenzy hasn't quite reached the same intensity as it did in 2021, when GameStop (GME) and AMC (AMC) stocks catapulted to new heights, the meme phenomenon has continued in a concentrated handful of standouts.In recent trading, for example, there’s been an uptick in interest in GameStop (GME) sparked in part by new additions to the market via IPO, such as Reddit (RDDT) and Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (DJT).Reddit stock soared over 90% to more than $65 a share in its first three days of trading, well above its IPO price of $34 a share. Shares of the social network platform have continued to experience volatility, however, falling to around $49 as of Thursday's close.And after initially rising by as much as 50% on its first day of trading, Trump Media also saw a decrease in value later in the week, as the stock closed Thursday's session around $62 per share.""It's been momentum all along since November, but the leading momentum stocks have generally been stocks that have been delivering the goods,"" Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above) about the broader market rally. ""We're starting to see people chase stocks just simply because they're going up, not because of any fundamental reason. That, to me, indicates froth.""Annex Wealth Management's Brian Jacobsen told Yahoo Finance Live that investor interest in meme stocks could be tied directly to FOMO mentality, or a fear of missing out.“They’re trying to find the next hot thing, and they’re just beginning to chase it and pile into it,” Jacobsen said. “That obviously can work well, but it can also then end in tears, especially if you don’t get into those names early enough.”3 hallmarks of meme stocksBut what is a meme stock, exactly?Sosnick explained that there are three main criteria for evaluating if a stock belongs to the category.Story continuesThe first indicator of a meme stock is a ""quasi-religious fervor,"" according to Sosnick.""It's one thing to be enthusiastic about a stock, it's another thing to just be so hyped up about it,"" Sosnick said. ""Think about how the real apes were in AMC, the real devotees in GameStop early on. Certainly, one can say that about the former president's base, who I think helped getting DJT's stock moving.""The second criterion is a disregard for fundamentals. Traditionally, investors look for opportunities that offer a financial return over a long-term time horizon, especially one that can beat the market's performance over that same time period.On the other hand, many meme stock investors have a much shorter time horizon in mind as they look to quickly flip speculative assets if the price spikes to turn a hefty profit.""If you're believing in the faith of a stock, if you have a non-analytical view of the stock, well, then you could disregard the fundamentals,"" Sosnick added, noting that stocks trading on momentum can seem expensive ""by any conventional metrics.""The trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) prepares for Reddit's initial public offering on March 21, 2024, in New York City. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images) (Spencer Platt via Getty Images)Lastly, Sosnick said investors should watch for high short interest.Short interest refers to bets made by investors that a stock's price will fall rather than rise. In the case of DJT, the high short interest was precedented but still in a high range of 11%. The average short interest for public companies is typically between 3% and 4% but can reach as high as 40% when investors are more pessimistic.Essentially, according to Sosnick’s definition, meme stocks utilize an intense passion from retail investors who are willing to take on more risk and ignore some of the more conventional investing strategies for a chance at higher returns, especially in the short term.Public COO Stephen Sikes largely agreed, though he doesn’t think it’s quite that simple. Sikes claimed that meme stocks are attractive to a wide variety of investors with different goals and strategies, not just those looking to flip them for an immediate return.“We have some investors that are long-term buy-and-hold investors, and we have some that are traders trying to take advantage of volatility and momentum in the market,” Sikes said. “They see an opportunity here more so than sort of the quasi-religious fervor you might have seen in prior eras.”As for why meme stocks are back in the picture, Sikes told Yahoo Finance that a combination of investors’ familiarity with a company’s products or brand and increased market volatility is likely to blame.And when asked where investors may be able to find the next targets of “meme mania,” Jacobsen noted the market may shift toward the small-cap space and underperforming sectors such as industrials, manufacturing, and utilities.Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"
TechCrunch,The market is forcing cloud vendors to relax data egress fees,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/market-forcing-cloud-vendors-relax-160041023.html,"Amazon, Microsoft and Google — have relaxed their egress fees, which are a tax of sorts that the cloud companies charge customers to move their data to another vendor.  It’s a way to keep existing customers in the fold, but it’s kind of a ham-handed way to do it, and doesn’t exactly foster goodwill.  For example, there are limits to the kind of data you can move, and each requires you to contact the vendor and open a request to get your own data out of the cloud.","In recent months, the big three cloud vendors — Amazon, Microsoft and Google — have relaxed their egress fees, which are a tax of sorts that the cloud companies charge customers to move their data to another vendor. It’s a way to keep existing customers in the fold, but it’s kind of a ham-handed way to do it, and doesn’t exactly foster goodwill.As a number of factors come into play, like the reality of a multi-cloud world, a stricter regulatory environment and consumer backlash, these companies are beginning to see the error in their ways by easing these fees, albeit with lots of caveats and a bit of friction involved. For example, there are limits to the kind of data you can move, and each requires you to contact the vendor and open a request to get your own data out of the cloud. But it’s a start at least.This change of heart is really an acknowledgement of changing market dynamics, says John Dinsdale, chief analyst and managing director at Synergy Research, a firm that tracks the cloud infrastructure market. “I think this is a natural progression of the market. As true competition heats up, it would do cloud providers no good to be seen as being overly protectionist,” Dinsdale told TechCrunch.“Giving customers what they want is just the right business strategy. In the IT world of the last few years, legacy companies that have tried to hang on to the old ways of doing things have not done well,” he said.Google says it’ll stop charging fees to transfer data out of Google CloudIt’s also clear that we are moving into a multi-cloud world where it’s more important than ever to remove friction around moving data, says Jake Graham, CEO and co-founder at Bobsled, a startup that helps customers move data between clouds. His role puts him on the front lines of this issue.“In the original cloud world, the three major cloud vendors were really fighting to try to build what felt like walled gardens, and as long as you built on top of them, everything was great. But going across them was really challenging,"" Graham said. “They're starting to get significant pushback from their enterprise customers, who are saying that there is no world in which a global enterprise is not using multiple platforms.” He says that charging these fees is putting up a significant barrier to moving data, making it difficult to share with customers, and even within divisions inside the same company.Story continuesRudina Seseri, founder and managing partner at Glasswing Ventures, says the shift is partly due to regulatory pressure, but that isn’t the only reason. “At a high level, this emergence of regulation is a pretty simple explanation for the sudden change in behavior,"" she said. ""However, I think it is also worth pointing out the optics of preemptively making such a language switch, and how Google has used it as a marketing tool against Azure. If these companies see the demise of egress fees as an inevitability, then Google certainly has first-mover advantage towards painting itself as the 'less restrictive' cloud and attracting early-stage customers,” she said.AWS follows Google in announcing unrestricted free data transfers to other cloud providers“Metaphorically, the market dynamic is moving away from the stick and back towards the carrot. Cloud customers looking to switch providers will need to be retained through innovative and accessible features now that the punishment of egress fees is being phased out,” Seseri said.David Linthicum, a longtime cloud consultant, says that while these recent announcements are a pleasant PR move, he warns folks to review their bills carefully because egress fees aren’t the only problem. “This is a nice surprise, but it's not necessarily consequential. Customers have to consider the costs holistically,” Linthicum told TechCrunch. “In other words, what are we paying for the services we're leveraging? What are we paying for the networking fees, the egress fees, all the other hidden fees that come along with what people call junk fees that come from the cloud vendors?”But this may not affect startups as much as larger enterprise customers. “There are more moving parts in a cloud ecosystem than just storage, such as services required for scaling and security, and the largest companies have built tight infrastructures that can be onerous to unwind,"" Seseri said. ""The experience of startups, however, will certainly improve as providers now must lean further into innovative features and improved customer satisfaction to win long-term loyalty.""After AWS and Google, Microsoft says it’s removing Azure ‘egress’ data transfer fees — but with caveatsGraham, whose primary business is helping move data, sees his whole business model affected by these fees. He says the recent changes are a small but important step, but he also sees a future where it’s increasingly difficult to determine what is an egress fee and what’s not, which could lead to the ultimate demise of these fees.That’s because migrations take a long time. It’s not a clean break like, ""I was in AWS and now I’m GCP."" It’s a lengthy process over years where data sources that need to communicate are in both clouds for a period of time. At the same time, he says the original cloud vendor is working hard to get the customer to change their minds and come back, and it’s an impossible balancing act for these companies.“You’re just going to have this battle between the team that is associated with winning back the customer, trying to make the customer happy, and another group that says, wait a second, we already lost this customer. We should be charging them everything. Why are we giving them favorable treatment?”As data becomes increasingly valuable in the age of AI, being able to move data and put it to work is growing in importance for everyone. Cloud vendors are going to be a lot better off getting in front of this trend instead of throwing up roadblocks to make it more difficult to move data around. Perhaps this is just the start of something much bigger."
Motley Fool,Is Pinterest Stock a Buy?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pinterest-stock-buy-160000750.html,The company's business revived as efforts to bolster its platform bore fruit.,"Shares of digital pinboard site Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) experienced a resurgence in the past few months. The stock hit a 52-week high of $41.60 in February.That's a dramatic turnaround from the 52-week low of $20.60 reached last May. The company's growth in both monthly active users (MAUs) and revenue last year helped to drive the stock price reversal.Since then, shares have retreated from its February high. But does this signal a buy opportunity?To make a decision whether to snatch up Pinterest stock, it's important to understand if the company's performance can endure over the long run. To that end, let's examine Pinterest more closely.Pinterest's user growth successPinterest ended 2023 on a high note. The company reported record high monthly active users of 498 million in the fourth quarter, an 11% jump up from 2022. This led to $3.1 billion in 2023 revenue, up from the prior year's $2.8 billion.Last year's growth in MAUs was no fluke. Pinterest's management team established new business priorities for the company after CEO Bill Ready took over the top spot in the summer of 2022. One of these priorities was to grow users on Pinterest's platform.The company is achieving this objective with the help of artificial intelligence (AI). Pinterest employs AI to find and recommend content tailored to the specific interests of each user to keep people engaged on the platform.Pinterest also added new features in 2023, such as its collage functionality, which allows users to cut out images from their content collection and combine them. The majority of users adopting this collage capability are those who have never pinned content on Pinterest, indicating the feature's success in pulling in new users.Pinterest's compelling financialsAlong with user growth, the company is focused on raising its average revenue per user (ARPU). Pinterest is tackling this from multiple fronts. First, it more than doubled the number of advertising products available to marketers who want to run ads on the platform.Story continuesSecond, Pinterest is partnering with other businesses to help it deliver a larger pool of ads to its users. These partners include Amazon and Alphabet-owned Google. For example, Pinterest shows Amazon's ads to users. When a user clicks on these ads, they are taken to Amazon to buy.Through these efforts, Pinterest's global ARPU ticked up from 2022's $6.36 to $6.44 by the end of 2023. More importantly, ARPU in North America rose from $24.38 in 2022 to $25.52 last year. This region generated $2.4 billion of Pinterest's $3.1 billion in 2023 revenue.Yet despite its sales growth, Pinterest is not profitable. The company exited 2023 with a net loss of $35.6 million. However, achieving profitable growth is one of Pinterest's key business priorities.As part of this, the company performed cost cuts in 2023, and consequently, its net loss last year was a 63% improvement over the prior year's loss of $96 million.Moreover, the company exited 2023 with a spectacular balance sheet. Its total assets of $3.6 billion far exceeded total liabilities of $503.7 million. Its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities alone were $2.5 billion.Deciding whether to buy Pinterest sharesSo far, Pinterest has seen success under Bill Ready, and the company expects continued growth in 2024. Pinterest forecasts Q1 revenue to reach at least $690 million, a double-digit increase from 2022's $603 million.The company is showing positive momentum, and that's helped its stock price. In fact, the median share price target among Wall Street analysts is $44.30, and the current consensus among these analysts is an overweight rating for Pinterest stock.The one question is whether Pinterest can capture greater ARPU growth outside of North America. Ready noted about 80% of Pinterest's users are located internationally yet represent only 20% of revenue.The company is hoping to see international ARPU gains over time through its Google and Amazon partnerships. Pinterest is also working on additional partnerships to help deliver international ARPU growth.Its rising MAUs, strategies for increasing ARPU, and solid financials show Pinterest is on the right track under Ready. This makes Pinterest stock a worthwhile long-term investment as the company continues to push toward greater revenue growth and profitability over the next three to five years.Should you invest $1,000 in Pinterest right now?Before you buy stock in Pinterest, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Pinterest wasn’t one of them.
