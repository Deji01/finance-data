The limited run of ‘dumb’ phones – specifically designed to have reduced tech capabilities - has been created to encourage people to enjoy better real-life connections on nights out by disconnecting from their smartphones. With smartphones becoming so advanced and interesting to the user, it’s easier than ever to connect to the online world but harder to stay in the moment. Produced by European mobile innovator, Human Mobile Devices (HMD), the Heineken® x Bodega Boring Phone strips back the distractions of today’s smartphones. Designed to deliver the basics needed for a great night out, the phone’s primary function is to send and receive calls and text messages. The phone’s transparent casing and holographic stickers draw inspiration from Gen Z’s love of Newtro fashion and design and are reminiscent of mobile phones of the early 2000s. With modern-day frills removed, the phone is unable to download social media or other apps that take away from being present. It also has a handy week of standby time and up to 20 hours of talk time. As smartphones continue to dominate attention spans globally, new research commissioned by Heineken® reveals 90% of Zillennials* across the UK and US confess to doom scrolling while socialising with friends and family; checking their devices seven times each night out on average. When it comes to the biggest distractions, two-thirds admit to checking social media (62%) when hanging out with others, while over a third (36%) confess to checking work emails. Three in ten (30%) also revealed they sneakily play games instead of engaging with their family and friends in the moment. But as over a third (37%) reveal that they check their phones more often than they should when socialising, the tide is beginning to turn with 32% admitting they would like to be able to switch off from their phones while on a night out. Encouragingly, one in five (22%) revealed they already turn their phone off or leave it at home ahead of social occasions and a further two in five (38%) say they’d consider doing so. Heineken® and Bodega have embarked on this partnership to show people that there is more to their social life when there is less on their phone. Nabil Nasser, the Global Head of Heineken® comments, “We could all do with a break from the constant distractions of smart tech; something our research has shown is even more important to our Gen Z and Millennial consumers. When we spoke to them about their smartphone usage, we quickly realised that many feel they are habitually distracted when socialising by their device but also admit they didn’t want to go completely phone-free. At Heineken®, we want to foster moments of genuine connection and help people experience the joy of true togetherness. In creating The Boring Phone we have gone back to basics, we have dialled down the tech to help people truly connect over a beer, without any distraction from the constant buzzing and dings.” Oliver Mak, co-founder of Bodega adds, “At Bodega, we see ourselves as a vehicle for connecting culture and young people, so when Heineken approached us to collaborate on a project designed to do exactly this, we were excited to get involved. Despite having grown up surrounded by technology, us Gen Z and Millennials are now recognising that our dependence on our phones is impacting our ability to make actual, real-life connections. This in turn impacts our ability to have fun, and on a macro level, the development of culture. “Smartphones can be too interesting, so we wanted to design a boring one. We were really inspired by the rise of Newtro and wanted to reinterpret a past cultural icon that some younger Zillennials may not have experienced before. We can’t wait to see the response to The Boring Phone as we merge our visions in a shared pursuit of creativity and community. This is truly going to help answer the call for better nights out.” Emerging Ibiza-based, British producer, TSHA, who is quickly becoming one of the most exciting young artists in the industry, will be celebrating The Boring Phone launch with a giveaway to fans, having experienced first-hand how smart tech serves as a barrier to being in the moment at music events. TSHA says, “As an artist, you want to connect with the audience to know they’re having a good time, but it’s hard to do this when you look up from the decks and see a sea of smartphones flashing in your face. I would love to see a world where we enter the venue and just live in the moment; connect with the artist, your mates and just have a good time. The Heineken x Bodega Boring Phone is the perfect antidote to the barriers smart tech pose to nights out.” Heineken® and Bodega will unveil The Boring Phone at Milan Design Week on Thursday 18th April, with a party hosted by the collaborators. Following this, devices will be given away to revellers around the world, so they can disconnect, reclaim quality time with friends, family and loved ones, and dial up their nights out. An app that will turn smartphones boring will also be launched in June to give those who don’t manage to get their hands on a physical device the Boring Phone experience.

This current drilling program is focused on resource expansion at the Basin North portion of the project. The target is a resource expansion from 1.08 to a minimum of 2.5 million tons (MT) of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE). Achievement of this would generate a US$ 3.0 million royalty payment from Lithium Royalty Company (LRC).The first four holes have been logged, sampled, and shipped to the laboratory while drilling of the fifth hole is in progress. Results on all four holes are pending. A further 3 holes are planned.Highlights:The Company has completed four widely spaced holes for a total of 4,330 feet (1,320m) from a planned program of 8,800 feet/2,680 meters (See RNS 12 March, 2024)The average Upper Clay thickness, based on visual inspection of the drill core extracted, between the four holes is 85 meters, ranging from 73m to 103m (previous average thickness, excluding Basin East, is 80m)Hole 19 has encountered the thickest-ever Upper Clay sequence at 103 meters, potentially demarking the depositional centerHoles 16 and 18 have encountered Upper Clay shallower than anticipated, yet maintain good thicknesses, hole 17 was abandoned due to poor drilling conditions at a shallow depth and has now been offset and currently being redrilled as hole number 20.The four holes (BND24-15, 16, 18, & 19) have encountered between 7 and 37 meters of Lower Clay, a strong indication of continuity from Basin East, located 2.0km to the southeastA 7th hole will be added to the south of Basin North, twinning last year's sonic hole BES23-11 (See RNS 21 August, 2023), which cut 88.70m of upper clay averaging 903ppm and 12.51m of high grade at 1,427ppm, but did not penetrate the Lower ClayThe programme is scheduled to complete in early May with an updated 43-101 Resource to follow once all assays have been received, for which Bradda Head is targeting early June.Ian Stalker, Executive Chair, commented:""Drilling the Basin North clays has been an exciting and promising program. Thus far; we're finding excellent clay thicknesses, as expected, and some clay depths have been shallower than anticipated,which is an encouraging result that supports the viability and potential of this project.""We have successfully now completed nearly half of the planned program, bringing Bradda Head increasingly closer to achieving the significant milestone of our target of resource 2.5MT, and unlocking the next royalty payment of US$3m from LRC.""We look forward to providing further updates in due course.""Figure 1.

Geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological grade (or quality) continuity. It is based on exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings, and drill holes. An Inferred Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to an Indicated Mineral Resource and must not be converted to an Ore Reserve. It is reasonably expected that the majority of Inferred Mineral Resources could be upgraded to Indicated Mineral Resources with continued exploration.Indicated Mineral ResourceThat part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade (or quality), densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with sufficient confidence to allow the application of Modifying Factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from adequately detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings, and drill holes, and is sufficient to assume geological and grade (or quality) continuity between points of observation where data and samples are gathered.SnTinTa2O5Tantalum pentoxideForward-Looking StatementsNeither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.

Negative None. 04/17/2024 - 03:30 AM VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / April 17, 2024 / Q PRECIOUS & BATTERY METALS CORP. (""Q Metals"" or the ""Company) (CSE:QMET)(OTC PINK:BKTRF)(FRA:0NB) QMET is planning for an initial 1,000 metres of diamond drilling scheduled for mid- June 2024, with VMS targets on the La Corne South project at proposed depths ranging from 50 to 300 metres below surface as modelled by the EM survey and noted in historic drilling results (see news release dated August 7, 2022).TMC Geophysique completed deep-penetrating Pulse-EM -Time Domain Electromagnetic (TDEM) surveying on the claims that targeted zones through geologic assessment and rock sampling. The TMC Geophysical report concludes that the surface TDEM data identified of a group of strong conductive anomalies in places coincident with areas of rock exposures that contained significant percentages of pyrite and pyrrhotite. The geology along the trend is interpreted to have potential for Volcanogenic Massive Sulphide (VMS) mineralization (see News Release dated 2022-08-07). The zone of interest also displays magnetic features derived from QMET 2021 drone-supported magnetometer surveys. The geophysical survey results combined with historic drilling results and more current rock sampling results provide compelling targets for further exploration.QMET exploration obtained rock samples that returned elevated values for silver, copper and zinc in an area near to the documented Boily-Bérubé mineral showing. The TDEM features are modelled as relatively shallow-seated conductive bodies. Several drill pads are planned to allow for drill testing these relatively shallow targets.In the northern portion of the QMET claims a number of historic drill holes were successful at intercepting significant sulphides with associated elevated copper, zinc, silver, and minor amounts of gold. The historic drilling carried out by Falconbridge Inc in 2005 and Sullico Mines Ltd in 1971 returned intercepts of up to 7490 ppm copper with 0.17 gpt gold and 18.2 gpt silver. Elevated zinc was also returned from the intervals of interest.Hole NumberCompanyYearUTM EUTM NAzimuthDipDepth (m)F-1-72-1SULLICO MINES LTD1971296646535562636050151.00FIE-15-04-02FALCONBRIDGE INC200429796953547525445176.00Historic Drill Resultshole idyearGM reportsampleidfrom mto mintvl mCu ppmZn ppmAu gptAg gptFIE-15-04-02200562134504268126.50127.000.5074905330.17318.2FIE-15-04-02200562134504266124.50125.501.00604031400.0267F71-119712695848970.1070.860.76200038000.00020.3F71-119712695849070.8671.780.91190020000.00020.06FIE-15-04-02200562134504265123.00124.501.5010601000.0230.8The reader is cautioned that QMET has not yet verified historic drilling resultsPhase II diamond drilling on the McKenzie East gold property located north of Val d'Or, Quebec is being planned for mid-June as well. QMET geological consultants concluded that the results from the 2020-2021 drilling program warrant continued exploration on the property. A permit has been issued to allow for the construction of 15 drill pads with supporting access.From 2020 to 2021 QMET completed an Induced Polarization (IP) electrical survey, a MMI soil sampling survey, and a drone-supported airborne magnetic survey, outlining drilling targets on the McKenzie East.The proposed 2024 drilling program will follow-up the 2021 eight-hole diamond drilling completed by QMET. Results from that drilling included 1.185 grams per tonne gold (gpt Au) over 1 metre from hole MKE-21-01. As well, several Intercepts containing > 0.5 gpt were returned from holes MKE-21-03, MKE-21-06 and MKE-21-08 (see news release dated July 13, 2021).QMET geologist note that the style of mineralization intercepted in holes MKE-21-03, 06, and 08 showed the most promise during the drilling campaign. Geologic observations of hole MKE-21-03 indicated a section of core that contained a visible gold grain of approximate 1mm by 2mm size, as well as veining, alterations and associated sulphide minerals over a wide interval. The section containing the visible gold returned a weighted average 0.61 gpt Au. However, metallic assay provided that the coarse fraction contained 8.01 grams per tonne, indicating that coarse gold was a significant part of the overall content. Drill holes MKE-21-03, MKE-21-04, and MKE-21-08 were all designed to test a geophysical anomaly of primary interest. These holes returned a total of 17 core analysis that contain over 0.1 gpt Au, and is considered a target worthy of continued exploration.The results of the early 2021 eight-hole diamond drilling program indicate that gold is present within veins and altered rock cored on the McKenzie East claims. The Phase II program will continue to test the zone cored by holes MKE-21-03, 04, and 08, as well as testing other targets delineated from ground and airborne surveys conducted on the property from 2020 to 2023.The QMET team is also preparing to return to the southern claim block of the McKenzie East property in order to follow-up potential for narrow high grade gold-bearing quartz veins aa sampled at the adjacent Maruska mineral showing (see QMET news release dated November 28, 2023). While at the Maruska, QMET Metals obtained a rock sample that included chips from a number of the exposed quartz-pyrite veins. The sampling was taken to verify the presence of gold and silver in the veins. The sample returned 3.41 grams per tonne gold and 2.58 grams per tonne silver, confirming the presence of precious metals in the Maruska vein system. QMET Metals is very interested in this high grade gold showing due to its location very near to the south block of the company's McKenzie East claims. However, the reader is warned that results obtained from adjoining properties are not direct indications for potential on the QMET Metals claims.The McKenzie East Gold property is located adjacent to the McKenzie Break Project. Monarch Mining Corporation completed a gold resource estimate for the McKenzie Break in February 2021 with open pit and underground indicated resource of 145,982 ounces and inferred resource of 250,593 ounces gold. (NI43-101 Technical Evaluation Report on the McKenzie Break Property, February 11, 2021). Readers are warned that resources estimated on an adjoining property do not imply that similar resources or mineralization exist on the Black Tusk - McKenzie East property.QMET anticipates having both permits in hand to allow for drilling on the La Corne South and McKenzie East projects, scheduled for a mid- June 2024 Drilling Program Commencement. The company has contracted First Class Drilling to undertake the diamond drilling.QMET exploration programs undertaken in Quebec are supervised by Dr. Mathieu Piché, OGQ, with office located north of Val d'Or. He is also a QMET company director.Perry Grunenberg, PGeo, a qualified person as that term is defined under National Instrument 43-101, has reviewed and approved the technical information in this news release.Cautionary StatementThis press release contains forward-looking statements based on assumptions as of that date.

Results showed near-complete suppression of clinical relapses and brain lesions in people with relapsing or primary progressive multiple sclerosis (RMS or PPMS) which reinforce the potential benefits of this investigational formulation. Treatment with OCREVUS SC led to rapid and sustained B-cell depletion in the blood. The data will be presented as an oral presentation at the 76th American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Annual Meeting taking place April 13-18 in Denver and has been recognised as an abstract of distinction by the AAN scientific committee. “With a full year of data demonstrating near-complete suppression of relapse activity and minimal progression of lesion development, this 10-minute subcutaneous OCREVUS injection shows results that are consistent with the long-established benefits of intravenous OCREVUS,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s chief medical officer and head of Global Product Development. “We look forward to continuing ongoing conversations with regulatory bodies worldwide to potentially bring an additional treatment option to more people living with MS, in a shorter injection time.” Updated, longer-term results showed that OCREVUS SC injection (920 mg; n=236; both treatment arms [OCR SC/SC and OCR IV/SC]) resulted in near-complete suppression of relapse activity (97.2% had no relapse during the treatment phase) and MRI up to 48 weeks with an ARR of 0.04, and most patients having no T1 gadolinium-enhancing (T1 Gd+) lesions and no new/enlarging T2 lesions. These lesion types are markers of active inflammation and burden of disease, respectively. Additionally, in exploratory patient reported outcome measures (n=52) patients reported a high level of satisfaction (92.3% were satisfied or very satisfied) and convenience (90.1% felt it was convenient or very convenient) with OCREVUS SC injection. “Updated results from OCARINA II further underline the potential benefits of subcutaneous OCREVUS for patients with both relapsing and progressive forms of MS,” said Scott Newsome, D.O., lead author, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. “Patients treated with subcutaneous OCREVUS experienced appropriate B-cell suppression and impressive near-complete suppression of new inflammatory disease activity. These results demonstrate the potential of subcutaneous OCREVUS as a treatment option that can be matched to the individual needs of people with MS and healthcare professionals.” Additional data continued to show that the safety profile of OCREVUS SC injection was consistent with the well-established safety profile of OCREVUS IV infusion. No new safety signals were identified for OCREVUS SC. The most common adverse events in the OCREVUS SC group were injection reactions (51.5% of all exposed patients), including erythema (34.8%; skin redness or irritation), pain (17.2%), swelling (9.4%) and pruritus (5.6%; skin itching), all of which were either mild or moderate and none of which led to treatment withdrawal. A total of seven serious AEs were experienced by three (2.6%) and four (3.4%) patients in the OCREVUS SC injection and IV infusion groups, respectively. The OCARINA II abstract was selected as an abstract of distinction by the AAN, based on the quality of the study and the interest to the neurology community. The twice-yearly, 10-minute SC injection has the potential to expand the usage of OCREVUS to treatment centres without IV infrastructure or with IV capacity limitations. Data from the Phase III OCARINA II trial were submitted to health authorities around the world following the first presentation of these results during ECTRIMS-ACTRIMS 2023. Both the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have accepted Roche’s submissions, with a target decision date of mid-2024 for the EMA and September 2024 for the FDA. More than 300,000 people with MS have been treated with OCREVUS IV globally. OCREVUS IV is approved in more than 100 countries across North America, South America, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Asia, Australia, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the EU. Roche is committed to advancing innovative clinical research programmes to broaden the scientific understanding of MS, further reducing disability progression in RMS and PPMS and improving the treatment experiences for those living with the disease. There are more than 30 ongoing OCREVUS clinical trials designed to help us better understand MS and its progression. About the subcutaneous formulation of OCREVUS (ocrelizumab)The investigational subcutaneous (SC) formulation combines OCREVUS with Halozyme Therapeutics’ Enhanze® drug delivery technology. OCREVUS is a humanised monoclonal antibody designed to target CD20-positive B cells, a specific type of immune cell thought to be a key contributor to myelin (nerve cell insulation and support) and axonal (nerve cell) damage. This nerve cell damage can lead to disability in people with MS. Based on preclinical studies, OCREVUS binds to CD20 cell surface proteins expressed on certain B cells, but not on stem cells or plasma cells, suggesting that important functions of the immune system may be preserved. The Enhanze drug delivery technology is based on a proprietary recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20), an enzyme that locally and temporarily degrades hyaluronan – a glycosaminoglycan or chain of natural sugars in the body – in the SC space. This increases the permeability of the tissue under the skin, allowing space for large molecules like OCREVUS to enter, and enables the SC formulation to be rapidly dispersed and absorbed into the bloodstream. OCREVUS IV is the first and only therapy approved for both RMS (including relapsing-remitting MS [RRMS] and active, or relapsing secondary progressive MS [SPMS], in addition to clinically isolated syndrome [CIS] in the U.S.) and PPMS. OCREVUS IV is administered by intravenous infusion every six months. The initial dose is given as two 300 mg infusions given two weeks apart. Subsequent doses are given as single 600 mg infusions. About the OCARINA II studyOCARINA II (NCT05232825) is a Phase III, global, multicentre, randomised study evaluating the pharmacokinetics, safety and radiological and clinical effects of the subcutaneous (SC) formulation of OCREVUS compared with OCREVUS intravenous (IV) infusion in 236 patients with relapsing MS (RMS) or primary progressive MS (PPMS). Initial results shared at ECTRIMS-ACTRIMS 2023 demonstrated that the trial met the primary endpoint of non-inferiority in area under the serum concentration time curve (AUC) from day 1 to 12 weeks after SC injection compared to IV infusion. Secondary endpoints include maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of OCREVUS, the total number of active, gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions at 8 and 12 weeks, and new or enlarging T2 lesions at 12 and 24 weeks, as well as safety and immunogenicity outcomes. Exploratory endpoints include patient-reported outcomes. About multiple sclerosisMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease that affects more than 2.8 million people worldwide. MS occurs when the immune system abnormally attacks the insulation and support around nerve cells (myelin sheath) in the central nervous system (brain, spinal cord and optic nerves), causing inflammation and consequent damage. This damage can cause a wide range of symptoms, including muscle weakness, fatigue and difficulty seeing, and may eventually lead to disability. Most people with MS experience their first symptom between 20 and 40 years of age, making the disease the leading cause of non-traumatic disability in younger adults. People with all forms of MS experience disease progression – permanent loss of nerve cells in the central nervous system – from the beginning of their disease even if their clinical symptoms aren’t apparent or don’t appear to be getting worse. Delays in diagnosis and treatment can negatively impact people with MS, in terms of their physical and mental health, and contribute to the negative financial impact on the individual and society. An important goal of treating MS is to slow, stop and ideally prevent disease activity and progression as early as possible. Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) is the most common form of the disease and is characterised by episodes of new or worsening signs or symptoms (relapses) followed by periods of recovery. Approximately 85% of people with MS are initially diagnosed with RRMS. The majority of people who are diagnosed with RRMS will eventually transition to secondary progressive MS (SPMS), in which they experience steadily worsening disability over time. Relapsing forms of MS (RMS) include people with RRMS and people with SPMS who continue to experience relapses. Primary progressive MS (PPMS) is a debilitating form of the disease marked by steadily worsening symptoms but typically without distinct relapses or periods of remission. Approximately 15% of people with MS are diagnosed with the primary progressive form of the disease. Until the FDA approval of OCREVUS, there had been no FDA-approved treatments for PPMS.

Positive ASML reports total net sales of €5.3 billion and net income of €1.2 billion in Q1 2024. Q2 2024 total net sales expected to be between €5.7 billion and €6.2 billion with a gross margin of 50% to 51%. ASML's 2024 outlook remains unchanged, with a stronger second half of the year anticipated. The company plans to declare a total dividend for 2023 of €6.10 per ordinary share, a 5.2% increase from 2022. Negative None. Financial Analyst ASML's reported €5.3 billion in total net sales aligning with their guidance, combined with a robust gross margin of 51.0%, is indicative of healthy revenue and cost management. The company's ability to maintain a margin above the 50% threshold demonstrates a competitive advantage in operational efficiency, especially given the capital-intensive nature of the semiconductor industry. Investors should note the decrease in sales from Q4 2023 but consider this in the context of potential seasonality and the cyclical nature of the tech sector. The net income of €1.2 billion, while substantial, does represent a decline from the previous quarter, which could be due to a myriad of factors including R&D investments or varying product mixes. The steady dividend growth, reaching €6.10 per share, reflects a confident posture in the company's financial health and future earnings potential. However, the multi-year share buyback program indicates a strategic approach to managing share value and shareholder returns. Market Research Analyst The projection for Q2 with net sales between €5.7 billion and €6.2 billion suggests optimism about demand for ASML's products, which could signal a broader recovery in semiconductor markets. The anticipated stronger second half aligns with typical industry patterns where technology investments ramp up towards the end of the year. However, investors should be attentive to the semiconductor industry's dynamics, including competition, global supply chains and geopolitical factors that may influence ASML's performance. The company's position as a leading supplier of photolithography systems puts it at the forefront of the semiconductor manufacturing process, which is important for the production of advanced chips. This position could benefit ASML if the industry experiences an upswing, as anticipated. Technology Industry Analyst ASML's continued investments in capacity ramp and technology, especially in EUV systems, are indicators of a long-term strategic approach to capitalize on the next turn of the industry cycle. Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) technology is critical for the production of smaller, more advanced chips and ASML's leadership in this area could translate into significant market advantages as demand for advanced semiconductors grows. The highlighted €656 million in EUV systems within the net bookings demonstrates the high value and demand for cutting-edge technology. As investors assess the company's prospects, the consistent R&D investment is a positive sign of ASML's commitment to maintaining its technological lead, which is essential for its growth trajectory and market dominance. 04/17/2024 - 01:00 AM ASML reports €5.3 billion total net sales and €1.2 billion net income in Q1 20242024 outlook unchanged VELDHOVEN, the Netherlands, April 17, 2024 – Today, ASML Holding NV (ASML) has published its 2024 first-quarter results.

These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”; “ambition”; ‘‘anticipate’’; ‘‘believe’’; “commit”; “commitment”; ‘‘could’’; ‘‘estimate’’; ‘‘expect’’; ‘‘goals’’; ‘‘intend’’; ‘‘may’’; “milestones”; ‘‘objectives’’; ‘‘outlook’’; ‘‘plan’’; ‘‘probably’’; ‘‘project’’; ‘‘risks’’; “schedule”; ‘‘seek’’; ‘‘should’’; ‘‘target’’; ‘‘will’’; “would” and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement, including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets, and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative, judicial, fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks, including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities, delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics, such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak, regional conflicts, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, and a significant cybersecurity breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023 (available at www.shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement, April 17, 2024. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or other information. In light of these risks, results could differ materially from those stated, implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement. Shell’s Net Carbon Intensity Also, in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” (NCI), which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell’s NCI also includes the emissions associated with the production and use of energy products produced by others which Shell purchases for resale. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the terms Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” or NCI are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries. Shell’s net-zero emissions target Shell’s operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and NCI targets over the next ten years. However, Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target, as this target is currently outside our planning period. In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target. Forward Looking non-GAAP measures This announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements. The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement. We may have used certain terms, such as resources, in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Form 20-F, File No 1-32575, available on the SEC website www.sec.gov. When is Shell plc's 2024 Annual General Meeting (AGM) scheduled? The AGM is scheduled to be held on Tuesday, May 21, 2024, at 10:00 (UK time) at the InterContinental London – The O2. Where can shareholders view and download the Notice of the AGM?

Tier 1 capital increased to $259.7 million as of March 31, 2024, which represents an increase from $238.0 million at March 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to earnings less dividends paid.

We are eager to continue our baseline data collection which started in 2022 as we advance the permitting and study phases of Corvette."" Alix Drapack, Vice President of ESG, Patriot, commented: ""The guidelines from COMEV were clear and consistent with other proposed mining projects of this scale and nature in Eeyou Istchee and were as expected. We are looking forward to continuing our discussions on the Project with the tallyman and his family and the Cree community of Chisasibi. The Company is currently evaluating the Corvette Project as a potential hard rock spodumene mining operation. The Company is well-funded and is carrying out an intensive in-fill drilling on CV-5 this winter and a regional exploration campaign on the Corvette area during the summer and fall season. An updated NI 43-101 resource estimate on the Corvette project is planned for release in CYQ3 2024. The Company commenced collection of environmental baseline data at the Project in 2022 and will continue to collect data in accordance with the newly received guidelines. The Company will provide regular updates on the progress of the work programs associated with the completion of the ESIA and submission of the ESIA is anticipated in late 2025. The Corvette Project is highlighted by the CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite which hosts a maiden mineral resource estimate of 109.2 Mt at 1.42% Li2O inferred1 and ranks as the largest lithium pegmatite resource in the Americas based on contained lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE), and one of the top 10 largest lithium pegmatite resources in the world. The CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite is located approximately 13.5 km south of the regional and all‑weather Trans-Taiga Road and powerline infrastructure, and approximately 50 km from the La-Grande 4 hydroelectric power station in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of Quebec (Figure ). 1 The CV5 mineral resource estimate (109.2 Mt at 1.42% Li2O and 160 ppm Ta2O5 inferred) is reported at a cut-off grade of 0.40% Li2O with effective date of June 25, 2023 (through drill hole CV23-190). Mineral resources are not mineral reserves as they do not have demonstrated economic viability. About the CV Lithium Trend The CV Lithium Trend is an emerging spodumene pegmatite district discovered by the Company in 2017 and is interpreted to span more than 50 kilometres across the Corvette Property. The core area includes the approximate 4.4 km long CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite, which hosts a maiden mineral resource estimate of 109.2 Mt at 1.42% Li2O inferred1. To date, eight (8) distinct clusters of lithium pegmatite have been discovered across the Corvette Property – CV4, CV5, CV8, CV9, CV10, CV12, CV13, and the recently discovered CV14. Given the proximity of some pegmatite outcrops to each other, as well as the shallow till cover in the area, it is probable that some of the outcrops may reflect a discontinuous surface exposure of a single, larger pegmatite ""outcrop"" subsurface.

About Acrivon Therapeutics Acrivon is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing precision oncology medicines that it matches to patients whose tumors are predicted to be sensitive to each specific medicine by utilizing Acrivon’s proprietary proteomics-based patient responder identification platform, Acrivon Predictive Precision Proteomics, or AP3. The AP3 platform is engineered to measure compound-specific effects on the entire tumor cell protein signaling network and drug-induced resistance mechanisms in an unbiased manner. These distinctive capabilities enable AP3’s direct application for drug design optimization for monotherapy activity, the identification of rational drug combinations, and the creation of drug-specific proprietary OncoSignature companion diagnostics that are used to identify the patients most likely to benefit from Acrivon’s drug candidates. Acrivon is currently advancing its lead candidate, ACR-368, a selective small molecule inhibitor targeting CHK1 and CHK2 in a potentially registrational Phase 2 trial across multiple tumor types. The company has received Fast Track designation from the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the investigation of ACR-368 as monotherapy based on OncoSignature-predicted sensitivity in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian or endometrial cancer. Acrivon’s ACR-368 OncoSignature test, which has not yet obtained regulatory approval, has been extensively evaluated in preclinical studies, including in two separate, blinded, prospectively-designed studies on pretreatment tumor biopsies collected from past third-party Phase 2 trials in patients with ovarian cancer treated with ACR-368. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Device designation for the ACR-368 OncoSignature assay for the identification of ovarian cancer patients who may benefit from ACR-368 treatment. In addition to ACR-368, Acrivon is also leveraging its proprietary AP3 precision medicine platform for developing its co-crystallography-driven, internally-discovered preclinical stage pipeline programs. These include ACR-2316, a potent, selective WEE1/PKMYT1 inhibitor designed for superior single-agent activity as demonstrated in preclinical studies against benchmark inhibitors, and a cell cycle program with an undisclosed target.

Negative None. 04/16/2024 - 09:00 PM Combined market tops US $5B, breaks string of 5 straight down quarters Managed services spending up 18% vs. prior year, XaaS up 27% SYDNEY--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Asia Pacific’s IT and business services market delivered a resurgent performance in the first quarter, with spending at a level last seen almost two years ago, according to the latest state-of-the-industry report from Information Services Group (ISG) (Nasdaq: III), a leading global technology research and advisory firm. The Asia Pacific ISG Index™, which measures commercial outsourcing contracts with annual contract value (ACV) of US $5 million or more, shows ACV for the combined market—both managed services and as-a-service (XaaS)—climbed 25 percent versus the prior year, to just over US $5 billion, the first time the region topped the US $5-billion level since the second quarter of 2022. It also broke a string of five straight quarters the region produced negative year-over-year results. Managed services ACV rose 18 percent, to just over US $1 billion, versus the prior year, and was up 21 percent sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2023. Business process outsourcing (BPO) drove all the growth in the first quarter, up 72 percent to US $399 million. IT outsourcing (ITO), meanwhile, declined 1 percent, to US $643 million. A total of 66 managed services contracts were awarded in the first quarter, up 12 percent year on year. The volume of smaller deals, those under US $30 million, rose 2 percent. New-scope awards accounted for more than 80 percent of the region’s managed services ACV, while the ACV of contract restructurings fell more than 60 percent. ACV in the XaaS segment advanced 27 percent, to US $4.0 billion, led by growth in infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), up 30 percent, to US $3.6 billion. Software-as-a-service (SaaS) was up 4 percent, to US $427 million. Results by Industry, Geography Among industries, the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) sector led the way, generating ACV of US $434 million, more than double that of the prior year, and accounting for 137 percent of the region’s managed services growth in the quarter. Manufacturing and telecommunications spending was down significantly, while other industries generated gains, albeit off small bases. By geography, all markets in the region were positive, except for its largest market, Australia-New Zealand, which declined 15 percent year on year. India, Japan, Southeast Asia and China were all up by double digits. “As we noted last quarter, Asia Pacific has bottomed out and is poised for a rebound in 2024,” said Michael Gale, partner and regional leader, ISG Asia Pacific. “The region is off to a strong start, with double-digit managed services growth led by the BFSI sector and BPO overall. ACV for cloud-based services surpassed the US $4 billion level for the first time since the second quarter of 2022 and produced its second straight quarter of double-digit growth. Early indications are that Asia Pacific is leading the way in a global rebound of IT and business services spending among the three regions.” 2024 Global Forecast ISG is forecasting 3 percent growth for managed services, down 125 basis points from its January forecast, and maintaining its forecast of 15 percent revenue growth for XaaS in 2024. “Looking ahead, economic conditions are forecasted to be less volatile as the year progresses and inflation continues to slow, but challenges persist,” Gale said. “In this environment, outsourcing could see a boost as companies seek to balance cost management and service quality. GenAI, meanwhile, is poised to be a growth catalyst, with large hyperscalers expected to manage increasing workloads. The data layer, integral for training AI models, presents a prime opportunity for service providers.” About the ISG Index™ The ISG Index™ is recognized as the authoritative source for marketplace intelligence on the global technology and business services industry.

The Nomination Committee proposes that Maxime Lombardini and Justine Dimovic be elected as new Directors of Millicom for the term beginning at the AGM and ending at the 2025 AGM.

The Nomination Committee, supported by the Board, proposes that Mauricio Ramos be elected as Chair of the Board for a term beginning at the AGM and ending at the 2025 AGM. The Nomination Committee's motivated statement regarding the Board’s composition is available on Millicom's website. AGM – item 17: DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY AND FEES Directors’ Remuneration Policy In proposing remuneration for the Directors, the Nomination Committee considers many factors, including the size and complexity of the business, the number of board and committee meetings, the amount of responsibility related to each role, regulatory requirements, as well as market practice. The Nomination Committee may also appoint an external compensation consultant to provide advice and benchmarking. The Chair of the Board of Millicom does not participate in discussions or decision-making regarding Director remuneration. Remuneration to Directors comprises cash-based and share-based components, weighted toward shares to align with the compensation philosophy and guidelines of the Company set out in item 22. Directors appointed to Board Committees receive cash-based compensation for each appointment. Share-based compensation is in the form of fully paid-up shares of Millicom common stock. There are no retention, vesting or other holding conditions attached to the shares. Such shares are provided from the Company’s treasury shares or alternatively issued within Millicom’s authorized share capital exclusively in exchange for allocation from the premium reserve (i.e., for nil consideration from the relevant Directors). Share-based compensation is calculated by dividing the approved remuneration by the average Millicom closing share price on the Nasdaq Stock Market in the US for the three-month period ending on April 30, 2024, provided that shares shall not be issued below par value. Notwithstanding the above, for any period where a Director is also an employee of Millicom, no remuneration is paid to that Director beyond any compensation received as an employee of Millicom. Directors’ Remuneration The Nomination Committee proposes the compensation for the period from the date of the AGM to the date of the 2025 AGM, as follows: Cash2024/2025(USD)Shares2024/2025(USD)Chair of the Board (1)*105,000210,000Board members (8)*55,000105,000Audit and Compliance Committee chair (1)*45,000- Audit and Compliance Committee members (3)*22,500- Compensation and Talent Committee chair (1)*25,000- Compensation and Talent Committee members (2)*12,500- Total 707,5001,050,000 * Not payable while the Chair or a Board member receives compensation as an employee of Millicom.

AGM – item 18: ELECTION OF THE AUDITOR AND FEES The Nomination Committee, in accordance with the recommendation of Millicom’s Audit and Compliance Committee, proposes that KPMG be elected as external auditor for a term beginning at the AGM and ending at the 2025 AGM. The proposal from the Nomination Committee, and recommendation from the Audit and Compliance Committee, is based on a tender and evaluation of external audit firms conducted in Q1 2024, taking into consideration independence requirements and fees, among other factors. The Nomination Committee proposes that the auditor’s remuneration be paid against an approved account. AGM – item 19: INSTRUCTION TO THE NOMINATION COMMITTEE The Nomination Committee proposes that the following Instruction to the Nomination Committee shall apply until new instructions have been adopted. In the event any applicable law or stock market regulation requires a change to this procedure, the Nomination Committee shall take any steps necessary or proper to ensure compliance with such rules. The work of preparing the following agenda items for the annual general meeting shall be performed by a Nomination Committee: To propose the chair of the annual general meeting;To set the number of Directors of the Board; To propose candidates to be elected or re-elected as Directors and the term of their appointment; To propose the remuneration of the Directors;To propose the election or re-election of the external auditor and its remuneration; andTo propose a new / amended instruction to the Nomination Committee, if deemed appropriate. The Nomination Committee shall be formed in consultation with the largest shareholders as of the last business day of June 2024. The Nomination Committee shall consist of four members (except that the Nomination Committee may consist of less than four members to the extent that the ten largest shareholders have been given the opportunity to appoint a member and more than six of those largest shareholders have declined) and comprise: (i) the Chair of the Board (Executive Chair, if so appointed), and (ii) three members appointed by shareholders, each appointed by one of the 10 largest shareholders which has chosen to appoint a member, starting with the largest shareholder and then in descending order until all three members (or less, if applicable) have been nominated. The majority of the members of the Nomination Committee are to be independent of the Company and its executive management. At least one member of the Nomination Committee must be independent of the Company’s largest shareholder in terms of votes or any group of shareholders who act in concert in governance of the Company. The Chair of the Board shall act as the Nomination Committee’s convener, and the members of the Nomination Committee will appoint the Nomination Committee’s chair at their first meeting, provided that the Chair of the Board may not serve as the chair of the Nomination Committee. Before the assignment is accepted, a proposed member of the Nomination Committee shall carefully consider any conflict of interest or other circumstances that makes membership of the Nomination Committee inappropriate. The Chief Executive Officer or other members of the executive management may be invited by the chair of the Nomination Committee to participate in meetings of the Nomination Committee as considered appropriate. The Nomination Committee is appointed for a term of office commencing at the time of its formation, which must be no later than six months before the annual general meeting and ending when a new Nomination Committee is formed. If a member resigns during the Nomination Committee’s term of office, and provided that the Nomination Committee finds this prudent, the shareholder that appointed the resigning member may be asked to appoint a new member, provided that the shareholder is still one of the 10 largest shareholders of Millicom. If that shareholder declines to appoint a new member, the Nomination Committee may choose to ask the next largest qualified shareholder to appoint a Nomination Committee member and so on. In the event of changes to the ownership structure of the Company, whereby a shareholder that has appointed a member to the Nomination Committee significantly reduces its shareholding, such member shall immediately resign from the Nomination Committee, unless the other members unanimously decide that such person shall remain until the end of their term. In addition, the Nomination Committee may decide to change its composition and invite the new larger shareholder(s) to appoint a member of the Nomination Committee. In its decision, the Nomination Committee shall inter alia take into account the status of its work, the time remaining to the annual general meeting and the nature of the change in ownership. If more than three months remain until the annual general meeting, however, a shareholder that has become amongst the three largest shareholders shall always, at its request, have the right to appoint a member of the Nomination Committee.

Repurchase transactions under the Share Repurchase Plan may be made at acquisition prices per Share as follows: For Shares repurchased on a regulated market where the shares are traded, the price per Share shall be within the registered interval for the share price prevailing at any time (the so-called spread), that is, the interval between the highest buying rate and the lowest selling rate of the Shares on the market on which the purchases are made.For any other Shares repurchased, the price per share may not exceed 110% of the most recent closing trading price of the Shares on the Nasdaq Stock Market in the U.S., provided that the minimum repurchase price is above SEK 50 (or USD equivalent). The Share Repurchase Plan may not have the effect of reducing Millicom's net assets and reserves under the limit required by the Luxembourg Commercial Companies Law or the Articles of Association of the Company.Only fully paid-up Shares may be included in repurchase transactions made under the Share Repurchase Plan. The primary purposes of this resolution are to provide the Board with more options in its efforts to deliver long-term shareholder value and total shareholder return, and to provide a method to secure availability of Shares for Board remuneration and Millicom’s share-based incentive plans. The Board is hereby authorized to: transfer all or part of the Shares repurchased under the Share Repurchase Plan to employees of the Millicom Group in connection with any existing or future Millicom share-based incentive plans, use the purchased Shares to meet obligations arising from debt financial instruments exchangeable into equity instruments, use the repurchased Shares as consideration for merger and acquisition purposes, including joint ventures and the buy-out of minority interests in Millicom’s subsidiaries or joint ventures, as the case may be, in accordance with the limits set out in the Luxembourg Commercial Companies Law,cancel the repurchased Shares and Shares held in treasury from Shares repurchased under previous Share repurchase plans, and any other purpose not expressly prohibited by applicable law. All powers are hereby granted to the Board, with the power to delegate and substitute, to ensure the implementation of this authorization, conclude all agreements, carry out all formalities and make all declarations with regard to all authorities and, generally, do all that is necessary or proper for the execution of any decisions made in connection with this authorization. The Share Repurchase Plan supersedes and replaces all other previous share repurchase plans of Millicom, which are deemed cancelled. AGM – item 21: 2023 REMUNERATION REPORT The Board proposes that the AGM provides an advisory vote on Millicom’s remuneration report for the financial year ended on December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Remuneration Report”), pursuant to Article 7ter. of the Luxembourg law of 24 May 2011 on the exercise of certain rights of shareholders at general meetings of listed companies, as amended. The Nomination Committee will consider this advisory vote when reviewing the Director Remuneration Policy, and the Board will consider this advisory vote when reviewing the Senior Management Remuneration Policy in the future and explain in the 2024 remuneration report how this advisory vote was taken into account. The 2023 Remuneration Report is available on Millicom’s website: https://www.millicom.com/our-company/governance/shareholder-meetings/. AGM – item 22: SENIOR MANAGEMENT REMUNERATION POLICY The Board proposes that the AGM resolves on the following guidelines and policy for remuneration and other employment terms for the senior management for the period up to the 2025 AGM. Compensation philosophy and guidelines: Competitive and fair – Levels of pay and benefits to attract and retain the right people.Drive the right behaviors – Reward policy and practices that drive behaviors supporting our Company strategy and business objectives. Shareholder alignment – Variable compensation plans that support a culture of entrepreneurship and performance and incorporate both short-term and longer-term financial and operational metrics strongly correlated to the creation of shareholder wealth. Long-term incentives are designed to maintain sustained commitment and ensure that the interests of our Global Senior Management Team are aligned with those of our shareholders.Pay for performance – Total reward structured around pay in line with performance, providing the opportunity to reward strong corporate and individual performance. A significant proportion of top management's compensation is variable (at risk) and based on measures of personal, company and share price performance directly attributable to short-term and long-term value creation. Transparency – Millicom is committed to expanding transparency, including disclosure around pay for performance, links to value creation, etc. Market competitive and representative remuneration – Compensation is designed to be market competitive and representative of the seniority and importance of roles, responsibilities and geographical locations of individuals. Retention of key talent – Variable compensation plans include a significant portion of deferred share-based or cash compensation, the payout of which is conditional on future employment with the Company for three-year rolling periods, starting on the grant date.Executive management to be ‘invested’ – The Executive Team and Corporate Vice-Presidents, through Millicom’s share ownership guidelines, are required to reach and maintain a significant level of personal ownership of Millicom shares. Objectives of senior management compensation: Fixed salary and benefits: to ensure that Millicom can attract, motivate and retain senior management, within the context of Millicom’s international talent pool, which consists of Telecommunications, Media & Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (“FMCG”) companies. Short Term Incentives (“STI”): to incentivize senior management to execute strategic plans in operational decision making to achieve short-term performance goals impacting performance and enhancing the value of the Company. In general, 75% of the STI is based on achievement of financial targets of the individual’s corresponding business unit, while the remaining 25% is based on individual performance.Long Term Incentives (“LTI”): to align senior management long-term incentives with the long-term interests of shareholders, encouraging long-term value creation, retention and management focus on long-term value and commitment to the Company. Based on these key principles, the LTI design for 2024 is a balance of share price appreciation, retention and ESG targets approved by the Compensation & Talent Committee and the Board. Millicom emphasizes the “one team” mentality – by maintaining unified goals and objectives in the long-term incentive program for the executive leadership team with the purpose of long-term value of the Company. Benchmarking of Executive Management Compensation: For the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Executive Vice Presidents (“EVPs”), compensation has been benchmarked against a peer group, which includes: Lumen Technologies, Inc., DISH Network Corporation, American Tower Corporation, Altice USA, Inc., Sirius XM Holdings Inc., Global Payments Inc., Liberty Latin America Ltd., Frontier Communications Parent, Inc., Telephone and Data Systems, Inc., United States Cellular Corporation, AMC Networks Inc., SBA Communications Corporation and Cable One, Inc. Senior Management Remuneration Policy (i) Base salary and benefits Base annual salaries shall be competitive and based on individual responsibilities and performance. The base salary and other benefits of the CEO are proposed by the Compensation and Talent Committee and approved by the Board, and the base salary and benefits of the EVPs are proposed by the CEO and approved by the Compensation and Talent Committee. (ii) Variable remuneration Senior management may receive variable remuneration in addition to base salary. The variable remuneration consists of (a) Short-term Incentives (“STI”), and (b) Long-term Incentives (“LTI”). The amounts and percentages for variable remuneration are based on pre-established goals and targets related to the performance of both Millicom and individual employees, as summarized below and presented in detail in item 23. Short-term Incentives The STI consists of two components: a cash bonus and a restricted share units-based component (the Deferred Share Plan, or “DSP”). For the 2025 DSP grant, Corporate Directors, General Managers and senior in-country leadership teams are eligible for a Deferred Cash Plan (the “DCP”) instead of the DSP. STI measures, and relative weightings (shown below) are designed to reflect Millicom’s strategic goals of encouraging profitable operations, efficient use of capital, overall growth and customer focus: Service Revenue (25%), Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) (25%), Equity Free Cash Flow (“EFCF”) (25%), Personal Performance* (25%). * Personal Performance is assessed on achievement of personalized qualitative and quantitative goals aligned to the overall strategy and objectives of the Company. The DSP seeks to attract and retain management employees, by rewarding for past performance and incentivizing longer-term service. It is part of Millicom’s short-term incentive program and as such the Board deems that pro rata vesting (30%/30%/40%) over a three-year period is reasonable in order to achieve the objectives of Millicom’s overall compensation and reward strategy. Modifications compared to the 2023 STI-DSP (i) 2024 STI paid in 2025 The Compensation and Talent Committee implemented a redistribution of weights for both the 2025 DSP and 2025 DCP, reducing the personal performance from 30% to 25% and assigning equal weights to the three financial metrics totaling 75%. Additionally, the Committee also introduced EFCF as a new metric, in replacement of OFCFaL and Relational Net Promoter Score, to align with the principal financial target disclosed by the Company. (ii) 2025 DSP (based on 2024 performance) Eligibility for participation in the DSP component is limited to Millicom’s CEO, EVPs and Corporate Vice Presidents (“VPs”). Currently, 16 individuals are included in this group. The metrics are the same as the 2024 STI metrics. (iii) 2025 DCP (based on 2024 performance) Corporate Directors and senior in-country leadership (excluding General Managers) are eligible for a Deferred Cash Plan instead of the DSP, with the same targets as the DSP and 2024 STI metrics. Currently, 111 individuals are included in this group. For the General Managers, the DSP is also replaced with a Deferred Cash Plan (DCP), with individual country targets: Service Revenue (50%), andEFCF (50%). Long-term Incentive Plan (“LTI”) The LTI is a share-based plan whereby the awards granted vest at the end of a three-year period, subject to achievement against performance measures and fulfillment of conditions. These measures, and their relative weightings, are shown below: Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs) (60%), Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) (30%), andPerformance Shares with ESG target achievement (10%) Modifications compared to the 2023 LTI For 2024, we have moved towards an incentive plan focused on shareholder value creation, long-term incentive and retention using three equity vehicles: Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs), Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), and Performance Shares based on achievement of ESG metrics. For the ESG metric, the Compensation and Talent Committee has proposed to reduce from 5 metrics to 1, focusing on carbon emissions. Eligibility Eligibility for participation in the LTI is limited to Millicom’s CEO, EVPs and VPs. Currently, 16 individuals are included in this group. For General Managers, the LTI is merged into the DCP plan described above, including the same metrics. 2024 LTI (based on 2024-2026 performance) Information on the 2024 LTI, including performance measures and payout scales (based on performance from 2024 to 2026), and the number of share awards to be granted, is included in agenda item 23 below. (iii) Other benefits Other benefits can include, for example, car allowance, medical coverage and, in limited cases, while on an expat assignment, housing allowance, school fees, and home leave. (iv) Pension The Global Senior Management Team, which is comprised of Millicom’s CEO, EVPs, VPs and General Managers are eligible to participate in a global retirement saving plan which also covers death and disability insurance. This global plan is secured through premiums paid to insurance companies. Company contributions to the global defined contribution retirement saving plan range between 10% and 15% of the executive’s base pay. Notice of termination and severance pay If the employment of Millicom’s most senior management is terminated, a notice period of up to 12 months could potentially apply. Other Policies and Practices The Board regularly reviews best practices in executive compensation and governance and revises policies and practices when appropriate. Deviations from the policy and guidelines In special circumstances, the Board may deviate from the above policy and guidelines, including additional variable remuneration in the case of exceptional performance. Where such deviation relates to the CEO’s remuneration, the Board may temporarily deviate from the above policy and guidelines until the 2025 AGM to ensure the long-term interest and continuity of Millicom or guarantee its viability. Independent Advisor The Board has retained Mercer as its independent compensation consultant. Mercer provides advice, executive benchmarking data and best practices and makes suggestions based on its knowledge of the market. – item 23: SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE PLANS outlined in the proposed guidelines and policy for senior management remuneration in agenda item 22 above (and the corresponding guidelines approved at the 2023 AGM), variable compensation includes the following share-based incentive plans: a short-term Deferred Share Plan (DSP), and a three-year Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTI). is no legal requirement for Millicom (as a Luxembourg company) to obtain shareholder approval of share-based incentive plans. Nonetheless, following past practice and in alignment with the expectations of Millicom’s shareholders, the Board proposes that the meeting resolves to approve the 2024 DSP, the 2024 LTI and the granting of share awards under both plans, as further described below. of the Plans Compensation and Talent Committee of the Board monitors and evaluates programs for variable remuneration (both ongoing programs and those that have ended during the year), the manner in which the guidelines for remuneration to senior management adopted at the AGM have been applied, and the current remuneration structure and levels of remuneration in Millicom. The design of each share-based plan is reviewed each year to ensure that: The programs are well aligned with the interests of shareholders;The programs are designed to help attract, motivate and retain the competencies needed in Millicom’s senior management; andThe programs have a positive effect on Millicom’s development and thus are beneficial for both Millicom and its shareholders. Compensation and Talent Committee determines when an offer for the grant of share awards shall be made, the eligible employees to whom such offer shall be made and the terms governing the offer for the grant of share awards, in accordance with the principles adopted by the AGM. The Compensation and Talent Committee shall also have the right to resolve on more detailed terms and conditions in accordance with the Senior Management Remuneration Policy.Compensation and Talent Committee approves the detailed terms and conditions of the share-based compensation plans, in accordance with the terms and guidelines set out herein. In connection therewith, the Compensation and Talent Committee is entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions, and, in connection with delivery of shares to participants, offer share settlement in order to cover the participant’s tax costs upon vesting.Compensation and Talent Committee may make certain other adjustments, including deciding to reduce the delivery of shares for all participants, or for certain categories of participants covered by the 2024 LTI and 2024 DSP, if material changes occur within Millicom or in the market that, in the Board's assessment, mean that the terms and conditions for the allotment of shares under the plans no longer fulfil the main objectives of the plans. of the Proposal's Compensation and Talent Committee has prepared the 2024 DSP and the 2024 LTI in consultation with external advisors. The plans have been reviewed at meetings of the Compensation and Talent Committee in 2023 and in the first months of 2024. Proposed 2024 DSP (based on 2023 performance) The proposed 2024 DSP is based on a target percentage of the annual base salary of each participant and the performance related to the 2023 financial year. Each share unit granted carries a non-transferable right to receive one share in Millicom on the relevant vesting date. Eligibility for participation in the 2024 DSP is described in item 22. Calculation STI compensation is calculated as Base Salary X a pre-determined % of base salary X plan performance. Performance measures (based on 2023 performance) and payout scale Performance is measured on the extent to which performance targets (group, regional, or country level as applicable to each individual) are achieved, as follows: Performance measure% of the DSPService revenue (SR)20%EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization)20%OFCFaL (Operating Free Cash Flow after Leases)20%rNPS (relational net promoter score)10%Personal performance30% Payout is based on a linear scale with minimum, target and maximum achievement of performance measures (except personal performance) as follows: AchievementPayoutAchievement less than 95% of target0%Achievement at 100% of target100%Achievement at or above 104% (SR), 106% (EBITDA), 107% (OFCFaL) and/or 110% (tNPS) of target 200% Personal performance is based on the rating scale below, whereby employees rated “does not meet” do not receive any STI compensation, and employees rated ‘partially meets’ are not eligible to participate in the 2024 DSP. Performance ratingDoes not meetPartially meetsMeetsExceedsExceptionally ExceedsPayout0%15% on cash component.0% on share component.30%45%60% Payment / vesting If the AGM approves the 2024 DSP, and thereby the granting of share awards to the DSP Participants, the STI is paid in cash and in DSP shares: for senior leaders 30% / 70% at the top and 40% / 60% at the lower end. For employees not participating in the DSP, or to the extent that the DSP is not approved by the AGM, the STI (including the portion that would have been provided as shares) will be a cash bonus. The share awards will vest (generally subject to the participant still being employed by Millicom) 30% in Q1 2025, 30% in Q1 2026 and 40% in Q1 2027. Grant of share awards 1,141,873 share units were granted, conditional on AGM approval as per the above, under the DSP plan in Q1 2024, representing approximately 0.67% of the outstanding shares and outstanding votes. (ii) Proposed 2024 LTI The proposed 2024 LTI award is divided in three equity vehicles: Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs), Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), and Performance Shares based on achievement of the ESG performance measure between 2024 and 2026. Eligibility for participation in the 2024 LTI is described in item 22. Calculation The award value per participant is based on seniority and ranges from 35% to 315% at target (for the CEO) of base annual salary (as of January 1, 2024) as follows: Seniority% of base annual salary (range)VPs35%-70%CEO and EVPs85%-315% This award will be divided into: 1. Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs) - (60% of the award), calculated based on Black-Scholes valuation of the stock price at fair market value of the grant. 2. Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) – (30% of the award). 3. Performance Shares with ESG metric – (10% of the award). Stock Appreciation Rights will vest in number of units as defined by the Black-Scholes valuation. The participant will have the eligibility to exercise these units during the seven-year period following the vesting date. Upon exercising these units, the appreciation will be paid in Millicom stock. Each Restricted Stock Unit and Performance Share unit will vest as one Millicom share, subject to the achievement of the following performance measures for the performance shares: Performance measure% of the LTIESG metric – 2024-2026 measurement based on Carbon Emissions reduction target.10% Payout for the Performance conditions for ESG target: In the event the Company achieves less than 80% of the target, the corresponding portion of the grant will be reduced to zero. In the event the Company achieves between 80% and 100% of the target, the corresponding portion of the grant will be adjusted in linear pro rata of the achievement starting at a payout of 0% to 100%. Payout is capped at 100% achievement. In addition, participants who receive a ‘does not meet’ performance rating are not eligible to participate in the LTI in the following year. Payment / vesting The equity awards vest after a three-year vesting period, in Q1 2027, subject to achievement of performance measures and the participant being employed by Millicom at the time of vesting. Grant of share awards At target 193,537 share units are granted under the 2024 LTI plan corresponding to RSUs and Performance Shares, representing approximately 0.11% of the outstanding shares and votes. The amount of SARs to be granted are subject to the share price valuation following approval of the LTI by the Compensation and Talent Committee, i.e., April 4, 2024. Share ownership requirements Participants in the LTI are subject to Millicom’s Share Ownership Policy, which requires them to maintain the minimum levels of share ownership based on the size of their annual share grants, or hold all shares vested (post tax) under either the LTI or the DSP until reaching those minimum levels. These levels currently range from 400% of base salary to 50% of base salary. Accounting, cost and maximum number of shares Both the DSP and LTI are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2, which requires the cost of share awards to be recorded as employee costs in the income statement over the vesting period, based on the number of shares expected to vest and the fair value of those shares. Elements specific to each plan are as follows: (i) 2024 DSP No expense is recognized for DSP share awards that do not ultimately vest. Vesting of the shares is not dependent on market conditions. The number of shares that may vest, approximate cost and percentage of outstanding shares (based on grant share price of USD 16.33) are as follows: Shares that may vestApproximate cumulative three-year cost (USD)% of outstanding sharesAt Maximum1,141,87318.65 million0.67% The costs and dilution are expected to have only a marginal effect on key ratios of Millicom. Information on performance of the 2023 STI and on the 2024 DSP grant will be presented in Millicom’s 2024 Annual Report. (ii) 2024 LTI No expense is recognized for share awards that do not ultimately vest, except for the Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs) portion of the LTI where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vested regardless of whether or not the market conditions are satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied. For Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) vesting of the shares is dependent on service conditions only. An estimate of the number of shares that may vest and approximate cost for the RSUs and the performance shares are as follows: Shares that may vestApproximate cumulative three-year cost (USD)% of outstanding sharesAt Maximum193,5373.93 million0.11% Information about the performance results and the outcome of the 2024 LTI will be presented in Millicom’s 2026 Annual Report. Hedging arrangements and delivery of shares The undertaking to deliver shares to the participants in the 2024 DSP and 2024 LTI will be fulfilled either by Millicom transferring its own treasury shares or, if required, by acquiring and transferring shares or issuing new shares. Delivery of shares, subject to the terms of conditions of the plans, will be made free of charge.

Negative None. 04/16/2024 - 06:30 PM VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / April 16, 2024 / Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd. (TSX:NDM);(NYSE American:NAK) (""Northern Dynasty"" or the ""Company"") and 100%-owned U.S.- based subsidiary Pebble Limited Partnership (""Pebble Partnership"" or ""PLP"") have been advised by the US Army Corps of Engineers (""USACE"") that, after months of successive delays, the USACE has declined to engage in the remand process related to the November 25, 2020 denial of a permit application for the Pebble Project, citing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (""EPA"") intervening veto of the development at Pebble.After the November 25, 2020, denial of the permit application for the Pebble Project, a separate division of the USACE remanded the denial decision back to the USACE Alaska District on April 25, 2023, after an administrative review found numerous errors with the denial decision. Today, after several requests for extensions, the USACE has announced that it has declined to engage in the remand process altogether. The USACE reasoning is due to the EPA veto, which effectively prevents them from altering their decision while that veto is in place. On March 15, 2024, we announced we were filing an appeal of the EPA veto in Federal District Court in Alaska, and the State of Alaska filed its action against the veto on April 11, 2024.We are reviewing the decision of the USACE not to engage in the remand process and are evaluating appropriate next steps regarding today's announcement. It is worth noting that the USACE decision is without prejudice and not based on the merits of the many technical issues raised in our appeal.Ron Thiessen, CEO of the Northern Dynasty, stated ""This decision by the USACE exposes the fatal vulnerability of EPA's veto of the Pebble project. The EPA veto rests extensively on findings made in the USACE permit denial, which is itself flawed as pointed out in the Remand Order. The USACE itself, during its own administrative review process, avoided affirming its permit denial, ordering instead a remand to address some of the erroneous findings which are then relied upon by the EPA in its veto. This is because a number of these critical findings were contradicted by the administrative record.""Mr. Thiessen continued, ""This leaves them with an unsupportable federal bureaucratic position: The EPA veto rests upon USACE findings in its permit denial which were rebuked by its own internal administrative review; and now USACE refuses to address the critical flaws its own permit denial decision as ordered by its own administrative review because EPA has vetoed the project. We are confident the courts in our existing case against EPA will see through this illogical and contorted rationale and overturn the EPA veto, concluding that the EPA veto rests upon critical conclusions in the USACE permit denial which the USACE has now refused to address on remand. Our litigation against the EPA veto was made much stronger today by the USACE decision not to engage in the remand process as it was ordered to do so by its own administrative review.""Mr. Thiessen concluded, ""So the path forward is unchanged. Our primary focus remains on removing the EPA veto, either through federal government action or through our existing legal proceedings in conjunction with the State of Alaska. Once the veto is cleared, it opens the way for us to re-engage with the USACE.""About Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd.Northern Dynasty is a mineral exploration and development company based in Vancouver, Canada.

Successful completion of IPO strengthens SolarMax's foundation for future growth. Negative None. Financial Analyst A thorough analysis of SolarMax Technology, Inc.'s fiscal year 2023 financial results reveals a company on the upswing. The revenue surge to $54.1 million represents a healthy 21% increase year-over-year, signaling strong market demand and perhaps effective sales strategy. More impressive, however, is the gross profit jump of 49%, which outpaced revenue growth. This indicates a significant improvement in cost management or product mix, leading to a higher margin on sales. The improved gross margin to 21% from 17% in the previous year is noteworthy; efficiency measures or economies of scale may be contributing factors here. A substantial decrease in total operating expenses by 31% could reflect a streamlining of operations or cost-cutting initiatives that enhance profitability. A turnaround from a net loss of $6.9 million to a net income of $0.4 million is certainly a positive signal to investors. However, one should also consider the sustainability of these gains, taking into account the broader economic climate, competition and operational risks. Energy Sector Analyst SolarMax's financial growth dovetails with a broader industry trend towards renewable energy solutions, especially solar. The 21% revenue increase can be partially attributed to the growing consumer and corporate consciousness about sustainable energy practices. An improved gross margin implies that SolarMax is becoming more adept at navigating the volatile costs associated with solar technology manufacturing and installation. Investors should recognize that the renewable energy sector can be significantly influenced by government policies and incentives, which could either bolster or beleaguer SolarMax's future performance. The CEO's comments about strategic pricing and operational efficiency suggest that the company has been proactive in adapting to these external pressures. The mention of a successful IPO could also mean enhanced capital for research, development and expansion, potentially increasing SolarMax's competitive edge within the sector. 04/16/2024 - 07:35 PM RIVERSIDE, CA / ACCESSWIRE / April 16, 2024 / SolarMax Technology, Inc.

Buenaventura Announces First Quarter 2024 Results for Production and Volume Sold per Metal,2024-04-16T22:23:00.000Z,Low,Positive,"Buenaventura, Peru's largest publicly-traded precious metals mining company, announced its 1Q24 results for production and volume sold. The company provided detailed figures for gold, silver, lead, zinc, and copper production across its various operations.","Buenaventura Announces First Quarter 2024 Results for Production and Volume Sold per Metal Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Buenaventura, Peru's largest publicly-traded precious metals mining company, announced its 1Q24 results for production and volume sold. The company provided detailed figures for gold, silver, lead, zinc, and copper production across its various operations. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Reviewing Buenaventura's production figures for the first quarter of 2024, we see a snapshot of the company's operational efficiency and resource management. The total direct operations in gold production, for instance, came in at 36,495 ounces, which we must benchmark against the full-year guidance of 122.8k to 137.2k ounces. This represents approximately 29% of the lower end of the guidance, indicating a strong start to the year. Similarly, the silver production performance shows a total of 3,070,773 ounces, positioning the company to potentially meet or exceed the annual forecast.When it comes to base metals like lead and zinc, the production figures are also telling. For lead, production is in line to meet the annual guidance, assuming a steady production throughout the rest of the year. However, for zinc, with 8,814 metric tons produced out of a guidance of 24.1k to 26.9k metric tons, there might be concerns about meeting annual targets unless production ramps up in subsequent quarters. Copper, a key industrial metal, shows a strong production output, which could be an indicator of robust demand and favorable market conditions.Investors should consider these production numbers in light of global commodity prices, geopolitical factors and mining sector trends, as they will influence revenues and, by extension, the stock performance of Buenaventura. Any significant variance from projected volumes, especially in gold and silver, which are key drivers of Buenaventura's revenue, should be a focal point for shareholders' assessments of the company's performance. Mining Sector Analyst Delving into Buenaventura's operational performance provides insight into the company's strategic positioning within the mining sector. The production numbers reflect not only the output efficiency but also the resource quality and mine life expectancy. It's important to note that, for the precious metals industry, maintaining consistent production levels is critical due to the high fixed costs associated with mining operations.Furthermore, investors should be aware of the sustainability and environmental challenges that the mining industry faces. These challenges can impact operational costs and regulatory compliance. For example, stricter environmental regulations can lead to increased costs or even production halts. Buenaventura's ability to effectively manage these aspects can significantly affect its long-term profitability and stock valuation.Assessing the company's exploration efforts and reserves replacement is important for understanding its long-term outlook. A company that is not replacing its mined reserves could be facing a diminishing production profile, which would be a red flag for investors looking at long-term growth. Buenaventura's current production performance and future projections may offer some reassurance, yet the details of reserve replacement rates and the success of exploration activities should be considered for a comprehensive analysis. 04/16/2024 - 06:23 PM LIMA, Peru--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Compañía de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A.

Realized prices include both provisional sales and final adjustments for price changes. Commentary on Operations Tambomayo: Gold, lead and zinc production exceeded 1Q24 projections due to a change in mining sequence, prioritizing higher-margin prepared areas with higher gold, lead and zinc grades, partially offset by lower silver production. Orcopampa: 1Q24 gold production was in line with expectations. Coimolache: 1Q24 gold production was in line with expectations. Environmental permitting delays reduced available space on the leach pads, adversely impacting the volume of fresh ore which could be placed on the pad, as was previously announced. Silver production exceeded 1Q24 projections due to higher grade silver ore processed from the Tantahuatay NW-Ext, which was placed on the leach pad during 4Q23. Julcani: Silver and lead production was in line with expectations for 1Q24. Uchucchacua: Silver, lead and zinc in line with expectations for 1Q24. Uchucchacua production increased to an average 1,000 tpd during 1Q24 from 800 tpd reported during the 4Q23, aligned with the Company’s plan to reach 1,500 tpd by the end of 2024. Yumpag: In January 2024, Yumpag successfully completed processing 124,600 tonnes of ore from its pilot stope. Yumpag received final operating permitting approval on March 18, 2024, enabling uninterrupted mining of up to 1,000 tons per day. Silver production exceeded 1Q24 projections as ore processing was initiated earlier than expected due to the operating permit approval. Processing had previously been expected to start during the 2Q24. El Brocal: Copper production was in line with expectations for 1Q24. Silver production exceeded 1Q24 projections due to higher than anticipated grades from the open pit’s remaining stockpiled inventories. This was partially offset by lower than anticipated zinc grades during the quarter. As was previously reported, El Brocal’s lead and zinc open pit mine has been placed under care and maintenance for up to three years until the Company receives the approval of the mine’s Modification of Environmental Impact Assessment. El Brocal’s 1Q24 underground mine exploitation rate reached 10,500 tpd, in line with the Company’s target to reach 11,000 tpd by the end of 2024.

The company's CEO highlighted operational successes, geographic expansions, and product developments, setting the stage for continued growth in 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Examining the record-breaking financial performance of Beam Global, one sees a company on a rapid expansion trajectory. A 206% increase in annual revenue is not only impressive but indicative of significant market penetration and growth strategy execution. The strategic move to increase the EV ARC™ base unit sales price by 8.25% likely contributed to the revenue surge, reflecting a strong pricing power that can buffer margin pressures in a competitive landscape.Understanding the financial health of a company involves looking beyond revenue; here, the operating expenses reduction to 26% of revenues down from 82% is as important as the top-line growth. It speaks to a company achieving better economies of scale and improved operational efficiency. However, investors should be mindful of the net loss figures, which, while improved, still represent a sizeable 24% of revenues. The reliance on capital raises and the corresponding increase in working capital warrant close observation for indications of how sustainable and self-funding the company's growth trajectory might be. Clean Technology Market Analyst Beam Global's involvement in the electric vehicle infrastructure space aligns with global trends toward decarbonization and electrification. The substantial orders from US federal agencies and the expansion into the European market through the acquisition of Amiga and the subsequent UK Ministry of Defence order are strategic plays. These moves not only diversify the company’s revenue streams but also signal potential for market leadership in a sector that's expected to see exponential growth as governments worldwide push for greener transportation solutions.Moreover, the development of the EV Standard™ product and expansion of the patent portfolio represent a commitment to innovation and intellectual property - key aspects for maintaining competitive advantage. While the growth is tangible, retail investors should balance the enthusiasm with the consideration of the industry's regulatory risks and the high-paced competitive environment where rapid technological changes can affect long-term profitability. Sustainability Analyst The focus on sustainable EV charging infrastructure by Beam Global is not only an ethical stance but also a strategic business decision. With increased consumer awareness around climate change, companies that offer sustainable solutions are becoming increasingly attractive. Beam’s patented Thermal Management Technology that ensures lithium-ion batteries' safety is an innovation that addresses a key consumer concern in the EV market, potentially driving further adoption and sales.However, this is a double-edged sword; as regulatory scrutiny on battery materials and recycling escalates, Beam will need to constantly evolve to maintain its ‘clean’ brand. For investors, this focus on sustainability represents an alignment with a long-term trend, yet the financial viability of these technologies must be continuously evaluated against emerging regulations and competitive technologies that could disrupt the market dynamics. 04/16/2024 - 07:02 PM Conference Call Wednesday April 17, 2024 at 4:30 p.m. ETSAN DIEGO, April 16, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Beam Global, (Nasdaq: BEEM, BEEMW), (the “Company”), the leading provider of innovative and sustainable infrastructure solutions for the electrification of transportation and energy security, today announced operating results for the year ended December 31, 2023. 2023 and Recent Company Highlights Record full year revenues of $67.4 million, 206% year over year increaseRecord Q4 revenues of $20.0 million, 154% year over year increase and highest quarterly revenue in the company’s historyRecord full year EV ARC™ system production, 194% year over year increasePositive full-year gross profit – an improvement of 9% as a percentage of revenue over 2022Debt free and $100 million line of credit available and unusedCurrent pipeline $150 million, backlog of $22 million at December 31, 2023Received $7.4 million order from the U.S. Army for 88 off-grid EV ARC™ EV charging systems – 3rd largest order in company historyReceived $4.8 million order from U.S. Department of Homeland Security for sustainable EV charging infrastructure products – 5th largest order in company historyAcquired Amiga creating Beam Europe to open largest market in the world to Beam Global clean technology solutions with existing customer relationships in 17 nationsAwarded first European government supplier agreement on the UK’s Crown Commercial ServiceReceived first million-dollar European order for EV ARC™ solar-powered EV charging systems from UK Ministry of DefenceReceived new European orders from leading telecommunications provider totaling US$1.2 millionQualified for U.S. Federal government FedRAMPIncreased EV ARC™ base unit sales price by 8.25%Expanded global patent portfolio: Granted U.S. Patent for Wireless / Inductive Electric Vehicle Charging Powered by Renewable EnergyGranted European patent for Compact Transportation-Configurable EV ARC™ SystemsGranted European patent for EV Standard™ Curbside EV Charging Infrastructure productGranted European Patent for Thermal Management Technology that Makes Lithium-ion Batteries SaferGranted patents in China and India for Thermal Management Technology that Makes Lithium-ion Batteries Safer Enhanced Beam global leadership team: Judy Krandel joined Beam Global Board of Directors as Audit Committee ChairEurope-based George Syllantavos joined Beam Global Board of DirectorsAppointed Mark Myers, former nuclear navy officer, as Chief Operating OfficerAppointed Lisa Potok as Chief Financial Officer Significantly expanded engineering expertise to further develop new product solutions for the electrification of transportation and the security and decarbonization of energy infrastructureSignificantly expanded development and manufacturing capacity to bring Beam Global products to European markets and beyondCommenced fabrication of EV Standard™ beta productsLaunched 160 mph wind-rated EV ARC™ sustainable EV charging infrastructure product line “The Beam Team delivered a tripling of revenues, positive and significantly improved gross profits, significantly reduced operating costs as a percentage of revenues, a tangible path to cash flow, and growing pipeline and healthy backlog,” said Desmond Wheatley, CEO of Beam Global. “We executed a major geographic expansion into the world's largest market for our products through our acquisition of Amiga DOO and won an important government contract award and our first million-dollar EV ARC™ order from a European military within five months of creating Beam Europe. We made significant enhancements to our operational, engineering and leadership teams and implemented efficiencies and design enhancements which enabled us to reduce direct costs and improve our products. We were awarded multiple new and meaningful patents and several awards for our existing products. We are now fabricating the first physical components of a major new product launch – EV Standard – in our European and Chicago facilities and we intend to bring that product to market early in the second half of this year. We achieved all of this in the same year without taking on debt and without meaningful dilution. 2023 was the best operational year by far in our history, and we believe that we have laid the groundwork for continued improvements in 2024.” 2023 Financial Summary RevenuesFor the fourth quarter of 2023, Beam Global reported record revenues of $20.0 million, a 154% increase over the same period in 2022. Full year revenues for 2023 were a record $67.4 million, a 206% increase over 2022. The 2023 revenue growth is primarily attributable to an increase in federal orders from larger orders we received in late 2022. Gross ProfitGross profit for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 was $0.4 million, or 2% of sales, compared to a gross loss of $0.7 million, or 9% of sales in the fourth quarter of the prior year. As a percentage of sales, our gross profit improved by 11%. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our gross profit was $1.2 million, or 2% of sales, compared to a gross loss of $1.7 million, or 7% of sales in 2022. As a percentage of sales, the full year margin improved by 9%. Excluding non-cash intangible amortization from the 2023 gross margin, increases gross profits to $2.1 million. The improvement in gross margin is primarily due to the increase in production levels compared to the prior year which resulted in favorable fixed overhead absorption, as well as cost savings from engineering design changes, labor efficiencies and reduction in material costs. Operating ExpensesOperating Expenses were $5.5 million or 28% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $7.1 million or 90% of revenues for the same period in the prior year, an improvement of 62% year over year. Operating expenses decreased by $1.9 million for non-cash contingent consideration related to the All Cell Technologies acquisition and for non-cash stock compensation expense, partially offset by increases for sales commissions. For the year ended December 31, 2023, total operating expenses were $17.5 million or 26% of revenues compared to $18.0 million, or 82% of revenues for the same period in 2022, an improvement of 56% as a percentage of revenues. Expenses in 2023 included a $5.3 million reduction in the fair value of contingent consideration expense related to the All Cell Technologies acquisition which was recorded in 2022 but was not required in 2023. Operating expense increases included commissions due to the increase in sales, the addition of operating expenses for Amiga for Q4 following the acquisition and increased salaries and consultants including R&D related to the development of the new EV Standard™ product. Net LossNet loss was $5.1 million, or 25% of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $7.8 million, or 99% of revenue, for the same period in 2022 an improvement of 74% year over year. Net Loss was $16.1 million or 24% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $19.7 million or 90% of revenues for 2022 an improvement of 66% year over year. The year-to-date net loss included non-cash expense items such as depreciation, intellectual property amortization and non-cash compensation expense of $4.3 million in 2023 and $9.2 million in 2022. 2023 net loss excluding noncash items was $11.8 million or 18% of revenues. Cash and Working CapitalOn December 31, 2023, we had cash of $10.4 million, compared to $1.7 million at December 31, 2022. The cash increase was primarily due to a capital raise in June 2023, offset by increased accounts receivable due to the increased revenues, operating losses and cash payments for the acquisition of Amiga in the fourth quarter. Our working capital increased from $6.8 million to $23.8 million from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023 due to the cash from the capital raise and the increase in accounts receivable and inventories resulting from the increased orders and revenues.

Partnership with Google Cloud for first deployment of CXAI platform with a Fortune 1000 client in Summer 2024. CXAI integrates customer experience (CX) with artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance workplace efficiency and employee engagement. Negative None. Financial Analyst Analyzing the Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) growth is a key performance indicator, especially for a tech company like CXApp Inc., which has just announced a significant 24% growth for the full year 2023. The double-digit growth in the fourth quarter is a strong signal of the company's market traction and given that this growth is associated with securing large Fortune 1000 clients, it suggests CXApp is successfully scaling its business and improving its market position.The strategic rebranding to CXAI could be interpreted as a move to enhance the company’s perceived value in the market by focusing on AI capabilities, which could attract more investors and potentially lead to a higher stock valuation. However, investors should consider the costs associated with such rebranding efforts and whether the new brand will resonate with customers and lead to increased sales.It’s important for investors to monitor the upcoming deployment of the CXAI platform in partnership with Google Cloud. The success of this deployment could serve as a proof of concept to potential clients and might stimulate further growth. If the platform outperforms or meets industry expectations, it could likely lead to an uptick in the company's stock price. Conversely, any setbacks could have an adverse effect. Tech Market Analyst The partnership with Google Cloud is of particular interest, offering CXApp a robust cloud infrastructure and enhanced credibility in the tech market. This collaboration might allow CXAI to leverage Google’s AI tools and cloud capabilities, potentially increasing their competitive edge. We may also anticipate an uptick in marketing activities as the company prepares for the deployment of its platform for a Fortune 1000 client in the summer of 2024.As AI is a rapidly evolving field, CXApp's focus on AI integration into workplace experiences could position the company at the forefront of this trend. However, it is essential to assess the ongoing competition in this space and whether CXAI's solutions offer substantial differentiation.Investors should also consider the longevity and scalability of the solutions CXAI is offering. As workplace technology continually advances, CXAI will need to invest in innovation to maintain a competitive edge, which can impact future earnings. 04/16/2024 - 04:25 PM Strategic Rebranding to CXAI (""Sky"")First Deployment of CXAI Platform partnering with Google Cloud for Fortune 1000 Client slated for Summer 2024PALO ALTO, CA / ACCESSWIRE / April 16, 2024 / CXApp Inc.

The company repurchased 261,340 common shares and declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per share. Total assets decreased to $4.10 billion, while total loans increased to $3.38 billion during the first quarter of 2024. Nonperforming assets increased to $12.5 million, and stockholders' equity rose to $609.3 million at the end of the quarter. Negative Noninterest income decreased to $4.4 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $5.8 million in the first quarter of 2023. Nonperforming assets increased to $12.5 million at the end of the first quarter of 2024. Stockholders' equity decreased by $10.5 million from December 31, 2023, to March 31, 2024. Financial Analyst Bank First's reported net income of $15.4 million for the first quarter of 2024, reflected in earnings per share (EPS) of $1.51, denotes a solid performance especially when considering the year-over-year comparison with the first quarter of 2023, which saw a net income of $10.7 million and an EPS of $1.09. This represents a considerable uplift in profitability, presumptively due to optimized operations and a beneficial business environment. The bank's decision to repurchase over 261,340 of its own common shares, equivalent to 2.5% of its outstanding shares, could indicate confidence in their intrinsic value and a strategic approach to enhancing shareholder value. Furthermore, the consistent dividend payout of $0.35 per share signifies stability and a commitment to returning profits to shareholders, which is a reassuring signal for investors looking for consistent income streams. From a balance sheet standpoint, the marginal decrease in total assets may call for a closer examination of asset management strategies and portfolio composition over time. However, the increase in loans by $60.1 million year-over-year could bode well for future interest income generation, assuming that asset quality remains strong. Credit Analyst The provision for credit losses of $0.2 million in the first quarter of 2024, which is markedly lower than the $4.2 million during the same quarter in 2023, suggests improved asset quality or an adjusted risk assessment framework. The recorded net recoveries add a positive nuance to the credit performance narrative, potentially indicating robust loan underwriting standards and effective credit management practices. However, the uptick in nonperforming assets to $12.5 million raises a flag that requires monitoring as it could reflect an emerging risk within the loan portfolio, particularly as it pertains to the integration of acquired loan portfolios. Market Research Analyst The bank's strategic moves, such as the sale of its member interest in UFS and the ongoing upgrades to its online customer platform, underscore an intent to adapt to changing market conditions and customer expectations. While noninterest income has slightly dipped, likely due to the absence of revenue from UFS, the investment in tech infrastructure is an anticipatory move that could strengthen competitive positioning in the digital banking space and enhance customer retention in the long-term. Additionally, the changes in the deposit portfolio composition, with a modest shift from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits, suggest an evolving depositor behavior which might reflect broader economic trends such as fluctuating interest rates or changes in savers' preferences that have to be navigated adeptly by the bank's management. 04/16/2024 - 04:15 PM Net income of $15.4 million and earnings per common share of $1.51 for the three months ended March 31, 2024Annualized return on average assets of 1.50% for the three months ended March 31, 2024261,340 common shares repurchased, 2.5% of outstanding shares as of the beginning of the period, during the first quarter of 2024 Quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per share declared, matching the prior-quarter and 16.7% higher than the prior-year first quarterMANITOWOC, Wis., April 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Bank First Corporation (NASDAQ: BFC) (""Bank First"" or the ""Bank""), the holding company for Bank First, N.A., reported net income of $15.4 million, or $1.51 per share, for the first quarter of 2024, compared with net income of $10.7 million, or $1.09 per share, for the prior-year first quarter.

Net interest margin (""NIM"") was 3.62% for the first quarter of 2024, compared to 3.53% for the previous quarter and 3.74% for the first quarter of 2023. NII from purchase accounting increased NIM by 0.13%, 0.03% and 0.26% for each period, respectively. Bank First recorded a provision for credit losses of $0.2 million during the first quarter of 2024, compared to $0.5 million during the previous quarter and $4.2 million during the first quarter of 2023. Net recoveries of previously charged-off loan balances over currently charged-off loans totaled $0.6 million during the first quarter of 2024, adding to the recorded provision for credit losses in creating an adequate credit loss reserve for the Bank's growth in its loan portfolio. The acquisition of the loan portfolio of Hometown Bancorp, Ltd. (""Hometown"") during the first quarter of 2023 resulted in a day one provision for credit losses expense of $3.6 million, leading to the significant year-over-year first quarter variance in provision expense. Noninterest income was $4.4 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $5.8 million for the first quarter of 2023. One differentiator in year-over-year first quarter noninterest income was the absence of income from UFS, LLC (""UFS"") during 2024 compared to $0.9 million of revenue from UFS during the first quarter of 2023. The Bank sold 100% of its member interest in UFS in a transaction that closed on October 1, 2023. The Bank also experienced a $0.3 million negative valuation adjustment to its mortgage servicing rights asset during the first quarter of 2024, which compared unfavorably to a $0.8 million favorable adjustment in the prior-year first quarter. All other components of noninterest income were relatively consistent year-over-year. Noninterest expense was $20.3 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $19.7 million during the first quarter of 2023. Personnel expense increased by $1.0 million year-over-year as additional staff from the acquisition of Hometown impacted the full first quarter of 2024 compared to just over one-half of the first quarter of 2023. Data processing expenses, which increased by $0.5 million year-over-year, included $0.3 million paid to a vendor during the first quarter of 2024 related to upgrading the Bank's online customer platform. Postage, stationery and supplies expenses, as well as outside service fees, were heavily impacted by one-time acquisition expenses from the acquisition of Hometown during the first quarter of 2023, leading to a year-over-year reduction in these expense categories during the first quarter of 2024. The comparability of year-over-year income tax expense was affected by a provision enacted in the Bank's home state during 2023 which offered an income tax exclusion on certain commercial and agricultural loans to borrowers who reside or are located in the state of Wisconsin. While Wisconsin's governor signed this provision on July 5, 2023, rules related to qualifying loans under it were not finalized until the first quarter of 2024. Based on these final rules, an additional benefit of $1.3 million was recorded during the first quarter of 2024 as a refinement to provisions for income taxes from 2023. Balance SheetTotal assets were $4.10 billion at March 31, 2024, a decrease of $121.9 million from December 31, 2023, and $67.3 million lower than March 31, 2023. Total loans were $3.38 billion at March 31, 2024, up $40.4 million from December 31, 2023, and up $60.1 million from March 31, 2023. Loans grew by 4.9% annualized during the first quarter of 2024. Much of this growth occurred later in the quarter, muting the impact on earnings and NII, but future quarters should benefit to a greater degree. Total deposits, nearly all of which remain core deposits, were $3.42 billion at March 31, 2024, down $16.9 million from December 31, 2023, and down $47.2 million from March 31, 2023. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits comprised 29.0% of the Bank's total deposits at March 31, 2024, compared to 31.8% at March 31, 2023, as the Bank experienced a modest shift in the makeup of its deposit portfolio towards interest-bearing balances. Asset QualityNonperforming assets at March 31, 2024 totaled $12.5 million, up from $9.1 million at the end of the fourth and first quarters of 2023. The current quarter increase in nonperforming assets resulted from one loan totaling $3.6 million which was moved to nonaccrual status. This loan and over 95% of the Bank's total nonaccrual loan balances were included in the loan portfolios of the Bank's previous two acquisitions. Nonperforming assets to total assets ended the first quarter of 2024 at 0.31%, up from 0.21% at the end of the prior quarter and 0.22% at the end of the prior-year first quarter. Capital PositionStockholders' equity totaled $609.3 million at March 31, 2024, an increase of $47.0 million from the end of the first quarter of 2023, but a decrease of $10.5 million from December 31, 2023. Dividends totaling $3.5 million and repurchases of BFC common stock totaling $22.3 million outpaced earnings of $15.4 million during the quarter, causing the decline in capital. The Bank's book value per common share totaled $60.16 at March 31, 2024 compared to $59.80 at December 31, 2023 and $54.04 at March 31, 2023. Tangible book value per common share (non-GAAP) totaled $40.35 at March 31, 2024 compared to $40.30 at December 31, 2023 and $34.14 at March 31, 2023.

Pederson and Jeremy Held, won re-election for a three-year term. RISKS An investment in the Fund is not appropriate for all investors and is not intended to be a complete investment program. The Fund is designed as a long-term investment and not as a trading vehicle. Investing in the Fund involves risks, including the risk that you may receive little or no return on your investment or that you may lose part or even all of your investment and exposure to below-investment grade investments (i.e., ""junk bonds""). The Fund's net asset value will vary and its distribution rate may vary and both may be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the market spread over a specified benchmark, market interest rates and performance of the broader equity markets. Fluctuations in net asset value may be magnified as a result of the Fund's use of leverage. Therefore, before investing you should carefully consider the risks that you assume when you invest in the Fund's common shares. Securities backed by commercial real estate assets are subject to market risks similar to those of direct ownership of commercial real estate assets including, but not limited to, declines in the value of real estate, declines in rental or occupancy rates and risks related to general and local economic conditions. The Fund's investment objectives and policies are not designed to seek to return the initial investment to investors that purchase shares. An investor should consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing.

Positive None. Negative None. 04/16/2024 - 05:38 PM MILWAUKEE, April 16, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- High Income Securities Fund (“the Fund”) (NYSE: PCF) announced today that its Board of Trustees has authorized the issuance of one non-transferable right for each share of the Fund held on a date to be announced to purchase one additional share of the Fund’s stock at a subscription price to be determined by the Board of Trustees. Rights holders that fully exercise their rights will also be entitled to subscribe, subject to certain limitations to be set forth in a prospectus (which shall be available on the website of the Securities and Exchange Commission at www.sec.gov) and subject to allotment, for additional shares of stock that are not subscribed for by other rights holders. If there are not enough unsubscribed shares available to honor all additional subscription requests, the Fund may, in its sole discretion, issue additional shares up to 10% of the shares initially available in the offering. Subject to shareholder approval, a special committee of the Board comprised only of the independent Trustees has recommended that the full Board approve (1) the Fund entering into an investment advisory agreement with Bulldog Investors, LLP, and (2) changes to the Fund’s investment strategies and fundamental policies in order to expand the types of investments the Fund can make and to increase the Fund’s ability to pursue attractive investment opportunities. Therefore, after completion of the rights offering, and subject to Board approval, the Fund intends to hold a special meeting of shareholders to consider proposals to implement these changes. Since the Fund’s shareholder base has become increasingly inactive with respect to participation in shareholder meetings, culminating in the lack of a quorum at the annual meeting of shareholders in 2023, the rights offering is intended, in part, to increase the proportion of shareholders that will actively participate in shareholder meetings. To this end, the Board intends to authorize a self-tender offer by the Fund to commence shortly after the special meeting to purchase, at a price of at least 98% of NAV, at least (a) 90% of the number of shares issued in the rights offering if the proposals are adopted, or (b) 60% of the number of shares issued in the rights offering if the proposals are not adopted. The foregoing does not constitute a tender offer or an offer to purchase the shares of any shareholder. Any such offer will be made pursuant to separate tender offer materials complying with the requirements of Section 13(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and Rule 13e-4 thereunder. This press release is not intended to and does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to subscribe for or buy or an invitation to purchase or subscribe for any securities in any jurisdiction, nor shall there be any sale, issuance, or transfer of securities in any jurisdiction in contravention of applicable law. No offer of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. For more information, please call InvestorCom, the Fund’s information agent, at (877) 972-0090. What did High Income Securities Fund announce? High Income Securities Fund announced a non-transferable rights offering. What does the rights offering allow shareholders to do?

(OTCQB:FEMFF)(WKN: [A2JC89]), a leading player in the energy metals sector, is delighted to announce the results of its 2023 exploration campaign on our properties in the prospective James Bay region. The extensive work effort, encompassing prospecting, mapping, and sampling, aimed to identify lithium-pegmatite targets for further exploration, a critical step in advancing the Company's lithium exploration initiatives in the northern Quebec. Samples collected during the program underwent field testing with a handheld Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) instrument and selected samples were submitted to Activation Laboratories (""ACTLABS""), Ancaster, Ontario for analysis. The laboratory analysis has confirmed several promising pegmatites, which will need a detailed 2024 follow-up work program.Rose East Lithium Work Program Highlights: Situated approximately 70 km Northeast of Nemiscau town, the Rose East property has proven to be geologically promising. Of note was identifying and mapping 19 prominent pegmatites, enhancing the property's lithium exploration potential. A total of 57 rock chip and grab samples were collected during the fieldwork. The samples were initially scanned in the field with LIBS, from which nine samples were submitted for analysis to the laboratory. LIBS testing of the samples revealed anomalous lithium values, with the laboratory results returning lithium values in the range of approximately less than 15 ppm to 107 ppm, with anomalous values of other rare metals such as niobium (2.4 to 43.3 ppm) and rubidium (80.2 to 340 ppm) (see Table 1 for details).Rose West Lithium Work Program Highlights: Located approximately 40 km to the west of Nemiscau town, the project covers approximately 1,695 hectares, which sit directly adjacent to the claims of Critical Elements Lithium Corporation, which hosts their Rose Lithium deposit. Seven prominent pegmatite outcrops were identified and mapped during 2023 work, from which a total of 21 rock chip and grab samples were collected. Field testing with the LIBS unit again identified anomalous values of lithium, and 12 samples were selected for laboratory analysis. The assays indicated lithium values in the range of less than 15 ppm to 78 ppm (see Table 2 for details).Pontax West Lithium Work Program Highlights: Located at a distance of approximately 50 km Southwest of the Camp KM 381, the project staddles the Mattagami-Raddison highway, the main road to the James Bay region. Much of the property was covered using this highway for prospecting with some remote locations accessed by helicopter. In total, 23 prominent pegmatites were identified on the property and 117 samples were collected. The majority of samples represented the pegmatites, with a few collected from granites and metasediments. The samples were again field tested with LIBS, out of which 15 samples were submitted for analysis. The laboratory results indicate lithium values in the range of less than 15 ppm to 49 ppm (see Table 3 for details).The samples were bagged and tagged using best practices and were delivered to ACTLABS for sample preparation and analysesusing laboratories code Ultratrace 7 and sodium peroxide fusion (Na2O2) as summarized below. ACTLABS is an independent commercial, accredited ISO Certified Laboratory.Code Ultratrace 7 - Peroxide Fusion - ICP and ICP/MSSamples are fused with sodium peroxide in a Zirconium crucible. The fused sample is acidified with concentrated nitric and hydrochloric acids. The resulting solutions are diluted and then measured by ICP-OES and ICP-MS. All metals are solubilized.ICP-MSFused samples are diluted and analyzed by Agilent 7900 ICP-MS. Calibration is performed using five synthetic calibration standards. A set of (10-20) fused certified reference material is run with every batch of samples for calibration and quality control. Fused duplicates are run every 10 samples.ICP-OESSamples are analyzed with a minimum of 10 certified reference materials for the required analytes, all prepared by sodium peroxide fusion. Every 10th sample is prepared and analyzed in duplicate; a blank is prepared every 30 samples and analyzed. Samples are analyzed using a Varian 735ES ICP and internal standards are used as part of the standard operating procedure.Source: https://actlabs.com/geochemistry/lithogeochemistry-and-whole-rock-analysis/peroxide-total-fusion/In addition to the exploration update, the Company is pleased to announce a non-brokered private placement financing for total gross proceeds of up to $1,000,000.

First Quarter Results Highlighted by Record Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Expansion Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Equity Bancshares, Inc. reported record net interest income and net interest margin expansion in the first quarter of 2024. The company achieved a net interest margin of 3.75% and completed a merger with Rockhold Bancorp, enhancing its Missouri franchise. Positive Record net interest income and net interest margin expansion Net income of $14.1 million or $0.90 earnings per diluted share Successful completion of merger with Rockhold Bancorp Added to Missouri franchise with the merger Strategic growth opportunities expected in the future Negative None. Financial Analyst Evaluating the recent earnings report from Equity Bancshares, several financial highlights stand out. The reported net interest income is noteworthy, as it serves as a primary revenue source for financial institutions. The increase in net interest margin (NIM) to 3.75% speaks volumes about the bank's efficiency in earning from its core lending and deposit activities. A higher NIM often implies that the bank is managing its interest-earning assets and liabilities effectively, which can result in improved profitability. Additionally, the successful merger with Rockhold Bancorp, expanding the Missouri franchise, suggests strategic growth and potential economies of scale. Mergers and acquisitions can offer cost synergies and customer base expansion, which could enhance future earnings potential. However, it's also essential to monitor the integration process as it can be complex and costly. For the retail investor, the earnings per diluted share of $0.90 is a direct indicator of the bank's profitability and its potential to provide shareholder value. It's also a key metric to compare against market expectations and historical performance. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Equity Bancshares' strategic moves, like the merger with Rockhold Bancorp, are significant for its regional influence in the Midwest. The expansion in Missouri could enhance the bank's competitive positioning in this market. Investors often look favorably upon mergers that promise to enhance market reach and contribute to revenue diversification. It's also important to understand how this merger impacts the bank's market share and whether it could lead to greater pricing power or cross-selling opportunities. However, one must be cautious of overestimating the short-term benefits as the true impact of mergers usually unfolds over the longer term. For investors, this kind of strategic expansion can be enticing, but it's vital to consider the broader economic environment and regional banking trends to gauge the potential success of such ventures. 04/16/2024 - 05:46 PM Reports NIM of 3.75%, Completes Merger with Rockhold Bancorp, Adding to Missouri Franchise WICHITA, Kan.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Equity Bancshares, Inc. (NYSE: EQBK), (“Equity”, “the Company”, “we,” “us,” “our”), the Wichita-based holding company of Equity Bank, reported net income of $14.1 million or $0.90 earnings per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. “Our Company entered the year positioned to take advantage of opportunities which we expect will drive our operating growth in the future,” said Brad S. Elliott, Chairman and CEO of Equity. “With our team’s proven, strategic skillset and cultivated relationships within our banking community, we were able to complete our merger with the Bank of Kirksville on February 9, 2024, just 67 days after announcement of the formal agreement. We are excited about our Company’s capacity to continue to leverage our skills and position to grow our franchise.” ""In addition, our retail and commercial teams throughout our footprint continued to build customer relationships and provide value to business and consumer customers in the quarter,"" Mr. Elliott said. ""Our classified asset ratio continues to be historically low, while both capital and on balance sheet reserves remain high, positioning Equity to continue to pursue strategic growth opportunities, both organically and through mergers.” Notable Items: The Company realized earnings per diluted share of $0.90, adjusted to exclude merger expenses of $1.6 million and opening balance sheet provisioning of $1.0 million, earnings per share were $1.03. The Company completed its all-cash acquisition (“the acquisition”) of Rockhold Bancorp, the parent company of the Bank of Kirksville adding eight locations, $118.7 million in loans, and $349.6 million in deposits. A gain on acquisition of $1.2 million was recorded with the closing of the transaction. The Company realized linked quarter gross loans held-for-investment expansion of $149.3 million. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, loans grew by $30.6 million, or 3.70% annualized The Company realized expansion in net interest income and net interest margin, as the benefits of previously announced strategic transactions were realized. Total net interest income for the quarter was $44.2 million, an all-time high for the Company. The Company was active in its share repurchase plan during the quarter, purchasing 209,591 shares at a weighted average cost of $32.24. Under the repurchase plan announced in the fourth quarter of 2023, 790,409 shares remain available for purchase. Classified assets as a percentage of total risk based capital at Equity Bank closed the period at 6.65% while non-performing assets remained historically low. The allowance for credit losses closed the quarter at 1.28% of total loans. Financial Results for the Quarter Ended March 31, 2024 Net income allocable to common stockholders was $14.1 million, or $0.90 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Excluding merger expenses and the required provisioning for performing loans acquired in the acquisition, net income was $16.1 million, or $1.03 per diluted share. Excluding the impact of the merger expenses and the loss on sale of securities taken by the Company during the previous quarter, operating net income was $12.1 million. The drivers of the periodic change are discussed in detail in the following sections. Net Interest Income Net interest income was $44.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to $39.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2024, the increase was driven by increasing average assets as well as positive trend in margin. Net interest margin increased to 3.75% from 3.49% as the yield on interest-earning assets increased 40 basis points to 6.09% and the cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 19 basis points to 2.77%. The earning asset improvement was driven by the Bank’s bond portfolio re-positioning as well as purchase accounting accretion associated with the marks on the acquisition. Additionally, loan coupons continued to improve partially offsetting pressures in funding costs. Further, the addition of non-interest bearing deposits positively impacted total deposit costs during the quarter, limiting expansion to 18 basis points and comparatively improving net interest income. Provision for Credit Losses During the three months ended March 31, 2024, there was a provision of $1.0 million compared to a provision of $711 thousand in the previous quarter. The provision for the quarter is entirely attributable to the establishment of reserve on loan acquired in the acquisition. The Company continues to estimate the allowance for credit loss with assumptions that anticipate slower prepayment rates and continued market disruption caused by elevated inflation, supply chain issues and the impact of monetary policy on consumers and businesses. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, we had net charge-offs of $668 thousand as compared to $1.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023. Non-Interest Income Total non-interest income was $11.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to $(43.4) million for the three months ended December 31, 2023. Adjusted for the loss realized on re-positioning our bond portfolio of $50.7 million, non-interest income for the previous period ended was $7.3 million. The comparative increase for the current quarter ended is driven by positive outcomes on resolution of specific loan assets adding $3.0 million as well as the gain recognized on the acquisition of $1.2 million. In addition to these non-recurring benefits, the Bank saw expansion in service fee revenue line items, including service charges, treasury, mortgage banking and wealth management during the period. The gain on acquisition is primarily attributable to the improvement in the fair value position of the Bank of Kirksville’s bond portfolio between announcement of the transaction and close. Non-Interest Expense Total non-interest expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, was $37.1 million as compared to $35.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $2.1 million. Adjusting for merger expenses in both periods, the increase quarter over quarter was $1.0 million due to the addition of Bank of Kirksville expenses, annual compensation rate adjustments and early year payroll tax dynamics. The conversion of systems related to the acquisition will not be completed until the middle of the second quarter 2024. Following conversion, cost saves are expected to be fully realized. Income Tax Expense At March 31, 2024, the effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.8% as compared to a normalized rate of 7.5% for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. The prior quarter's tax rate was normalized to exclude pre-tax losses recognized in the quarter related to the sale of investment securities. The increase in rate from December 31, 2023, to the quarter ending March 31, 2024, was the result of a reduction in the tax benefit related to investments in tax credit structures offset by the tax benefit recognized in the current quarter related to the bargain purchase gain recorded on the acquisition completed during the quarter. At the end of the quarter, the Company has additional capacity for investments in tax credit structures which would positively impact the Company's tax rate. As these investments have not been made as of the end of the quarter, they are not considered in establishing the quarterly tax expense reserve. Loans, Total Assets and Funding Loans held for investment were $3.48 billion at March 31, 2024, increasing $149.3 million compared to the previous quarter. Included in this growth figure is $118.7 million in total loans added through the acquisition. Total assets were $5.20 billion as of March 31, 2024, increasing $204.4 million or 4.1% during the quarter. Total deposits were $4.4 billion at March 31, 2024, increasing $225.6 million from the previous quarter end. Included in the growth figure is $349.6 million added through the acquisition. Of the total deposit balance, non-interest-bearing accounts comprise approximately 22.5%. During the quarter, the Company’s $140.0 million Federal Reserve Bank borrowing matured and was replaced with borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Bank. Total Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings were $219.9 million as of the end of the quarter, up $119.9 million as compared to December 31, 2023. Asset Quality As of March 31, 2024, Equity’s allowance for credit losses to total loans remained materially consistent at 1.3% as compared to December 31, 2023. Nonperforming assets were $25.3 million as of March 31, 2024, or 0.5% of total assets, compared to $26.5 million at December 31, 2023, or 0.5% of total assets. Non-accrual loans were $24.2 million at March 31, 2024, as compared to $25.0 million at December 31, 2023. Total classified assets, including loans rated special mention or worse, other real estate owned, excluding previous branch locations, and other repossessed assets were $38.1 million, or 6.65% of regulatory capital, down from $40.5 million, or 7.1% of regulatory capital as of December 31, 2023. Capital Quarter over quarter, book capital increased $3.9 million to $456.8 million and tangible capital decreased $6.7 million to $384.8 million. The increase in book capital is primarily due to earnings, partially offset by treasury share purchases of $6.7 million, increase in unrealized loss on bonds and cash flow hedges of $2.9 million and dividends declared of $1.9 million. The comparative reduction in tangible capital is due to the addition of $11.5 million in core deposit intangible associated with the acquisition. The Company’s ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets was 11.1%, the total capital to risk-weighted assets was 14.7% and the total leverage ratio was 9.1% at March 31, 2024. At December 31, 2023, the Company’s common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio was 11.7%, the total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio was 15.5% and the total leverage ratio was 9.5%. Equity Bank's ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets was 13.2%, total capital to risk-weighted assets was 14.3% and the total leverage ratio was 10.2% at March 31, 2024. At December 31, 2023, Equity Bank’s ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets was 13.9%, the ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets was 15.1% and the total leverage ratio was 10.6%. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to evaluating the Company’s results of operations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), management periodically supplements this evaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP financial measures that are intended to provide the reader with additional perspectives on operating results, financial condition and performance trends, while facilitating comparisons with the performance of other financial institutions. Non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for GAAP measures, rather, they should be read and used in conjunction with the Company’s GAAP financial information. The efficiency ratio is a common comparable metric used by banks to understand the expense structure relative to total revenue. In other words, for every dollar of total revenue recognized, how much of that dollar is expended. To improve the comparability of the ratio to our peers, non-core items are excluded. To improve transparency and acknowledging that banks are not consistent in their definition of the efficiency ratio, we include our calculation of this non-GAAP measure. Return on average assets before income tax provision and provision for loan losses is a measure that the Company uses to understand fundamental operating performance before these expenses. Used as a ratio relative to average assets, we believe it demonstrates “core” performance and can be viewed as an alternative measure of how efficiently the Company services its asset base. Used as a ratio relative to average equity, it can function as an alternative measure of the Company’s earnings performance in relationship to its equity. Tangible common equity and related measures are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of intangible assets, net of deferred taxes, and their related amortization. These financial measures are useful for evaluating the performance of a business consistently, whether acquired or developed internally. Return on average tangible common equity is used by management and readers of our financial statements to understand how efficiently the Company is deploying its common equity. Companies that are able to demonstrate more efficient use of common equity are more likely to be viewed favorably by current and prospective investors. The Company believes that disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures is both useful internally and is expected by our investors and analysts in order to understand the overall performance of the Company. Other companies may calculate and define their non-GAAP financial measures and supplemental data differently. A reconciliation of GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP measures and other performance ratios, as adjusted, are included in Table 6 in the following press release tables.

Special Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements reflect the current views of Equity’s management with respect to, among other things, future events and Equity’s financial performance. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “may,” “should,” “could,” “predict,” “potential,” “believe,” “will likely result,” “expect,” “continue,” “will,” “anticipate,” “seek,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “project,” “positioned,” “forecast,” “goal,” “target,” “would” and “outlook,” or the negative variations of those words or other comparable words of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about Equity’s industry, management’s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond Equity’s control. Accordingly, Equity cautions you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although Equity believes that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from Equity’s expectations include competition from other financial institutions and bank holding companies; the effects of and changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board; changes in the demand for loans; fluctuations in value of collateral and loan reserves; inflation, interest rate, market and monetary fluctuations; changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits; and acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses; and similar variables. The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. For discussion of these and other risks that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, please refer to “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in Equity’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 7, 2024, and any updates to those risk factors set forth in Equity’s subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K. If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if Equity’s underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from what Equity anticipates. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and Equity does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by law. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict those events or how they may affect us. In addition, Equity cannot assess the impact of each factor on Equity’s business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements, expressed or implied, included in this press release are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. This cautionary statement should also be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that Equity or persons acting on Equity’s behalf may issue.

Bringing SELARSDI to market in the U.S. early next year presents a significant opportunity to improve patient access to a vital biologic in inflammatory disease and contribute to the reduction of inflationary pressure in healthcare costs. The development of SELARSDI leveraged our purpose-built end-to-end development and manufacturing platform for biosimilars. Being able to develop the biosimilar in the same cell type and continuous perfusion process as was used for the reference product, facilitated the development program’s success.” Ustekinumab is a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that selectively targets the p40 protein, a component common to both interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 cytokines, which play crucial roles in treating immune-mediated diseases like psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Alvotech developed and produces SELARSDI using Sp2/0 cells and a continuous perfusion process, which are the same type of host cell line and process used in the production of Stelara. Sales of the reference product Stelara in the U.S. were nearly $7 billion in 2023.1 The availability of a Stelara biosimilar will create opportunities for cost savings across the healthcare system and introduce additional treatment options for patients. In the U.S., plaque psoriasis is the most common form of psoriasis while psoriatic arthritis accounts for approximately six percent of all cases of juvenile arthritis.2,3 In June 2023, Alvotech and Teva announced that they had reached a settlement and license agreement with the manufacturer of the reference biologic, Johnson & Johnson, granting a license entry date for SELARSDI in the United States no later than February 21, 2025. In August 2020, Alvotech and Teva entered into a strategic partnership for the exclusive commercialization of five of Alvotech’s biosimilar product candidates, and in August 2023, the collaboration was extended to include two additional biosimilars and new presentations of two previously partnered products. Alvotech handles development and manufacturing, while Teva is responsible for the exclusive commercialization in the U.S., which leverages Teva’s experience and extensive sales and marketing infrastructure. SELARSDI is the second biosimilar approved under the strategic partnership: in February 2024, the FDA approved SIMLANDI®, the first high-concentration, citrate-free biosimilar to Humira that has been granted an interchangeability status by the FDA. The FDA approval of SELARSDI, referred to as AVT04 during development, was based on a totality of evidence, including analytical and clinical data. The clinical development program included data from: 1) Study AVT04-GL-301, a randomized, double blind, multicenter, 52-week study to demonstrate equivalent efficacy and to compare safety and immunogenicity between SELARSDI and the reference product Stelara in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis. The study was conducted in four countries in Europe and enrolled 581 patients. The primary efficacy endpoint was Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) percent improvement from Baseline to Week 12; 2) Study AVT04-GL-101, a Phase I, randomized, double-blind, single-dose, parallel-group, 3-arm study to compare the pharmacokinetic, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity profiles of SELARSDI, administered as a single 45mg/0.5mL subcutaneous injection with that of the US-licensed Stelara as well as EU-approved Stelara. The study was conducted in Australia and New Zealand and enrolled 294 healthy adult volunteers.

INDICATIONS FOR SELARSDI (ustekinumab-aekn)SELARSDI™ (ustekinumab-aekn) Injection, is a human interleukin-12 and -23 antagonist indicated for: the treatment of adults and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy.the treatment of adults and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with active psoriatic arthritis. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION SELARSDI™ (ustekinumab-aekn) injection is contraindicated in patients with clinically significant hypersensitivity to ustekinumab products or to any of the excipients in SELARSDI. Infections Ustekinumab products may increase the risk of infections and reactivation of latent infections. Serious bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal, and viral infections were observed in patients receiving ustekinumab products. Serious infections requiring hospitalization or otherwise clinically significant infections were reported. In patients with psoriasis, these included diverticulitis, cellulitis, pneumonia, appendicitis, cholecystitis, sepsis, osteomyelitis, viral infections, gastroenteritis, and urinary tract infections. In patients with psoriatic arthritis, this included cholecystitis. Treatment with SELARSDI should not be initiated in patients with a clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating use of SELARSDI in patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection occur while on treatment with SELARSDI and discontinue SELARSDI for serious or clinically significant infections until the infection resolves or is adequately treated. Theoretical Risk for Vulnerability to Particular Infections Individuals genetically deficient in IL-12/IL-23 are particularly vulnerable to disseminated infections from mycobacteria (including nontuberculous, environmental mycobacteria), salmonella(including non typhi strains), and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccinations. Serious infections and fatal outcomes have been reported in such patients. It is not known whether patients with pharmacologic blockade of IL-12/IL-23 from treatment with ustekinumab products may be susceptible to these types of infections. Appropriate diagnostic testing should be considered (e.g., tissue culture, stool culture) as dictated by clinical circumstances. Pre-Treatment Evaluation of Tuberculosis (TB) Evaluate patients for TB prior to initiating treatment with SELARSDI. Do not administer SELARSDI to patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB before administering SELARSDI. Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to initiation of SELARSDI in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Closely monitor patients receiving SELARSDI for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after treatment. Malignancies Ustekinumab products are immunosuppressants and may increase the risk of malignancy. Malignancies were reported among patients who received ustekinumab in clinical trials. The safety of ustekinumab products has not been evaluated in patients who have a history of malignancy or who have a known malignancy. There have been post-marketing reports of the rapid appearance of multiple cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas in patients receiving ustekinumab products who had pre-existing risk factors for developing non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). All patients receiving SELARSDI, especially those greater than 60 years of age or those with a history of Psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA )or prolonged immunosuppressant treatment, should be monitored for the appearance of NMSC. Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, have been reported with ustekinumab products. If an anaphylactic or other clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction occurs, institute appropriate therapy and discontinue SELARSDI. Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) Two cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), also known as Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS), were reported in clinical trials. Cases have also been reported in postmarketing experience in patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Clinical presentation included headaches, seizures, confusion, visual disturbances, and imaging changes consistent with PRES a few days to several months after ustekinumab product initiation. A few cases reported latency of a year or longer. Patients recovered with supportive care following withdrawal of ustekinumab products. Monitor all patients treated with SELARSDI for signs and symptoms of PRES. If PRES is suspected, promptly administer appropriate treatment and discontinue SELARSDI. Immunizations Prior to initiating therapy with SELARSDI, patients should receive all age-appropriate immunizations as recommended by current immunization guidelines. Patients being treated with SELARSDI should not receive live vaccines. BCG vaccines should not be given during treatment or for one year prior to initiating or for one year following discontinuation of SELARSDI. Exercise caution when administering live vaccines to household contacts of SELARSDI patients, as shedding and subsequent transmission to SELARSDI patients may occur. Non-live vaccinations received during a course of SELARSDI may not elicit an immune response sufficient to prevent disease. Concomitant Therapies The safety of ustekinumab products, in combination with other biologic immunosuppressive agents or phototherapy has not been evaluated in clinical trials of psoriasis. Ultraviolet-induced skin cancers developed earlier and more frequently in mice. In psoriasis studies, the relevance of findings in mouse models for malignancy risk in humans is unknown. In psoriatic arthritis studies, concomitant methotrexate use did not appear to influence the safety or efficacy of ustekinumab. Noninfectious Pneumonia Cases of interstitial pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia have been reported during post-approval use of ustekinumab products. Clinical presentations included cough, dyspnea, and interstitial infiltrates following one to three doses. Serious outcomes have included respiratory failure and prolonged hospitalization. Patients improved with discontinuation of therapy and, in certain cases, administration of corticosteroids. If diagnosis is confirmed, discontinue SELARSDI and institute appropriate treatment. Allergen Immunotherapy Ustekinumab products have not been evaluated in patients who have undergone allergy immunotherapy. Ustekinumab products may decrease the protective effect of allergen immunotherapy (decrease tolerance) which may increase the risk of an allergic reaction to a dose of allergen immunotherapy. Therefore, caution should be exercised in patients receiving or who have received allergen immunotherapy, particularly for anaphylaxis. Most Common Adverse Reactions Most common adverse reactions for psoriasis (greater than or equal to 3%) are: nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and fatigue.

The approval marks Teva's commitment to expanding biosimilar availability and Alvotech's success in developing biosimilars.","Alvotech and Teva Announce U.S. FDA Approval of SELARSDI™ (ustekinumab-aekn), biosimilar to Stelara® (ustekinumab) Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags fda approval Rhea-AI Summary Alvotech and Teva Pharmaceuticals announce the U.S. FDA approval of SELARSDI, a biosimilar to Stelara, for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in adults and pediatric patients. SELARSDI is expected to be marketed in the U.S. in 2025, following a settlement agreement with Johnson & Johnson. The approval marks Teva's commitment to expanding biosimilar availability and Alvotech's success in developing biosimilars. Positive The approval of SELARSDI expands Teva's biosimilar portfolio and marks the second biosimilar approval for Alvotech in the U.S. SELARSDI is a biosimilar to Stelara, targeting immune-mediated diseases like psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. The strategic partnership between Alvotech and Teva enables the exclusive commercialization of SELARSDI in the U.S. The development of SELARSDI leveraged Alvotech's end-to-end manufacturing platform for biosimilars. The availability of a Stelara biosimilar is expected to create cost-saving opportunities in the healthcare system and provide additional treatment options for patients. SELARSDI approval was based on a comprehensive clinical development program, including studies demonstrating efficacy and safety compared to the reference product Stelara. Negative None. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The approval of SELARSDI (ustekinumab-aekn), a biosimilar to Stelara, represents a strategic expansion in the biosimilars market for Teva and Alvotech. With SELARSDI expected to enter the market in 2025, investors should monitor the potential effects on Teva's revenue streams. The introduction of a biosimilar could result in market share gains and provide a cost-competitive alternative to Stelara, which reported sales near $7 billion in 2023. However, uptake rates of biosimilars can vary depending on physician preferences, patient sentiment and insurance coverage dynamics.From a market perspective, SELARSDI's entry is timed post-settlement with Johnson & Johnson, which might affect its market penetration strategy. Investors should also consider the impact of such agreements on the competitive landscape, including potential pressures on pricing and market access. The projected cost savings for healthcare systems and patients alike might drive faster adoption, benefiting Teva's 'Pivot to Growth' strategy while potentially impacting Johnson & Johnson's market share and revenue from Stelara. Biopharmaceutical Research Analyst SELARSDI's approval is based on a totality of evidence including analytical, clinical and immunogenicity data, indicating comparable efficacy and safety to its reference, Stelara. As a biosimilar, SELARSDI does not require the same breadth of clinical trials as an original biologic, which can expedite its path to market and reduce developmental costs. This can be financially advantageous for Alvotech and Teva, potentially allowing for more competitive pricing.Understanding the pharmacokinetic profiles and manufacturing processes is essential for investors. SELARSDI's production using Sp2/0 cells and a continuous perfusion process, mirroring the original biologic's methodology, suggests a robust approach to biosimilar development that could shorten FDA review times for future products under their strategic partnership. The implications for stakeholders extend beyond this single product, hinting at Alvotech’s potential in delivering other biosimilars efficiently. 04/16/2024 - 05:30 PM SELARSDI is approved for both adult and pediatric indications and is the second biosimilar approved under the strategic partnership between Alvotech and Teva SELARSDI is expected to be marketed in the U.S. on or after February 21, 2025, following a settlement agreement with Johnson & Johnson, the manufacturer of StelaraSELARSDI was developed and is manufactured by Alvotech using murine cell (Sp2/0) and a continuous perfusion process, which are the same type of cells and process used for the production of Stelara REYKJAVIK, ICELAND & PARSIPPANY, NJ — Alvotech (NASDAQ: ALVO) and Teva Pharmaceuticals, a U.S. affiliate of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE and TASE: TEVA), today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved SELARSDI (ustekinumab-aekn) injection for subcutaneous use, as a biosimilar to Stelara®, for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and for active psoriatic arthritis in adults and pediatric patients 6 years and older. Under the strategic partnership between Teva and Alvotech, Teva is responsible for the exclusive commercialization of SELARSDI in the United States. “The approval of SELARSDI – which is our second biosimilar approval this year – underscores Teva’s commitment to expanding the availability, access and uptake of this important treatment option to patients in the U.S.,” said Thomas Rainey, Senior Vice President, U.S. Market Access at Teva. “The biosimilars market is growing, both globally and in the U.S., and biosimilars are a key component of delivering on Teva’s Pivot to Growth strategy. The partnership model that we’ve established enables us to leverage our commercial presence and experiences globally as we move to bring additional biosimilars to market.” Robert Wessman, Chairman and CEO of Alvotech, added, “We are delighted to announce our second biosimilar approval in the U.S., which is the thirty-eighth approved market for our biosimilar to Stelara globally. Bringing SELARSDI to market in the U.S. early next year presents a significant opportunity to improve patient access to a vital biologic in inflammatory disease and contribute to the reduction of inflationary pressure in healthcare costs. The development of SELARSDI leveraged our purpose-built end-to-end development and manufacturing platform for biosimilars. Being able to develop the biosimilar in the same cell type and continuous perfusion process as was used for the reference product, facilitated the development program’s success.” Ustekinumab is a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that selectively targets the p40 protein, a component common to both interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 cytokines, which play crucial roles in treating immune-mediated diseases like psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Alvotech developed and produces SELARSDI using Sp2/0 cells and a continuous perfusion process, which are the same type of host cell line and process used in the production of Stelara. Sales of the reference product Stelara in the U.S. were nearly $7 billion in 2023.1 The availability of a Stelara biosimilar will create opportunities for cost savings across the healthcare system and introduce additional treatment options for patients. In the U.S., plaque psoriasis is the most common form of psoriasis while psoriatic arthritis accounts for approximately six percent of all cases of juvenile arthritis.2,3 In June 2023, Alvotech and Teva announced that they had reached a settlement and license agreement with the manufacturer of the reference biologic, Johnson & Johnson, granting a license entry date for SELARSDI in the United States no later than February 21, 2025. In August 2020, Alvotech and Teva entered into a strategic partnership for the exclusive commercialization of five of Alvotech’s biosimilar product candidates, and in August 2023, the collaboration was extended to include two additional biosimilars and new presentations of two previously partnered products. Alvotech handles development and manufacturing, while Teva is responsible for the exclusive commercialization in the U.S., which leverages Teva’s experience and extensive sales and marketing infrastructure. SELARSDI is the second biosimilar approved under the strategic partnership: in February 2024, the FDA approved SIMLANDI®, the first high-concentration, citrate-free biosimilar to Humira that has been granted an interchangeability status by the FDA. The FDA approval of SELARSDI, referred to as AVT04 during development, was based on a totality of evidence, including analytical and clinical data. The clinical development program included data from: 1) Study AVT04-GL-301, a randomized, double blind, multicenter, 52-week study to demonstrate equivalent efficacy and to compare safety and immunogenicity between SELARSDI and the reference product Stelara in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis. The study was conducted in four countries in Europe and enrolled 581 patients. The primary efficacy endpoint was Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) percent improvement from Baseline to Week 12; 2) Study AVT04-GL-101, a Phase I, randomized, double-blind, single-dose, parallel-group, 3-arm study to compare the pharmacokinetic, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity profiles of SELARSDI, administered as a single 45mg/0.5mL subcutaneous injection with that of the US-licensed Stelara as well as EU-approved Stelara. The study was conducted in Australia and New Zealand and enrolled 294 healthy adult volunteers.

INDICATIONS FOR SELARSDI (ustekinumab-aekn) SELARSDI™ (ustekinumab-aekn) Injection, is a human interleukin-12 and -23 antagonist indicated for: the treatment of adults and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy.the treatment of adults and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with active psoriatic arthritis IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION SELARSDI™ (ustekinumab-aekn) injection is contraindicated in patients with clinically significant hypersensitivity to ustekinumab products or to any of the excipients in SELARSDI. Infections Ustekinumab products may increase the risk of infections and reactivation of latent infections. Serious bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal, and viral infections were observed in patients receiving ustekinumab products. Serious infections requiring hospitalization or otherwise clinically significant infections were reported. In patients with psoriasis, these included diverticulitis, cellulitis, pneumonia, appendicitis, cholecystitis, sepsis, osteomyelitis, viral infections, gastroenteritis, and urinary tract infections. In patients with psoriatic arthritis, this included cholecystitis. Treatment with SELARSDI should not be initiated in patients with a clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating use of SELARSDI in patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection occur while on treatment with SELARSDI and discontinue SELARSDI for serious or clinically significant infections until the infection resolves or is adequately treated. Theoretical Risk for Vulnerability to Particular Infections Individuals genetically deficient in IL-12/IL-23 are particularly vulnerable to disseminated infections from mycobacteria (including nontuberculous, environmental mycobacteria), salmonella(including non typhi strains), and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccinations. Serious infections and fatal outcomes have been reported in such patients. It is not known whether patients with pharmacologic blockade of IL-12/IL-23 from treatment with ustekinumab products may be susceptible to these types of infections. Appropriate diagnostic testing should be considered (e.g., tissue culture, stool culture) as dictated by clinical circumstances. Pre-Treatment Evaluation of Tuberculosis (TB) Evaluate patients for TB prior to initiating treatment with SELARSDI. Do not administer SELARSDI to patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB before administering SELARSDI. Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to initiation of SELARSDI in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Closely monitor patients receiving SELARSDI for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after treatment. Malignancies Ustekinumab products are immunosuppressants and may increase the risk of malignancy. Malignancies were reported among patients who received ustekinumab in clinical trials. The safety of ustekinumab products has not been evaluated in patients who have a history of malignancy or who have a known malignancy. There have been post-marketing reports of the rapid appearance of multiple cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas in patients receiving ustekinumab products who had pre-existing risk factors for developing non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). All patients receiving SELARSDI, especially those greater than 60 years of age or those with a history of Psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA )or prolonged immunosuppressant treatment, should be monitored for the appearance of NMSC. Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, have been reported with ustekinumab products. If an anaphylactic or other clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction occurs, institute appropriate therapy and discontinue SELARSDI. Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) Two cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), also known as Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS), were reported in clinical trials. Cases have also been reported in postmarketing experience in patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Clinical presentation included headaches, seizures, confusion, visual disturbances, and imaging changes consistent with PRES a few days to several months after ustekinumab product initiation. A few cases reported latency of a year or longer. Patients recovered with supportive care following withdrawal of ustekinumab products. Monitor all patients treated with SELARSDI for signs and symptoms of PRES. If PRES is suspected, promptly administer appropriate treatment and discontinue SELARSDI. Immunizations Prior to initiating therapy with SELARSDI, patients should receive all age-appropriate immunizations as recommended by current immunization guidelines. Patients being treated with SELARSDI should not receive live vaccines. BCG vaccines should not be given during treatment or for one year prior to initiating or for one year following discontinuation of SELARSDI. Exercise caution when administering live vaccines to household contacts of SELARSDI patients, as shedding and subsequent transmission to SELARSDI patients may occur. Non-live vaccinations received during a course of SELARSDI may not elicit an immune response sufficient to prevent disease. Concomitant Therapies The safety of ustekinumab products, in combination with other biologic immunosuppressive agents or phototherapy has not been evaluated in clinical trials of psoriasis. Ultraviolet-induced skin cancers developed earlier and more frequently in mice. In psoriasis studies, the relevance of findings in mouse models for malignancy risk in humans is unknown. In psoriatic arthritis studies, concomitant methotrexate use did not appear to influence the safety or efficacy of ustekinumab. Noninfectious Pneumonia Cases of interstitial pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia have been reported during post-approval use of ustekinumab products. Clinical presentations included cough, dyspnea, and interstitial infiltrates following one to three doses. Serious outcomes have included respiratory failure and prolonged hospitalization. Patients improved with discontinuation of therapy and, in certain cases, administration of corticosteroids. If diagnosis is confirmed, discontinue SELARSDI and institute appropriate treatment. Allergen Immunotherapy Ustekinumab products have not been evaluated in patients who have undergone allergy immunotherapy. Ustekinumab products may decrease the protective effect of allergen immunotherapy (decrease tolerance) which may increase the risk of an allergic reaction to a dose of allergen immunotherapy. Therefore, caution should be exercised in patients receiving or who have received allergen immunotherapy, particularly for anaphylaxis. Most Common Adverse Reactions Most common adverse reactions for psoriasis (greater than or equal to 3%) are: nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and fatigue.

(NYSE: SOR) (the “Fund”), approved maintaining the Fund’s regular monthly distribution rate for each of the next three months as follows: Regular Monthly Distributions: Month Rate per Common Share Record Date Payable Date June 2024 $0.2083 June 18, 2024 June 28, 2024 July 2024 $0.2083 July 16, 2024 July 31, 2024 August 2024 $0.2083 August 15, 2024 August 30, 2024 About Source Capital, Inc. Source Capital, Inc. is a closed-end investment company managed by First Pacific Advisors, LP. Its shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “SOR.” The investment objective of the Fund is to seek maximum total return for shareholders from both capital appreciation and investment income to the extent consistent with protection of invested capital. The Fund may invest in longer duration assets like dividend paying equities and illiquid assets like private loans in pursuit of its investment objective and is thus intended only for those investors with a long-term investment horizon (greater than or equal to ~5 years). You can obtain additional information by visiting the website at fpa.com, by email at crm@fpa.com, toll free by calling 1-800-982-4372, or by contacting the Fund in writing. Important Disclosures You should consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses carefully before you invest. Distributions may include ordinary income, net capital gains and/or returns of capital. Generally, a return of capital would occur when the amount distributed by the Fund includes a portion of (or is comprised entirely of) your investment in the Fund in addition to (or rather than) your pro-rata portion of the Fund’s net income or capital gains. The Fund’s distributions in any period may be more or less than the net return earned by the Fund on its investments, and therefore should not be used as a measure of performance or confused with “yield” or “income.” A return of capital is not taxable; rather it reduces a shareholder’s tax basis in his or her shares of the Fund. If the Fund estimates that a portion of its distribution may be comprised of amounts from sources other than net investment income, the Fund will notify shareholders of the estimated composition of such distribution through a separate written Section 19 notice. Such notices are provided for informational purposes only, and should not be used for tax reporting purposes. Final tax characteristics of all Fund distributions will be provided on Form 1099-DIV, which is mailed after the close of the calendar year. It is important to note that differences exist between the Fund’s daily internal accounting records and practices, the Fund’s financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and recordkeeping practices under income tax regulations. Please see the Fund’s most recent shareholder reports for more detailed tax information. The Fund’s distribution rate may be affected by numerous factors, including changes in realized and projected market returns, Fund performance, and other factors. There can be no assurance that a change in market conditions or other factors will not result in a change in the Fund’s distribution rate at a future time. As with any stock, the price of the Fund’s common shares will fluctuate with market conditions and other factors. Shares of closed-end management investment companies frequently trade at a price that is less than (a “discount”) or more than (a “premium”) their net asset value. If the Fund’s shares trade at a premium to net asset value, there is no assurance that any such premium will be sustained for any period of time and will not decrease, or that the shares will not trade at a discount to net asset value thereafter. The Fund’s New York Stock Exchange closing market price, net asset value per share, as well as other information, including updated portfolio statistics and performance as of the most recent quarter end are available by visiting the website at https://fpa.com/funds/overview/source-capital, by email at crm@fpa.com, toll free by calling 1-800-279-1241 (option 1), or by contacting the Fund in writing. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of the securities in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of any such state. In the event of a tender offer, there may be tax consequences for a stockholder. For example, a stockholder may owe capital gains taxes on any increase in the value of the shares over your original cost. Investments, including investments in closed-end funds, carry risks and investors may lose principal value. Capital markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. It is important to remember that there are risks inherent in any investment and there is no assurance that any investment or asset class will provide positive performance over time. Value style investing presents the risk that the holdings or securities may never reach our estimate of intrinsic value because the market fails to recognize what the portfolio management team considers the true business value or because the portfolio management team has misjudged those values. In addition, value style investing may fall out of favor and underperform growth or other style investing during given periods. Non-U.S. investing presents additional risks, such as the potential for adverse political, currency, economic, social or regulatory developments in a country, including lack of liquidity, excessive taxation, and differing legal and accounting standards. Non-U.S. securities, including American Depository Receipts (ADRs) and other depository receipts, are also subject to interest rate and currency exchange rate risks. Fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate, inflation and credit risks. Such investments may be secured, partially secured or unsecured and may be unrated, and whether or not rated, may have speculative characteristics. The market price of the Fund’s fixed income investments will change in response to changes in interest rates and other factors. Generally, when interest rates rise, the values of fixed income instruments fall, and vice versa. Certain fixed income instruments are subject to prepayment risk and/or default risk. Private placement securities are securities that are not registered under the federal securities laws, and are generally eligible for sale only to certain eligible investors. Private placements may be illiquid, and thus more difficult to sell, because there may be relatively few potential purchasers for such investments, and the sale of such investments may also be restricted under securities laws. The Fund may use leverage. While the use of leverage may help increase the distribution and return potential of the Fund, it also increases the volatility of the Fund’s net asset value (NAV), and potentially increases volatility of its distributions and market price. There are costs associated with the use of leverage, including ongoing dividend and/or interest expenses. There also may be expenses for issuing or administering leverage. Leverage changes the Fund’s capital structure through the issuance of preferred shares and/or debt, both of which are senior to the common shares in priority of claims. If short-term interest rates rise, the cost of leverage will increase and likely will reduce returns earned by the Fund’s common stockholders.

The Form 25 will also serve to deregister Panbela’s common stock under Section 12(b) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). As previously disclosed, on March 5, 2024, a Nasdaq hearings panel notified Panbela that it had determined to delist its common stock and trading of Panbela’s common stock on Nasdaq was suspended on March 7, 2024. The panel reached its decision because our company did not satisfy the minimum $2.5 million stockholders’ equity requirement in Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) and was unable to comply with any of the alternative requirements in Listing Rule 5550(b). Neither the filing of the Form 25 nor the official delisting of Panbela’s common shares from Nasdaq is expected to impact the eligibility of our common shares for quotation on the OTCQB. About Panbela’s PipelineThe pipeline consists of assets currently in clinical trials with an initial focus on familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), first-line metastatic pancreatic cancer, neoadjuvant pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer prevention and ovarian cancer. The combined development programs have a steady cadence of anticipated catalysts with programs ranging from pre-clinical to registration studies. Ivospemin (SBP-101)Ivospemin is a proprietary polyamine analogue designed to induce polyamine metabolic inhibition (PMI) by exploiting an observed high affinity of the compound for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and other tumors. It has shown signals of tumor growth inhibition in clinical studies of metastatic pancreatic cancer patients, demonstrating a median overall survival (OS) of 14.6 months and an objective response rate (ORR) of 48%, both exceeding what is typical for the standard of care of gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel suggesting potential complementary activity with the existing FDA-approved standard chemotherapy regimen. In data evaluated from clinical studies to date, ivospemin has not shown exacerbation of bone marrow suppression and peripheral neuropathy, which can be chemotherapy-related adverse events. Serious visual adverse events have been evaluated and patients with a history of retinopathy or at risk of retinal detachment will be excluded from future SBP-101 studies. The safety data and PMI profile observed in the previous Panbela-sponsored clinical trials provide support for continued evaluation of ivospemin in the ASPIRE trial. Flynpovi ™Flynpovi is a combination of CPP-1X (eflornithine) and sulindac with a dual mechanism inhibiting polyamine synthesis and increasing polyamine export and catabolism. In a Phase III clinical trial in patients with sporadic large bowel polyps, the combination prevented > 90% subsequent pre-cancerous sporadic adenomas versus placebo. Focusing on FAP patients with lower gastrointestinal tract anatomy in the recent Phase III trial comparing Flynpovi to single agent eflornithine and single agent sulindac, FAP patients with lower GI anatomy (patients with an intact colon, retained rectum or surgical pouch), showed statistically significant benefit compared to both single agents (p≤0.02) in delaying surgical events in the lower GI for up to four years. The safety profile for Flynpovi did not significantly differ from the single agents and supports the continued evaluation of Flynpovi for FAP. CPP-1XCPP-1X (eflornithine) is being developed as a single agent tablet or high dose powder sachet for several indications including prevention of gastric cancer, treatment of neuroblastoma and recent onset Type 1 diabetes. Preclinical studies as well as Phase I or Phase II investigator-initiated trials suggest that CPP-1X treatment may be well-tolerated and has potential activity. About PanbelaPanbela Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing disruptive therapeutics for patients with urgent unmet medical needs. Panbela’s lead assets are Ivospemin (SBP-101) and Flynpovi. Further information can be found at www.panbela.com .

Positive Positive results from the Phase 2a COURSE trial for TEZSPIRE® in COPD Reduction in annualized rate of moderate or severe exacerbations by 17% Encouraging data across a broad range of eosinophil levels More significant reductions in patients with baseline eosinophil count ≥150 cells/μL Optimistic outlook for the future development of tezepelumab in COPD Negative None. 04/16/2024 - 05:26 PM Planning Underway for Phase 3 Development of Tezepelumab in COPD THOUSAND OAKS, Calif., April 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) today provided an update regarding the results of the Phase 2a COURSE trial for TEZSPIRE® (tezepelumab-ekko) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which were accepted for presentation in the Clinical Trials Symposium at The American Thoracic Society (ATS) 2024 International Conference on Monday, May 20, from 9:15-11:15 a.m. PDT. We are encouraged by the results of the COURSE Phase 2a proof-of-concept trial, which investigated tezepelumab in moderate to very severe COPD patients, across a broad range of eosinophil levels, irrespective of inflammatory drivers, emphysema, chronic bronchitis and smoking status. This study did not exclude any patients based on their baseline eosinophil count (BEC) and intentionally enrolled patients with a broad range of BECs. Overall, tezepelumab numerically reduced the annualized rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations versus placebo by 17% (90% CI: −6, 36; p=0.1042). Of note, more reductions were observed in a prespecified subgroup of patients with BEC ≥150 cells/μL (37% [95% CI: 7, 57]). The trend in reduction was greater in a small number of subjects with BEC ≥300 cells/µL. ""We are excited by these data and optimistic about the potential tezepelumab has for patients with COPD, a condition that continues to have a significant unmet medical need,"" said James Bradner, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development and chief scientific officer at Amgen. We look forward to presenting the full data set at the congress and based on these findings, we are actively planning for the Phase 3 development of tezepelumab in COPD. TEZSPIRE is a registered trademark of Amgen Inc. and AstraZeneca. TEZSPIRE® (tezepelumab-ekko) U.S. IndicationTEZSPIRE is indicated for the add-on maintenance treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with severe asthma. TEZSPIRE is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus. TEZSPIRE® (tezepelumab-ekko) Important Safety Information CONTRAINDICATIONS Known hypersensitivity to tezepelumab-ekko or excipients. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity ReactionsHypersensitivity reactions were observed in the clinical trials (e.g., rash and allergic conjunctivitis) following the administration of TEZSPIRE. Postmarketing cases of anaphylaxis have been reported. These reactions can occur within hours of administration, but in some instances have a delayed onset (i.e., days). In the event of a hypersensitivity reaction, consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient to determine whether to continue or discontinue treatment with TEZSPIRE. Acute Asthma Symptoms or Deteriorating DiseaseTEZSPIRE should not be used to treat acute asthma symptoms, acute exacerbations, acute bronchospasm, or status asthmaticus. Abrupt Reduction of Corticosteroid DosageDo not discontinue systemic or inhaled corticosteroids abruptly upon initiation of therapy with TEZSPIRE. Reductions in corticosteroid dose, if appropriate, should be gradual and performed under the direct supervision of a physician. Reduction in corticosteroid dose may be associated with systemic withdrawal symptoms and/or unmask conditions previously suppressed by systemic corticosteroid therapy. Parasitic (Helminth) InfectionIt is unknown if TEZSPIRE will influence a patient's response against helminth infections. Treat patients with pre-existing helminth infections before initiating therapy with TEZSPIRE. If patients become infected while receiving TEZSPIRE and do not respond to anti-helminth treatment, discontinue TEZSPIRE until infection resolves. Live Attenuated VaccinesThe concomitant use of TEZSPIRE and live attenuated vaccines has not been evaluated. The use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided in patients receiving TEZSPIRE. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥3%) are pharyngitis, arthralgia, and back pain. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS There are no available data on TEZSPIRE use in pregnant women to evaluate for any drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Placental transfer of monoclonal antibodies such as tezepelumab-ekko is greater during the third trimester of pregnancy; therefore, potential effects on a fetus are likely to be greater during the third trimester of pregnancy.

No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market. Any scientific information discussed in this release relating to new indications for Amgen's products is preliminary and investigative and is not part of the labeling approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the products.

Financial Analyst The offering of $700 million in senior notes by Johnson Controls represents a strategic financial maneuver aimed at strengthening the company's balance sheet. By earmarking the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which include refinancing existing debt and potentially funding share repurchases or dividend payments, the company is signaling a proactive approach to capital management. This reallocation of capital could improve financial ratios, such as the debt-to-equity ratio, implying a potential reduction in financial risk. For investors, a key point of interest would be the interest rate affixed to the notes, as it impacts the cost of capital. The rate comparison with industry benchmarks could provide an insight into the market's perception of Johnson Controls' creditworthiness. Additionally, the involvement of multiple prestigious financial institutions as book-runners and co-managers may instill confidence regarding the placement success of the notes. Market Research Analyst Investors might look at Johnson Controls' move to issue $700 million in senior notes through the lens of market trends and competitive positioning. The decision to prioritize debt repayment and potentially finance share buybacks or dividends can be seen as a response to the investor’s appetite for companies that are actively optimizing their capital structure for shareholder returns. In the context of the industry, where smart and sustainable buildings are gaining traction, such capital reallocations can also fund strategic acquisitions to bolster the company's technological edge or expand its market share.

The company expects significant gold production growth in 2024, with AISC slightly elevated due to waste stripping. Preliminary Q1 results show 30,386 gold ounces produced. Abore M&I mineral resources increased by 181,000 ounces. The company had $130.8 million in cash and no debt as of March 31, 2024. Positive Significant increase in Abore M&I mineral resources by 181,000 ounces (38%) due to improved grade and tonnage. 2024 gold production expected to double compared to 2023, with AISC between $1,600/oz to $1,750/oz. Preliminary Q1 2024 results show 30,386 gold ounces produced, in-line with expectations. Company had $130.8 million in unaudited cash and cash equivalents with no debt as of March 31, 2024. Exploration program in 2024 planned at $15 million, split between generative and near-mine activities. Growth capital in 2024 expected to be approximately $20 million for plant upgrades and site establishment costs. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in Abore Measured and Indicated (M&I) Mineral Resources represents a notable enhancement to Galiano Gold's asset base, potentially extending the mine's life and improving the company's valuation. While significant, one must consider the elevated All-In Sustaining Cost (AISC) forecast for 2024 against current gold price trends to fully understand the financial implications. A comprehensive analysis of the projected capital expenditures – both sustaining and growth-oriented – alongside the operational cost guidance, suggests a strategic investment in long-term production capacity. However, investors should monitor gold market fluctuations, as the AISC proximity to current gold prices could compress margins should gold prices decline. Mining Analyst The 38% increase in Galiano's Abore M&I Mineral Resources is reflective of successful exploration activities, particularly the grade improvement from 1.16 grams per tonne (g/t) to 1.31 g/t, as gold grade is a critical component in evaluating mining profitability and operational efficiency. The anticipated move from stockpile milling to higher-grade ore processing in Q2 2024 could result in a positive shift in production costs and output. Moreover, the company's plan to update the Mineral Reserve Estimate and Life of Mine plan by Q4 2024 may further solidify the reserve base, enhancing investor confidence in the company's growth trajectory and operational stability. Market Research Analyst The no debt position, coupled with a strong cash balance of $130.8 million, positions Galiano Gold favorably in terms of financial health. Market sentiment towards the mining sector often hinges on a company's ability to manage costs while expanding resources. Galiano's preliminary operational results and updated mineral resources, when viewed in context with industry benchmarks and gold market dynamics, could signal a positive outlook for the company. However, retail investors should consider broader market trends, geopolitical factors influencing gold prices and operational execution risks when evaluating Galiano's future performance. 04/16/2024 - 05:00 PM (all dollars in U.S. dollars) VANCOUVER, BC, April 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Galiano Gold Inc. (""Galiano"" or the ""Company"") (TSX, NYSE American: GAU) is pleased to provide 2024 operating and cost guidance, preliminary first quarter operational results and an update on the improved Abore Mineral Resource at the Company's Asanko Gold Mine (the ""AGM""), located in Ghana, West Africa. 2024 Full Year Guidance The AGM is expected to produce between 140,000 to 160,000 ounces at forecast All-In Sustaining Cost (""AISC"")1 of between $1,600/oz to $1,750/oz. With the AGM now owned 90% by Galiano, production is expected to significantly exceed that of 2023, more than doubling the Company's attributable gold production. AISC1 is anticipated to be slightly elevated in 2024 primarily due to the waste stripping to access consistent ore feed at Abore, which will benefit future years production. Sustaining capital, exclusive of capitalized waste stripping, is expected to be approximately $10 million in 2024. Growth capital in 2024 is expected to be approximately $20 million and primarily includes plant upgrades (additional Carbon-In-Leach tanks, a secondary crusher and associated circuit upgrades) and site establishment costs. The exploration program in 2024 is expected to be in line with previous years at $15 million. The spend is planned to be equally split between generative and near-mine exploration activities. Preliminary Q1 2024 Operating Results For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the AGM produced 30,386 gold ounces, in-line with the Company's expectations, as the mill feed was sourced from existing stockpiles, while Abore pre-stripping continued. The Company expects to be processing higher grade ore from the Abore pit by the end of the second quarter of 2024. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had $130.8 million in unaudited cash and cash equivalents and no debt. These balances include the financial results of the AGM, which were consolidated by the Company effective March 4, 2024, upon closing of the transaction with Gold Fields Limited. __________________________ 1 Refer to Non-IFRS Performance Measures Preliminary Q1 2024 Operational Results2 Q1 2024 Gold produced (oz) 30,386 Gold sold (oz) 31,840 Average realized gold price ($/oz) 2,056 2024 First Quarter Financial Results Announcement The Company will release its condensed consolidated interim financial statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 after market close on May 2, 2024. 38% Increase to Abore Measured and Indicated (""M&I"") Mineral Resource Estimate Following successful 2023 and early 2024 infill drilling programs at Abore, a notable increase to the Abore Mineral Resource Estimate (""MRE"") was completed effective March 31, 2024. This new estimate includes assay results from an additional 119 exploration drill holes, totaling 27,039 metres, completed since the December 31, 2022 MRE, as described in the 2023 Technical Report3. The net impact of the additional drillingexceeded conversion of the Inferred Mineral Resources to Indicated Mineral Resources. The Abore M&I Mineral Resources increased by 181,000 ounces (38%), as a result of improved grade (13%) and tonnage (22%) from 1.16 grams per tonne (""g/t"") to 1.31 g/t, and from 12.8 million tonnes to 15.6 million tonnes, respectively. Both estimates were based on an $1,800 per ounce gold price and an equivalent cut-off grade of 0.45 g/t Au. These results, in addition to other infill and step out drilling results, will be used to update a consolidated AGM Mineral Reserve Estimate and an optimized Life of Mine plan in the fourth quarter of 2024. ""With the consolidation of the AGM completed during the first quarter, I am pleased to report on the work the team has been focused on since completing this transformational milestone,"" stated Matt Badylak, Galiano's President & Chief Executive Officer. ""The significant increase in M&I Resources at Abore highlights the deposit's importance to the AGM life of mine and work is underway to update the Mineral Reserve Estimate. This estimate is expected to grow on the back of the expanded MRE and provide additional mill feed optionality going forward. Across the AGM, we strongly believe in the long-term potential for growth through successful infill and step out drilling at all of our existing deposits.

(INVO) reports significant revenue growth in Q4 2023 and FY 2023, with a focus on expanding access to advanced fertility treatments. The company's revenue increased by 397% in Q4 and 267% in FY 2023, driven by clinic revenue growth and strategic acquisitions. Despite a net loss, adjusted EBITDA improved, reflecting a positive outlook for future profitability. Positive Significant revenue growth of 397% in Q4 2023 and 267% in FY 2023 compared to the previous year. Clinic revenue increased by 519% in Q4 and 366% in FY 2023, driven by INVO Centers and strategic acquisitions. Total operating expenses decreased by $1.6 million in FY 2023, contributing to improved financial performance. Net loss decreased from $(10.9) million to $(8.0) million in FY 2023. Adjusted EBITDA improved from $(8.4) million to $(5.1) million in FY 2023, indicating progress towards profitability. CEO Steve Shum highlights the company's focus on revenue growth and profitability, with a goal to achieve break-even or profitability in 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst INVO Bioscience's report reveals a striking 397% increase in quarterly revenue and a 267% annual revenue growth. This growth trajectory is primarily due to clinic revenue surges, reflective of successful expansion strategies. However, it's noteworthy that despite revenue increases, the company operates at a loss with a net loss of $(2.0) million for the quarter and $(8.0) million annually. Investors should consider the company's ability to maintain growth rates in clinic revenues and whether they can effectively control operating expenses, which although decreased, may still hinder profitability. The Adjusted EBITDA improvements are encouraging signs of operational optimization, yet achieving break-even in 2024 remains an ambitious target given the historical loss figures. Healthcare Industry Analyst From an industry standpoint, INVO's focus on fertility services via the INVOcell® device aligns with the increasing demand for fertility treatments. The revenue uptick from the clinics suggests strong market reception and operational growth. However, this sector is known for high upfront costs and long payback periods. It is important to monitor how INVO's strategy to acquire and establish clinics continues to affect their financials, especially as the sector grapples with regulatory changes and competitive pressures. The planned merger with NAYA Biosciences represents a strategic move to consolidate market positioning but also adds a layer of financial and execution risk that stakeholders should watch closely. M&A Analyst Analyzing the merger aspect, the all-stock transaction with NAYA Biosciences is pivotal. The deal's terms and the strategic fit should be scrutinized to understand the dilution effects on current shareholders and the synergistic potential of NAYA's integration. Mergers can provide economies of scale and access to new technologies or markets – in this case, potentially strengthening INVO's positioning in the fertility industry. On the flip side, merging operations can lead to integration challenges and additional costs in the short term. With INVO already operating at a loss, managing this merger without impacting the company's trajectory towards profitability will be a delicate balance. 04/16/2024 - 04:59 PM SARASOTA, Fla., April 16, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- INVO Bioscience, Inc. (Nasdaq: INVO) (""INVO"" or the ""Company""), a healthcare services fertility company focused on expanding access to advanced treatment worldwide through the establishment and acquisition of fertility clinics, and with the intravaginal culture (""IVC"") procedure enabled by its INVOcell® medical device, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and provided a business update. Q4 2023 Financial Highlights (all metrics compared to Q4 2022 unless otherwise noted) Revenue was $1,381,754, an increase of 397% compared to $278,142.Clinic revenue increased 519% to $1,362,938, compared to $220,253.

Included in the Q4 2023 operating expenses were approximately $250,000 pertaining to the definitive merger agreement with NAYA Biosciences, Inc. (""NAYA"") to acquire NAYA in an all-stock transaction.Net loss was $(2.0) million compared to $(2.8) million.Adjusted EBITDA (see table included) was $(1.2) million, including transaction costs related to the potential merger, compared to $(2.2) million in the prior year. 2023 Financial Highlights (all metrics compared to 2022 unless otherwise noted) Revenue was $3,020,575, an increase of 267% compared to $822,196.Clinic revenue increased 366% to $2,862,574, compared to $614,854. All reported clinic revenue is derived from the Company's INVO Center in Atlanta, Georgia, and fertility clinic in Madison, Wisconsin which are consolidated in the Company's financial statements.Revenue from all clinics, inclusive of both those accounted for as consolidated and under the equity method, was $4,346,933, an increase of 158% compared to $1,686,705.Total operating expenses were $9.8 million, a $1.6 million decrease compared to $11.4 million.Net loss was $(8.0) million compared to $(10.9) million.Adjusted EBITDA (see table included) was $(5.1) compared to $(8.4) million. Management Commentary ""We continue to execute on our plan to capture a greater share of the total fertility cycle revenue and profit through the transformation of INVO into an innovative healthcare services company, driven by our existing INVO Centers and recently acquired Wisconsin-based IVF Center,” commented Steve Shum, CEO of INVO. “During 2023, our revenue increased to more than $3.0 million, a 267% increase from the previous year, and included approximately 4.5 months of revenue from our Wisconsin revenue. In total, revenue from all clinics, inclusive of both those accounted for as consolidated and under the equity method, was more than $4.3 million. The growth in revenue has also had a positive impact on our adjusted EBITDA, as we work towards our stated goal of reaching break-even or profitability within our current operations (excluding the potential merger with NAYA) in 2024. With a full year of revenue from our Wisconsin clinic and further expected growth overall, we believe we remain on track to reach that objective. We are excited about our position in the fertility market, and the opportunity we have to make advanced fertility care more accessible and inclusive to people around the world.” Definitive Merger Agreement On October 23, 2023, INVO and NAYA, a company dedicated to increasing patient access to breakthrough treatments in oncology and regenerative medicine, jointly announced that they had entered into a definitive merger agreement (the ""Merger"") for INVO to acquire NAYA Biosciences in an all-stock transaction. Under the terms of the agreement, NAYA Biosciences' shareholders will receive 7.3333 shares of INVO for each share of NAYA Biosciences at closing, for a total of approximately 18,150,000 shares of INVO. Following the closing of the Merger, the combined company is expected to operate under the name ""NAYA Biosciences."" As described in greater detail in the Company's SEC filings and press releases, the Merger remains subject to certain closing conditions including shareholder approval, an interim private financing in INVO at a premium of INVO's market price at time of financing (""Interim PIPE"") of at least $2 million plus an amount to fund the Company’s fertility operations for twelve months and address the Company’s outstanding payables, and a private offering by the combined company at a target price of $5.00 per common share of INVO. To date, NAYA has provided approximately $805,000 in financing. “INVO and NAYA remain committed to completing the merger between our two companies, creating a company uniquely positioned in both the fertility and oncology space,” commented Shum. ""With the 10-K now on file, we plan to update our Proxy S-4 and schedule the stockholder meeting as soon as possible pending completion of the various closing conditions outlined in the agreement.” Financial Tables Included in this press release is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA. All additional financial tables are included in the Company’s 10-K, which can be found on the Company’s website at https://www.invobioscience.com/sec-filings/ or at https://www.sec.gov/. Use of Non-GAAP Measure Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. This measure is not intended to be a substitute for those financial measures reported in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA has been included because management believes that, when considered together with the GAAP figures, it provides meaningful information related to our operating performance and liquidity and can enhance an overall understanding of financial results and trends. Adjusted EBITDA may be calculated by us differently than other companies that disclose measures with the same or similar terms. See our attached financials for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the nearest GAAP measure. About INVO Bioscience We are a healthcare services fertility company dedicated to expanding the assisted reproductive technology (""ART"") marketplace by making fertility care accessible and inclusive to people around the world. Our commercialization strategy is focused on the opening of dedicated ""INVO Centers"" offering the INVOcell® and IVC procedure (with three centers in North America now operational), the acquisition of US-based, profitable in vitro fertilization (""IVF"") clinics and the sale and distribution of our technology solution into existing fertility clinics. Our proprietary technology, INVOcell®, is a revolutionary medical device that allows fertilization and early embryo development to take place in vivo within the woman's body. This treatment solution is the world's first intravaginal culture technique for the incubation of oocytes and sperm during fertilization and early embryo development. This technique, designated as ""IVC"", provides patients a more natural, intimate, and more affordable experience in comparison to other ART treatments. We believe the IVC procedure can deliver comparable results at a fraction of the cost of traditional IVF and is a significantly more effective treatment than intrauterine insemination (""IUI"").

Shareholders of record as of March 28, 2024, will be entitled to vote at the meeting. In connection with the definitive proxy filing, the Company has mailed a letter to Genco shareholders recommending they vote for Genco’s seven highly qualified directors on the WHITE proxy card – James G. Dolphin, Paramita Das, Kathleen C. Haines, Basil G. Mavroleon, Karin Y. Orsel, Arthur L. Regan and John C. Wobensmith. The Company also launched VoteForGenco.com, which provides additional information and resources to shareholders about Genco’s value creation strategy, George Economou’s record of self-dealing and history of value destruction and resources to help shareholders vote at the 2024 Annual Meeting. Highlights from the letter include: Genco is successfully executing on its Comprehensive Value Strategy to deliver compelling quarterly dividends for shareholders, reduce our debt and invest in growth opportunities to drive value through drybulk cycles.Genco’s highly qualified, active and engaged director nominees bring vast experience and expertise in shipping, fleet management, commercial and technical management, drybulk commodities, capital allocation management, financial reporting and M&A.Economou is a competitor seeking access to Genco’s Board room. Economou has a distinct track record of self-dealing to the detriment of other investors and a history of poor corporate governance practices.Economou’s nominee lacks relevant experience and has overseen significant value destruction at companies on which he has served on the board. He has been a professional pawn to activists with shady track records throughout his career and we believe he has demonstrated no ability to exercise independence. The Genco Board unanimously concluded that he would not be additive to our already strong, focused and experienced Board.The proposals Economou has made to the Genco Board have been self-serving. They have been thoroughly assessed and would double Genco’s net debt and impair our future ability to pay dividends with no discernable long-term benefit to all of our shareholders. The full text of the letter follows: April 16, 2024 Dear Fellow Shareholders, We are reaching out because we want your vote “FOR"" Genco’s director nominees at the upcoming Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The Genco Board and management team have established a record of leadership across our industry based on our performance and our corporate governance. Through our Comprehensive Value Strategy, we have distributed sizeable dividends to shareholders, significantly reduced our debt and grown and modernized our fleet. At the same time, we have taken important steps to uniquely position Genco to drive returns through volatile drybulk shipping market cycles. George Economou has recently taken an approximately 5% ownership position in the Company and is pursuing the nomination of his hand-picked nominee for election to the Company’s Board. Economou has also taken similar stakes in other companies in the industry. He is a competitor seeking access to the Company’s Board room. He is known throughout the industry and investment community for his history of poor governance practices and brings with him a distinct track record of self-dealing and shareholder value destruction. At Genco, he is pursuing an agenda based on a share repurchase plan and a premium self-tender offer that would double our net leverage and limit our ability to pay future dividends. Our Board and management team thoroughly reviewed both plans and determined they are self-interested, short-sighted and not in the best interest of Genco and all its shareholders. Every vote counts – vote “FOR” Genco’s nominees. By voting “FOR” each of Genco’s seven nominees and voting “AGAINST” Economou’s nominee and his shareholder proposal you can enable us to continue executing on our Comprehensive Value Strategy so you can realize the upside potential of your Genco investment. Learn more about our Comprehensive Value Strategy and how to vote at www.VoteForGenco.com. Executing a Clear Strategy to Create Value for ALL Genco Shareholders Through Market Cycles We are executing on the Comprehensive Value Strategy that we introduced to investors in 2021 to position Genco to drive value through drybulk cycles. The strategy’s key pillars include paying compelling quarterly dividends, deleveraging to reduce the Company’s financial risks and investing in growth opportunities. By focusing on a low leverage, high dividend payout model, we believe we have the most flexibility and optionality to pursue accretive growth opportunities while maintaining significant returns to shareholders through volatile market cycles. That said, our Board and management team regularly evaluate our capital allocation strategy and will continue to do so going forward for the benefit of the Company and all shareholders. We are making clear progress on our strategic priorities and are building a foundation for continued growth: Paying 18 consecutive quarterly dividends since 2019, the longest stretch in our drybulk peer group. Over this period, the Company has paid dividends of $5.155 per share, or approximately 25% of the current share price as of April 12, 2024;Lowering our debt by 55% since 2021 and reduced our cash flow breakeven rate to the lowest in the peer group; andInvesting in our fleet to drive growth and earnings power. We have invested $520 million over the last five years in fleet expansion and modernization, adding 17 high specification, fuel efficient vessels to our fleet. Through targeted ship purchases and investments in our vessels, we are modernizing our fleet and increasing our earnings capacity, while reducing costs and improving fuel efficiency. Looking ahead, we have the resources to continue these efforts, having recently closed on a $500 million revolving credit facility and by maintaining significant access to capital. As a result, we are delivering strong results and outperforming our peers: Genco’s TSR (total shareholder return) as of the closing price on April 12, 2024, for the past 1-, 3- and 5-year periods, are 37.7%, 146.9% and 237.6%, respectively, significantly higher than the median TSR of our proxy statement shipping performance peers which were 16.4%, 134.4% and 148.3% for the past 1-, 3- and 5-year periods, respectively, and also significantly higher than the TSR of the S&P 500 which were 27.2%, 30.1% and 91.6% for the past 1-, 3- and 5-year periods, respectively.i Building on Our Industry-Leading Corporate Governance Practices We are proud of Genco’s leadership in transparency, governance and sustainability, representing strong capital stewardship. Our well-planned and well-executed corporate governance and sustainability initiatives have enabled us to be #1, out of 64 public shipping companies, in the annual Webber Research ESG Scorecard three years in a row.ii Genco’s directors are highly qualified, active and engaged business leaders, all of whom bring the right balance of skills and experience in areas relevant to our business, including shipping, fleet management, commercial and technical management, drybulk commodities, capital allocation management, financial reporting and M&A. Our directors regularly engage with our shareholders and are open-minded with respect to value-creation opportunities. We remain committed to maintaining our strong corporate governance and are taking actions that we believe will create the most value and are in the best interest of our shareholders. Moreover, we are always looking for further improvement. Based on our Board’s continuous review of our practices and our shareholder engagement, we have taken actions to make our governance even stronger. Our Board and management team will continue to engage with shareholders on important matters like these, as we further seek to uphold best-in-class standards when it comes to governance and sustainability. VOTE “FOR” OUR HIGHLY QUALIFIED NOMINEES James G.

Mavroleon 46 years of shipping industry experience, serving as a Managing Director at a comprehensive sale and purchase, newbuilding, marine projects and ship finance brokerage Karin Y. Orsel Shipping executive and entrepreneur with over 33 years of experience in the industry Arthur L. Regan 30-plus years of shipping experience in executive roles and managing and investing across the industry John C. Wobensmith Genco’s CEO, who brings more than 30 years of shipping industry experience and expertise in every aspect of the business including capital allocation, M&A, commercial, technical and operations George Economou Has a Record of Self-Dealing to the Detriment of Other Investors Genco shareholders should be particularly concerned when Economou claims to be concerned about capital allocation. His history is capital allocation mixed with conflicts of interest, self-dealing and shareholder value destruction for personal gain. This is in stark contrast to the Genco Board, which prioritizes capital allocation around driving returns for ALL shareholders. We believe that Economou’s actions at DryShips, his last public company, are indicative of how he has conducted business throughout his career and serve as a warning to Genco shareholders. These actions were characterized by: Abrupt and perplexing deviations of corporate strategy;High financial leverage at peak market cycles;A litany of related-party transactions;Self-dealing and poor corporate governance. “The interests of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer may be different from your interests,” DryShips stated in their public disclosures, which was highly evident in the measures taken by the company.iii Through a series of steps, Economou took his ownership stake in DryShips from 0.01% in March 2017 to 83% of the stock less than two years later, before taking DryShips private, destroying other shareholders’ value in the process.iv These steps included: Conducting a series of large-scale highly dilutive equity offerings in 2016 and 2017 that resulted in a complete washout of shareholder value.vEntering a series of related party transactions that gave control of DryShips to Economou without other shareholders receiving any control premium.viBuying out the remaining 17% in 2019, taking DryShips private, but at a significant discount to net asset value.vii It is no surprise with these actions that DryShips was ranked last on the Webber Research ESG Scorecard for three years, displaying poor corporate governance. Beyond DryShips, Economou’s record of dubious behavior and judgment has continued on a global scale. Following the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Economou’s TMS Tankers continued transporting Russian crude, making it the second largest carrier of Russian oil, a distinction that landed Economou’s company on the Ukrainian government’s list of “international sponsors of war”. We Encourage You to Vote “AGAINST” Economou’s Self-Dealing Agendaand His Director Candidate The attempts by our Board and management team to engage constructively with Economou demonstrated to us that he has an agenda and intends to treat Genco like his other investments: Setting the record straight on our engagement: Members of our Board and management team sought to engage constructively with Economou since his investment became public. This includes numerous communications promptly responding to Economou and his advisors and offering to meet in-person to thoroughly discuss his views. Economou’s self-serving and short-sighted share repurchase demands: Over the course of these interactions, Economou has pushed the Company to sell vessels and pursue large share repurchases in amounts exceeding Genco’s cash on hand. Our Board and management team, together with its financial advisors, thoroughly reviewed his informal request of a share repurchase. The analysis included a comprehensive review of the last eight years of buybacks in the shipping industry with 52 buyback programs and 133 buyback executions separately analyzed, which showed buybacks overall did not improve share performance versus peers and in many cases hurt relative performance. The analysis showed that Economou’s repurchase ideas would place the Company in a less advantageous position and potentially destroy value as they would:• Meaningfully increase financial leverage;• Reduce market capitalization and trading float;• Reduce our available liquidity for opportunistic fleet growth;• Increase our cash flow breakeven rate;• Impact our ability to pay dividends; and• Diminish real earnings in this strong current market.The Board therefore determined that pursuing Economou’s share repurchase was not in the best interest of shareholders.Economou flip-flops and demands Genco launch a premium self-tender in which he would likely be a seller: When presented with the analysis on March 26, 2024, Economou agreed that ideas about share repurchases and selling vessels would not create value in the present market. As part of that conversation, Economou indicated he would exit his position if the shares reached a certain level (we note that these details of this conversation were conspicuously omitted from GK Investor’s proxy materials). Later that day, he insisted Genco commence a tender offer for $100 million of its own shares at a significant premium to the trading price. The Board reviewed the idea with its external financial advisors and determined this type of premium repurchase is not in the best interest of the Company or its shareholders, as it would require an increase in Genco’s leverage, decrease our earnings potential, impact our ability to pay out future dividends, reduce the Company’s market cap and impact trading liquidity. The analysis also showed that there are better uses of Genco’s cash, such as potential vessel purchases, that the Company believes can create more value for shareholders than a self-tender.Adding Economou’s nominee to the Genco Board is not in the best interest of Genco shareholders: Economou originally nominated two directors for election to the Board to further his influence on the Company: Randee Day and Robert Pons. He later withdrew Day’s nomination without giving a reason for doing so in his preliminary proxy materials.Pons has been a professional pawn to activists with shady track records throughout his career and we believe he has demonstrated no ability to exercise independence. He has served as a director nominee on behalf of the family of Gary Singer, a convicted felon permanently barred by the SEC from acting as an officer or director of a public company, as well as on four other dissident slates proposed by activist shareholders, including Murchinson Ltd., a Canadian activist fund that settled charges of violations of short sale rules with the SEC in 2021 and whose owner, Marc Bistricer, was the subject of enforcement action by the Ontario Securities Commission.viii As a director, he’s overseen self-dealing transactions that have benefited his activist sponsors, including selling assets to Singer-controlled companies and entering into management agreements with the Singers.ix Given Economou’s record, we believe Genco shareholders should be concerned with whom he is truly loyal. He’s also overseen significant value destruction at companies on which he’s served on the board. Most of the companies on which has served as a director have either declined in value during his tenure or underperformed the S&P 500.Importantly, Pons has no experience in shipping, commodities, cyclical businesses or anything relevant to Genco’s business. During his interview with the Board’s Nomination and Governance Committee he touted his general experience in board and management positions, but he had no general or specific ideas for the Company. The Genco Board unanimously concluded that he would not be additive to our already strong, focused and experienced Board.Pons’ lack of relevant experience and record of value destruction stands in stark contrast to that of Jim Dolphin, Genco’s Chairman that Economou is targeting as part of his proxy fight. Jim Dolphin has played a key role in developing and refining the Company’s Comprehensive Value Strategy as a member of the Board. He brings a strong understanding of cyclical businesses and rigorous reviews of capital spending given his experience in shipping and the oil and gas industries. Over his career he has provided advice on transportation strategy and capital allocation to companies such as the resource giant BHP, the oil major BP, the Union Pacific Railroad and the Panama Canal Commission. He was instrumental in creating Oceania Cruises and as a director, he helped grow the business which was eventually sold to Apollo Management for $850 million. At OSG America he helped the company preserve value amidst the 2008 market downturn. Like the other directors on the Genco Board, he is open minded with respect to any and all opportunities for value creation, and he leads the Company’s shareholder engagement. Don’t be misled by Economou’s attacks on our company. We believe his intentions with Genco are no different than his actions at the many other places he has led or invested in during his career: to benefit himself first, without regard to potential harm to the Company or its other shareholders. Moreover, his director candidate is unfit for our Board. We urge you to discard any proxy materials you receive from Economou or his affiliates. The Choice Between the Genco Board and George Economou’s Nominee is Clear The Genco Board of Directors unanimously recommends that Genco shareholders vote “FOR” the re-election of each of Genco’s seven nominees currently serving on the Genco Board and “AGAINST” Economou's nominee and shareholder proposal on the WHITE proxy card. We appreciate the support of ALL Genco shareholders, as we continue to take concrete steps to deliver on our Comprehensive Value Strategy to drive long-term sustainable value.

Xcel closed a 5-year term, $5 million term loan during the fourth quarter of 2023. Negative None. Financial Analyst Reviewing Xcel Brands' full year and Q4 2023 financials, a pronounced decline in net revenue is notable. The 45% year-over-year revenue dip reflects strategic shifts including divestitures and exits from several business segments. However, these reductions appear to be offset by operational restructuring, which is evident from the improved Adjusted EBITDA figures. While net losses widened substantially, this seems partly due to the absence of a significant one-time gain seen in the previous year. The $14 million reduction in salaries and operating costs suggests aggressive cost control which, coupled with new licensing agreements, could signal steps towards stabilization.The long-term viability of the new business strategy, particularly the entry into video and social commerce, remains to be seen. This pivot is a double-edged sword; while it has potential in a growing e-commerce market, it also introduces new risks and uncertainties. Investors should weigh the potential of the Orme platform's impact on future revenue streams against the backdrop of the current high net loss figures. With a modest cash position and working capital, liquidity doesn't raise immediate red flags, but the company's ability to fund continuous transformation in a competitive landscape could be a concern. Market Analyst From a market perspective, Xcel Brands' pivot toward core brand management and social commerce could capitalize on trends favoring online and interactive shopping experiences. The company's focus on video commerce over TV could address changing consumer behaviors. However, the significant revenue decline possibly reflects market challenges, including the reduced demand for Xcel's traditional offerings or potential missteps in execution.The licensing agreements mentioned are critical for future growth, yet it's important for investors to consider the competitive nature of these agreements and whether Xcel can leverage them to create substantial value. Additionally, the launch of the Orme platform should be monitored for user adoption rates and revenue generation capabilities, which will be vital indicators of Xcel's ability to execute on its revised strategy. 04/16/2024 - 04:33 PM GAAP net loss of $6.8 million for the quarter, compared with GAAP net loss of $6.0 million in the prior year quarter.Adjusted EBITDA of ($1.2) million for the quarter, compared with Adjusted EBITDA of ($5.9) million for the prior year quarter, an improvement of $4.7 million.GAAP net loss of $21.1 million for the current year, compared with GAAP net loss of $4.0 million in the prior year, which included a $20.6 million gain on the sale of a majority interest in the Isaac Mizrahi brand.Adjusted EBITDA of ($5.7) million for the year, compared with Adjusted EBITDA of ($12.5) million for the prior year, an improvement of $6.8 million. NEW YORK, April 16, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Xcel Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ: XELB) (“Xcel” or the “Company”), a media and consumer products company with significant expertise in livestream shopping and social commerce, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Robert W. D'Loren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Xcel commented, “Throughout 2023, we focused on a restructuring plan that got us focused on our core brand management business. The plan is now complete, and the core business is back on track. We have entered into new licensing agreements with industry leaders in core product categories and reduced salaries and operating costs by $14 million. Also, we strengthened our balance sheet. Recently, we launched Orme, a video and social commerce marketplace with a technology partner that leverages our vast knowledge in video commerce over TV and their technology brilliance. I believe Orme has the potential to transform e-commerce as we know it today.” Mr. D’Loren continued, “we finished the year as expected and look forward to working with our new licensing partners to grow top line revenue and bottom-line results. Now more than ever, I am excited by the potential of the company.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $2.3 million, representing a decrease of approximately $1.8 million (-44%) from the fourth quarter of 2022. The year-over-year revenue decline in the fourth quarter of 2023 was driven by a $2.5 million decrease in net sales, attributable to the exit from the wholesale apparel, fine jewelry and Longaberger sales operations earlier this year as part of our restructuring plan, which was partly offset by an increase in licensing revenues. Net loss attributable to Xcel Brands for the quarter was approximately $6.8 million, or ($0.34) per share, compared with a net loss of $6.0 million, or ($0.30) per diluted share, for the prior year quarter. The operating loss for the current quarter was approximately $5.6 million, compared with $8.4 million, loss for the prior year quarter. After adjusting for certain cash and non-cash items, results on a non-GAAP basis were a net loss of approximately $4.7 million, or ($0.24) per share for the current quarter and a net loss of approximately $6.2 million, or ($0.32) per share, for the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA improved significantly on a year-over-year basis to negative $1.2 million for the current quarter as compared with negative $5.9 million for the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of the restructuring of our business and entry into the new long-term license agreements for our Halston, Judith Ripka, C Wonder and Longaberger brands. Full Year 2023 Financial Results Net revenue for the current year was $17.8 million, representing a decrease of approximately $8.0 million (45%) from the prior year. The year-over-year revenue decline from the prior year was driven by a $5.6 million decrease in licensing revenue, primarily attributable to the sale of a majority interest in the Isaac Mizrahi brand in May 2022 and a decrease of $2.4 million in net sales, attributable to the exit from the wholesale apparel, fine jewelry and Longaberger sales operations earlier this year as part of our restructuring plan. Net loss attributable to Xcel Brands for the current year was approximately $21.1 million, or ($1.07) per share, compared with a net loss of $4.0 million, or ($0.20) per diluted share, for the prior year, which included a $20.6 million gain on the sale of a majority interest in the Isaac Mizrahi brand. After adjusting for certain cash and non-cash items, results on a non-GAAP basis were a net loss of approximately $12.2 million, or $(0.62) per share for the current year, compared with a net loss of approximately $15.0 million, or $(0.77) per share, for the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $5.7 million for the current year, as compared with negative $12.5 million for the prior year, an improvement of $6.8 million or approximately 54%. Balance Sheet The Company's balance sheet at December 31, 2023, reflected stockholders' equity of approximately $48 million, cash and cash equivalents of approximately $3.0 million, and working capital, exclusive of the current portion of lease obligations, of approximately $2.1 million. The Company closed a 5-year term, $5 million term loan during the 4th quarter 2023. Conference Call and Webcast The Company will host a conference call with members of the executive management team to discuss these results with additional comments and details at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on April 16, 2024.

We define non-GAAP net income as net income (loss) attributable to Xcel Brands, Inc. stockholders, exclusive of amortization of trademarks, proportional share of trademark amortization of equity method investee, stock-based compensation and cost of licensee warrants, loss on extinguishment of debt, gain on the sale of assets, gain on lease termination, gain on reduction of contingent obligations, asset impairment, certain adjustments to provision for doubtful accounts and income taxes. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS measures do not include the tax effect of the aforementioned adjusting items, due to the nature of these items and the Company’s tax strategy. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP unaudited measure, which we define as net income (loss) attributable to Xcel Brands, Inc. stockholders, exclusive of amortization of trademarks, proportional share of trademark amortization of equity method investee, stock-based compensation and cost of licensee warrants, interest and finance, including loss on extinguishment of debt, gain on the sale of assets, gain on lease termination, gain on reduction of contingent obligations, asset impairment, certain adjustments to provision for doubtful accounts, costs associated with restructuring of operations, income taxes and other state and local franchise taxes. Management uses non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA as measures of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis and to identify business trends relating to our results of operations. Management believes non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA are also useful because these measures adjust for certain costs and other events that management believes are not representative of our core business operating results, and thus these non-GAAP measures provide supplemental information to assist investors in evaluating our financial results. Adjusted EBITDA is the measure used to calculate compliance with the EBITDA covenant under our term loan agreement. Non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net income, earnings per share, or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Given that non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA are financial measures not deemed to be in accordance with GAAP and are susceptible to varying calculations, our non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in our industry, because other companies may calculate these measures in a different manner than we do. In evaluating non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may or may not incur expenses similar to some of the adjustments in this document. Our presentation of non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA does not imply that our future results will be unaffected by these expenses or any unusual or non-recurring items. When evaluating our performance, you should consider non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including our net income and other GAAP results, and not rely on any single financial measure.

The company aims to drive revenue growth, achieve profitability, and expand its wellness portfolio. Financially, XWELL reported a total revenue of $30.1 million for 2023, with an operating loss of $28.2 million. Non-cash impairment charges were recorded, impacting the Treat business segment. XWELL remains focused on improving operating performance and delivering long-term strategic priorities. Positive None. Negative Non-cash impairment charges totaling approximately $8.9 million were recorded in 2023, primarily related to HyperPointe unit and other assets. The Audit Committee determined an understatement of impairment expenses related to the Treat business segment, leading to a restatement of financial information for Q3 2023. Total revenue for 2023 was $30.1 million, with an operating loss of $28.2 million. Net loss attributable to XWELL was approximately $28.0 million for 2023. Total cost of sales decreased approximately 40% in 2023 compared to 2022. Salary, general, and administrative expenses decreased approximately 33% in 2023 versus 2022. Financial Analyst The financial performance of XWELL, Inc. reflects an operational recalibration with cost-saving measures reducing total cost of sales by 40% and administrative expenses by 33% year-over-year. Notably, the operating loss narrowed from $31.2 million to $28.2 million, indicating improved efficiency despite revenue contraction, from $55.9 million to $30.1 million. Investors should interpret this in light of the broader economic climate as the company navigates a transition towards profitability. The strategic expansion into new markets, such as Penn Station and maintaining a growth trajectory in the wellness sector, signals potential for revenue diversification. However, the impairment charges of $8.9 million, primarily related to the HyperPointe unit, raise concerns about asset valuation and future profitability, which investors should monitor closely. As there are no long-term debts and with approximately $23 million in total liquidity, the company appears to be maintaining a solid liquidity position. However, the slight decline in operating performance underscores the importance for current and prospective investors to consider the effectiveness of the company's turnaround strategies and their impact on future earnings. Market Research Analyst XWELL's strategic positioning within the wellness and biosurveillance sectors taps into growing health consciousness among travelers and the public's heightened awareness of public health due to the pandemic. The expansion into high-traffic areas like New York's Penn Station with a 'labor-lite' model is innovative and could attract a different customer demographic, potentially enhancing the company's market penetration. Moreover, the increased footprint of Naples Wax Center in Florida targets a niche market, which may contribute to a more stable revenue stream.The collaboration with Ginkgo Bioworks and the CDC in biogenomic surveillance marks a foray into an emerging field with governmental contracts, suggesting potential for long-term sustainability. These moves should be weighed against the backdrop of current economic indicators and consumer spending trends for a holistic view of the company's growth prospects. Legal Expert The restatement of financials due to the misapplication of GAAP principles, resulting in a $1.6 million understatement of impairment expenses, poses a significant concern for investors. It highlights potential governance issues which can impact investor confidence. The company's reassurance of unaffected cash balances and optimistic outlook for their biosurveillance business is crucial, yet investors should stay attentive to any further disclosures and the company's measures to prevent future discrepancies.The implications of this restatement are not to be overlooked; they can affect shareholder trust and may warrant a close review of internal controls. Investors would be advised to keep abreast of any resulting regulatory scrutiny or administrative repercussions. 04/16/2024 - 04:30 PM NEW YORK, April 16, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- XWELL, Inc.

We also accelerated our growth potential by expanding outside of the airport. Following the September 2023 acquisition of Naples Wax Center, we’ve secured multiple new leases and intend to expand their portfolio to approximately 10 locations by early 2025. Further underscoring our focus on driving retail revenue growth and smart leverage of our brands beyond traditional venues, we’re opening a new labor-lite model in New York City’s Penn Station.” Mr. Milford added, “We remain focused on continuing to expand our wellness portfolio including additional expansion into transportation hubs and launching TreatStudios, a new platform for independent wellness providers.

These automated offerings include Novo XT massage chairs, HydroMassage units and fully autonomous, AI-powered express manicure units, provide self-care to guests while bringing operational efficiency to the Company’s business model. In November 2023, the Company opened a new XpresSpa in Abu Dhabi International Airport, representing its 11th international XpresSpa. The new spa is a valuable extension to its portfolio and capitalizing on a growing UAE traveler base. Strategically, XWELL’s continued international expansion allows management the opportunity to further leverage its expertise in providing premium wellness services to more international passengers who appreciate health and wellness services and are willing to spend more in pursuit of their well-being. Penn Station XpresSpa In addition to retail unit growth, XWELL is actively pursuing plans to extend its reach across other transportation hubs such as train stations and other travel venues. To this end, subsequent to year-end 2023, the Company announced plans to open an XpresSpa location in Penn Station, located in the heart of New York City’s newly revitalized PENN DISTRICT. The tech-forward, labor-lite out-of-airport spa will serve commuters, neighborhood locals, and tourists with wellness-focused retail, autonomous massage, and nail care services, enabling seamless and efficient experiences for time-crunched New York City travelers. Out-of-Airport Wellness Portfolio - Naples Wax Center®XWELL’s first off-airport brand, Naples Wax Center, is a group of upscale hair removal and aesthetic services boutiques with current locations in Florida. Acquired in mid-September 2023 for approximately $1.5 million, Naples Wax Center provides core products and service including face and body waxing as well as a range of skincare and cosmetic products from its current three locations. Subsequent to year-end 2023, on February 14, 2024, the Company announced plans to open additional Naples Wax Center locations in 2024. The Company believes that the new locations will strengthen the brand’s esthetic service foundation and enhance its retail and skin care offerings as a growing one-stop esthetic and beauty authority. Two of the new Florida locations, which will extend Naples Wax Center’s footprint in the greater Naples and Cape Coral markets, are expected to open in the second half of 2024. Additionally, a third location is scheduled to open in the growing Tampa-Saint Peterburg metro area during the third quarter of 2024. Consistent with its projections, the Company is intending to execute additional Florida leases including further expansion into the center of the state and expects to have approximately 10 Naples Wax Center locations by early 2025. XWELL intends to extend its reach across the Southeast and as new locations are opened, they’ll also incorporate additional aesthetic services into the Naples Wax Center model to drive new revenue and broaden their offering. Life Sciences & Biosurveillance -- XpresCheck® and HyperPointe™The Company XpresTest, Inc. subsidiary (“XpresCheck”), in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) and Ginkgo Bioworks, currently operates 9 biosurveillance stations in 7 of the nation’s busiest airports. On August 17, 2023, the Company announced that the CDC renewed the traveler-based SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Surveillance program through a new one-year contract. On November 6, 2023, XWELL and Ginkgo Bioworks announced they’re expanding their work with the CDC’s Traveler-based Genomic Surveillance program (TGS) to test for more than 30 additional priority pathogens, in addition to SARS-CoV-2. The program expansion was launched in late October 2023 at four of the program’s six major international airports including New York, JFK, San Francisco, Boston, and Washington DC, Dulles. More recently, on March 12, 2024, XWELL and Ginkgo Bioworks announced that the TGS program was being expanded further to new collection locations at U.S. international airports in Miami (MIA) and Chicago (ORD). Pursuant to the March 2024 extension, the program funding and scope were expanded to an estimated $36.7 million or more. TGS is a flexible, multimodal platform that consists of four complementary approaches of sample collection from arriving international travelers at U.S. airports, including voluntary nasal swabbing, aircraft wastewater, air monitoring and airport wastewater sampling to enhance early detection of new SARS-CoV-2 variants and other pathogens, and fills gaps in global surveillance. As background, in late 2021, in collaboration with the CDC and Ginkgo Bioworks, XpresTest began conducting biosurveillance monitoring aimed at identifying existing and new SARS-CoV-2 variants. During the third quarter of 2022, XpresCheck, in partnership with Ginkgo Bioworks were awarded a new contract in continuation of their support to the CDC’s traveler-based SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Surveillance program. In the first quarter of 2023, in addition to SARS-CoV-2, XpresCheck and Ginkgo Bioworks expanded their support of the program to include a pilot study monitoring influenza viruses. This provided an additional source of viral surveillance to inform the selection of influenza vaccine viruses for the 2023-2024 flu season. Additionally, beginning in third quarter of 2023, the Company began reporting operating results for HyperPointe within its XpresTest business. Beginning in June 2020, and following its acquisition by XWELL in January 2022, HyperPointe’s management team and suite of services and technology have been utilized to develop and deploy the technological infrastructure necessary to scale the growth of the XpresTest business. HyperPointe’s experience in this space continues to play a critical role in the expansion of ongoing biosurveillance efforts created in partnership with Ginkgo Bioworks and the CDC. HyperPointe is a leading digital healthcare and data analytics relationship marketing agency, servicing the global healthcare and pharmaceutical industry. HyperPointe has significant experience in patient and healthcare professional marketing and deep technological experience with CXM (customer experience management) and data analytics. Liquidity and Financial ConditionAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately $8.4 million of cash and cash equivalents, $14.6 million in marketable securities, total current assets of approximately $26.6 million, and no long-term debt. Summary Fiscal Year 2023 Financial ResultsTotal revenue during fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, was $30.1 million compared to $55.9 million in the prior year. Revenue for 2023 primarily consisted of approximately $19.5 million from XpresSpa locations and Treat locations and approximately $9.9 million from XpresTest, which includes XWELL’s bio-surveillance partnership and its HyperPointe business. Naples Wax Center, which was acquired near the end of the third quarter of 2023, accounted for $0.65 million. Non-Cash Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment ChargesIn accordance with accounting requirements, 2023 results included non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges totaling approximately $8.9 million, primarily related to its HyperPointe unit and other assets related to Treat and XpresSpa. As previously announced on April 12, 2024, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, after audit work performed and consultation with management and with its independent registered public accounting firm, determined that the Company incorrectly applied U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) as related to the determination of the impairment of the Company’s Treat, Inc. business segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 (“Q3 2023”) in the Quarterly Report on Form10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2023 (the “Third Quarter Quarterly Report”). The cumulative effect is an understatement of the impairment expenses as related to the Treat business segment of $1.6 million. As part of its determination, the Audit Committee concluded that it was appropriate to correct the misapplication of GAAP described above for financial statements for Q3 2023 included in the Third Quarter Quarterly Report, by restating such unaudited financial information because the errors in the financial statements are material to the financial statements for Q3 2023 (the “Restatement”). As a result, unaudited financial statements for Q3 2023 should no longer be relied on. Similarly, any previously issued or filed reports, press releases, earnings releases, and investor presentations or other communications describing the Company’s financial statements and other related financial information covering Q3 2023, should no longer be relied upon. These errors have no effect on the Company’s previously reported cash and cash equivalents or marketable securities balances or cash runway. Additional details of the Restatement, the impairment charge and its impact on the Company's financial statements are included in XWELL’s annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. The non-cash impairment charge will not have any impact on the cash flows or liquidity. Additionally, HyperPointe remains key to the operating strategy of Company’s XpresCheck segment and does not alter XWELL’s positive outlook for its bio-surveillance business. Total Cost of SalesTotal cost of sales were approximately $26.4 million for 2023 compared with approximately $43.9 million for 2022. Salary, General and Administrative ExpensesSalary, general and administrative expenses were approximately $20.9 million compared with approximately $31.2 million for 2022. This decrease was primarily due to the reduction of functional costs associated with the operations of XpresCheck and reduced overhead spend. Total Operating ExpensesTotal operating expenses were approximately $31.9 million for 2023, compared to approximately $43.2 million for 2022. Operating LossThe operating loss for 2023 was approximately $28.2 million compared with an operating loss of approximately $31.2 million in 2022. Net Loss Attributable to XWELLNet loss attributable to XWELL was approximately $28.0 million for 2023 compared to net loss attributable to XWELL of approximately $32.7 million in 2022.

The company incurred an impairment charge for certain exploration targets in Colombia. 04/16/2024 - 04:30 PM (All amounts expressed in US dollars, unless otherwise stated) VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 16, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Atico Mining Corporation (the “Company” or “Atico”) (TSX.V: ATY | OTC: ATCMF) today announced its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023, posting income from mining operations of $7.4 million and a net loss of $5.8 million. Production for the year at Atico’s El Roble mine totaled 13.2 million pounds (“lbs”) of copper and 10,149 ounces (“oz”) of gold in concentrate at a cash cost(1) of $2.04 per payable pound of copper(2). Fernando E. Ganoza, CEO and Director, commented, ""we had a challenging year overall, with the first half of the year facing lower than expected head grades and lower throughput due to mechanical and operational issues, coupled with a significant appreciation in the Colombian Peso throughout the year which materially increased our costs. Despite these challenges the team did a great job getting El Roble mine back on track in the second half of the year to deliver just slightly below our annual guidance. This turnaround in operations and strong metal prices resulted in generation of good cash flows at the mine which were offset by a non-cash impairment charge recorded for the year.” Mr. Ganoza continued, “In 2024, we will continue looking at opportunities to optimize operating costs while investing in expanding the resource and reserves estimate at El Roble and extending its mine life. In parallel, the La Plata project continues to advance with the permitting process and the Feasibility Study which is nearing completion.” 2023 Consolidated Financial Highlights Net loss for 2023 amounted to $5.8 million, compared with $3.4 million for the comparative year. The loss was primarily due to an impairment charge to mineral properties, in respect to certain regional exploration targets in Colombia of the El Roble’s exploration & evaluation segment, and lower income from mining operations because of lower sales and higher production costs.Sales for the year decreased 12% to $57.5 million when compared with $65.2 million in 2022. Copper (“Cu”) and gold (“Au”) accounted for 83% and 17% of the 31,763 (2022 – 36,655) dry metric tonnes (“DMT”) sold during 2023. Sales during the year were impacted by lower quantities sold compared to 2022.The average realized price per metal was $3.94 (2022 - $3.80) per pound of copper and $2,009 (2022 - $1,797) per ounce of gold.Working capital was negative $2.1 million (2022 – positive $18.2 million), while the Company had $6.0 million (2022 - $15.6 million) in long-term loans payable. The decrease in working capital is largely due to the $10M loan payable to Trafigura PTE Ltd. becoming due within 12 months from December 31, 2023.Cash costs(1) were $129.99 per tonne of processed ore and $2.04 per pound of payable copper produced, which were a decrease of 1% and an increase of 39% relative to 2022, respectively. Loss from operations was $4.4 million (2022 – income of $9.2 million) which included a $5.7 million impairment charge discussed above, while cash flows from operations, before changes in working capital, was $9.7 million (2022 - $15.8 million).Cash used by investing activities amounted to $15.9 million (2022 - $14.1 million) with expenditures for $5.5 million at El Roble and $5.5 million at La Plata. The Company also paid $3.6 million to the National Mining Agency in Colombia (2022 - $3.4 million) and $1.0 million towards the deferred purchase price amount for the La Plata non-controlling interest acquisition completed in 2022. The final amount remaining of $1.0 million is due in August 2024.All-in sustaining cash cost(1) per payable pound of copper produced was $2.87 (2022 - $2.43). 2023 Consolidated Operating Highlights and Review Ore processed increased 16% year-on-year;Copper head-grade decreased 22% year-on-year;Gold head-grade decreased 18% year-on-year;Concentrate production decreased 8% year-on-year;Copper metal production decreased 12% year-on-year; andGold metal production decreased 9% year-on-year. Operationally the Company had a challenging first half of the year resulting in low ore and concentrate production and low copper head grade. This was turned around in Q3-2023 with an improvement in these metrics to finish the year delivering just under the bottom end of our copper and gold production guidance ranges for 2023. In 2023, the Company produced 13.2 million lbs of copper, 10,149 oz of gold, and 36,949 oz of silver. The decrease in copper and gold production compared to the prior year is mainly explained by a decrease in head grade, which was partially offset by an increase in ore processed which met the guidance for the year. During 2023, the mill operated for 339 days, an increase of 3% compared to the target set for the year and an increase of 12% compared to 302 days of operation in 2022. Average copper head-grade decreased by 22% relative to 2022, meeting the bottom end of the 2023 guidance range, while average gold head-grade decreased by 18% relative to 2022, slightly below the bottom end of the 2023 guidance range. Recoveries remained steady at 91.8% (2022 – 91.4%) for copper and 60.1% (2022 – 60.6%) for gold. Cash costs(1) were $129.99 per tonne of processed ore and $2.04 per pound of payable copper produced, which were a decrease of 1% and an increase of 39% relative to 2022, respectively(1). The increase in cash costs per pound of payable copper produced compared to 2022 is due to lower copper grade and lower gold (by-product) credits due to lower gold grade. 2023 Consolidated Operational Details Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Total Production (Contained in Concentrates)(3) Copper (000s pounds)2,310 2,803 3,762 4,367 13,242 Gold (ounces)2,553 2,313 2,705 2,578 10,149 Silver (ounces)8,335 7,826 9,979 10,810 36,949 Mine Tonnes of ore mined60,568 72,340 77,947 78,132 288,987 Mill Tonnes processed62,793 68,471 74,580 73,030 278,874 Tonnes processed per day747 799 888 853 825 Copper grade (%)1.87 2.04 2.46 2.89 2.34 Gold grade (g/t)2.23 1.80 1.83 1.75 1.89 Silver grade (g/t)11.20 9.98 10.13 9.86 10.26 Recoveries Copper (%)89.2 90.6 93.0 93.9 91.8 Gold (%)57.0 58.4 61.9 62.7 60.1 Silver (%)37.5 36.6 41.0 47.0 40.7 Concentrates Copper Concentrates (dmt)5,815 6,789 9,336 10,727 32,667 Copper (%)18.0 18.7 18.3 18.5 18.4 Gold (g/t)13.7 10.5 9.0 7.5 9.7 Silver (g/t)44.8 34.9 33.2 31.3 35.0 Payable copper produced (000s lb)2,169 2,639 3,536 4,108 12,451 Cash cost per pound of payable copper(1)(2) ($/lb)2.20 2.22 1.97 1.91 2.04 (1) Alternative performance measures; please refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” at the end of this release.(2) Net of by-product credits(3) Subject to adjustments on final settlement The financial statements and MD&A are available on SEDAR and have also been posted on the company's website at http://www.aticomining.com/s/FinancialStatements.asp Fourth Quarter Financial Highlights During the quarter, the Company generated sales of $17.3 million, where copper accounted for 89% and gold for 11%. The average realized price per metal was $3.86 per pound of copper and $2,053 per ounce of gold, and included copper and gold price adjustments on shipments provisionally invoiced in prior quarters whose final settlement occurred during Q4-2023 as per their quotational periods. Income from mining operations for the quarter was $2.3 million and net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $3.5 million, which included operating cash inflows before changes in non-cash operating working capital items of $2.0 million and cash inflows from changes in non-cash working capital items of $1.5 million. Cash costs(1) for the quarter were $135.00 per tonne of processed ore and $1.91 per pound of payable copper produced(2)(4), increases of 7% and 1% over Q4-2022, respectively. Annual General Meeting Atico Mining cordially invites all shareholders to its Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, at 10:00 am, Tuesday, June 18, 2024, at Suite 501 - 543 Granville Street, Vancouver, British Columbia. El Roble Mine The El Roble mine is a high grade, underground copper and gold mine with nominal processing plant capacity of 1,000 tonnes per day, located in the Department of Choco in Colombia. Its commercial product is a copper-gold concentrate. Since obtaining control of the mine on November 22, 2013, Atico has upgraded the operation from a historical nominal capacity of 400 tonnes per day. El Roble’s reserves estimate, with an effective date of September 30, 2020, included in the NI 43-101 Technical Report dated February 18, 2021, and filed on SEDAR on the same date, includes Proven and Probable reserves of 1.00 million tonnes grading 3.02% copper and 1.76 g/t gold, at a cut-off grade of 1.3% copper equivalent. Mineralization is open at depth and along strike and the Company plans to further test the limits of the deposit. On the larger land package, the Company has identified a prospective stratigraphic contact between volcanic rocks and black and grey pelagic sediments and cherts that has been traced by Atico geologists for ten kilometers. This contact has been determined to be an important control on VMS mineralization on which Atico has identified numerous target areas prospective for VMS type mineralization occurrence, which is the focus of the current surface drill program at El Roble. A focus in 2023 will be on increasing the resource and reserves estimate and extending the El Roble’s life of mine. La Plata Overview The La Plata project is a gold rich volcanogenic massive sulphide deposit that was the subject of small-scale mining from 1975-1981 by Outokumpu Finland. The project benefits from a modern drill and exploration database which was completed by Cambior Inc. from 1996-1999, Cornerstone Capital from 2006-2009 and Toachi from 2016-2019. In total, there is drill core and logs from more than 28,300 metres of drilling. Historic resources based on drilling by Cambior and Cornerstone were estimated at 913,977 tonnes grading 8.01 grams gold per tonne, 88.3 grams silver per tonne, 5.01% copper, 6.71% zinc and 0.78% lead per tonne in the inferred category. More recently, Toachi Mining completed a PEA estimating an inferred resource of 1.85 million tonnes grading 4.10 grams gold per tonne, 50.0 grams silver per tonne, 3.30% copper, 4.60% zinc and 0.60% lead per tonne. The La Plata project consists of two concessions covering a total area of 2,235 hectares along its 9-kilometer length, which contains known mineralization in two VMS lenses and nine priority exploration targets. The Company is currently working on completing a Feasibility Study and obtaining the necessary permits and the environmental license to begin construction of the La Plata project. In May 2022 the Company received the technical approval of its Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (“ESIA”) study for the project and the Ministry of Environment, Waters and Ecological Transition (MAATE) initiated the socialization of the ESIA, through an environmental public consultation process, as an important step for the issuance of the environmental license for the La Plata project. However, on July 31, 2023, the Constitutional Court in Ecuador, admitted for processing a claim of the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE) and other complainants, provisionally suspending Executive Decree No 754 signed on May 31, 2023, that regulates environmental consultations for all public and private industries and sectors in Ecuador – not limited to extractive industries. The La Plata environmental consultation process was as result put on pause until a ruling was made from the Constitutional Court in Ecuador. On November 17, 2023, the Ecuadorian Constitutional Court ruled the Executive Decree 754 was unconstitutional, but decided to maintain the decree in force until the Ecuadorian National Assembly enacts this procedure into Organic Law. Until the Assembly passes the necessary organic law, the temporary suspension of the Decree was revoked by the Constitutional Court and the Decree remains in effect. This allows many projects across all industries and sectors, including La Plata, to resume their respective consultation process, which MAATE reinitiated for La Plata during Q1-2024. In January 2024, the Company announced that the Government of Ecuador authorized the extension period for the La Plata mining concession until 2049.

Wells Fargo Bank and Bank of America served as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners on the credit facility, with other major banks participating. The expanded facility enhances NNN REIT's financial flexibility for potential acquisitions, supporting its track record of 34 consecutive annual dividend increases.

For more information, visit NNN REIT's website. Negative None. Financial Analyst The expansion of NNN REIT's unsecured credit facility from $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion is indicative of the trust's proactive financial management strategy, aiming to fortify its liquidity and support its acquisition-driven growth model. Notably, the option to extend the facility's maturity to April 2029 provides a cushion against potential short-term liquidity crunches. However, it's the accordion feature that is particularly noteworthy, potentially ramping up the facility size to $2.0 billion if tapped. This speaks volumes about the company's ambition and the flexibility it desires in pursuing aggressive expansion or cushioning against unforeseen market disruptions. Given NNN's track record of consistent annual dividend increases, the expanded credit line might reassure investors about the REIT's commitment to financial stability and sustained growth. While the unchanged material loan provisions suggest a status quo in terms of cost of capital, the overall enhancement of the credit facility can be seen as a strategic move to underpin the company's long-term investment thesis. Real Estate Market Analyst Considering NNN REIT's portfolio, which spans across 49 states with significant gross leasable area, the expanded credit facility aligns with the sector's need for flexibility and liquidity in managing large-scale real estate assets. The retail property market, often characterized by long-term, net leases, requires a buffer against the cyclicality of retail business and consumer spending patterns. NNN REIT's strategy to maintain a weighted average remaining lease term of over 10 years positions it favorably within the industry, balancing risk and stability. However, one must consider the larger economic context, such as interest rate trends and consumer spending shifts, which directly influence retail real estate dynamics. Investors should assess how NNN REIT's financial strategy meshes with these macroeconomic factors to evaluate the potential impact on the company's performance and their investment. 04/16/2024 - 04:30 PM ORLANDO, Fla., April 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- NNN REIT, Inc.

Positive None. Negative None. 04/16/2024 - 04:30 PM PASADENA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Heliogen, Inc. (“Heliogen” or the “Company”) (OTCQX: HLGN), a leading provider of AI-enabled concentrating solar energy technology, today announced that its Board of Directors (the “Board”) adopted an amendment to its existing limited duration stockholder rights plan (as amended, the “Rights Plan”) to extend the duration of the Rights Plan and reduce the exercise price of the rights. Julie Kane, Chair of the Board, stated “Heliogen continues to experience a significant and ongoing dislocation in the trading price of its common stock. The extension of the Rights Plan is intended to enable all of our stockholders to realize the long-term value of their investment, particularly in light of the Company’s previously announced consideration of strategic alternatives. The Rights Plan should reduce the likelihood that any person or group gains control of Heliogen through open market accumulation without paying all stockholders an appropriate control premium or without providing the Board sufficient time to make informed judgments and take actions that are in the best interests of all stockholders.” The Board did not adopt the extension to the Rights Plan in response to a specific takeover threat. In addition, the Rights Plan does not prevent the Board from engaging with parties or accepting an acquisition proposal if the Board believes that it is in the best interests of Heliogen and all of its stockholders. The Rights Plan is similar to other plans adopted by publicly held companies in comparable circumstances, and does not contain any dead-hand, slow-hand, no-hand or similar feature that limits the ability of a future Board to redeem the rights. The Rights Plan, as amended, will automatically expire on April 17, 2025 unless the rights are earlier redeemed by the Company. The rights will be exercisable only if a person or group (an “acquiring person”), other than an “exempt person” (as described in the Rights Plan), acquires or launches a tender or exchange offer to acquire beneficial ownership (which includes certain synthetic equity interests) of 12.5% or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock (20% for certain passive institutional investors as described in the Rights Plan). Any stockholders with beneficial ownership of the Company’s outstanding common stock above the applicable threshold as of the time of this announcement are grandfathered at their current ownership levels but are not permitted to increase their ownership without triggering the Rights Plan. Once the rights become exercisable, each right will entitle its holder (other than the acquiring person, whose rights will become void) to purchase, for $26.40, additional shares of the Company’s common stock having a market value of twice such exercise price. In addition, the Rights Plan has customary flip-over and exchange features. Except as otherwise set forth in the Amendment, the terms of the Rights Plan are unchanged and remain in full force and effect. Additional information regarding the Amendment to the Rights Plan will be contained in a Form 8-K to be filed by the Company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

The net interest income decreased, but interest income from net loans increased. Asset quality remained stable, and non-interest income decreased due to various factors. Non-interest expense decreased primarily due to lower FDIC insurance expenses. Positive Net income available to common shareholders decreased by 3.8% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Net interest income decreased by $5.1 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Interest income from net loans increased by $50.6 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023. Non-interest income decreased by $3.0 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Non-interest expense decreased by $3.0 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Negative The net interest margin decreased to 3.32% in the first quarter of 2024. Non-performing assets increased slightly from the previous quarter. Non-interest income decreased due to various factors including commercial customer interest rate swap fee income. Non-interest expense decreased primarily due to lower FDIC insurance expenses. Financial Analyst Examining the reported financials, Fulton Financial Corporation's net income of <$59.4 million> in Q1 2024 reflects a slight downtrend from the prior quarter (<$2.3 million> or <3.8%> decrease). The attention here, for those with an eye on consistent growth, would be the operating net income's decline of <5.0%> from the last quarter of 2023. This could signal a need for investors to reevaluate growth expectations, especially considering net interest income's reduction by <4.0%> year-over-year. The contraction in net interest margin, down four basis points, may concern investors focusing on profitability metrics, as it could indicate tighter margins ahead amid a dynamic interest rate environment. Market Research Analyst From a broader market standpoint, the decrease in average interest-earning assets and the net interest margin may resonate with current economic trends of rising interest rates. It's critical to note the shift in Fulton's funding mix, emphasizing increased average interest-bearing liabilities. For investors, the bank’s strategic response to these shifts and how it manages its interest rate risk, could be pivotal in its future performance. Additionally, the rise in non-interest income year-over-year suggests diversification in revenue streams, a positive indicator of resilience amid changing market conditions. Credit Risk Analyst A subtle uptick in the provision for credit losses, compared to the previous quarter, may raise questions about the bank's credit risk profile. However, this figure is considerably lower than the same period last year, which could suggest that the bank's loan portfolio is stabilizing. Furthermore, with non-performing assets constituting only <0.57%> of total assets, the bank seems to maintain solid asset quality within industry norms. This ratio is important for investors as a measure of asset health and risk exposure. The incremental rise in net charge-offs to <0.16%> of total average loans should be monitored for potential trends, but it does not yet indicate a significant deterioration in credit quality. 04/16/2024 - 04:30 PM LANCASTER, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Fulton Financial Corporation (NASDAQ: FULT) (“Fulton” or the “Corporation”) reported net income available to common shareholders of $59.4 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2024, a decrease of $2.3 million, or 3.8%, in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2023. Operating net income available to common shareholders for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $65.4 million, or $0.40 per diluted share(1), a decrease of $3.5 million, or 5.0% in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2023. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240416112442/en/ “We are pleased with our first quarter results, which are a good start to the year; operating earnings were solid, deposit growth outpaced loan growth during the quarter, net interest margin was in line with our expectations, and asset quality remained stable,” said Curtis J. Myers, Chairman and CEO of Fulton Financial Corporation. “We are focused and making progress on our strategic initiatives.” Net Interest Income and Balance Sheet Net interest income for the first quarter of 2024 was $206.9 million, a decrease of $5.1 million in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2023, due to slight decreases in both average interest-earning assets and the net interest margin. Total average interest-earning assets for the first quarter of 2024 were $25.6 billion, a decrease of $41.0 million from the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily driven by a decrease in average investment securities and average other interest-earning assets of $137.0 million and $18.3 million, respectively, partially offset by an increase in average net loans of $114.3 million. Total average interest-bearing liabilities increased $347.9 million to $18.9 billion in the first quarter of 2024 in comparison to $18.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities was driven by an increase in the average balance of total interest-bearing deposits and the average balance of borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities of $281.2 million and $66.6 million, respectively. (1) Financial measure derived by methods other than generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). Refer to the calculation on the page titled ""Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures"" at the end of the press release. The net interest margin for the first quarter of 2024 decreased four basis points to 3.32% in comparison to 3.36% in the fourth quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in the rate on average interest-bearing deposits and a shift in the funding mix from noninterest-bearing demand deposits to interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by higher loan yields and a lower rate on average borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. A seven basis point increase in the yield on average net loans and an increase in the average balance of net loans of $114.3 million in the first quarter of 2024 drove an increase in interest income of $1.5 million to $339.7 million in comparison to $338.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities for the first quarter of 2024 increased by $6.6 million to $132.7 million in comparison to $126.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. The linked-quarter increase in interest expense in the first quarter of 2024 was primarily due to an increase in the rate on average interest-bearing deposits of 16 basis points, a decline of $379.0 million in the average balance of noninterest-bearing deposits and an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits of $281.2 million in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2023, partially offset by a decrease in the rate on borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities of 12 basis points. For the first quarter of 2024, net interest income was $206.9 million, a decrease of $8.7 million, or 4.0%, in comparison to the first quarter of 2023. Interest income for the first quarter of 2024 increased by $49.8 million to $339.7 million in comparison to $289.8 million in the first quarter of 2023, primarily driven by rising interest rates resulting in an increase in interest income from net loans of $50.6 million. Total average interest-earning assets for the first quarter of 2024 increased by $357.0 million from the first quarter of 2023. Average net loans for the first quarter of 2024 were $21.4 billion, an increase of $0.9 billion from the same period in 2023. Compared to the first quarter of 2023, average investment securities decreased $305.9 million and average other interest-earning assets decreased $244.1 million in the first quarter of 2024. Total average interest-bearing liabilities for the first quarter of 2024 increased $1.9 billion to $18.9 billion in comparison to $17.0 billion in the first quarter of 2023, driven by an increase in the average balance of total interest-bearing deposits of $2.4 billion, partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities of $0.5 billion. Increases in the average balance of net loans of $0.9 billion and yields on net loans of 69 basis points in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023 each contributed to the increase in interest income. Interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities for the first quarter of 2024 increased by $58.5 million to $132.7 million in comparison to $74.2 million in the first quarter of 2023, primarily driven by rising interest rates resulting in an increase to interest expense from interest-bearing deposits of $62.0 million. A decrease in the average balance of noninterest-bearing deposits of $1.6 billion and an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits of $2.4 billion, in the first quarter of 2024 in comparison to the first quarter of 2023 also contributed to the increase in interest expense. Asset Quality The provision for credit losses was $10.9 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $9.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $24.5 million in the first quarter of 2023. The provision for credit losses of $10.9 million recorded in the first quarter of 2024 was primarily due to net charge-offs of $8.6 million and loan growth. Non-performing assets were $156.4 million, or 0.57% of total assets, at March 31, 2024, in comparison to $154.2 million, or 0.56% of total assets, at December 31, 2023, and $167.9 million, or 0.62% of total assets, at March 31, 2023. Net charge-offs for the first quarter of 2024 were 0.16% of total average loans in comparison to 0.15% and 0.27% in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2023, respectively. Non-interest Income Non-interest income before investment securities gains (losses) in the first quarter of 2024 was $57.1 million, a decrease of $3.0 million, or 5.0%, from the fourth quarter of 2023. The decrease in non-interest income was due to a $2.0 million decrease in commercial customer interest rate swap fee income, reflected in capital markets, a $2.2 million decrease in other non-interest income (including a $0.9 million decrease in income from equity method investments and a $1.0 million net change from market movements in our commercial customer interest rate swap program resulting from the reference rate transition from the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR"")). These decreases were partially offset by increases in wealth management revenues due to an increase in assets under management and mortgage banking income due to higher loan sales volumes and higher spreads. Compared to the first quarter of 2023, non-interest income before investment securities gains (losses) increased $5.4 million, or 10.5%, from $51.7 million. The increase in non-interest income was primarily due to increases of $2.1 million in wealth management revenues due to an increase in assets under management, $1.3 million in commercial banking income, $1.1 million in mortgage banking income and $0.5 million in consumer banking income. The increase in commercial banking income was primarily due to increases of $0.8 million in cash management fee income and $0.3 million in gains on sale from Small Business Administration loans, reflected in other commercial banking income. The increase in mortgage banking income was driven by higher loan sale volumes and higher spreads. Non-interest Expense Non-interest expense was $177.6 million in the first quarter of 2024, a decrease of $3.0 million, or 1.6%, compared to $180.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a $5.0 million decrease in FDIC insurance expense, which included special assessment charges of $1.0 million in the first quarter of 2024 and $6.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, assessed to recover the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund in connection with the closures of certain banks in 2023. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in FultonFirst implementation costs and loss on asset disposals of $3.1 million. The FultonFirst implementation costs and loss on asset disposals of $6.3 million in the first quarter of 2024 included a $3.6 million loss on disposal of assets, reflected in other non-interest expense, $2.5 million of consulting service expense, included in other outside services, and $0.2 million of severance expense, reflected in salaries and employee benefits expense. The FultonFirst implementation costs and loss on asset disposals of $3.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 included $2.6 million of consulting services, reflected in other outside services, and $0.6 million of severance expense, included in salaries and employee benefits expense. Excluding FultonFirst implementation costs and loss on asset disposals, and FDIC expense noted above in the first quarter of 2024 and the fourth quarter of 2023, non-interest expense decreased $0.5 million, or 0.3%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, largely due to decreases in marketing expense of $1.6 million and salaries and employee benefits expense of $1.4 million, partially offset by increases in snow removal costs of $1.1 million, included in net occupancy expense, $0.7 million in data processing and software expense and a debt extinguishment gain of $0.7 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023. The $1.6 million decrease in marketing expense was the result of higher costs incurred in the fourth quarter of 2023 related to a targeted customer deposit acquisition program and brand marketing campaigns in growth markets. The $1.4 million decrease in salaries and benefits expense was primarily due to a decrease in healthcare costs and variable incentive expenses, partially offset by an increase in payroll taxes due to the reset of payroll tax caps. Compared to the first quarter of 2023, excluding the FultonFirst implementation costs and loss on asset disposals of $6.3 million discussed above, non-interest expense increased $11.7 million, or 7.3%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $6.0 million in salaries and employee benefits expense, $1.9 million in data processing and software expense primarily due to technology investments made in 2023, $1.7 million in net occupancy expense driven by snow removal costs, $1.3 million in FDIC insurance, which includes the $1.0 million special assessment charge noted above, and $0.7 million in other outside services expense. The $6.0 million increase in salaries and benefits expense was primarily due to merit increases and healthcare costs. Income Tax Expense For the first quarter of 2024 the effective tax rate was 18.0% in comparison to 18.5% for the full-year of 2023.

FULTON FINANCIAL CORPORATION RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES (UNAUDITED) (dollars in thousands, except per share and share data) Explanatory note: This press release contains supplemental financial information, as detailed below, that has been derived by methods other than GAAP. The Corporation has presented these non-GAAP financial measures because it believes that these measures provide useful and comparative information to assess trends in the Corporation's results of operations and financial condition. Presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is consistent with how the Corporation evaluates its performance internally and these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in the Corporation's industry. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP measures, are also useful to investors to evaluate the Corporation's results. Investors should recognize that the Corporation's presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures might not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

(OTCPINK: MCOM), a global player in innovative transportation solutions, today announced its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240416233414/en/Visit www.micromobility.com (Graphic: Business Wire) Amid a tough year for the micromobility sector, the Company showcased strategic resilience and focus, steering the company toward long-term stability and advancement. Total Net Revenues for the year amounted to $9.8 million, reflecting a 37% decrease from the previous year, primarily due to the strategic decision to early terminate the non-profitable LNPB (Lega Nazionale Professionisti Serie B) agreements, main providers of live contents for the Helbiz Media platform, and to exit non-profitable micromobility markets. These moves are aligned with the company’s long-term strategy to reduce operating cash burn. Cost of Revenues showed a significant reduction, decreasing by 30%. This reduction stems from the same strategic exits and is part of a broader effort to streamline operations and enhance financial efficiency. General and Administrative, Research and Development, and Sales and Marketing expenses also showed a general decrease, further evidencing the company’s commitment to operational efficiency and financial health. A notable highlight of the year is the significant reduction amounting to 62% of our financial liabilities, from $40.4 million in the previous year to $15.4 million. This material decrease is primarily due to settlement agreements reached by the management with secured loan holders and repayments of loans and convertible debts. “As we navigate through the restructuring of the micromobility sector, our results reflect the tough but necessary decisions we’ve made to ensure micromobility.com’s resilience and sustainability,” said Salvatore Palella, CEO of micromobility.com Inc. “Looking ahead, we are exploring strategic mergers and acquisitions to further solidify our market position and capitalize on emerging opportunities within and beyond our core sectors.” micromobility.com Inc. remains committed to leading the way in sustainable and innovative transportation solutions.

The collaboration's conclusion allows Precision to independently develop or seek new partners for these programs, maintaining focus on key clinical priorities. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Precision BioSciences shows a strategic maneuver in regaining control of its programs after ending its collaboration with Prevail Therapeutics. This decision underscores the company's confidence in its ARCUS platform and its gene editing capabilities. For investors, the key takeaway is the maintained financial stability with a cash runway into 2026, despite this shift. It suggests that Precision BioSciences is robust enough to weather changes in strategic direction without immediate financial strain. When evaluating the stock, one should consider the company's track record of advancing programs from concept to clinical candidacy as a positive signal of its R&D capabilities. However, investors should also weigh potential risks associated with the transition to independent development, such as increased R&D costs and the delay of market entry. Biotech Industry Analyst Precision BioSciences' reclamation of its gene editing programs from Prevail Therapeutics holds significance within the biotechnology sector. The focus on Hepatitis B and Primary Mitochondrial Myopathy remains a testament to the company's commitment to addressing unmet medical needs. Given that the ARCUS platform upholds attributes like precision gene editing capabilities, the biotech community may see this as a reinforcement of Precision's competitive edge. The impending steps towards GLP toxicology studies and IND submissions will be critical in determining the platform's clinical viability. Stakeholders should monitor these developments closely, as successful outcomes can catapult the company forward in the gene therapy space and may lead to strategic partnerships or interest from larger pharmaceutical entities. Medical Research Analyst From a medical research perspective, the return of Precision BioSciences' gene editing programs represents a substantial commitment to pursuing treatments for genetic diseases in-house. The ARCUS platform's proof of concept in gene excision and insertion is promising, yet the transition from collaborative to solo development brings challenges. The company’s ability to maintain its projected cash runway while advancing these programs is reassuring. Looking forward, the progression into GLP toxicology studies and eventual IND submissions will be pivotal milestones that could validate the platform's therapeutic potential and drive investor confidence. Additionally, the strategic decision to potentially seek new partners offers a flexible approach to development that could alleviate some of the financial and operational burdens associated with solo drug development. 04/16/2024 - 04:15 PM - Productive collaboration advanced three programs and demonstrated proof of concept of ARCUS for gene excision and gene insertion - Precision exercised option to regain control of programs and intends to bring collaboration programs back to develop independently or with new partners - Precision’s most important near-term clinical priorities in Hepatitis B (HBV) and Primary Mitochondrial Myopathy (PMM) and the expected cash runway into the second half of 2026 are not impacted DURHAM, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Precision BioSciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: DTIL), an advanced gene editing company, today announced the anticipated return of three programs from Prevail Therapeutics Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company. Precision exercised its option to regain rights for the programs following Prevail Therapeutics’ decision to conclude the collaboration. Precision uses its novel proprietary ARCUS® platform to develop in vivo gene editing therapies for sophisticated gene edits, including gene elimination, insertion, and excision. The collaboration began in January 2021 and was amended in June 2023 to transfer certain preclinical research, manufacturing, and investigational new drug (IND)-enabling activities from Precision BioSciences to Prevail Therapeutics. “We enjoyed a productive gene editing collaboration with Prevail Therapeutics and appreciate their contributions to the success of these programs. Together, we advanced three programs from concept toward clinical candidates, and Precision completed its workplan for these programs to the next stage gate, taking us to an important development decision point,” said Michael Amoroso, President and Chief Executive Officer of Precision BioSciences. “Our decision to regain control of the programs brings exciting development opportunities to Precision’s pipeline with a focus on benefiting people born with incurable genetic diseases.” “These in vivo gene editing programs are designed to take advantage of unique attributes of ARCUS, namely its cut, size, and simplicity. Our next steps will be to prepare for GLP toxicology studies followed by potential IND and clinical trial application (CTA) submissions,” said Jeff Smith, PhD, Co-Founder and Chief Research Officer. “We are excited about the compelling in vivo proof-of-concept data generated for ARCUS gene excision of a “hot spot” region of the dystrophin gene in the DMD program. Additionally, in vivo data for the gene insertion program demonstrated up to 45% high efficiency gene insertion in non-dividing cells of non-human primates measured by total liver tissue. This is important and differentiating proof-of-concept data for ARCUS compared to CRISPR, base editors and prime editors, which have not demonstrated such high levels of gene insertion efficiency in dividing or non-dividing cells in vivo, potentially enabling broader therapeutic applicability for ARCUS.” As a result of the strong proof of concept data generated to date, Precision is exploring opportunities to develop the returned programs independently or in partnership with others. Importantly, the return of these programs does not impact the Company’s near-term clinical priorities in ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, HBV, and PMM or its expected cash runway to achieve these clinical data milestones. “Turning to our fundamental story, Precision continues to make progress with our wholly owned programs for HBV and PMM as well as through partnerships with Novartis and iECURE. Most recently, iECURE has commenced regulatory and clinical activities in major markets around the world to use the ARCUS platform for gene insertion to address OTC deficiency using an ARCUS nuclease,” added Mr. Amoroso. Precision BioSciences remains focused on its most important near-term priorities and clinical data milestones with several opportunities to validate ARCUS for both wholly owned and the lead partnered program in 2024 and 2025. The OTC deficiency program partnered with iECURE is the most advanced ARCUS in vivo gene editing program with first-in-human clinical dosing expected to commence in 2024. IND and CTAs have been approved in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia for the Phase 1/2 OTC-HOPE study. Following receipt of regulatory guidance in and outside of the United States, Precision’s wholly owned PBGENE-HBV viral elimination program has commenced final IND and CTA enabling studies and is rapidly progressing toward the clinic with submissions planned in 2024. The PBGENE-PMM mutant mitochondrial DNA elimination program is on track for IND and/or CTA submission in 2025. The cash received from our recent public offering, upfront and potential near-term cash from cell therapy transactions, along with existing cash and cash equivalents, expected operational receipts, continued fiscal and operating discipline, availability of our at-the-market facility, and available credit, are expected to provide Precision with a cash runway into the second half of 2026. The completion of the collaboration does not impact Precision’s expected cash runway as no milestones from Prevail Therapeutics were assumed in our cash runway through 2026.

The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to earnings, positioning Oil-Dri as a key player in the lightweight cat litter segment. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of Ultra Pet by Oil-Dri is a strategic maneuver to strengthen its foothold in the burgeoning crystal cat litter market. This segment has witnessed a 500% growth since 2019, indicating a significant shift in consumer preferences towards silica gel-based products. Oil-Dri's foray into this niche is a calculated response to evolving market dynamics. By integrating Ultra Pet's product lineup, Oil-Dri is positioned to capitalize on the lightweight litter trend, leveraging synergies to enhance its competitive edge in the pet care industry. This transaction, valued at $46 million, is projected to be accretive to Oil-Dri's earnings, potentially creating shareholder value. Financial Analyst Oil-Dri's financing strategy for the Ultra Pet acquisition reflects prudent capital management. Utilizing a mix of cash reserves and existing credit facilities to fund the $46 million purchase minimizes dilution for existing shareholders and preserves capital for future growth opportunities. The immediate accretion to earnings suggests a positive impact on the bottom line, which should be well-received by the market. Furthermore, with Ultra Pet's annual net sales of approximately $24 million, the price-to-sales ratio of just under 2x appears reasonable, signaling a potentially value-accretive deal for Oil-Dri. Pet Industry Expert Oil-Dri's acquisition of Ultra Pet signifies an alignment with consumer trends favoring innovative pet care products. Silica gel-based crystal cat litter aligns with modern consumer demands for lightweight, high-absorbency and dust-free solutions. Ultra Pet's established distribution channels through e-commerce and pet specialty stores will likely enhance Oil-Dri's market reach. The integration of Ultra Pet's offerings with Oil-Dri's existing portfolio presents an opportunity for cross-branding and market penetration strategies that could resonate with eco-conscious consumers and bolster brand loyalty across segments. 04/16/2024 - 04:11 PM CHICAGO, April 16, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Oil-Dri Corporation of America (NYSE: ODC) (“Oil-Dri”), a leading manufacturer of sorbent minerals including clay-based cat litter, announced today that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire privately-held Ultra Pet Company, Inc. (“Ultra Pet”), a prominent supplier of silica gel-based crystal cat litter. Under the terms of the agreement, Oil-Dri will acquire Ultra Pet for $46 million in cash. Oil-Dri plans to finance this acquisition through a combination of cash-on-hand and its existing credit facilities. The board of directors of Oil-Dri and the managers of Ultra Pet’s parent company have unanimously approved the transaction which is expected to close in Oil-Dri’s fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, after satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Oil-Dri expects this transaction to be immediately accretive to earnings following the completion of the transaction. Ultra Pet, headquartered in Anderson, South Carolina, is a recognized innovator and pioneer within the alternative cat litter market with annual net sales of approximately $24 million. Ultra Pet introduced the original crystal cat litter, Litter Pearls, in the United States in 1998. Since then, Ultra Pet has expanded its product offerings and has an established presence in the crystal cat litter segment. Through multiple distribution channels such as e-commerce, pet specialty, and grocery, Ultra Pet has grown its business significantly over the past several years. Since 2019, the crystal cat litter segment has experienced tremendous sales growth of 500%¹. This pending acquisition provides Oil-Dri the opportunity to become a significant player in this rapidly growing space within the cat litter market. Ultra Pet’s line of branded and private label silica gel-based crystal cat litter offerings fit well with Oil-Dri’s pet care product portfolio. Similar to Oil-Dri’s clay-based lightweight branded and private label litter, Ultra Pet’s crystal litter products are lightweight with superior odor control. Crystals are 99.9% dust free and absorb up to 90% of their weight in liquid. All of these benefits align well with Oil-Dri’s strategic focus on growing the lightweight cat litter segment with both branded and premium private label high quality products sold at a fair price to consumers.

NOG Provides Update on First Quarter Hedging Results and Stock Repurchases,2024-04-16T20:10:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. (NOG) provided an update on its first quarter hedging results and stock repurchases. The company reported $19.1 million in realized gains on derivatives but also $146.2 million in unrealized mark-to-market losses for the quarter. Additionally, NOG repurchased 549,356 shares of its common stock at an average price of $36.42 per share. As of the end of the first quarter, the company had $67.5 million remaining for stock repurchases.","NOG Provides Update on First Quarter Hedging Results and Stock Repurchases Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags buyback earnings Rhea-AI Summary Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. (NOG) provided an update on its first quarter hedging results and stock repurchases. The company reported $19.1 million in realized gains on derivatives but also $146.2 million in unrealized mark-to-market losses for the quarter. Additionally, NOG repurchased 549,356 shares of its common stock at an average price of $36.42 per share. As of the end of the first quarter, the company had $67.5 million remaining for stock repurchases. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Evaluating Northern Oil and Gas' first quarter activities, the reported realized gains of $19.1 million on derivatives indicate an effective hedging strategy, despite the unrealized mark-to-market losses of $146.2 million. The disparity between realized and unrealized figures could signal significant volatility in commodity prices or a strategic decision to hold derivative positions despite unfavorable market conditions. Investors should consider the potential for these unrealized losses to reverse should market conditions improve. The stock repurchase program, wherein NOG bought back shares at a weighted average price below their end-of-quarter value, reflects management's confidence in the company's valuation. This could be viewed positively as it suggests leadership believes the stock is undervalued. However, the remaining $67.5 million repurchase authorization will need to be judiciously deployed to maximize shareholder value. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, NOG's utilization of excess cash flow for share repurchases rather than other investments or debt reduction typically signals a bullish stance by the company on its own stock. This, coupled with the CEO's remarks on a 'positive growth outlook' and 'promising developments,' may indicate forthcoming operational successes. However, the market often reacts to the immediate financial implications of such announcements. Given the share price was repurchased at a discount to the closing price at the end of the quarter, it suggests NOG's management is adept at capital allocation. Yet, the substantial unrealized mark-to-market losses call for careful attention from investors who must weigh short-term impacts against NOG's long-term growth narrative. 04/16/2024 - 04:10 PM MINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. (NYSE: NOG) (“NOG” or the “Company”) today provided an update regarding first quarter hedging results and stock repurchases. HEDGING UPDATE The Company periodically enters into derivative agreements to hedge a portion of its commodity pricing exposure. For the first quarter of 2024, realized gains on derivatives are expected to be $19.1 million. Unrealized mark-to-market losses on derivatives are expected to be $146.2 million for the quarter. STOCK REPURCHASE UPDATE The Company allocated capital in the first quarter of 2024 to common stock repurchases. NOG repurchased 549,356 shares of its common stock at a weighted average price of $36.42 per share, repurchased prior to the most recent dividend record date. For comparative purposes, the average closing price of NOG’s common stock during March 2024 was $37.71, and the final closing price at quarter end was $39.68. As of the end of the first quarter, the Company had $67.5 million of availability remaining on its existing common stock repurchase authorization. MANAGEMENT COMMENTS “Repurchases of NOG’s common stock offered a compelling option for our excess cash flow in the first quarter,” commented Nick O’Grady, NOG’s Chief Executive Officer. “With a positive growth outlook, and promising developments in our larger joint operated ventures, NOG is poised for a productive 2024 with a sightline to continued strength in 2025. Our dynamic approach to delivering a compelling total return for our shareholders provides us the flexibility to allocate capital where we see the most attractive value.” ABOUT NOG NOG is a real asset company with a primary strategy of acquiring and investing in non-operated minority working and mineral interests in the premier hydrocarbon producing basins within the contiguous United States.

(“FTA”) announced today that the shareholders of First Trust SSI Strategic Convertible Securities ETF (Nasdaq: FCVT) (the “Fund”), a series of First Trust Exchange-Traded Fund IV (the “Trust”), voted at the special meeting of shareholders to approve for the Fund (1) a new investment sub-advisory agreement (the “New Sub-Advisory Agreement”) among the Trust, on behalf of the Fund, FTA, as investment advisor, and SSI Investment Management LLC (“SSI”), as investment sub-advisor, and (2) a “manager of managers” structure (the “Manager of Managers Structure”).

Since the Closing, SSI has been majority owned indirectly by the New Ownership Group. The Closing operated as an “assignment” (as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”)), resulting in the automatic termination of the Fund’s then-existing investment sub‑advisory agreement with SSI as of December 29, 2023. Since then, prior to the receipt of shareholder approval of the New Sub-Advisory Agreement, SSI had been providing investment sub-advisory services to the Fund on an interim basis, as permitted under the 1940 Act. The New Sub-Advisory Agreement became effective upon shareholder approval. Manager of Managers Structure.

Such forward-looking statements include, without limitation: (i) the results of the Kainantu Mine Definitive Feasibility Study, and the Kainantu 2022 Preliminary Economic Assessment, including the Stage 3 Expansion, a new standalone 1.2 mtpa process plant and supporting infrastructure; (ii) statements regarding the expansion of the mine and development of any of the deposits; (iii) the Kainantu Stage 4 Expansion, operating two standalone process plants, larger surface infrastructure and mining throughputs; and (iv) the potential extended life of the Kainantu Mine. All statements in this news release that address events or developments that we expect to occur in the future are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts and are generally, although not always, identified by words such as “expect”, “plan”, “anticipate”, “project”, “target”, “potential”, “schedule”, “forecast”, “budget”, “estimate”, “intend” or “believe” and similar expressions or their negative connotations, or that events or conditions “will”, “would”, “may”, “could”, “should” or “might” occur. All such forward-looking statements are based on the opinions and estimates of management as of the date such statements are made. Forward-looking statements are necessarily based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our ability to control, that may cause our actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking information. Such factors include, without limitation, Public Health Crises, including the COVID-19 virus; changes in the price of gold, silver, copper and other metals in the world markets; fluctuations in the price and availability of infrastructure and energy and other commodities; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; volatility in price of our common shares; inherent risks associated with the mining industry, including problems related to weather and climate in remote areas in which certain of the Company’s operations are located; failure to achieve production, cost and other estimates; risks and uncertainties associated with exploration and development; uncertainties relating to estimates of mineral resources including uncertainty that mineral resources may never be converted into mineral reserves; the Company’s ability to carry on current and future operations, including development and exploration activities; the timing, extent, duration and economic viability of such operations, including any mineral resources or reserves identified thereby; the accuracy and reliability of estimates, projections, forecasts, studies and assessments; the Company’s ability to meet or achieve estimates, projections and forecasts; the availability and cost of inputs; the availability and costs of achieving the Stage 3 Expansion or the Stage 4 Expansion; the ability of the Company to achieve the inputs the price and market for outputs, including gold, silver and copper; failures of information systems or information security threats; political, economic and other risks associated with the Company’s foreign operations; geopolitical events and other uncertainties, such as the conflicts in Ukraine, Israel and Palestine; compliance with various laws and regulatory requirements to which the Company is subject to, including taxation; the ability to obtain timely financing on reasonable terms when required; the current and future social, economic and political conditions, including relationship with the communities in Papua New Guinea and other jurisdictions it operates; other assumptions and factors generally associated with the mining industry; and the risks, uncertainties and other factors referred to in the Company’s Annual Information Form under the heading “Risk Factors”. Estimates of mineral resources are also forward-looking statements because they constitute projections, based on certain estimates and assumptions, regarding the amount of minerals that may be encountered in the future and/or the anticipated economics of production. The estimation of mineral resources and mineral reserves is inherently uncertain and involves subjective judgments about many relevant factors. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. The accuracy of any such estimates is a function of the quantity and quality of available data, and of the assumptions made and judgments used in engineering and geological interpretation, Forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of future performance, and actual results and future events could materially differ from those anticipated in such statements. Although we have attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause actual results to differ materially from those that are anticipated, estimated, or intended. There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. The Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

(NASDAQ: PXMD), a biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing treatments for neurological disorders, today announced it has received an urgent request from the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Malawi, asking for emergency access to IV suramin to avert a potential humanitarian crisis brought on by dwindling supplies of drugs used routinely to save lives in that region of Africa. PaxMedica, which just last week announced that it has completed execution of its three pivotal registration/validation batches of PAX-101 (an IV form of suramin), has brought this emergency request to the attention of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to determine potential impact, if any, on the ongoing development program and NDA submission plans for PAX-101. PaxMedica has previously announced the completion of its recent Type B meeting with FDA in preparation for submitting an NDA for the use of PAX-101 in the treatment of the rare and fatal trypanosomal infection, Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, caused by the bite of a tsetse fly. “Receiving this request from The Ministry of Health of Malawi serves to emphasize, not only the challenging situation faced by the countries in the most vulnerable zone for the fatal disease, TBr HAT, it speaks to the continued need for suramin as the standard of care in treating Stage 1 of the infection, using what’s known as the Malawi dosing protocol, which they have used in an effort to save lives in that region for nearly 100 years”, said Howard Weisman, Chairman and CEO of PaxMedica. “FDA has agreed that having more than one global manufacturer of drugs like suramin could provide public health benefit by creating multiple supply chains and would help ensure a steady supply of the drug product.” It is important to note that, of the 349 patients who were included in our Real World retrospective evidence, HAT-301 clinical study of TBR HAT patients treated with suramin between 2000 and 2020, many of the cases were from Malawi. (PaxMedica - A Promising Path in Autism) “Having the highest incidence of TBr HAT in the world, the Malawi Ministry of Health enabled PaxMedica to conduct the first and only analysis of efficacy in the actual setting where historically the vast majority of these infections have been successfully treated”, said Weisman. “This pivotal Phase 3 study would not have been possible without their multi-year commitment to our work on PAX-101.” PaxMedica is in the process of responding to the Malawi Ministry of Health’s request and is in contact with regulatory authorities in both the U.S. and Malawi with an intention to help with today’s emergency, as well as to work with the FDA to determine the best path forward to submit the PAX-101 NDA for regulatory approval, as well as to potentially qualify for a Priority Review Voucher under the Neglected Tropical Disease Priority Review Voucher Program, which could provide PaxMedica resources to help ensure a steady supply of suramin to these endemic regions.” About PaxMedica PaxMedica, Inc. is a forward-looking clinical-stage biopharmaceutical firm specializing in cutting-edge anti-purinergic drug therapies (APT) aimed at addressing a range of challenging neurologic disorders. Our comprehensive portfolio encompasses a spectrum of conditions, including neurodevelopmental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), as well as other critical areas within the neurology field. Additionally, we intend to provide the rest of the world with an additional, reliable source of suramin, the accepted standard of care for Stage 1, Trypanosoma Brucei Rhodesiense. We are dedicated to the continuous development and evaluation of our pioneering program, PAX-101, an intravenous suramin formulation that lies at the heart of our efforts, particularly focused on innovative ASD treatment solutions.

The company completed transformative acquisitions, divested non-core assets, and restructured its sales and marketing organization. Despite challenges in the advertising and media market, GameSquare remains optimistic about future growth and profitability, with a focus on enhancing shareholder value through strategic initiatives. Positive Revenue surged by 85% to $52 million in 2023 compared to the previous year. Gross profit increased to $13.4 million from $9.7 million in 2022. Net loss widened to $31.3 million from $18.1 million in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA loss improved to $15.0 million, representing 28.8% of revenue. Management anticipates annual revenue exceeding $100 million in 2024, with a gross margin between 22.5% to 27.5%. The company completed acquisitions of Engine Gaming and FaZe Clan, while divesting non-core assets for strategic focus. GameSquare restructured its sales and marketing organization to align with the new operating model. Despite challenges in the advertising and media market, the company remains optimistic about future growth and profitability. The company aims to enhance shareholder value through strategic growth initiatives and cost optimization. 2024 annual guidance includes a full 12 months of contribution from FaZe Clan, acquired in March 2024. Negative Net loss widened significantly in 2023, reaching $31.3 million compared to $18.1 million in the previous year. Adjusted EBITDA loss, while improved, still represents a significant portion of revenue at 28.8%. Challenges in the advertising and media market impacted revenue opportunities in the fourth quarter of 2023. The restructuring of the sales and marketing organization had an adverse effect on the revenue pipeline. The company anticipates challenges in the first quarter of 2024 due to asset sales, costs from the FaZe acquisition, and realignment of operations. Financial Analyst GameSquare Holdings' significant revenue growth of 85% to $52 million indicates a strategic expansion through acquisitions and organic growth. The acquisition of Engine Gaming and FaZe Clan suggests a pivot towards a media-centric model leveraging gaming and events. The divestiture of non-core assets, like Complexity Gaming, at $10.4 million, points to a focused portfolio strategy. Nevertheless, the increase in net loss from $18.1 million to $31.3 million raises questions about the sustainability of growth and the efficacy of integration. Investors should eye the Adjusted EBITDA improvement to 28.8% as a positive sign of management's operational efficiency despite the loss figures. The projected doubling of revenue for 2024, with gross margins between 22.5% to 27.5%, appears optimistic, indicating that management has confidence in the synergy of recent acquisitions and the potential for scale. However, the real test will come as these integrations unfold and whether they can translate into net profitability. Market Research Analyst In the context of a challenging advertising and media market, GameSquare's strategic realignment, particularly around its sales and marketing organization, is a key factor for investors to consider. The withdrawal of high-margin brand campaigns in Q4 indicates sensitivity to market conditions that could affect short-term performance. However, the company's focus on rapidly growing sectors within content and gaming and their expansion of the FaZe Brand could tap into burgeoning demand in these markets. The emphasis on media and events is well-aligned with current consumer trends towards digital and interactive entertainment. With the industry's projected growth, GameSquare may well be positioned to capture market share, but execution and the ability to monetize these assets efficiently will be critical to their success and investor returns. 04/16/2024 - 04:05 PM Revenue increased 85% year-over-year to an annual record of $52 million, reflecting the contribution from the Engine Gaming acquisition, and organic growthFRISCO, TX / ACCESSWIRE / April 16, 2024 / GameSquare Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:GAME), (""GameSquare"", or the ""Company""), today announced financial results for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2023.""2023 was a historic year for GameSquare as we executed against an M&A strategy focused on building a next-generation media business by acquiring industry leading technology, media, and creative assets. Over the past 12 months, we have completed two transformative acquisitions including Engine Gaming in April 2023, and FaZe Clan in March 2024. As part of our strategy, we successfully sold certain non-core radio business assets for a total consideration of $3.4 million in December 2023 and our esports team Complexity Gaming for a total consideration of $10.4 million in March 2024. These actions reflect the innovative platform we are creating that takes advantage of large, rapidly growing global trends in content, gaming, and events,"" said Justin Kenna, CEO of GameSquare.""Our 2023 results reflect the investments made to optimize our model and the contribution of Engine Gaming, while we also navigated a challenging advertising and media market environment. Specifically, brands reigned in their budgets during the fourth quarter, which caused two brand partners to pull their campaigns - each were expected to contribute high-margin, multi-million-dollar revenue in the fourth quarter. In addition, we restructured our sales and marketing organization to better align with our new operating model, which had an impact on our pipeline and further reduced revenue opportunities. Despite these impacts, our team has maintained strong relationships and supported our pipeline. As a result, we believe our media business is well positioned, once the market environment improves, for accelerating growth,"" Mr. Kenna continued.""While we expect the 2024 first quarter will be affected by the asset sale, costs associated with the FaZe acquisition, and the realignment of our sales and marketing infrastructure, we believe 2024 will be a good year of growth and enhanced profitability. We are focused on quickly executing against an exciting growth strategy, expanding the FaZe Brand, and eliminating costs to create lasting value for our shareholders. We believe our shareholders will see the power of our recent acquisitions and new operating model throughout 2024 and I am excited by the direction we are headed,"" concluded Mr. Kenna.Twelve months ended December 31, 2023, compared to December 31, 2022Revenue of $52.0 million, compared to $28.1 millionGross profit of $13.4 million, compared to $9.7 millionNet loss of $31.3 million, compared to a net loss of $18.1 millionAdjusted EBITDA loss of $15.0 million, compared to a loss of $13.2 millionAdjusted EBITDA loss was 28.8% of revenue versus 47.2% of revenue last year2024 Annual GuidanceManagement expects over $100 million in annual revenue and annual gross margin to range between 22.5% to 27.5% for 20242024's annual guidance is based on a pro-forma basis and includes a full 12 months of contribution from FaZe Clan, which was acquired on March 7, 2024.Conference Call DetailsJustin Kenna, CEO, Lou Schwartz, President, and Mike Munoz CFO are scheduled to host a conference call with the investment community.

Financial Analyst Intra-Cellular Therapies' decision to launch a public offering of common stock totaling $500 million is a move that directly affects capital structure and investor dilution. Traditionally, such offerings are undertaken to raise capital for expansion, research and development, or to strengthen the balance sheet. Depending on how the market perceives the use of proceeds, the stock price may react either positively, as a sign of growth, or negatively, due to the dilution of existing shares. Given the size of the offering and the fact that a 15% additional purchase option for underwriters exists, investors should closely monitor the final terms disclosed in the prospectus supplement. The involvement of high-profile underwriters suggests a robust interest in the offering, potentially indicating positive market sentiment towards Intra-Cellular Therapies' growth prospects. Market Research Analyst The biopharmaceutical sector is highly competitive and capital-intensive. Companies like Intra-Cellular Therapies, which specialize in CNS disorders, must continuously invest in research and development to stay ahead. A successful offering could bolster the company's ability to finance new projects and accelerate pipeline development. For retail investors, it's important to consider how this offering may influence the company's position against its competitors.

Pharmaceutical Industry Expert CNS disorders represent an area with a significant unmet medical need, which makes companies like Intra-Cellular Therapies pivotal players in the pharmaceutical landscape. If the capital raised through this stock offering is allocated toward the advancement of promising treatments, it could lead to breakthrough therapies that not only benefit patients but also create substantial value for shareholders.

Positive iLearningEngines completes a business combination with Arrowroot Acquisition Corp., becoming a publicly traded company on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol 'AILE'.

The company has seen revenue growth of 35% year-over-year through the first nine months of 2023. iLearningEngines plans to disclose its fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results soon, showcasing strong revenue growth and emerging profitability. Negative None. Financial Analyst iLearningEngines' decision to go public via a business combination with Arrowroot Acquisition Corp. heralds a strategic turning point for the company. This move aligns with the trend of companies utilizing Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) to streamline the IPO process. Now, as the firm commences trading under the symbol 'AILE', retail investors have the opportunity to partake in iLE's growth story. A key point to consider is iLearningEngines' reported 35% revenue increase year-over-year in the first nine months of 2023. While impressive, investors should await the fourth quarter and full-year financial results for a comprehensive view of the company's financial health. In the interim, it's important to dissect this growth rate within the context of the capitalized market segments: AI, e-learning and hyperautomation. These are high-growth areas with burgeoning CAGRs, yet they are also highly competitive with rapid technology evolution, which could impact iLE's long-term position. For stakeholders, the immediate concern post-IPO will be how iLE sustains its growth trajectory and leverages its AI capabilities to maintain a competitive edge. Technology Market Analyst The AI software, e-learning and hyperautomation markets, where iLearningEngines stakes its claim, are not only rapidly growing but also evolving. The company's proprietary AI technology, secure Knowledge Cloud and no code AI canvas suggest a focus on accessibility and integration—vital in today's fast-paced digital landscape. For investors, the ability of iLE to 'productize' institutional knowledge and automate workflows could signal ongoing demand for their services, as businesses continuously seek efficiency improvements. However, technology investors should keep an eye on how iLE's adoption scales across the claimed dozen industry verticals. Market penetration and customer diversity will be instrumental in cushioning against sector-specific downturns. The company's emphasis on improving business outcomes with cognitive AI could resonate well with enterprises looking to capitalize on AI without the overhead of developing in-house solutions. Yet, it's essential to monitor how iLE's platform stands up to new market entrants and innovation by established tech giants. Corporate Governance Analyst The addition of Arrowroot's former President and CFO Thomas Olivier to iLearningEngines' Board of Directors is a strategic integration of expertise, likely intended to enhance corporate governance and financial oversight. This move suggests a forward-thinking mentality, aiming to draw from Arrowroot Capital's acumen in enterprise software. Governance-wise, investors should appreciate that iLE is seeking to strengthen its decision-making framework as it enters the public market—a move that could potentially foster investor confidence. Tracking the Board's effectiveness, particularly in delivering on the promised growth strategy, will be critical. Investors are often reassured by boards that possess relevant industry experience and a track record of guidance through growth phases. The real test will be in how iLearningEngines translates strategic board decisions into tangible results that reflect in improved financials and market share. 04/16/2024 - 04:05 PM BETHESDA, Md. and MARINA DEL REY, Calif., April 16, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- iLearningEngines, Inc.

(NASDAQ: OTRK) reports Q4 revenue of $3.5 million, up 41% year over year, with a full-year revenue of $12.7 million, down 12%. The company expands services, completes equity financing, and amends its master note purchase agreement. Ontrak receives $1.9 million from the exercise of Public Offering Warrants. The financial results show improvements in operating loss and adjusted EBITDA compared to the previous year. Positive Revenue for Q4 2023 was $3.5 million, a 41% increase from the same period in 2022. Operating loss for Q4 2023 was $(5.2) million, a 35% improvement from Q4 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 2023 was $(3.6) million, an improvement from $(6.1) million in Q4 2022. Full-year 2023 revenue was $12.7 million, a 12% decrease from the prior year. Operating loss for full-year 2023 was $(20.6) million, an improvement from $(44.1) million in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for full-year 2023 was $(14.7) million, an improvement from $(31.5) million in the prior year. Ontrak expands its WholeHealth+ program to a larger commercial population and eligible self-insured groups. The company completes equity financing, raising approximately $5.3 million in a public offering. Ontrak amends its master note purchase agreement, making up to $15.0 million of borrowing capacity available. The company receives $1.9 million from the exercise of Public Offering Warrants. Ontrak introduces the Recovering Quality of Life Assessment (ReQoL) into its WholeHealth+ Product and Solutions Suite. Negative None. Financial Analyst Ontrak's financial highlights indicate a company that is in the midst of a complex transformation. While Q4 revenue growth of 41% year-over-year is commendable, it's important to note the full-year revenue declined by 12%. Investors should consider the volatility in these numbers, focusing on the company's ability to sustain and improve revenue growth moving forward. Additionally, the 35% and 52% year-over-year improvements in operating loss for Q4 and the full year, respectively, suggest a significant reduction in expenses or improved operational efficiency. Investors might view these improvements as a positive sign of management's ability to control costs. However, the heavy reliance on one customer for 33.8% of total revenue is a potential risk and the customer's decision not to continue the services post-February 2024 raises concerns about revenue concentration and client diversification.The closing of the public offering and private placement, netting approximately $5.3 million, adds liquidity but also dilutes current shareholders. The conversion of $16.3 million in secured notes and the amendment allowing for $15 million borrowing capacity under senior secured convertible promissory notes indicate a company that is actively restructuring its balance sheet. While these measures may provide short-term financial relief, they may also lead to long-term debt obligations that can affect profitability. Market Research Analyst Ontrak's service expansion to a larger commercial population and self-insured groups, along with its strategic partnership expansion, indicate a push to capture a larger market share and diversify its customer base. The increased eligibility for the WholeHealth+ program initially representing over a six-fold increase in potential members is a significant stride. Given the industry's move towards value-based care models, Ontrak's alignment with health outcomes and cost reduction is a strategic fit.However, the market response to the company's strategic direction could be influenced by the loss of the health plan customer. Potentially, initiatives like the introduction of the ReQoL into the WholeHealth+ suite may offer differentiation in the market and appeal to new customers looking for innovative mental health solutions. Investors should keep an eye on how these operational highlights translate into user engagement and client acquisition, which will be critical drivers of revenue growth. Healthcare Financial Analyst When analyzing Ontrak's performance and outlook, it's important to understand the healthcare sector's dynamics. Ontrak operates within the telehealth and AI-powered healthcare space, which has seen increased demand but also heightened competition. The introduction of the Advanced Engagement System and the Recovering Quality of Life Assessment (ReQoL) reflect the company's investment in technology and product innovation, which could enhance its value proposition and improve its competitive positioning.The financial outlook for the next quarter, with estimated revenues between $2.5 million to $2.9 million, suggests caution. For investors, it's key to consider both the company's innovation trajectory and its ability to convert these innovations into sustainable revenue streams, especially following the indicated customer loss. Long-term performance will likely hinge on the company's ability to attract new customers and penetrate deeper into existing markets with its expanded service offerings. 04/16/2024 - 04:05 PM Q4 Revenue of $3.5 million, up 41% year over year; and Full Year Revenue of $12.7 million, down 12% year over year Q4 operating loss of $5.2 million, a 35% improvement year over year; and Full Year operating loss of $21.1 million, a 52% improvement year over year Company expands its services to a larger commercial population as well as eligible self-insured groups with a health plan customer Company completes equity financing transaction, raising approximately $5.3 million, net in a public offering and completes $16.3 million conversion of secured notes Company completes amendment to its master note purchase agreement, which makes available up to $15.0 million of borrowing capacity under senior secured convertible promissory notes Company receives $1.9 million of cash proceeds from the exercise of Public Offering Warrants by certain holders thereof for a total of 5,166,664 shares of the Company's common stock Company to Host Conference Call at 4:30 pm ET Today MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ontrak, Inc.

The Company's effective outreach pool was 2,161 at December 31, 2023 compared to 3,861 at December 31, 2022. As of the date of filing this report, the Company's effective outreach pool was 5,094. On February 29, 2024, the Company announced the expansion of Ontrak's WholeHealth+ program to a larger commercial population with a health plan customer, one of the largest health systems in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and Southeast. On March 12, 2024, the Company announced a continuing expansion of its strategic partnership with the same health plan customer to offer its program to eligible self-insured groups. The expanded partnership initially represents more than 6.5 times increase in the number of this customer's members who are eligible for the Ontrak WholeHealth+ program. On October 10, 2023, the Company was notified by a health plan customer of its intent not to continue using the Company’s services after February 2024. The customer also informed us that the notification was related to the customer’s financial and budgetary constraints and not reflective of the performance or value of the Company’s services. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we billed this customer approximately $4.3 million, representing 33.8% of our total revenue. On October 31, 2023, the Company and Acuitas Capital entered into a Fifth Amendment to the Master Note Purchase Agreement, as amended (the ""Fifth Amendment""), which, among other things, in the event the Company completes a Qualified Financing, as defined in the Keep Well Agreement, the following were provided: i) the conversion of Keep Well Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, less $7.0 million, ii) in lieu of the provision set forth in the Fourth Amendment concerning investment of Escrowed Funds in an offering (which is described below), the Company and Acuitas to consummate a private placement which would consist of the escrowed funds and $5.0 million of Keep Well Notes in pre-funded warrants. In addition, the maturity date of the remaining $2.0 million Keep Well Note was changed from September 30, 2024 to the date that is two years and six months after the closing date of the offering (May 14, 2026), unless it becomes due and payable in full earlier, whether by acceleration or otherwise. On November 14, 2023, the Company announced the closing of its previously announced public offering of: 4,592,068 shares of its common stock and 9,184,136 warrants to purchase up to 9,184,136 shares of its common stock at a combined public offering price of $0.60 per share of common stock and accompanying warrants, and 5,907,932 pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 5,907,932 shares of its common stock and 11,815,864 warrants to purchase up to 11,815,864 shares of its common stock at a combined public offering price of $0.5999 per pre-funded warrant and accompanying warrants, which represents the per share public offering price for the common stock and accompanying warrants less the $0.0001 per share exercise price for each pre-funded warrant. The Company estimates net proceeds of approximately $5.3 million from the public offering described above. In addition, concurrent with the public offering described above, the Company announced the closing of its previously announced concurrent private placement (the “Private Placement”) of $11.0 million worth of unregistered pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of the Company's common stock and unregistered warrants to purchase shares of the Company's common stock to Acuitas. The Company issued 18,333,333 pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 18,333,333 shares of its common stock and 36,666,666 warrants to purchase up to 36,666,666 shares of its common stock at a purchase price of $0.5999 per pre-funded warrant and accompanying warrants, which represents the per share public offering price for the common stock and accompanying warrants less the $0.0001 per share exercise price for each pre-funded warrant. The warrants accompanying the pre-funded warrants have an exercise price of $0.85 per share. The consideration for the Private Placement Securities purchased by Acuitas consisted of (a) the $6.0 million of escrowed funds then held in an escrow account, and (b) $5.0 million of senior secured convertible notes outstanding under the Keep Well Notes. Prior to the closing of the public offering and private placement described above, Acuitas converted approximately $16.3 million of outstanding senior secured convertible notes, pursuant to which the Company issued to Acuitas 18,054,791 shares of its common stock and warrants to purchase 18,054,791 shares of its common stock, as well as 9,027,395 shares of its common stock and warrants to purchase 9,027,395 shares of its common stock upon obtainment of shareholder approval in December 2023. In February 2024, the Company announced the introduction of Recovering Quality of Life Assessment (ReQoL) into its cutting-edge WholeHealth+ Product and Solutions Suite. ReQoL assessments can be used in healthcare and research settings to evaluate the impact of mental health conditions, psychological interventions, and healthcare interventions on patients' lives because they focus on understanding the person over the diagnosis, consistent with recovery strategies. In March 2024, the Company and Acuitas Capital entered into a Sixth Amendment to the Master Note Purchase Agreement, as amended (the ""Sixth Amendment""). In accordance with the Sixth Amendment, on April 5, 2024, the Company issued and sold to Acuitas Capital, and Acuitas Capital purchased from the Company, a senior secured convertible promissory note with a principal amount of $1.5 million (the ""Initial Demand Note""), and in Acuitas Capital’s sole discretion, Acuitas Capital may purchase from the Company, and the Company will issue and sell to Acuitas, up to an additional $13.5 million in principal amount of Demand Notes. In connection with each Demand Note purchased by Acuitas from the Company (including the Initial Demand Note), subject to stockholder approval effective date occurring, the Company will issue to Acuitas (or an entity affiliated with Acuitas, as designated by Acuitas) a warrant (“Demand Warrant”), to purchase such number of shares of the Company’s common stock that results in 200% warrant coverage. Each Demand Warrant will have a term of five (5) years. The initial exercise price of each Demand Warrant will be (a) in the case of the Demand Warrant issued in connection with the Initial Demand Note and in respect of the next $3.0 million of principal amount of Demand Notes purchased by Acuitas, the lesser of (i) $0.3442 (after giving effect to the reduction of the exercise price of the Public Offering Warrants and Private Placement Warrant (collectively, the “November 2023 Warrants”) that occurred on April 5, 2024) and (ii) the greater of (1) the consolidated closing bid price of the Company’s common stock as reported on The Nasdaq Stock Market or such other exchange on which the Company’s common stock is listed (the “Exchange”) immediately preceding the time the applicable Demand Note is deemed issued by the Company and (2) $0.12, and (b) in the case of the Demand Warrants issued in connection with any subsequent Demand Notes, the consolidated closing bid price of the Company’s common stock as reported on the Exchange immediately preceding the time the applicable Demand Note is deemed issued by the Company, which initial exercise price will, in each case of clauses (a) and (b) above, be subject to further adjustment in accordance with the terms of the Demand Warrant and the Sixth Amendment. From March 28, 2024 through April 2, 2024, the Company received a total of $1.9 million of cash proceeds from the exercise of Public Offering Warrants by certain holders thereof for a total of 5,166,664 shares of the Company's common stock. Financial Outlook The following outlook is based on information available as of the date of this press release and is subject to change in the future. For the quarter ending March 31, 2024, the Company estimates revenue in the range of $2.5 million to $2.9 million.

The non-GAAP financial measures presented include EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP net loss, and Non-GAAP net loss per common share, which are not U.S. GAAP financial measures. We believe that the presentation of these financial measures enhances an investor’s understanding of our financial performance. We further believe that these financial measures are useful financial metrics to assess our operating performance from period-to-period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business. EBITDA consists of net loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses. Adjusted EBITDA consists of net loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, write-off of debt issuance costs, write-off of other assets, restructuring, severance and related costs, gain on termination of operating lease, and gain/loss on change in fair value of warrant liability. We believe that making such adjustments provides investors meaningful information to understand our results of operations and the ability to analyze our financial and business trends on a period-to-period basis. Non-GAAP net loss consists of net loss adjusted for stock-based compensation, write-off of debt issuance costs, write-off of other assets, restructuring, severance and related costs, gain on termination of operating lease and gain/loss on change in fair value of warrant liability. Non-GAAP net loss per common share consists of loss per share adjusted for non-GAAP net loss attributable to common stockholders. We believe that making such adjustments provides investors meaningful information to understand our results of operations and the ability to analyze our financial and business trends on a period-to-period basis. We believe the above non-GAAP financial measures are commonly used by investors to evaluate our performance and that of our competitors. However, our use of the term EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP net loss and Non-GAAP net loss per common share may vary from that of others in our industry. None of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP net loss or Non-GAAP net loss per common share should be considered as an alternative to net loss before taxes, net loss, net loss per common share or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP as measures of performance. See the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures table at the end of this press release for a reconciliation of the Non-GAAP financial measures to U.S. GAAP financial measures. ONTRAK, INC.

Nicolet has multiple options for capital deployment, including organic growth, M&A, and capital return to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. Negative None. Financial Analyst Examining Nicolet Bankshares, Inc.'s first quarter financial results, investors may note a marginal drop in net income from $31 million in the previous quarter to $28 million. The decline in net interest income by $1 million and decrease in noninterest income, primarily from lower net asset gains, are contributors to this downturn. Yet, it is worth recognizing that the company has managed to maintain an impressive return on average tangible common equity (17.07%) and return on average assets (1.33%), which are key indicators of financial health. Despite a slight reduction in total assets and deposits, the stable asset quality, as indicated by the nonperforming assets ratio, suggests a solid credit culture within the bank. For an investor, the increment in tangible book value per share to $44.91 signifies growth in shareholder value and the maintenance of a strong capital position could potentially afford the company agility in pursuing future growth strategies like mergers and acquisitions or capital returns to shareholders. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the slight contraction in Nicolet's balance sheet, coupled with modest loan growth, could be indicative of cautious lending in a potentially tightening economic environment. The strategic decision to maintain higher cash reserves post-balance sheet repositioning in 2023 signals a conservative approach, which could be appealing to investors who prioritize stability. Furthermore, the unchanged nonperforming assets ratio implies that the bank has not experienced significant deterioration in credit quality despite economic headwinds. This disciplined risk management could position Nicolet favorably against peers, particularly if the economic climate becomes more challenging. However, the slowing M&A market noted by the CEO may limit near-term growth opportunities, suggesting that the bank's future performance might rely more heavily on organic growth and operational efficiencies. Tax Analyst Investors should not overlook the impact of the change in Wisconsin state tax law on Nicolet’s financials. While the tax benefit resulting from the exemption of certain interest and fees from state taxable income is a positive for future earnings, it required a one-time establishment of a $9.1 million valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. This has been a drag on 2023's earnings but is expected to benefit the company going forward by potentially reducing tax expenses. The reduction in net charge-offs to negligible amounts is an encouraging sign and speaks to the effectiveness of the bank’s credit management strategies. This tax landscape alteration and its effects underline the importance of regulatory changes on a company's bottom line and should be factored into the valuation and future earnings projections for investors. 04/16/2024 - 04:05 PM Well positioned to be opportunistic Net income of $28 million or adjusted net income (non-GAAP) of $26 million for first quarter 2024, compared to net income of $31 million or adjusted net income (non-GAAP) of $28 million in prior quarter, and net loss of $9 million or adjusted net income (non-GAAP) of $22 million for first quarter 2023 Tangible common equity ratio increased to 8.33% for first quarter 2024 Credit quality remains strong with nonperforming assets stable at 0.33% of total assets and negligible net charge-offs Continued strong financial performance metrics for first quarter 2024 17.07% Return on average tangible common equity 1.33% Return on average assets Tangible book value per share increased to $44.91 for first quarter 2024 GREEN BAY, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Nicolet Bankshares, Inc. (NYSE: NIC) (“Nicolet”) announced first quarter 2024 net income of $28 million and earnings per diluted common share of $1.82, compared to net income of $31 million and earnings per diluted common share of $2.02 for fourth quarter 2024, and net loss of $9 million and loss per diluted common share of $0.61 for first quarter 2023. Net income reflected certain non-core items and the related tax effect of each, including the first quarter 2023 balance sheet repositioning and third quarter 2023 change in Wisconsin state tax law, as well as gains / (losses) on other assets and investments in all periods. These non-core items positively impacted earnings per diluted common share $0.10 and $0.17 for first quarter 2024 and fourth quarter 2023, respectively, and negatively impacted earnings per diluted common share $2.06 for first quarter 2023. “Our first quarter results show our focus on execution as we move throughout the year,” said Mike Daniels, Chairman, President, and CEO of Nicolet. “We continue to maintain our relationship-based pricing discipline paired with our credit culture as our team consistently shows the value that we bring. We are encouraged by the results, and we will continue to challenge ourselves to manage both growth and efficiency.” Daniels continued, “Our strong core profitability has allowed us to build capital, which puts us in an enviable position of having significant options going forward. These options include organic growth, M&A, capital return to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. While the M&A market remains slow, we are reviewing opportunities and participating in high-level discussions with potential partners, as we maintain our high degree of discipline with our M&A strategy. Our goal is always to partner with a franchise that makes Nicolet and the communities we serve better.” Nicolet’s 2023 results were significantly impacted by the first quarter 2023 balance sheet repositioning, which included the sale of $500 million (par value) U.S. Treasury held to maturity securities for a pre-tax loss of $38 million or an after-tax loss of $28 million, with the net proceeds used to reduce FHLB borrowings and the remainder held in investable cash. In addition, in July 2023 a new Wisconsin tax law was signed which provided financial institutions with an exemption from state taxable income for interest, fees, and penalties earned on specific loans to existing Wisconsin-based business or agriculture purpose loans. This tax law change to Nicolet moving forward will be a reduction / elimination of State income taxes being expensed; however, it also required a $9.1 million valuation allowance to be established for the State-related deferred tax asset as of the effective date of the legislation. While both provided a drag to 2023 earnings, each also serve as a tailwind for first quarter 2024 and beyond. Balance Sheet Review At March 31, 2024, period end assets were $8.4 billion, down slightly ($22 million) from December 31, 2023, mostly lower cash balances, partly offset by growth in loans. Total loans increased $44 million (1%) from December 31, 2023, with growth in agricultural, commercial and industrial, and residential real estate loans. Total deposits of $7.2 billion at March 31, 2024, decreased $32 million from December 31, 2023, mostly noninterest-bearing demand deposits. Total capital was $1.1 billion at March 31, 2024, an increase of $25 million over December 31, 2023, with earnings partly offset by the quarterly common stock dividend. Asset Quality Nonperforming assets were $28 million and represented 0.33% of total assets at March 31, 2024, unchanged from December 31, 2023, and down from $41 million or 0.50% at March 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses-loans was $64 million and represented 1.01% of total loans at March 31, 2024, compared to $64 million (or 1.00% of total loans) at December 31, 2023, and $62 million (or 1.00% of total loans) at March 31, 2023. Asset quality trends remain solid and loan net charge-offs were negligible. Income Statement Review - Quarter Net income was $28 million and adjusted net income (non-GAAP) was $26 million for first quarter 2024, compared to net income of $31 million and adjusted net income (non-GAAP) of $28 million for fourth quarter 2023. Net interest income was $63 million for first quarter 2024, down $1 million from fourth quarter 2023. Interest income increased $1 million mostly due to the repricing of new and renewed loans in a rising interest rate environment, partly offset by lower investable cash balances, while interest expense increased $2 million due to higher average rates on seasonal deposits. The net interest margin for first quarter 2024 was 3.26%, down 4 bps from 3.30% for fourth quarter 2023. The yield on interest-earning assets increased 12 bps (to 5.44%) mostly due to higher average rates from the repricing of the loan portfolio, while the cost of funds increased 11 bps (to 3.01%) for first quarter 2024, attributable mainly to higher cost seasonal deposits. Noninterest income of $19 million for first quarter 2024 decreased $5 million from fourth quarter 2023, mostly due to the change in net asset gains. First quarter 2024 included net gains of $2 million due to a $1 million gain on sale of an investment security and a $1 million gain on the early extinguishment of subordinated debt, while fourth quarter 2023 included net gains of $6 million from the $9 million pre-tax gain on the sale of Nicolet’s member interest in UFS, LLC, partly offset by a $3 million loss on the sale of certain securities. Excluding the net asset gains (losses), noninterest income for first quarter 2024 was $18 million, a $1 million decrease from fourth quarter 2023, mostly due to changes in the fair value of nonqualified deferred compensation plan assets. Noninterest expense of $47 million for first quarter 2024 decreased $3 million from fourth quarter 2023. Personnel expense was minimally changed with higher salaries and incentives substantially offset by lower health insurance and a decrease in the fair value of nonqualified deferred compensation plan liabilities. Non-personnel expenses decreased $3 million (12%) between the sequential quarters, mostly lower data processing from an early contract termination charge in fourth quarter 2023.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures This communication contains non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP adjusted net income, non-GAAP adjusted earnings per diluted common share, tangible book value per common share, return on average tangible common equity, and tangible common equity to tangible assets. Management believes such measures to be helpful to management, investors and others in understanding Nicolet’s results of operations or financial position. When non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measures, as well as the reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the GAAP financial measures, are provided. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures (Unaudited)” below. The non-GAAP net income measure and related reconciliation provide information useful to investors in understanding the operating performance and trends of Nicolet and also aid investors in comparing Nicolet’s financial performance to the financial performance of peer banks. Management considers non-GAAP financial ratios to be critical metrics with which to analyze and evaluate financial condition and capital strengths. While non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a corporation, they have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.

(1) The adjusted net income measure and related reconciliation provide information useful to investors in understanding the operating performance and trends of Nicolet and also to aid investors in the comparison of Nicolet’s financial performance to the financial performance of peer banks. (2) Provision expense for 2023 is attributable to the expected loss on a bank subordinated debt investment. (3) The effective tax rate for periods prior to the July 1, 2023, effective date of the Wisconsin tax law change assumed an effective tax rate of 25%, and periods subsequent to the effective date assumed an effective tax rate of 19.5%. (4) The adjusted net income reconciliation for first and second quarter 2023 is as originally reported, and has not been restated to reflect the $3 million excess tax expense of those quarters that was subsequently reversed in third quarter 2023 due to the Wisconsin tax law change. Thus, the adjusted net income reconciliation for the quarters of 2023 will not sum to the full year impact. (5) The ratios of tangible book value per common share, return on average tangible common equity, and tangible common equity to tangible assets exclude goodwill and other intangibles, net.

Hunt Transport Services reflect a downturn in their first quarter performance year-over-year. The 9% drop in total operating revenue and a significant 35% decline in EPS indicate pressure on the company's profitability. The combination of decreased load volumes, particularly the 22% fewer loads in Integrated Capacity Solutions and reduced gross revenue per load across various segments, suggests a contraction in both demand and pricing power.From an operational perspective, this could reflect broader economic headwinds or sector-specific challenges such as heightened competition from over-the-road trucking options. The increase in operating expenses, like wages and insurance costs, despite lower purchased transportation costs, highlights rising cost pressures. The company's response, which included cost-cutting measures such as a reduction in net capital expenditures, may help mitigate financial strain in future quarters.For investors, this performance trend warrants attention to subsequent quarters for signs of either continued strain or recovery. The share repurchase activity, with $25 million spent in Q1 and a remaining authorization of $366 million, suggests management's confidence in the long-term value of the stock, yet investors may remain cautious amidst present challenges. Market Research Analyst Examining the logistics sector, where J.B. Hunt operates, we see the company's decreased revenue and operating income as an indicator of reduced market demand and increased price sensitivity among customers. The divergence in performance between segments, with notable losses in the ICS segment and Truckload but slight growth in Final Mile Services, reveals a shifting landscape where specialized delivery services might be more resilient to current market dynamics.The reported 91% customer retention rate in DCS is a positive note, suggesting strong client relationships, yet the need for cost optimization remains evident. These metrics give investors perspective on the market's volatility and the need for J.B. Hunt to adapt strategically, which may include exploring new growth avenues or enhancing operational efficiency.Looking ahead, investors should monitor how fluctuations in fuel costs, the competitive environment and consumer demand impact future revenue and operational strategies. The reported onboarding of new units of container capacity in the JBI segment, despite flat intermodal volume, also suggests an anticipation of market recovery or a strategic expansion to capture more market share when demand rebounds. 04/16/2024 - 04:05 PM First Quarter 2024 Revenue: $2.94 billion; down 9% First Quarter 2024 Operating Income: $194.4 million; down 30% First Quarter 2024 EPS: $1.22 vs. $1.89; down 35% LOWELL, Ark.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (NASDAQ: JBHT) announced first quarter 2024 U.S. GAAP (United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) net earnings of $127.5 million, or diluted earnings per share of $1.22 versus first quarter 2023 net earnings of $197.8 million, or $1.89 per diluted share. Total operating revenue for the current quarter was $2.94 billion compared with $3.23 billion for the first quarter 2023, a decrease of 9%. The decline in revenue was primarily driven by a 9% decrease in segment gross revenue per load in both Intermodal (JBI) and Truckload (JBT), 22% fewer loads in Integrated Capacity Solutions™ (ICS), and a modest decline in average trucks and productivity in Dedicated Contract Services® (DCS®) compared to the prior year period. Revenue declines in JBI, ICS, JBT and DCS were partially offset by Final Mile Services® (FMS) revenue growth of 2%, primarily driven by new contracts implemented over the past year. Current quarter total operating revenue, excluding fuel surcharge revenue, decreased approximately 7% versus the first quarter 2023. Operating income for the current quarter decreased 30% to $194.4 million versus $277.5 million for the first quarter 2023. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to a combination of lower volumes and yield pressure in JBI, ICS and JBT, as well as increases in equipment, insurance and claims, and bad debt expense. Operating income as a percentage of gross revenue decreased year-over-year as a result of higher professional driver and non-driver wages and benefits, equipment, and insurance and claims expenses as a percentage of gross revenue. These items were partially offset by lower rail and truck purchased transportation costs as a percentage of gross revenue. Net interest expense for the current quarter increased approximately 6% from first quarter 2023 due to higher effective interest rates and consolidated debt balance, partially offset by higher interest income. The effective income tax rate increased to 28.7% in the current quarter compared to 24.7% in the first quarter 2023, due to discrete tax items. We continue to expect our 2024 annual tax rate to be between 24.0% and 25.0%. Segment Information: Intermodal (JBI) First Quarter 2024 Segment Revenue: $1.40 billion; down 9% First Quarter 2024 Operating Income: $101.9 million; down 40% Intermodal volume was flat versus the same period in 2023. Transcontinental network loads increased 5%, while eastern network loads decreased 7% compared to the first quarter 2023. Overall demand for our domestic intermodal service offering in the quarter was weaker than expected, partially attributable to competition from over-the-road truck options in the eastern network, and our disciplined approach to the market for the value our services provide. Segment gross revenue decreased 9% from the prior year period, driven by a 9% decrease in segment gross revenue per load, resulting from changes in the mix of freight, customer rates, and fuel surcharge revenue. Revenue per load excluding fuel surcharge revenue was down 8% year-over-year. Operating income decreased 40% in the first quarter primarily from lower yields. JBI segment operating income as a percentage of segment gross revenue declined versus the prior-year period as a result of increases in professional driver and non-driver wages and benefits, higher equipment and maintenance expenses, and insurance premium costs as a percentage of gross revenue. During the period we onboarded approximately 1,140 new units of container capacity. The current period ended with approximately 119,300 units of trailing capacity and approximately 6,300 power units in the dray fleet. Dedicated Contract Services (DCS) First Quarter 2024 Segment Revenue: $860 million; down 2% First Quarter 2024 Operating Income: $93.6 million; down 9% DCS revenue decreased 2% during the current quarter over the same period 2023, driven by a 1% decline in average trucks combined with a 1% decline in productivity (gross revenue per truck per week). Productivity excluding fuel surcharge revenue increased 1% from a year ago driven by contracted indexed-based price escalators, partially offset by an increase in idled equipment. On a net basis, there were 71 fewer revenue producing trucks in the fleet by the end of the quarter compared to the prior-year period, and 2 more versus the end of the fourth quarter 2023. Customer retention rates are approximately 91%, largely reflecting the downsizing of fleets and to a lesser extent account losses. Operating income decreased 9% from the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by lower revenue; increases in insurance premiums, equipment and bad debt expense; and higher new account start-up costs as compared to the prior year period. These items were partially offset by lower maintenance costs and the maturing of new business onboarded over the past trailing twelve months. Integrated Capacity Solutions (ICS) First Quarter 2024 Segment Revenue: $285 million; down 26% First Quarter 2024 Operating Loss: $(17.5) million; vs. $(5.4) million in Q1’23 ICS revenue declined 26% during the current quarter versus the first quarter 2023. Overall segment volume decreased 22% versus the prior year period. Revenue per load decreased 5% compared to the first quarter 2023 due to lower contractual and transactional rates and changes in customer freight mix. Contractual volume represented approximately 57% of the total load volume and 59% of the total revenue in the current quarter compared to 63% and 64%, respectively, in first quarter 2023. Operating loss was $17.5 million compared to operating loss of $5.4 million for the first quarter 2023. Operating performance declined largely due to an $11.0 million decrease in gross profit, higher insurance costs, and integration and transition costs related to the purchase of the brokerage assets of BNSF Logistics. These items were partially offset by lower personnel-related expenses and reduced technology costs. Gross profit declined 21% versus the prior year period as a result of lower volume and revenue, despite gross profit margins improving to 14.3% as compared to 13.4% in the prior year period. ICS carrier base decreased 22% year-over-year, largely driven by changes to carrier qualification requirements to mitigate cargo theft. Final Mile Services (FMS) First Quarter 2024 Segment Revenue: $229 million; up 2% First Quarter 2024 Operating Income: $15.1 million; up 128% FMS revenue increased 2% compared to the same period 2023. The increase was primarily driven by multiple new contracts implemented over the past year and efforts to improve the overall revenue quality of the business. These items were partially offset by general weakness in demand across many of the end markets served. Operating income increased 128% to $15.1 million compared to the prior-year period. First quarter 2024 included a $3.1 million benefit from a prior period claim settlement. Excluding this impact, operating income increased primarily from higher revenue and lower personnel, maintenance, and technology costs. These items were partially offset by higher facility rent expense, insurance premiums, bad debt expense, and loss on equipment sales as compared to the prior year period. Truckload (JBT) First Quarter 2024 Segment Revenue: $178 million; down 13% First Quarter 2024 Operating Income: $1.2 million; down 75% JBT revenue decreased 13% compared to the same period in the previous year. Revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue decreased 13% due to a 9% decline in revenue per load excluding fuel surcharge revenue and a 5% decline in load volume. Total average effective trailer count decreased by approximately 200 units, or 2% versus the prior-year period. Trailer turns in the quarter were down 2% compared to the prior year period primarily due to changes in freight mix and weaker overall freight demand as compared to the first quarter 2023. JBT operating income decreased 75% to $1.2 million compared to the first quarter 2023. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by the decline in revenue. JBT segment operating income as a percentage of segment gross revenue declined versus the prior-year period as a result of higher equipment, maintenance and insurance premium expenses as a percentage of gross revenue.

Mesabi Trust Press Release,2024-04-16T20:05:00.000Z,Neutral,Negative,"Mesabi Trust (MSB) announces a distribution of $0.29 per Unit of Beneficial Interest payable on May 20, 2024, reflecting an increase compared to the previous year due to the restart of Northshore operations and higher royalties received from Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.","Mesabi Trust Press Release Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Mesabi Trust (MSB) announces a distribution of $0.29 per Unit of Beneficial Interest payable on May 20, 2024, reflecting an increase compared to the previous year due to the restart of Northshore operations and higher royalties received from Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. Positive Mesabi Trust declares a distribution of $0.29 per Unit of Beneficial Interest, payable on May 20, 2024. The distribution marks an increase compared to the same period last year when no distribution was declared. The increase is attributed to the restart of Northshore operations in April 2023 and higher royalties received from Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. Total royalty payments of $6,432,434 were received on January 30, 2024, compared to zero dollars received in January 2023. The Trust had not received any royalties in the three previous fiscal quarters until July 30, 2023. Current uncertainties related to previous announcements by Cliffs may impact future distributions. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reinstatement of Mesabi Trust's distribution at $0.29 per unit, especially following a period of no distributions, signals a turnaround in the Trust's revenue stream. This is largely credited to the resumption of Northshore operations. For investors, this uptick in distribution could indicate a restoration of operational stability and potentially improved profitability for the company. Analyzing the year-over-year increase in royalties received in January—from $0 in 2023 to over $6 million in 2024—highlights significant operational improvement. However, the mention of 'current continuing uncertainties' is a cautionary note indicating the potential volatility of future earnings. Mining Industry Expert The operational restart at Northshore, which is underlined as a key contributor to the increased royalties, likely points to an enhanced extraction and production capacity. Northshore's operational dynamics directly influence the Trust's royalty income, hence their output and the prevailing iron ore market prices are important to Mesabi Trust's financial health. Moreover, the distribution increase could reflect positively on Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.'s strategic decisions, suggesting effective management of the mining assets and responsiveness to market conditions. 04/16/2024 - 04:05 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Announcement of Mesabi Trust Distribution The Trustees of Mesabi Trust (NYSE:MSB) declared a distribution of twenty-nine cents ($0.29) per Unit of Beneficial Interest payable on May 20, 2024 to Mesabi Trust Unitholders of record at the close of business on April 30, 2024. This compares to no distribution declared for the same period last year. The Trustees’ announcement today of a twenty-nine cents ($0.29) per Unit distribution, as compared to no distribution announced by the Trust at the same time last year, reflects an increase in the distribution compared to the same period in the prior year, and is primarily attributable to the restart of Northshore operations in April 2023, and to an increase in the total royalties received by the Trust in January 2024, as compared to the total royalties received by the Trust in January 2023. In particular, the Trust’s receipt of total royalty payments of $6,432,434 on January 30, 2024 from Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (“Cliffs”), the parent company of Northshore Mining Company (“Northshore”), was higher than the total royalty payments of zero dollars ($0.00) received by the Trust from Cliffs in January 2023. The distribution announced today also reflects that, until July 30, 2023, the Trust had received no royalties in the Trust’s three previous fiscal quarters, as well as the current continuing uncertainties related to previous announcements by Cliffs about its intention to continue to treat Northshore as a swing operation. Accordingly, the Trustees’ decision announced today also reflects their determination to maintain an appropriate level of reserves in order to make adequate provision to meet current and future expenses and present and future liabilities (whether fixed or contingent) that may arise in the future. The Trustees have received no specific updates on Cliffs’ plans for the current year concerning Northshore iron ore operations. The Trustees’ distribution announcement today also takes into account numerous other factors, including uncertainties resulting from Cliffs’ prior announcements to increase the use of scrap iron in its vertical supply chain planning, the potential volatility in the iron ore and steel industries generally, national and global economic uncertainties, the cost and expense related to the Trust’s pending arbitration against Northshore and Cliffs, and further potential disturbances from global unrest. Quarterly royalty payments from Northshore for iron ore production and shipments during the first calendar quarter, which are payable to Mesabi Trust under the royalty agreement, are due April 30, 2024, together with the quarterly royalty report. After receiving the quarterly royalty report, Mesabi Trust plans to file a summary of the quarterly royalty report with the Securities and Exchange Commission in a Current Report on Form 8-K. Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains certain forward-looking statements with respect to Northshore operations in 2024 and other matters, which statements are intended to be made under the safe harbor protections of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Cliffs’ actual utilization of the Northshore operations could differ materially from current expectations due to inherent risks and uncertainties such as general adverse business and industry economic trends, uncertainties arising from war, terrorist events, recession, potential future impacts of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and other global events, higher or lower customer demand for steel and iron ore, decisions by mine operators regarding curtailments or idling of production lines or entire plants, announcements and implementation of trade tariffs, environmental compliance uncertainties, difficulties in obtaining and renewing necessary operating permits, higher imports of steel and iron ore substitutes, processing difficulties, consolidation and restructuring in the domestic steel market, and other factors. Although the Mesabi Trustees believe that any such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Additional information concerning these and other risks and uncertainties is contained in the Trust’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2023 and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2023. Mesabi Trust undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any of the forward-looking statements made herein to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof.
