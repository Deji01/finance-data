That was almost 6% higher than a year earlier, and marked the largest monthly increase in a year.The median home price also increased almost 6% to $384,500, an all-time high for the month of February, and marking the eighth consecutive month of year over year gains.Still, sales were down from February 2023, signaling some tightness in the market. On the bright side, there were 1.07 million homes available for sale at the end of February, a gain of 10% from a year ago.The uptick in inventory is a positive for homebuyers, who have long been dealing with a lack of options on the market. However, most activity seen last month stuck to the upper end, as entry-level homes remained scarce.“Maybe the absolute low point in inventory is over,” Lawrence Yun, chief economist at NAR, told reporters in a conference call Thursday. “We are seeing more inventory showing up in the market and consequently maybe this is one big factor as to why we are seeing an increase in home sales: more choices for consumers.”Thu, March 21, 2024 at 11:45 AM PDTAlexandra CanalNelson Peltz secures key support in proxy campaign against DisneyNelson Peltz just received key backing in his high-profile proxy battle against Disney (DIS).Influential proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) recommended shareholders vote for Peltz of Trian Fund Management to join Disney's board — contradicting the view of another high-profile firm Glass Lewis. The endorsement could breathe new life into Peltz's campaign.Peltz is currently seeking board seats for himself and former Disney CFO Jay Rasulo.In a report published Thursday and viewed by Yahoo Finance, ISS said Peltz ""as a significant shareholder, could be additive to the succession process, providing assurance to other investors that the board is properly engaged this time around. He could also help evaluate future capital allocation decisions.""""Peltz, with his considerable experience on other boards and fiduciary duties owed to a large shareholding group, appears best positioned to bring a shareholder perspective to the board,"" the firm added.Notably, ISS said shareholders should not vote for Rasulo's addition to the board. It also advised shareholders against voting for activist Blackwells Capital's nominees and to withhold their vote against current Disney board member Maria Elena Lagomasino.Blackwells supports the company's current board but has urged shareholders to vote for its three nominees as additions to it.On Monday, Glass Lewis recommended shareholders support the company's current board and withhold votes for the nominees put forth by Trian and Blackwells. The firm said CEO Bob Iger's recent initiatives to turn around the business have delivered positive results.ISS acknowledged these ""positive changes,"" saying it recognizes that ""some shareholders may feel that the company has sufficiently course corrected.""""Nonetheless, given the major missteps and severe consequences of the failed 2020 succession, particularly for a company that already had a history of succession drama, it may be difficult for others to simply trust that the board, albeit refreshed, will get it right this time,"" the firm said.If the proxy battle continues to a vote, a shareholder meeting set to take place on April 3 will ultimately determine the board's fate.Read more here.Thu, March 21, 2024 at 11:20 AM PDT Josh SchaferWith the Fed's story largely unchanged, bull market rules are at play for stocksWith Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell noting the inflation story hasn't changed, stocks are once again in rally mode as fears the Fed may cut less than expected appear to have been abated for now.The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up about 0.5% as areas of the market that could benefit from the Fed's projection of higher than anticipated economic growth are leading the way.""What we're seeing is in we're in a bull market and bull market rules apply,"" Truist Co-CIO Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance Live.

""If we do have a pullback, which we will have, use those as an opportunity.""Thu, March 21, 2024 at 10:40 AM PDTBrian SozziScenes from the Reddit IPO day roadI have spent half of the day down on the NYSE trading floor working the Reddit IPO (RDDT). Tons of fun being in the middle of the action on a buzzy IPO.A couple things I picked up on Reddit over the course of a few hours:The company opted against making a big advertising splash at the NYSE. There was no banner out front of the exchange, no big swag giveaways down on the floor. The message was clear (at least to me): the company gets they need to start making sustainable profits.Spent some time off camera with Reddit's co-founder and CEO Steve Huffman. He shared he is about to be a first-time father. After continuing this chat, I just didn't get the sense he will be the person that dumps all of his stock anytime soon and leaves investors holding the bag. You can tell his passion for what he helped create is authentic.Reading the tea leaves, Reddit probably has a few more AI deals in the works similar to the one it announced pre-IPO with Google (GOOGL). I think Huffman realizes these deals will help reach profitability ahead of when most investors currently believe.Thu, March 21, 2024 at 10:26 AM PDT Josh SchaferReddit opens trading at $47Shares of Reddit (RDDT) opened on the New York Stock Exchange at $47 per share.The stock quickly gained further, sitting at about $55 per share less than 10 minutes into trading.

And a surprise decision from the Swiss National Bank to cut rates also pushed the Swiss franc lower.With the stock market making new record highs, the odds are quickly rising that the “critical juncture” that we’ve been harping on will resolve itself with more upside movement, according to Matt Maley at Miller Tabak + Co.Story continues“We still believe that a short-term pullback could take place at any time,” Maley said. “However, if it doesn’t come quickly and sharply — the odds that it will become a full-blown correction will drop.”To Societe Generale SA strategists, there’s no stopping to the rally in US stocks against a backdrop of improving outlook for corporate earnings and the frenzy around artificial intelligence.The team led by Manish Kabra boosted its year-end target for the S&P 500 to 5,500 points from 4,750 — the highest forecast among strategists tracked by Bloomberg.“US exceptionalism is going from strength to strength,” Kabra wrote in a note. “Despite widespread market optimism, we view this as rational rather than excessive, as profit growth continues to increase and set new records for the S&P 500.”Despite strong gains in equity markets, “we are extremely excited about the investing landscape” said the GMO Asset Allocation team.“An abundance of cheap assets underpins this enthusiasm from an absolute return standpoint, while appealing valuation spreads within asset classes present us with the best relative asset allocation opportunity we’ve seen in 35 years,” the firm said.Looking at previous periods when the Fed was on hold shows that the current pause now ranks second in terms of duration, according to an analysis from Ryan Grabinski at Strategas Securities, through March 20.“The good news is that the longer they hold, the more the market has historically moved higher,” he noted.In periods where the pause is greater than 100 days, the market is up on average 13% compared to when the pause is less than 100 days and the market on average is down, Grabinski said. The best performance occurred during the 2006-2007 pause which was also the longest and resulted in the S&P 500 rising 22%.Meantime, rally-chasing investors who rode US equities higher this year have flocked to an upward trend occurring outside of just the so-called Magnificent Seven that have dominated the market: the one taking place in quality stocks.As traders have been enamored by artificial intelligence, they’ve also piled into stocks of companies across the broader market with high profitability and strong fundamentals, according to Piper Sandler & Co.’s Michael Kantrowitz.“AI is a subset of what’s driving momentum, but the rest is good old quality fundamental,” Kantrowitz said.Corporate Highlights:The US Justice Department and 16 attorneys general sued Apple Inc., accusing the iPhone maker of violating antitrust laws by blocking rivals from accessing hardware and software features on its popular devices.Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google are set to face full-blown European Union investigations into their compliance with a new law reining in the power of Big Tech, paving the way for potentially hefty fines.Boeing Co. directors plan to meet with top executives from some of their largest airline customers, who are growing increasingly frustrated about the planemaker’s crisis tearing into their business.Nelson Peltz received the backing of an influential shareholder advisory firm and a group of business leaders in his bid to join the board of entertainment company Walt Disney Co.Darden Restaurants Inc. is seeing lower-income consumers pull back, Chief Executive Officer Rick Cardenas said, depriving some of the company’s major brands a key revenue stream.Gildan Activewear Inc.’s largest investor said the clothing maker’s shares are undervalued, signaling that potential acquirers circling the company may need to pay up to win shareholders’ support.Key events this week:Japan CPI, FridayGermany IFO business climate, FridayAtlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic speaks, FridayECB’s Robert Holzmann and Philip Lane speak, FridaySome of the main moves in markets:StocksThe S&P 500 rose 0.5% as of 2:25 p.m. New York timeThe Nasdaq 100 rose 0.7%The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8%The MSCI World index rose 0.8%CurrenciesThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.4%The euro fell 0.6% to $1.0860The British pound fell 1% to $1.2660The Japanese yen fell 0.3% to 151.69 per dollarCryptocurrenciesBitcoin fell 2.6% to $65,307.44Ether fell 0.6% to $3,440.6BondsThe yield on 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 4.27%Germany’s 10-year yield declined three basis points to 2.41%Britain’s 10-year yield declined two basis points to 4.00%CommoditiesWest Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.3% to $81.05 a barrelSpot gold fell 0.2% to $2,181.06 an ounceThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.--With assistance from Alexandra Semenova and Sagarika Jaisinghani.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekElon Musk’s Don Lemon ImplosionWall Street and Silicon Valley Elites Are Warming Up to TrumpWeight-Loss-Drug Users Pay Up for Help Ditching the Pricey MedsMagnificent Seven?

Motley Fool,Why Chewy Stock Dropped on Thursday,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-chewy-stock-dropped-thursday-192200980.html,Management issued a downbeat outlook for the coming fiscal year.,"Chewy (NYSE: CHWY) stock found itself in the doghouse on Thursday. Shares fell 6% through early afternoon trading, compared to a modest uptick in the S&P 500. That move contributed to a rough year for owners of the pet supply retailer, which is down over 50% in the past 12 months.Thursday's slump was sparked by some discouraging news on the earnings front .Barking up the wrong treeChewy executives reported Q4 operating results before the market opened, and Wall Street wasn't thrilled with the details. While the e-commerce specialist boosted sales and improved its profit margin, both metrics were sluggish. Looking deeper into the results reveals some caution signs for the future.Specifically, Chewy continued to shed customers. Its active shopper pool fell 1.6% for the year to mark an acceleration over the prior year's 1.2% drop. The company offset that pressure by raising prices and moving slightly higher volume through its delivery network. Yet it was still discouraging to learn that Chewy is no closer to logging a rebound in its core active-customer metric.Looking aheadManagement said they were as excited as ever about Chewy's long-term growth initiatives, which include its push into pet healthcare and entry into the Canadian market. The business is profitable and cash-flow positive, after all, and its e-commerce shoppers remain highly engaged with the platform.Unfortunately, the next year will be characterized by an even tougher selling environment. Prices won't rise like they did in 2023, management warned, because inflation has cooled. Volumes will likely be pressured because pet adoption rates are down. Overall, there's little reason to be excited about a growth rebound occurring in the next year or so.These projections don't mean it's time to abandon Chewy's stock. But they do suggest that its business will struggle through at least one more year of unusually weak results as the pandemic-growth hangover continues pressuring the pet supply industry.Story continuesShould you invest $1,000 in Chewy right now?Before you buy stock in Chewy, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Chewy wasn’t one of them.

TheStreet,Here's how Reddit's first day on the stock market went,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-reddits-first-day-stock-185834918.html,Shares of Reddit jumped more than 60% during its first day of trading.,"Fast FactsReddit debuted Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker ""RDDT."" The stock spiked as much as 70% above its IPO price of $34 throughout the trading day. At its peak on Thursday, Reddit boasted a $10 billion market cap. Reddit, the 19-year-old social media platform, debuted on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday under the ticker ""RDDT."" Shares of the company soared as much as 70% above its initial public offering (IPO) price of $34 — at its peak, Reddit was valued at around $10 billion.This spike softened in the early afternoon; as of the time of writing, Reddit was trading at $48 per share, up around 42% from its IPO price with a market cap of $7.7 billion.The IPO valued Reddit at $6.4 billion, with the company and its selling shareholders raising nearly $750 million.Related: Expert on government-commissioned AI threat report: A lot of hype, but a good planThe debut marks the end of a lengthy journey undertaken by the company to go public, which began in 2021 when Reddit confidentially filed a draft of its IPO.Reddit officially filed its IPO prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission in February, detailing a net loss of $90 million for 2023 on revenue of $804 million.Reddit at the same time announced a deal with Google that, for $60 million a year, will allow Google to, among other things, train its artificial intelligence models on Reddit's content.The company also set aside 8% of the shares on offer for certain Reddit users and moderators, in addition to friends and family members of company insiders.It marks the first social media IPO since Pinterest went public in 2019.Related: Popular social media platform to sell user data to the company behind ChatGPTr/Wall Street reactsThe debut, according to FirstMark Capital founder and partner Rick Heitzmann, is a ""litmus test for the IPO buyer sentiment because it's not a premium company. It's at the end of its social cycle. Yet there's tons of demand.""Story continuesHe told CNBC Wednesday that he expects the stock to ""trade up"" upon its debut.While Wedbush's Dan Ives acknowledged that the burgeoning AI sector presents a strong opportunity for Reddit to monetize its enormous data piles, he said that now, the question is all about execution.""Can they be successful and can they monetize? Now it's just, not just talk the talk, walk the walk. Execute on the numbers,"" Ives told CNBC. ""Where in the social media tiering structure can they be.""Deepwater's Gene Munster said that this IPO is not really about the fundamentals. The future potential of the stock is all about profitability and ad spending, he said, saying the journey toward that kind of growth will determine whether Reddit can ""live up to its meme stock potential.""""Grab the popcorn, throw out the fundamentals, and enjoy Reddit's first day of trading,"" he said. ""Safe to say, the longs and shorts will battle it out over the next month.""Many users in r/WallStreetBets, meanwhile, expressed their eagerness to short the stock.Contact Ian with AI stories via email, ian.krietzberg@thearenagroup.net, or Signal 732-804-1223."
