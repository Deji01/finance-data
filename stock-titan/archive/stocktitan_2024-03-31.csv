(NYSE: AEON; AEON.WS), please note that in the first paragraph it incorrectly referenced March 29, 2024 as the Redemption Date. The Redemption Date is April 29, 2024. March 29, 2024 is the date on which the notice of redemption was delivered to warrant holders. The corrected release follows: AEON Biopharma, Inc. (NYSE: AEON; AEON.WS) (“AEON” or “the Company”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing a proprietary botulinum toxin complex for the treatment of multiple debilitating medical conditions, today announced that the Company will redeem all of its outstanding warrants (the “Public Warrants”) to purchase shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”), that were issued under the Warrant Agreement, dated February 8, 2021 (the “Warrant Agreement”), by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent (the “Warrant Agent”), as part of the units sold in the Company’s initial public offering (the “IPO”), for a redemption price of $0.10 per Public Warrant (the “Redemption Price”), that remain outstanding at 5:00 p.m. New York City time on April 29, 2024 (the “Redemption Date”). Warrants to purchase Common Stock that were issued under the Warrant Agreement in a private placement simultaneously with the IPO and still held by the initial holders thereof or their permitted transferees are not subject to this redemption. Under the terms of the Warrant Agreement, the Company is entitled to redeem all of the outstanding Public Warrants if the last sales price of the Common Stock is at least $10.00 per share on any twenty trading days within any thirty-day trading period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which a notice of redemption is given. At the direction of the Company, the Warrant Agent has delivered a notice of redemption to each of the registered holders of the outstanding Public Warrants. In addition, in accordance with the Warrant Agreement, the Company’s board of directors has elected to require that, upon delivery of the notice of redemption, all Public Warrants are to be exercised only on a “cashless basis.” Accordingly, holders may no longer exercise Public Warrants and receive Common Stock in exchange for payment in cash of the $11.50 per warrant exercise price. Any Public Warrants that remain unexercised at 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the Redemption Date will be delisted, void and no longer exercisable, and the holders will have no rights with respect to those Public Warrants, except to receive the Redemption Price (or as otherwise described in the redemption notice for holders who hold their Public Warrants in “street name”). The number of shares of Common Stock that each exercising warrant holder will receive by virtue of the cashless exercise (instead of paying the $11.50 per Public Warrant cash exercise price) will be calculated in accordance with the terms of the Warrant Agreement and will be equal to the number of shares determined by reference to the Fair Market Value of Class A Common Stock table in Section 6.2 of the Warrant Agreement and the Redemption Fair Market Value as of the Redemption Date. The Redemption Fair Market Value means the volume weighted average price of the Common Stock for the ten trading days immediately following the date of the notice of redemption. If any holder of Public Warrants would, after taking into account all of such holder’s Public Warrants exercised at one time, be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share of Common Stock, the number of shares the holder will be entitled to receive will be rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares. Questions concerning redemption and exercise of the Public Warrants can be directed to Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, 1 State Street, 30th Floor, New York, New York 10004, Attention: Compliance Department, telephone number (212) 509-4000.

CH Auto filed an application with the CSRC to list its Class A ordinary shares on a US exchange, potentially Nasdaq. Completion of the Business Combination was conditioned upon CH Auto's Class A ordinary shares being approved for listing on Nasdaq, which was waived to consummate the merger. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The completion of the business combination between CH Auto Technology Corporation Ltd. and Mountain Crest Acquisition Corp. IV represents a significant shift in the electric vehicle (EV) landscape, particularly within the context of U.S.-China economic relations. The merger facilitates a new phase for CH Auto, potentially enabling the company to leverage Mountain Crest's position to access capital markets and broaden its investor base. However, the non-listing of CH Auto's securities post-merger until CSRC approval is obtained introduces uncertainty for investors. This move may signal a strategic pause as the company navigates regulatory compliance, which could impact investor sentiment and the liquidity of the stock.Additionally, the merger's completion without the prior condition of Nasdaq listing approval suggests a confidence in the eventual positive outcome with the CSRC. This could be interpreted as a strong statement of intent from CH Auto to become a significant player in the global EV market. However, the lack of immediate listing may dampen the enthusiasm for those seeking quick returns, shifting the focus towards a long-term investment horizon. The emphasis on innovation and global market penetration by CH Auto's leadership indicates a forward-looking strategy that may reshape competitive dynamics in the EV sector, particularly in terms of technology transfer and market entry strategies. Financial Analyst The business combination's structure, involving share conversions and rights, is a complex financial maneuver that affects shareholder value and equity dilution. The conversion of MCAF units into shares of Common Stock and the subsequent exchange for Class A ordinary shares of CH Auto will alter the capital structure and could influence the company's valuation. Investors will need to closely monitor the ratio of rights conversion to understand the potential dilution and its impact on their investment.From a financial perspective, the immediate cessation of MCAF's trading on Nasdaq and the current non-listed status of CH Auto's securities could lead to volatility and a potential decrease in the liquidity of shares. This situation requires investors to consider the trade-offs between the potential for long-term growth in the EV market and the short-term challenges of limited marketability of their shares. Furthermore, the uncertainty surrounding the CSRC's approval process adds a layer of regulatory risk that must be factored into any investment decision related to CH Auto. Legal Expert The legal complexities of a cross-border merger such as the one between CH Auto and Mountain Crest Acquisition Corp. IV are considerable, particularly given the regulatory environments of both the PRC and the U.S. The decision to waive the conditions for Nasdaq listing and CSRC approval prior to completing the merger is a significant legal maneuver that indicates a willingness to navigate the PRC's regulatory framework post-merger. This strategy suggests a calculated risk by the companies involved, possibly reflecting confidence in their ability to comply with CSRC regulations.Investors should be aware of the legal implications of such a merger, including the potential for delays in the CSRC approval process and the impact this may have on the future liquidity and trading of CH Auto's securities. The legal framework governing these transactions is complex and can affect timelines, shareholder rights and ultimately, the success of the business combination in achieving its strategic objectives. 03/30/2024 - 10:29 PM BEIJING and NEW YORK, March 30, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CH Auto Technology Corporation Ltd. (“CHATC”), a company formed under the laws of the Peoples Republic of China (“PRC”), an electric vehicle manufacturing and design service company based in China, and Mountain Crest Acquisition Corp. IV (Nasdaq: MCAF), a Delaware corporation that was a publicly-traded special purpose acquisition company (“MCAF”), today announced that on March 28, 2024, the closing of their business combination transaction occurred, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended and restated on December 23, 2022 and further amended on March 1, 2023, the “Merger Agreement”) by and among the CHATC, MCAF, CH Auto, Inc., a Cayman Islands exempted company (“CH Auto”) and CH-Auto Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of CH Auto (“Merger Sub”). In accordance with the Merger Agreement, among other things, CH Auto became the owner of 71.2184% of the voting rights of CHATC and Merger Sub merged with and into MCAF (the “Merger”), with MCAF being the surviving corporation (the “Business Combination”). Qun Lu, the founder and CEO of CHAFC, will continue to lead CH Auto, the parent company, as its Chairman, CEO and CFO after closing of the Business Combination. Pursuant to the Merger, (i) each MCAF Unit, comprised of one share of MCAF common stock (“Common Stock”) and one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of a share of Common Stock upon the consummation of an initial business combination (the “Rights”), was converted into one share of Common Stock and one Right; (ii) each issued and outstanding share of Common Stock was exchanged for one Class A ordinary share of CH Auto (“CH Auto Ordinary Shares”); and (iii) all the Rights were converted into CH Auto Ordinary Shares on a 10 to 1 basis (i.e. for every 10 Rights one CH Auto Ordinary Share is issued).

Following the Business Combination, the securities of CH Auto, including its Class A ordinary shares, will not be listed for trading on any securities exchange. As a PRC company, CH Auto cannot list its securities on an exchange in the United States unless it completes the filing procedure with the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission (“CSRC”), a PRC government agency. CH Auto has filed an application with the CSRC to complete the filing procedure to list its Class A ordinary shares on an exchange in the United States, and is awaiting a definitive response from CSRC. In the event CH Auto completes the CSRC filing procedure, CH Auto plans to list its securities on The Nasdaq Stock Market. There can be no assurance that CH Auto will receive the necessary approval from CSRC or that its securities will trade on The Nasdaq Stock Market. While the Merger Agreement provided that the closing of the Business Combination was conditioned upon, among other things, (i) CH Auto’s Class A ordinary shares shall have been approved for listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market and (ii) all consents, approvals and actions of, filings with and notices to any Governmental Authority, including the CSRC, required to consummate the Business Combination shall have been made or obtained. However, as previously disclosed in the Prospectus, dated September 28, 2023, CHATC, MCAF, CH Auto and Merger Sub had the option to waive such conditions, and ultimately CHATC, MCAF, CH Auto and Merger Sub did waive those conditions to consummate the Business Combination. “CH Auto Inc. and its subsidiary company Qiantu Motor are a high-tech automotive industrial organization with what we believe to be revolutionary innovative technology,” said Qun Lu, the Chairman, CEO and CFO of CH Auto. Mr. Lu continued “Our advanced mechanical architecture and lightweight alloy materials have placed us good position in the field of new energy vehicles. While our roots and foundation are in China, our long-term vision is to become a globally integrated multinational enterprise with an international perspective.” Mr. Lu stated further that “This business combination with Mountain Crest IV marks only the beginning of our globalization strategy, as we aim to target global markets including the United States, positioning CH Auto as pioneers in Chinese new energy vehicle technology on a global scale."" “I am thrilled to see the successful completion of another business combination of the Mountain Crest franchise, and CH Auto, as one of the first EV automakers in China with proven technology breakthroughs and manufacturing expertise, is tackling an important mission to deliver innovation and growth in electric mobility,” said Dr. Suying Liu, Chairman, CEO and CFO of MCAF.

Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The shipment of the first flight model CONDOR Mk3 optical head by Mynaric AG marks a significant milestone in the company's operational timeline. This event signals the transition from developmental stages to tangible product delivery, which can potentially lead to revenue generation. The update on volume production and shipment expectations suggests a positive trajectory in the company's manufacturing capabilities. Investors may view this as an indication of Mynaric's ability to meet market demand and scale operations effectively.It is important to understand the implications of the CONDOR Mk3's market potential. As a key component in laser communication systems for airborne and space applications, the optical head's performance and reliability are critical.

However, the actual impact on the company's financials will depend on the successful integration of the product by customers and subsequent demand. Financial Analyst The commencement of serial production and the shipment of the CONDOR Mk3 optical head by Mynaric AG has direct implications for the company's financial projections and stock valuation. Given that this update follows the previously provided expectations, investors will be keen on comparing the actual production and shipment figures against those forecasts. Any significant deviation, either positive or negative, could influence investor sentiment and stock performance.Furthermore, the announcement's timing, in relation to quarterly financial reporting, can affect short-term stock volatility as the market assimilates this new information. Long-term implications hinge on the company's ability to maintain the production ramp-up and manage costs associated with scaling, which could affect profit margins.

The products were distributed in multiple states between January and March 2024. The recall was initiated after an equipment failure issue at ADM's animal feed manufacturing facility in Quincy, Illinois. Positive None. Negative None. Veterinary Nutritionist The recall of animal feed products by ADM Animal Nutrition is a significant event that underscores the importance of quality control in the production of animal feed. Elevated levels of certain minerals can have detrimental effects on livestock health, leading to conditions such as leg deformities in chickens or bone deformities in swine. These health issues not only cause animal welfare concerns but also impact the productivity and profitability of farms. For instance, reduced feed intake and feed conversion can lead to slower growth rates and increased production costs due to the need for additional feed to achieve the desired weight for market.From a nutritional standpoint, maintaining the correct balance of minerals like calcium, phosphorus and magnesium is critical for the growth and development of livestock. An excess of these minerals can disrupt the metabolic processes and lead to the aforementioned health issues. The recall indicates that ADM Animal Nutrition is taking corrective actions to address the problem, which is a positive response in terms of corporate responsibility. However, the incident may lead to a loss of trust among consumers and could potentially affect the company's market share in the competitive animal feed industry. Supply Chain Risk Analyst The recall of ADM's animal feed products due to elevated levels of minerals highlights the risks associated with supply chain and manufacturing processes. Equipment failure at the Quincy, Illinois facility has led to this significant recall, reflecting the potential for operational disruptions to have widespread effects. The impact on ADM's supply chain is multifaceted, including the immediate financial costs associated with the recall, potential legal liabilities due to the reported livestock deaths and the logistical challenges of coordinating the return and refund process for the affected products.Long-term implications may involve reevaluation of equipment maintenance schedules, quality control procedures and possibly investments in new technology to prevent future incidents. The recall also serves as a reminder for companies in the animal nutrition industry to continually monitor their supply chains for vulnerabilities and to develop robust contingency plans to mitigate risks. The direct communication with customers and swift action to remove products from shelves are commendable from a crisis management perspective, but the incident will likely prompt a review of internal processes to strengthen safeguards against future quality control issues. Financial Analyst ADM's recall of multiple lots of animal feed products due to elevated mineral levels poses financial implications for the company. Short-term costs include the logistics of the recall process, refunds to customers and potential settlements for reported livestock losses. The market may react to this news with concerns over ADM's operational oversight and quality control, potentially influencing the company's stock price negatively. Investors will be attentive to how ADM manages the recall and any strategies they implement to prevent future incidents.Long-term financial impacts depend on ADM's ability to restore consumer confidence and maintain its market position. If the recall leads to significant changes in operational procedures or regulatory scrutiny, the associated costs could affect future earnings. Furthermore, the incident may prompt a broader industry-wide examination of feed quality standards, which could result in increased regulatory compliance costs. Investors should monitor ADM's response to the recall and any announcements regarding measures to address the underlying issues that led to the elevated mineral levels in their products. 03/30/2024 - 04:30 PM Specific lots may contain elevated levels of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium and/or chloride and may harm chickens, swine, beef cattle and equine QUINCY, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ADM Animal Nutrition, a division of ADM (NYSE: ADM), is recalling the following products: Pen Pals® Chicken Starter-Grower 25-lb bag (Product No 70009ACF46); Pen Pals Chicken Starter-Grower 50-lb bag (Product No. 70009AAA44); Pen Pals Chicken Starter-Grower 25-lb case (Product No. 70009AAABE); MoorMan’s ShowTec Sale Burst w/DF DEN 50-lb. bag (Product No 21256CVWE4); MoorMan's Show-Tec Burst Starter with DFCTC/DEN 50-lb. bag (Product No: 24320AYWE4); ShowTec BB 18 BMD 50-lb. bag (Product No. 18241AGNE4); ShowTec 14.5/6 BMD 50-lb. bag (Product No. 14560AGN); AMPT-A CTC/IGR 50-lb. bag (Product No. 54229XNK); ShowTec Hi Fat 18 BMD 50-lb. bag (Product No. 18007AGN); Seniorglo 50-lb. bag (Product No. 10130AB) and MotivAte 12-15 DEN 50-lb. bag (Product No. 12286CVW).
