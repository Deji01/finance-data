Blackwells supports the company's current board but has urged shareholders to vote for its three nominees as additions to it.If the proxy battle continues to a vote, a shareholder meeting set to take place on April 3 will ultimately determine the board's fate.Last year, Peltz and his hedge fund renewed a push to shake up Disney's board as the stock price hit multiyear lows.Disney has been grappling with challenges that include a declining linear TV business, slower growth in its parks business, and losses in its streaming business.Although Glass Lewis did point to those challenges, which have also included a high-profile political battle with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and concerns surrounding succession, the firm said CEO Bob Iger's recent initiatives to turn around the business have delivered positive results.""Most recent reported quarters suggest these efforts do, indeed, have promise, which we believe substantially raises the bar for change at this time,"" Glass Lewis said.Read more here.Mon, March 18, 2024 at 9:42 AM PDTInes FerréRivian owners can now access Tesla's Supercharger network, shares jumpRivian (RIVN) stock jumped more than 3% on Monday after the electric vehicle maker confirmed in a blogpost owners can now access the Tesla (TSLA) Supercharger network, adding another automaker to Tesla's charging businessYahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports:Starting at 12:00PM Eastern time, Rivian owners were now able to use Tesla Superchargers equipped with an NACS (North American Charging Standard) plug by attaching a complimentary adapter issued by Rivian, or by using a certified NACS to CCS1 (Combined Charging Standard) adapter to plug into their Rivian EVs to charge.

He will be replaced by Gil West, former chief operating officer of Delta Airlines.""Scherr’s departure suggests HTZ faces greater operational challenges that need a more ‘hands on’ approach to execution,” noted Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas. The firm has an EqualWeight rating on the stock with a $10 price target.The leadership change comes after a reversal in Hertz's electric vehicle strategy. In January the rental company said it would sell 20,000 EVs, or about a third of its fleet, in a shift back to gas-powered vehicles.Hertz has had multiple CEOs since 2014. In 2021 the company emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy and went public again on the Nasdaq with symbol HTZ.In 2021, Hertz outlined plans to electrify its entire fleet and said it would order up to 100,000 Tesla Model 3 sedans.Mon, March 18, 2024 at 8:45 AM PDT Josh SchaferElevated immigration to boost US economic growth, Goldman Sachs saysGoldman Sachs believes the US economy will grow faster than it originally expected this year as increased immigration adds more workers to the US labor force.In a new research note on Sunday, Goldman cited increased immigration when raising its forecast for economic growth year over year in the fourth quarter to 2.4% from 2.1%. For the full year, Goldman now sees the US economy growing at a 2.7% annualized rate.""One likely reason why GDP growth was stronger in 2023 is that immigration ran well above the recent historical average, boosting the size of the labor force and potential GDP,"" Goldman Sachs economist Ronnie Walker wrote in a research note on Sunday. ""We have updated our payrolls and GDP forecasts to incorporate the ongoing boost from above-trend immigration.""Goldman's research suggests that immigration was 1.5 million above trend in 2023 and will come in 1 million above trend in 2024. To the team at Goldman, this helps explain the surprise job creation seen in the labor market over the last year, as well as the higher-than-expected growth seen across the economy.Read more here.

We believe Netflix's large scale, strong engagement (around 2 hours/day), and diversified content will continue to push the platform toward becoming global TV over time — i.e., the default choice for where users will consume long-form video content.""And then his brief analysis on the upcoming Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul fight on Netflix:""Netflix continues to build out its sports content, primarily targeting sports entertainment and shoulder programming. Key examples include WWE Raw, Formula 1: Drive to Survive, Full Swing, Break Point, Quarterback, Tour de France: Unchained, The Netflix Slam, etc. Importantly, Netflix is partnering with Most Valuable Promotions (MVP) to stream its third live sports event ever, a heavyweight boxing mega-event headlined by Jake Paul and Mike Tyson on July 20. We believe the fight could be the most watched boxing match ever given ease of access and NFLX’s large global subscriber base, and it should attract meaningful ad dollars while also boosting a seasonally slower period in mid-summer. While Netflix’s current focus is sports entertainment and shoulder content, we do not rule out a bigger push into live sports over time.""Mon, March 18, 2024 at 4:30 AM PDTBrian SozziHow Nvidia is seen by investors could change again this weekAsk most holders of Nvidia's (NVDA) stock what the company does and they will probably say ""chipmaker.""But that definition may change this week after Nvidia's GTC conference, which starts today. And it has to change if Nvidia's market cap is to continue to expand beyond its eye-popping $2.2 trillion level seen today.Good point on this front from Stifel's tech analyst Ruben Roy:""While we think that it has become evident that Nvidia is no longer a “chip” company, the company’s hardware innovations, roadmap, and time-to-market expectations are critically important given the emergence of several layers of potential competition including AMD (AMD) GPU platforms, various AI accelerator alternatives and accelerating efforts from most large CSPs to develop captive AI silicon. Given recent press reports, we would expect Nvidia to address the potential for further diversification of its technology road-map with potential custom application specific silicon offerings. On this front, while we think that this sort of technology expansion would make sense, we would view this as a long-term strategic effort given the time and investment required to develop an ASIC business.""Coverage reminderYahoo Finance's resident Nvidia expert — Tech Editor Dan Howley — is stationed at GTC. Be sure to follow his reporting on our platform and on X @DanielHowley. Give his GTC preview a read here."
Motley Fool,"Is Nvidia Stock Going to $1,050? 1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks So.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-going-1-050-195844221.html,Nvidia's artificial intelligence (AI) conference should give investors more clarity on its product roadmap.,"Wall Street analysts just keep boosting stock price targets for advanced semiconductor chip supplier Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). On Monday afternoon, Nvidia kicked off its 2024 GPU technology conference (GTC) with a keynote address by founder and CEO Jensen Huang.Just ahead of the conference, HSBC analyst Frank Lee kept his buy rating on Nvidia's stock but increased his firm's price target to $1,050 from its current $882 share price. The new stock price target represents an upside of 18% from where Nvidia shares traded Monday afternoon.The AI roadmap is getting clearerHuang will use his two-hour keynote speech in San Jose, California, to give investors an idea of what's ahead for the company in the coming year. The HSBC analyst sees Nvidia's upcoming AI platform enhancements enabling it to have more control over the AI value chain and expand Nvidia's market.That could bring more pricing power for Nvidia even as its revenue has already been soaring. Nvidia recently reported fiscal 2024 fourth-quarter net income that soared about 770% year over year for the period ended Jan. 28, 2024. Lee sees earnings per share (EPS) continuing to rise at least through fiscal 2026.Nvidia's runway for growth could be much longer than just the next several years, too. I think that makes Lee's price target easily achievable. But investors should also realize the stock has soared over the last year, and there could be some short-term corrections.The company itself could make a misstep, or competition could take away some of Nvidia's sales. The overall market, or technology stocks specifically, could also undergo a correction that would hit Nvidia's share price. But those investing for the long term should have Nvidia as part of their portfolio regardless. Any correction could just be a great opportunity to add to that position.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:Story continuesThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Alphabet Inc. jumped as Bloomberg News reported Apple Inc. is in talks to build Google’s Gemini artificial-intelligence engine into the iPhone. Just hours away from Nvidia Corp.’s AI conference — and chief Jensen Huang’s keynote — expectations are high for the chipmaker to deliver news that will sustain its blistering rally.Investors may glean more on the Federal Reserve’s resolve to ease and how close Japan is to finally exiting negative interest rates as central banks set policy for almost half the global economy. The coming week features the world’s biggest agglomeration of decisions for 2024 to date, including judgments on the cost of borrowing for six of the 10 most-traded currencies.“It’s a jam-packed week of central bank meetings,” said Win Thin and Elias Haddad at Brown Brothers Harriman. “There are sure to be some surprises and so today’s calm is likely to give way to greater volatility ahead.”The S&P 500 halted a three-day slide, while the Nasdaq 100 climbed 1%. Treasury two-year yields hit their highest levels in 2024 as expectations for Fed cuts continued to erode. The dollar rose. Nasdaq Inc. said it has resolved a technology glitch that disrupted premarket trading for almost three hours.Ahead of the Fed decision, Japan will face a monumental moment in its history — with the nation expected to end its negative interest rate regime — the world’s last. Traders betting on the outcome of the Bank of Japan’s decision have boosted their positions in yen futures to the highest since 2007.Story continuesMeantime, the potential end of the BoJ’s policy of guiding government bond yields — known as yield curve control — will have only a limited impact on the appetite for US Treasuries, according to strategists at Bank of America Corp.Bond investors who were once convinced that the Fed would start cutting rates this week are painfully surrendering to a higher-for-longer reality. Treasury yields have climbed as data continued to point to persistent inflation, causing traders to push back their timetable for US monetary easing. Swaps are currently pricing in less than 50% odds of a June rate cut.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economists led by Jan Hatzius changed their forecast to call for three quarter-point Fed cuts this year — instead of four. The change, which brings the forecast in line with the median forecast policymakers made in December, is “mainly because of the slightly higher inflation path,” they said.“After last week’s double-dose of hot inflation data, everyone will be wondering whether the Fed is rethinking a June cut,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. “The market will need to like what it sees in the Fed’s statement on Wednesday, and get confirmation from Jerome Powell that two months of sticky inflation numbers won’t derail the Fed’s game plan.”Investors will be keenly focused on the US central bank’s projections — the dot plot — to gauge how many rate cuts policymakers are expecting to deliver this year.To Krishna Guha at Evercore, the Fed will firm up its tone following hotter inflation reports – but will continue to point to a market-friendly base case of three cuts this year starting June.“We think he will say the Committee will be patient and take as long as needed to accumulate sufficient confidence – underlining June is not guaranteed and the Fed would delay to July/September if necessary, Guha noted.Traders will also be interested to see whether the Fed changes its views for 2025-2026 and the “neutral rate” — the level seen as neither stoking growth or holding it back.“The Fed has been quite reluctant to change their neutral rate estimate,” said Neil Dutta at Renaissance Macro Research. “Raising neutral would be one way to signal to markets that a deep easing cycle is unlikely.”Wall Street will listen carefully to any signs from Powell on the phase out of quantitative tightening, known as QT. While a handful expect the Fed to announce or even begin slowing the unwind of its balance sheet as early as May, others don’t see a tapering starting until the second half of the year.It looks like the Fed will begin to taper QT this year — and hints to that effect could be a positive for Treasury markets — allowing yields to drift sideways or down, according to David Kelly at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.“For investors, this isn’t exactly a rallying cry to buy bonds,” Kelly noted. “However, it does suggest the potential for a relatively stable financial environment, allowing equities to continue to move higher and fixed income to play its traditional role of providing income and diversification to portfolios.”US stocks will beat Treasuries over the next month, according to the latest MLIV Pulse survey. That’s the fifth consecutive poll in which majority of respondents opted for equities, the longest streak of pro-stocks bias since the survey started asking the question in August of 2022.Recent data has painted an ambiguous picture about the growth and inflation trends in the US economy, but it’s best not to over-analyze each data point and instead be clear-headed about the general direction of travel, said Jason Draho at UBS Global Wealth Management.“It’s a fairly healthy US macro environment, and it should stay that way,” Draho said. “The Fed is likely to communicate the same message this week, and it seems inclined to do what it can to support that outlook. This is directionally positive for financial markets, and that’s not even accounting for the AI tailwind. Speed bumps, or turbulence, more aptly, aren’t enough to derail the soft-landing trajectory.”In earnings this week, FedEx Corp.’s outlook on Thursday will provide hints on the state of the US economy after the bellwether previously forecast a slight revenue decline this fiscal year because of “volatile macroeconomic conditions.”Nike Inc., Lululemon Athletica Inc., General Mills Inc., and Darden Restaurants Inc. results will show whether consumers are pulling back on spending or trading down, especially with inflation hanging around.Corporate Highlights:The boss of Exxon Mobil Corp. said Monday that it has no interest in buying Hess Corp. outright, despite taking Chevron Corp. to arbitration over its proposed $52 billion merger with the other company.Fisker Inc. is pausing production for the next six weeks as the electric-vehicle maker looks to rein in inventory and avoid possibly having to file for bankruptcy.B.

Motley Fool,Nvidia Is Gaining Today Thanks to Its AI Conference -- Is the Red-Hot Artificial Intelligence Stock Still a Buy?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-gaining-today-thanks-ai-193916880.html,The world's hottest company is about to show investors what's on the horizon for artificial intelligence.,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has continued to climb higher in Monday's trading. The graphics processing unit (GPU) company's share price was up 1% as of 3:15 p.m. ET, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. It had been up as much as 5.2% earlier in the day's trading.Today marks the beginning of the company's GPU Technology Conference (GTC) in San Jose, California, and investors are excited about what the company might discuss and unveil at the event. The conference runs through Thursday and will likely play host to some major news from the artificial intelligence (AI) leader.CEO Jensen Huang is scheduled to give a keynote speech later today and host additional panels later in the week, and the conference will also include presentations from other artificial intelligence luminaries, more than 20 technical workshops on generative AI, and hundreds of exhibits. This year's GTC has become a focal point for what's on the horizon for artificial intelligence and other accelerated computing applications, and investors and industry watchers seem to have high expectations.Is it too late to buy Nvidia stock?Nvidia is the world's hottest company, and its stock has been serving up incredible gains. The AI leader's share price has surged roughly 79% higher already in 2024, and it's also up 244% over the last year. The GPU specialist is now valued at roughly $2.21 trillion and ranks as the world's third-most-valuable company, trailing behind only Microsoft and Apple.Given that the AI frontrunner's share price has seen such incredible gains and has already climbed today thanks to excitement about what could be unveiled at GTC, it's not unreasonable to question how much higher the stock can climb in the near term. Whether or not the company's AI announcements at this year's conference measure up to investors' expectations remains to be seen.Depending on what is or isn't shown, it's reasonable to expect that Nvidia stock will see some significant movement this week. But long-term investors shouldn't become overly fixated on what's shown and discussed at GTC this week. With Huang recently stating that AI could achieve human-level intelligence within the next five years, the long-term outlook is more exciting.Story continuesNvidia is still in the early stages of benefiting from the artificial intelligence revolution, and the stock continues to look like a worthwhile buy for long-term investors. The technology has been progressing at an incredible pace, and the company's GPUs are poised to play a key role in advancements over the long haul.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Why Tesla Stock Was Climbing Today,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-tesla-stock-climbing-today-193340907.html,Investors were encouraged by news of a price hike on the Model Y.,"Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) were moving higher today after the leading electric vehicle (EV) maker surprised investors by announcing price hikes on its Model Y crossover vehicle over the weekend.The price increase bucks the recent trend in the EV industry, as prices have fallen due to increasing competition and plateauing demand from car buyers.As of 2:14 p.m. ET, Tesla stock was up 6.2% on the news.Image source: Tesla.Tesla Model Y prices are going back upTesla announced two separate price hikes on its Model Y, the world's top-selling vehicle.First, the company said on Friday that it would raise prices by $1,000 on all Model Y vehicles in the U.S. by April 1. Then on Saturday, it announced that it would raise prices in several European countries on the crossover SUV by 2,000 euros, or $2,177.The company had also raised the price in the U.S. of the Model Y rear-wheel drive and long-range trims by $1,000 on March 1.CEO Elon Musk explained the move as a seasonal one, saying that consumer demand is seasonal, though manufacturing needs to be steady throughout the year. Car-buying tends to pick up in the spring in the U.S. as Americans receive their tax refunds.What's next for Tesla?Some analysts speculated that the decision could be more geared toward giving first-quarter deliveries a sales bump at the end of the quarter, as higher prices could persuade hesitant buyers to make a purchase.Goldman Sachs, for example, lowered its price target on the stock after channel checks showed Q1 deliveries tracking lower than previously expected, at just 435,000. Deutsche Bank also said the move was designed to boost first-quarter sales.Nonetheless, the price increase should help lift profit margins in the second quarter, which have been falling over the last several quarters.With the stock still down sharply this year, the news also gives Tesla bulls a reason to be optimistic, though the company is still sensitive to overall demand trends in electric vehicle stocks.Story continuesWhere to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The Telegraph,Encyclopedia Britannica plots $1bn stock market listing,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/encyclopedia-britannica-plots-1bn-stock-192516647.html,Encyclopædia Britannica is preparing to join the US stock market with a hoped-for $1bn (£850m) valuation.,"Encyclopedia BritannicaEncyclopædia Britannica is preparing to join the US stock market with a hoped-for $1bn (£850m) valuation.The publisher behind the centuries-old encyclopædia is in talks about a market debut that could come as soon as June, according to Bloomberg.The company, which is known for publishing the oldest English-language general encyclopaedia, is working with advisors over the initial public offering and is seeking a valuation of $1bn. It has been owned by Swiss financier Jacob E Safra since 1996 and filed confidentially for an initial public offering earlier this year.The move to go public would mark a watershed moment for the business, which was first published in Edinburgh in 1768.The reference book was created as a dictionary of arts and science, including entries on countries, geographies and cities.An advertisement for the first instalment in late December 1768 said the book would include “accurate definitions and explanations of all the terms as they occur in the order of the alphabet”, such as anatomy, smoke and money.The first edition of the work comprised three volumes and was sold by subscription over three years.As an attempt to map the sum of human knowledge, the publication is considered to be one of the greatest achievements of the Enlightenment. In the decades that followed the first edition, more than 7 million sets of the Encyclopædia Britannica were printed, including a record 120,000 sets in 1990.However, the publication faced increased competition from the internet, which made knowledge far more easily accessible than it had been. Wikipedia, a free, crowd sourced rival to the Encyclopedia Britannica, was launched in 2001.By 2012, Encyclopedia Britannica took the decision to stop publishing the 32-volume print edition, saying it needed to “diversify and digitise”. It now exists online as Britannica.com, attracting 7 billion page views each year.The company makes revenues from digital advertising and online subscriptions to access more of the website including games. Revenues also come from its online learning tools and a natural language processing platform.Story continuesThe company, Encyclopedia Britannica Inc, is today based in Chicago and publishes other well-known reference books including the Merriam-Webster dictionary.In 2022, the company said it was making around $100m in annual revenues. It has been linked to a potential IPO for the past two years.The public debut is expected to land Mr Safra a major pay-day. The investor is part of the billionaire Safra banking family and famously funded a series of Woody Allen films. It resulted in a legal battle over the profits made from the films, with Mr Allen claiming he was owed $14m. The case was settled in 2002.Britannica did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Motley Fool,Why Super Micro Computer Stock Gave Up Early Gains and Fell Double Digits Today,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-super-micro-computer-stock-190429093.html,Admission to the S&P 500 yielded to profit-taking.,"Shares of Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) were all over the stock charts today as the artificial intelligence (AI) stock was officially added to the S&P 500 index.Supermicro, as the the maker of AI servers and storage equipment is known, initially jumped on the news, gaining as much as 7.4% at the open, but slid over the course of the morning, and was down 10% by 1:05 p.m. ET.Image source: Getty Images.Why Supermicro couldn't hold onto its gainsSupermicro has been one of the biggest winners in the AI boom over the last year, but it's also been one of the most volatile as its recent gains seem to be driven as much by improving fundamentals as they are by momentum, with the stock up more than 200% year to date.Today's sell-off seemed to be a buy-the-rumor/sell-the-news type of event as investors took the opportunity to take profits after Super Micro Computer was added to the S&P 500. Shares of the AI hardware specialist jumped 19% two weeks ago when S&P Global said it would be added to the benchmark index.While trading volume in the stock was trending above its three-month average today, it was still lower than many of the stock's busiest days in recent weeks.Today's decline was also in contrast to most of the AI sector, which gained in anticipation of Nvidia's annual GTC conference, which begins today.Where is Supermicro stock headed?Admission to the S&P 500 is a positive for Super Micro Computer as it forces exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the index to buy the stock and acts as a stamp of approval from S&P Global.Over the long term, Supermicro stock looks well positioned to be a winner if the AI boom continues given its strength in essential hardware, but investors should expect the volatility in the stock to continue in the near term as it swings on news and momentum in the AI sector and due to activity from short-term traders.Should you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?Before you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:Story continuesThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.
