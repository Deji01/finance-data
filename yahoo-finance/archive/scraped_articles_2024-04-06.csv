Shares of the tech giant have declined 8.5% since the start of the year, wiping more than $300 billion from its market capitalization.","Slowing growth. Rising competition. Widening scrutiny.Apple is falling flat in China and with investors, as the shine comes off of the once darling stock. Shares of the tech giant have declined 8.5% this year, wiping more than $300 billion from its market capitalization, and underperforming the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100.However, not all is lost. The stock correction is making Apple's valuation more attractive, analysts say, and it's not out of the question that the company wows the world again with new offerings.Currently, Apple's stock has fallen 14% from its December peak of $198.11, compared to the S&P 500’s 10% gain and the Nasdaq 100’s nearly 9% climb during the same time.A number of factors have unnerved investors, including sluggish iPhone demand, intensifying Chinese competition, and heightened regulatory scrutiny, Needham analyst Laura Martin told Yahoo Finance Live.The growing list of obstacles has prompted more than a few of Martin’s peers to become more bearish on the stock in the short-term. Goldman Sachs removed Apple from its Conviction List last month, while Barclays, Piper Sandler, and Redburn Atlantic were among firms that have downgraded the stock in 2024.Earlier this week, Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah cut his price target on Apple to $170 from $185, and lowered his earnings estimates, writing in a client note that lackluster demand, ""softer fundamentals,"" and competition from Huawei and Xiaomi are having a ""material impact.""""iPhone unit shipments are simply too soft,"" Baruah wrote. ""We currently believe that both Street iPhone units and revenue [estimates] could be 20% too high, and that Wall Street’s overall revenue and EPS [estimates] could be 10% too high.""Baruah expects Apple's annual revenue and earnings to decline in 2024 — which has not happened since 2016.SHANGHAI, CHINA - MARCH 23, 2024 - Customers shop at Apple's flagship store, the world's second largest and Asia's largest, in Shanghai, China, March 23, 2024. (Photo credit: CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) (Future Publishing via Getty Images)And Apple's woes in China aren't going away. iPhone sales in the country dropped 24% during the first six weeks of the year, with Apple's market share falling below 16%, according to a Counterpoint Research report. Chinese smartphone maker Vivo holds the largest domestic market share with 17.6%, while Huawei and Honor Device accounted for 16.5% and 16.3%, respectively.Story continuesTECHnalysis Research's Bob O’Donnell told Yahoo Finance Live that the road ahead for Apple will be challenging, as the region contributed nearly one-fifth of the tech giant’s overall revenue in its most recent quarter.""I think the next couple of quarters is going to be tough,"" O’Donnell said. ""I'm hoping that Apple will pull a rabbit out of its hat. It's done so in the past, and I'm not convinced it can't do that now.""Despite waning excitement on Wall Street, now may be the time to bet on Apple. The recent selloff has put its shares at a discount, Piper Sandler chief market technician Craig Johnson told Yahoo Finance Live, giving it a more attractive risk-reward set up.""Apple looks like a pretty attractive place for people to park their money at this point in time, because it’s got a great balance sheet, a highly repeatable business model, good margins, and they're buying back quite a bit of stock,"" Johnson explained.Beyond its solid balance sheet, several analysts remain confident in the company's ability to regain momentum. The Vision Pro headset and anticipated AI initiatives are largely viewed as future revenue growth drivers, along with additional sources of revenue, including a potential advertising push.""Maybe demand is slower in China, but it has really wealthy demographics already using their ecosystem, so they need to add advertising to drive revenue growth,"" Martin said. ""Apple needs to figure out a way to add more services and software so it can get more subscription revenue and up its revenue per device.""Martin is among a shortened list of analysts who have maintained a buy rating on Apple. At the start of the second quarter, just over half the analysts covering Apple rated the stock a buy, according to Bloomberg data.

Motley Fool,Where Will Roku Stock Be in 3 Years?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/where-roku-stock-3-years-164500773.html,Bullish investors are hoping the future is drastically different from the recent past.,
Motley Fool,This Value Stock Just Surprised Investors With a Monster Buyback. Is It a Buy?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/value-stock-just-surprised-investors-163000182.html,Signet is reducing shares outstanding by 15% in a special transaction.,"Shares of Signet Jewelers (NYSE: SIG), the world's largest diamond jewelry retailer, were soaring on Wednesday after the company delighted investors with a share buyback and raised its guidance to adjust for the diminished share count.As a result of the buyback, the company is raising its adjusted earnings-per-share guidance from $9.08-$10.48 to $9.90-$11.52, and it will provide an additional boost to fiscal 2026 earnings as it benefits from a full year of a reduced share count.Image source: Getty Images.What's happening hereSignet made an agreement with private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners (LGP), which had taken a preferred equity stake in the company in 2016, to repurchase half of LGP's 8.2 million shares in the retailer. As a result, Signet is repurchasing 4.1 million for $414 million, based on the share price as of April 1. Following that transaction, LGP's stake will have a stated value of $328 million, on which it earns a 5% dividend.That transaction will reduce Signet's diluted share count by 7.6%, and Signet will use cash from the $1.4 billion it has on its balance sheet. Signet will also record an $83 million reduction in net income to reflect the difference in what it sold the preferred shares for and what it's paying.Additionally, Signet agreed to pay LGP $328 million for the stated value of its remaining preferred share balance, which will remove an additional 2.8 million shares, reducing its shares outstanding by roughly 7 million or 13%, which will give a 15% boost to earnings per share. The company will also save money by not having to shell out the roughly $34 million in annual preferred dividends it was paying.Signet flexes its muscleFor Signet, the transaction is as much a move to reward shareholders and reduce its share count as it is a reflection of the gains the company has made under its Path to Brilliance strategy, which has grown revenue by double digits while closing underperforming stores, and expanded gross margin by more than 400 basis points. The company has also increased adjusted EPS by nearly 60% during that time.Story continuesIn an interview with The Motley Fool, CFO Joan Hilson also noted that the repurchase would reduce the company's leverage ratio by 10%, putting it in a better position to make acquisitions and invest in the business.Speaking in the same interview, CEO Gina Drosos underscored the transformation that led to this, saying: ""We've transformed as a company. We've created an operating model that very consistently generates cash,"" and noted that the company generates nearly 15% of its company value annually, making Signet attractive to value stock investors.Is Signet a buy?Signet has quietly been a top performer on the market in recent years; the jewelry stock has more than tripled over the last five years, shortly after it introduced its Path to Brilliance strategy.The stock fell on its recent earnings report as investors were unimpressed with its guidance, but Signet rewarded investors with a 26% dividend increase. Wednesday's share buyback announcement is the company's latest effort to return capital to shareholders, and the company is in an excellent position to do so with rock-solid fundamentals and a price-to-earnings ratio of about 10.Signet also looks primed to grow over the coming years as it benefits from a recovery in engagements, which had declined to a pause in new relationships during the pandemic. The bridal business makes up about 40% of the company's revenue so the tailwind expected over the next three years could be substantial, and the company has other growth drivers, including high-margin services like repair, that can give profits a boost.With a 15% reduction in shares outstanding and the recent 26% dividend hike, Signet looks more focused on rewarding shareholders than ever before, and the stock remains a good value for the expected growth ahead of it. Shares of the jewelry leader continue to look like a buy.Should you invest $1,000 in Signet Jewelers right now?Before you buy stock in Signet Jewelers, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Signet Jewelers wasn’t one of them.

This week, that changed as the desire to protect against a downturn increased by a number of measures.“People are starting to recognize that we’ve skated through these first three months of the year — all in the face of interest rates going up, in the face of pushing out the probabilities of cuts,” said Joe Mazzola, director of trading and education at Charles Schwab & Co. “Something’s got to give at some point.”The Cboe Volatility Index, known as the VIX, closed at its highest level since November on Thursday, before dipping Friday as US stocks climbed. The index — a measure of the 30-day implied volatility of the S&P 500 based on out-of-the-money options prices — still held above its 200-day moving average.Since late March, investors have been slowly tacking on hedges, pushing the cost of bearish three-month put options to the biggest premium over bullish contracts since mid-January. Those positions added onto insurance that’s gotten more attention this year — tail-risk hedges that protect against a major crash, rather than a minor correction.Some investors are using spreads, which offer less protection against a downturn but cost much less than outright contracts. Susquehanna International Group called out recent put spreads that ready for drawdowns in the S&P 500, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, and the Russell 2000 — often seen as a benchmark of small cap health.Story continuesBelmont Capital Group’s Stephen Solaka, who manages hedging strategies for wealth management firms and institutions, said that more clients have been asking for portfolio hedges tied to both equities benchmarks as well as individual tech firms.“That’s a function of pricing and the run-up that we’ve had,” he said. According to Solaka, the demand makes sense: after the S&P 500’s blistering rally, investors might want to shield their winnings. “It’s natural.”These days, trader angst centers on a bunch of unknowns: geopolitical tensions, the upcoming US presidential election, first-quarter earnings reports, and — of course — central bank policy. That final wildcard came to the forefront last week after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said bankers need not rush to ease borrowing. The Fed’s Neel Kashkari further soured the mood when he raised the possibility of no rate cuts in 2024.A spike in put volume tied to iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (ticker HYG) signaled that investors are preparing for the Fed to disappoint again. The hedges tied to the fund would likely pay off should the Fed’s tight policy push the rate-sensitive fund lower.“If you think about what’s been driving some of the real macro volatility, it has been interest rates,” said Alex Kosoglyadov, managing director of equity derivatives at Nomura Securities International, noting that fewer cuts than markets expect could catalyze stock moves. “The Fed is a risk that could take the market lower.”Options positioning mirrors the action in the equity market, which has favored established megacaps over riskier stocks. Growth and quality exchange-traded funds reaped massive inflows compared to value funds’ meager intake throughout March.Demand for protection boils down to trader expectations, according to Rohan Reddy, director of research at Global X Management. With mounting consensus for a soft landing, unwelcome surprises can beget a bit of angst in even the most fearless of bull markets.“There is, of course, a real possibility things could get bumpy, in which case there may be more desire to protect,” said Reddy.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow Hertz’s Bet on Teslas Went Horribly SidewaysFixing Boeing’s Broken Culture Starts With a New PlaneElon Musk’s X Has a Porn ProblemHow Bluey Became a $2 Billion Smash Hit—With an Uncertain FutureChina’s Real Estate Tycoons Lost $100 Billion in the Housing Collapse©2024 Bloomberg L.P."
Motley Fool,"Shopify Stock Has 16% Upside, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shopify-stock-16-upside-according-150500859.html,The leading e-commerce platform has an expanding number of opportunities to drive growth.,"Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) has strung together several quarters of at least 20% revenue growth, but there are still catalysts that could lift the stock higher, according to analyst Colin Sebastian at Baird.Sebastian maintained his outperform rating on the shares but raised the price target from $85 to $87 per share. Wall Street's short-term price targets are of little use to long-term investors, but the reasons behind them can be enlightening. In this case, Shopify could be seeing strong traction in growing the number of active merchants on its platform, benefiting its growth and stock price.Why Wall Street analysts like ShopifyThe Baird analyst cited his firm's e-commerce platform survey, which indicated Shopify should see a marginal increase in net active stores. Specifically, the firm noted this could reflect strength in the Shopify Plus subscription plan, in addition to international and business-to-business opportunities.Shopify is coming off a strong year where revenue grew 23% year over year to cap off a stellar 2023. The analyst consensus has the company posting another 21% of top line growth in 2024.Shopify also posted a massive jump in operating profit last year, following the sale of its logistics business. However, Shopify could see another boost to the bottom line from the recent price increase for its Plus subscription tier.Management also believes its new business-to-business offering will emerge as a key growth driver, tapping a $450 billion market.Is the stock a buy?The prospects for profitable growth have pushed the shares up almost 60% over the last 12 months. The stock already commands a premium valuation at a price-to-sales ratio of 14.The most important takeaway from Baird's note to investors is that Shopify is executing well on its long-term growth strategy, which lays the ground for new highs to come to those who patiently hold the shares.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Motley Fool,Should You Buy This Sneaky Artificial Intelligence Stock Before It's Too Late?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-sneaky-artificial-intelligence-stock-150000089.html,The stock has outperformed Apple over the past five years. What will the next five years look like?,"The boom in artificial intelligence (AI) spending is unprecedented. Companies are investing billions of dollars to create data centers and other computing infrastructure in hopes of winning the AI technology wars.Microsoft and OpenAI are reportedly set to spend $100 billion on a single supercomputer. That is a lot of money going to computing systems.Investors have piled into the picks and shovels of the AI gold rush, like Nvidia and Super Micro Computer. But there is another AI winner that has flown under the radar: Dell Technologies (NYSE: DELL).As hard as it may be to believe, the stodgy personal computer brand has indeed been a force in AI. The legacy technology provider has expanded its services beyond consumer devices, positioning itself to take advantage of this potential boom in data centers and cloud computing.That potentially makes Dell Technologies a sneaky AI winner, but should you buy the stock? Let's investigate.Dell: More than personal computersDell is known for its branded Windows-powered computers. They still make up a sizable portion of the business. It focuses on high-end laptops and PCs, gaming stations, and business PCs. For fiscal 2024 (ended Feb. 2), Dell's computer segment, reported under its client solutions group, generated $48.9 billion in revenue and $3.5 billion in operating income.The segment saw a surge in growth during the pandemic, but it generated around the same amount of sales in fiscal 2024 as it did in 2020. It has produced consistent operating profits of at least $3 billion in each of the last five years too.What's more exciting is Dell's infrastructure solutions segment, at least from an AI perspective. The segment helps AI companies assemble and build highly efficient data centers around the world. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang even touted the company in his latest keynote, saying Dell was the premier solution for building data centers.Its financials are not rocketing higher like Nvidia's, but Dell's infrastructure solutions segment generated $4.3 billion in operating income last year. If companies keep going to Dell to help them optimize the computing power of advanced computer chips from the likes of Nvidia, investors should see this segment's earnings grow over the next few years.Story continuesThe potential and caution around AI beneficiariesThere is a lot of excitement around Dell, especially after the direct mention from Nvidia's CEO. Its stock is now up over 300% in the last five years, outperforming its computing hardware rival Apple.Dell's infrastructure solutions segment could grow rapidly over the next few years if companies keep building more and more AI computing systems. It is one of the top brands in the space, and there are tens of billions of dollars -- perhaps hundreds of billions -- in sales to go after. It is no surprise, then, to see some people getting excited about Dell as one of the next big AI winners.But betting on a stock just because of this hype-filled narrative is risky. Every year, there is a new story from Wall Street around what ""hot"" sector investors should buy. Sometimes, these are sectors that turn into sizable opportunities powering the global economy, like cloud computing.Most of the time, what was hot one year on Wall Street becomes a sideshow the next. In just the last decade, investors have seen booms and busts in sectors like cannabis, 3D printing, and the metaverse. These were all sectors talked about as the next big thing, but most of the stocks in these sectors severely underperformed the broad market.This is not to say AI is overhyped, but investors should tread lightly when investing in the popular trend of the day.DELL PE Ratio ChartTime to buy shares?In 2022, Dell had a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) below 8. This was dirt cheap compared to the S&P 500 market average and a key reason the stock has put up monster returns in the last few years.But the company's underlying earnings have been volatile over the same period with fiscal 2024 earnings per share basically unchanged from 2021. That said, they are up significantly from pre-pandemic levels.Most of the stock's rise has thus come from multiple expansion. Its P/E ratio is now 27, which is right around the S&P 500 average.Buying the stock at a P/E of 27 implies an expectation the company sees strong earnings results in the next few years and fulfills the narrative that it is an AI beneficiary through consistent financial growth. So far, it's hard to see proof of this, while its competitors like Nvidia and Super Micro Computer are seeing their revenue and earnings rocket higher.If Dell Technologies can push earnings higher, the stock can still be a deal after its recent run-up. But if the bottom line remains stagnant or even declines, it is hard to see the stock sustaining its current momentum.Should you invest $1,000 in Dell Technologies right now?Before you buy stock in Dell Technologies, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Dell Technologies wasn’t one of them.
