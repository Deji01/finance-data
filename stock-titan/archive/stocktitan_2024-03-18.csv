The board of directors has formed a special committee to evaluate strategic alternatives, including continued significant ownership by key shareholders. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst When a company like Nuvei Corporation explores the possibility of a going-private transaction, it's an event of substantial significance for shareholders and potential investors. The formation of a special committee to evaluate expressions of interest indicates that the board is taking these proposals seriously. This move suggests that there might be a premium over the current market price being considered, which could present a lucrative exit opportunity for current shareholders.However, such transactions often involve considerable debt and may lead to a restructuring of the company's finances. It's essential to monitor the debt-to-equity ratio and interest coverage ratios if a buyout occurs, as these will impact the company's financial health post-transaction. For potential investors, the key is to watch for any definitive agreement announcements, as these will provide a clearer picture of the transaction's structure and implications. Legal Expert The involvement of Nuvei's founder and CEO, Phil Fayer, in discussions about significant ownership post-transaction raises questions about management's future role and potential conflicts of interest. It's common in such scenarios for the management to roll over their equity stake into the new private entity. From a legal perspective, the special committee's role is to ensure that any transaction is fair to all shareholders, particularly minority ones.Additionally, the company's adherence to securities laws and regulations during this sensitive period is critical. Any misstep could lead to legal repercussions. Stakeholders should pay attention to the company's public disclosures and the special committee's recommendations, as these will be indicative of the transaction's fairness and adherence to fiduciary duties. Market Research Analyst Strategic alternatives, including going private, can be a response to various market conditions, such as undervaluation by public markets or a desire for greater operational flexibility. For Nuvei, a payment technology company, the competitive landscape and rapid technological advancements are likely factors in considering such a move.An analysis of the industry's valuation trends and M&A activities could provide context for the potential transaction's timing and nature. If Nuvei does go private, it could signal a broader trend in the fintech sector, where companies opt for private capital to fuel growth initiatives without the pressures of quarterly earnings reports. 03/17/2024 - 11:01 PM MONTREAL, March 17, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Nuvei Corporation (NASDAQ: NVEI) (TSX: NVEI) (the ""Company"" or ""Nuvei"") announces today that it is aware of recent media reports speculating as to a potential going-private transaction involving the Company.

The trials provide valuable data for future development and demonstrate the potential for hydrogen mobility in fleet operations. The global market for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles is projected to grow significantly, with fleet operators like WWU driving zero-emission vehicle adoption. Positive None. Negative None. 03/18/2024 - 04:10 AM Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - March 18, 2024) - First Hydrogen Corp. (TSXV: FHYD) (OTC Pink: FHYDF) (FSE: FIT) (""FIRST HYDROGEN"" or the ""Company"") has successfully completed hydrogen fuel cell-powered vehicle (FCEV) trials with gas distribution network Wales & West Utilities (WWU). WWU is exploring zero emissions vehicle technology to suit its operational requirements and the trials provided the transport team with the opportunity to experience the benefits of the Company's FCEV first-hand.The Company's FCEV completed more than 2,000 km (>1,200 miles) over the four-week trial, travelling up to 189 km (117 miles) per day in some of South Wales' coldest conditions. The FCEV vehicle demonstrated its' capability for demanding duties, such as carrying heavier payloads, towing and powering auxiliary equipment (onboard power), as well as, the full power capability of the fuel cell module, with outputs higher than 60kW in transient accelerations. The trial had already shown there was no decrease in vehicle performance or range when operating in colder temperatures. The data recorded will provide great insight into the FCEV's performance in winter conditions. More detail on the FCEV's deployment with WWU can be seen here. Driver feedback The FCEV was shared by two drivers from WWU's Network Emergency & Metering Services team who are responsible for emergency metering work for more than 7.5 million customers across Wales and the south west of England. Most of the vehicle's journeys were travelling to customer call outs, averaging 5-6 visits per day. The team has to respond quickly to calls and often covers long distances while transporting bulky equipment needed for repairs. Alun Jones, First Call Operative (FCO) for WWU and driver in First Hydrogen's trials says: ""First Hydrogen's van is lovely to drive and allowed us to get on with our job. The fact you can quickly refuel rather than charge up overnight is a massive advantage for us as sometimes we respond to calls from our homes in the middle of the night. I can definitely see the hydrogen vans working at WWU in terms of the efficiency we need.""Steve Morgan, FCO for WWU and driver in the vehicle trials, says: ""Our van is everything for us; it's our office and it's how we transport our equipment and charge our laptops and phones so we can respond to call outs. Therefore, we need vehicles that are comfortable and reliable and that can carry everything we need. We do a lot of miles so also need the range.""Trial feedbackStephen Offley, Transport Manager for WWU comments: ""We are impressed with how the van operates and its overall performance - particularly as this is a prototype vehicle and we were breaking new ground by creating our own hydrogen vehicle ecosystem. Testing the vehicle with our FCOs meant we could demonstrate its use in a front-line service role and provide credible findings for us to share with our stakeholders and other fleet managers. The data generated from the trials also gives us a case to push for fixed hydrogen infrastructure in the area so we can benefit from faster refuelling and operational simplicity.""Generating data to fuel zero emission adoptionCrucially, the trials have provided First Hydrogen and WWU with important data that will help to inform future development.Steve Gill, Executive Director Automotive, First Hydrogen, says: ""We're thrilled with the feedback from Wales & West Utilities. Having covered more miles in a single trial than ever before, we have generated a significant amount of vehicle data. Sharing the van between two drivers, neither of whom has driven a zero emission vehicle before, has given us insight into how different driving styles can affect performance. By reviewing this data and speaking to the WWU team, we have identified further opportunities to improve fuel consumption and optimise efficiency.""We have also gained valuable data, which enables us to model Total Cost of Operations (TCO), key information for fleet operators considering a transition to hydrogen fuel. We have presented our initial findings to the WWU board who responded positively and are keen to progress with next steps.""Importantly, these trials proved that hydrogen mobility is still possible for fleet operators without access to fixed hydrogen refuelling infrastructure. The trials were supported by Protium Energy Solutions, which provided green hydrogen to fuel the vehicle and Hyppo Hydrogen Solutions, who supplied a re-deployable hydrogen refuelling unit.DataHorizzon Research reported the global hydrogen fuel cell vehicles market is projected to grow from US$2.2 billion (£1.7 billion) in 2023 to US$82.1 billion (£64.2 billion) by 2032, at 49.1% CAGR. It anticipates that fleet operators, such as WWU, will drive zero emission vehicle sales - which includes hydrogen fuel cell commercial vehicles - as they strive to decarbonise in line with government mandates to phase out fossil fuel vehicles by 2035.First Hydrogen: The Future with Zero EmissionsTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8330/202045_2a62631594cdcae3_001full.jpgWWU driver Alun JonesTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8330/202045_2a62631594cdcae3_002full.jpgAbout First Hydrogen Corp.

Investors should be aware of the risks involved in investing in these ETFs. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The restatement of the net asset value (NAV) for AllianzIM U.S. Large Cap Buffer10 Aug ETF represents a significant upward revision of over 14%, which is a substantial adjustment in the context of typical daily fluctuations in ETF NAVs. This event may have implications for investors who rely on accurate NAVs for trading decisions. The correction suggests a lapse in the internal controls or calculation methodologies employed by AllianzIM. Investors and market participants may scrutinize the firm's operational integrity and demand increased transparency in NAV calculation processes. In the short term, this could influence the ETF's trading volume and volatility as the market absorbs the corrected information. Long-term implications might include a reassessment of the trust placed in AllianzIM's ETF products, potentially affecting future capital inflows and the firm's reputation. Market Research Analyst Anomalies in NAV calculations can lead to broader market concerns, particularly when they involve widely held assets like large-cap ETFs. The restatement might prompt industry-wide discussions about the accuracy and reliability of ETF NAV reporting. While the immediate financial impact is contained within the AllianzIM U.S. Large Cap Buffer10 Aug ETF, the ripple effects could lead to calls for enhanced regulatory oversight on NAV calculations and disclosures. Market participants will likely monitor peer institutions for similar discrepancies, which could lead to increased due diligence and pressure on other asset managers to affirm their calculation accuracy. This event underscores the importance of precision in financial reporting and may serve as a cautionary tale for other investment management firms. Compliance Officer The restatement of NAV by AllianzIM is not only a matter of financial accuracy but also one of regulatory compliance. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has strict guidelines regarding the calculation and reporting of NAVs for investment products. This error, although corrected, could draw regulatory scrutiny to ensure that AllianzIM adheres to compliance standards. The firm will need to review and possibly overhaul its NAV calculation procedures to prevent future occurrences. Additionally, this incident could lead to regulatory bodies reinforcing the importance of compliance across the industry, potentially resulting in more stringent controls and oversight for NAV calculations. 03/17/2024 - 08:00 PM MINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Allianz Investment Management LLC (AllianzIM), a wholly owned subsidiary of Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America (Allianz Life®), announces the net asset value (NAV) per share of the below exchange traded fund was restated as shown below: ETF Name Ticker Revised NAV (3/14/2024) Original NAV (3/14/2024) Change (%) AllianzIM U.S. Large Cap Buffer10 Aug ETF AUGT $27.55 $24.13 14.17% These values differ from previously disclosed NAVs.

The study highlights the potential of nab-sirolimus for mTOR-driven gynecologic cancers, with consistent response rates and manageable safety profiles. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The recent subgroup analysis from the AMPECT trial showing efficacy and safety of nab-sirolimus in patients with gynecologic origins of malignant perivascular epithelioid cell tumor (PEComa) is significant. PEComa is a rare sarcoma and the treatment options are limited. The fact that more than half of the evaluable patients in the trial had tumors of gynecologic or retroperitoneal origin underscores the prevalence of these cancers within the PEComa population. The reported overall response rate of 37.5% aligns with the broader trial results, which is encouraging for consistency of treatment effect.Furthermore, the rapid and durable responses, with a median time to response of 1.4 months and a median duration of response of 36.2 months, are noteworthy. These findings may influence treatment protocols and could lead to increased adoption of nab-sirolimus in clinical practice for this patient subset. The manageable safety profile also reassures clinicians regarding the risk-benefit ratio of this therapy. This data could potentially lead to more personalized care for patients with mTOR-driven gynecologic cancers, a field where precision medicine is increasingly important. Medical Research Analyst The focus on the mTOR pathway in gynecologic cancers is a strategic area of research, given its role in cell growth, proliferation and survival. The mTOR inhibitors, like nab-sirolimus, are particularly promising due to their targeted mechanism of action. The additional data presented at the SGO meeting, including real-world studies and updates on ongoing trials, provide a comprehensive view of the potential role of nab-sirolimus in treating mTOR-driven cancers.In the context of business impact, Aadi Bioscience's focus on a niche but critical area of oncology could position them favorably in the precision oncology market. The PRECISION1 trial and the phase 2 study of nab-sirolimus in combination with letrozole for advanced endometrioid-type endometrial cancer (EEC) could further expand the drug's applicability and market potential. The identification of TSC1 and TSC2 inactivating alterations in a subset of gynecological cancers through real-world databases provides a valuable biomarker-driven approach to patient selection, which is key in the era of personalized medicine. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the precision oncology sector is witnessing significant growth, driven by the demand for targeted therapies and the rise in incidence of cancer globally. Aadi Bioscience's advancement in this field, particularly for rare and aggressive cancers like PEComa, could enhance their market presence and competitive edge. The company's stock performance might reflect investor confidence in their clinical development strategy and potential revenue growth from nab-sirolimus.Investors should monitor the progress of the ongoing PRECISION1 trial and the phase 2 combination study with letrozole, as positive outcomes could lead to further FDA approvals and expanded indications for nab-sirolimus. Moreover, the prevalence of TSC1 and TSC2 inactivating alterations in gynecological cancers presents a substantial patient population that could benefit from nab-sirolimus, potentially increasing the drug's market penetration. The focus on a precision medicine approach aligns with current industry trends towards targeted therapies and could result in strategic partnerships or interest from larger pharmaceutical companies. 03/17/2024 - 08:00 AM Subgroup experienced efficacy and safety consistent with overall study population Advanced malignant PEComa tumors of gynecologic origin accounted for more than half of the evaluable patients enrolled in AMPECT Additional data presented highlight nab-sirolimus as potential approach for mTOR-driven gynecologic cancers LOS ANGELES, March 17, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Aadi Bioscience, Inc.

The AMPECT trial formed the basis for the FDA approval of the company's nab-sirolimus, FYARRO®, for advanced malignant PEComa regardless of mutational status. This new subgroup analysis will be presented during an oral plenary at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) Annual Meeting in San Diego, CA on March 17, 2024.

New research from the Centre for Economics and Business Research (Cebr) commissioned by ACI Worldwide shows that for every 5% increase in the volume of instant payments, the number of 15 to 24-year-olds globally who saved money in the last year increased by 15.6% on average. According to the latest data, the volume of instant payments in the EU is expected to rise from 7.6 billion transactions in 2023 to 21.2 billion transactions in 2028. This represents a compound annual growth rate of 17.5%. As a result, instant payments as a share of all electronic payments in the EU will increase by 6.1% (from 5% in 2023 to 11.1% in 2028)iii. This news comes at a time when young Europeans face serious financial challenges. Eurostat data shows 24.5% of people aged 15 to 29 are at risk of poverty or social exclusion, which is 2.9 percentage points higher than the rate for the total population (21.6%)iv. In January 2024, the EU youth unemployment rate was 14.9%v. Many young Europeans have been unable to move out of the family home due to a lack of affordable optionsvi. Meanwhile, some young people in the region now earn less than their parents didvii. Importantly, on February 7, 2024, the European Parliament endorsed the Regulation on instant payments, which the Council then adopted on February 26. The Regulation requires payment service providers to offer their customers the possibility of making payments from one account to another within 10 seconds, regardless of the time of day and the member state they are in. Should charges apply, these must not exceed those applicable for standard credit transfers. This will accelerate the volume of instant payments made in a region that has lagged. ACI Worldwide’s 2023 Prime Time for Real-Time report shows the share of instant payments among electronic payments in the EU is significantly behind Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. “Our research proves that moving money around faster drives economic growth and boosts financial inclusion, which in turn allows those facing the greatest financial pressures to save. Now that instant payments are mandated and expected to grow significantly, young people in the EU will benefit – as will others,” said Craig Ramsey, global head, real-time payments, ACI Worldwide. “ACI is at the forefront of making instant payments a reality for businesses and consumers around the world. We are proud to play our part in improving prosperity and financial inclusion.” Craig Ramsey will be discussing these findings at an event titled, “Can instant payments get everyone on-board?” on March 19, the same week the Regulation on instant payments final text is expected to be published. The event will explore the implications for consumers and businesses, as well as the broader impact on financial inclusion. Notes to Editors Methodology: Cebr research was conducted using GlobalData volume data on instant and electronic payments along with financial inclusion indicators published by the World Bank for 48 countries from 2011-2021. Analysis was conducted using a fixed effects model with time dummies and a control for the volume of electronic payments. The statistically significant relationship that a 1% increase in the volume of instant payments is, on average, associated with a 3.1 percentage point increase in the share of 15- to 24-year-olds that have saved any money, all else remaining equal, was identified.

The partnership combines Fujitsu's systems integration expertise with AWS Professional Services to offer fast and secure modernization solutions, enabling customers to adapt to evolving business demands with agility and resilience. Positive None. Negative None. Technology Industry Analyst The collaboration between Fujitsu and AWS signifies a strategic move within the technology sector, primarily aimed at addressing the increasing demand for digital transformation. This partnership leverages Fujitsu's expertise in mainframe and UNIX server environments with AWS's cloud services to offer a comprehensive modernization solution. The initiative targets industries heavily reliant on legacy systems, such as finance, retail and automotive, which often face challenges in agility and resilience due to outdated technology. From a business perspective, the initiative could lead to an increase in AWS's market share in cloud services, as it attracts enterprises seeking to modernize their IT infrastructure. The partnership may also enhance Fujitsu's competitive positioning as a systems integrator capable of handling complex digital transitions. It's important to note that the success of such initiatives often depends on the seamless integration of new cloud technologies with existing legacy systems, a non-trivial challenge that can impact project timelines and costs. Cloud Computing Consultant Modernizing legacy applications to cloud infrastructure is a critical step for businesses looking to improve scalability, performance and cost-efficiency. The collaboration between Fujitsu and AWS is expected to streamline this transition by combining Fujitsu's integration services with AWS's cloud and mainframe modernization tools. The initiative is particularly significant for businesses operating on-premise mainframes and UNIX servers, which are typically more expensive and less flexible than cloud alternatives. However, the process of migration and modernization carries inherent risks, such as data security concerns and potential downtime. The initiative's promise of 'fast and secure' modernization will be under scrutiny, as businesses will weigh the benefits of cloud agility against the risks of transitioning critical legacy systems. For stakeholders, the long-term benefits of reduced operational costs and increased innovation capacity must be balanced against the short-term challenges and investment required for modernization. Sustainability Expert One of the more subtle yet significant aspects of this initiative is the potential impact on sustainability. Digital transformation, particularly through cloud computing, can lead to more energy-efficient operations compared to traditional on-premise data centers. Fujitsu's mention of leveraging its Uvance offerings to contribute to greater sustainability suggests a dual focus on technological advancement and environmental responsibility. For businesses, the shift to cloud infrastructure through this initiative could result in lower carbon footprints and align with broader corporate social responsibility goals. However, the actual sustainability benefits will depend on the energy sources powering the cloud services and the efficiency of the modernized applications. Stakeholders should consider both the environmental and economic implications of this initiative as part of their overall assessment. 03/18/2024 - 04:01 AM Fujitsu and AWS will launch a new Modernization Acceleration Joint Initiative to enable customers across industries to drive digital transformation with fast and secure legacy modernization TOKYO, March 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Fujitsu Limited and Amazon Web Services (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced an expanded partnership to accelerate the modernization of legacy applications on AWS Cloud by launching a Modernization Acceleration Joint Initiative.

Positive None. Negative None. Telecommunications Policy Analyst The granting of a unified licence to Banglalink by the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) represents a significant regulatory development in the telecommunications sector. This move towards a more streamlined regulatory framework can have profound implications for operational efficiency and cost management for Banglalink, a subsidiary of VEON Ltd.From a policy perspective, the transition to a unified licence system typically allows for a more flexible use of spectrum and technology, potentially leading to improved network performance and the faster deployment of new technologies such as 5G. This also implies that Banglalink may now have an easier path to upgrade its infrastructure, which is essential for maintaining competitiveness in a rapidly evolving digital market.Furthermore, the active sharing of infrastructure resources could lead to a reduction in capital expenditures for Banglalink, as shared infrastructure often results in cost savings. This could positively affect the company's margins and profitability in the long term. Additionally, the simplification in the audit process and the rationalization of fees can lead to a more predictable business environment, which is typically welcomed by investors. Market Research Analyst The strategic implications of the unified licence for Banglalink's market positioning cannot be overstated. By enabling the company to operate across multiple generations of technology with a single licence, Banglalink is poised to enhance its service offerings, potentially increasing its market share in Bangladesh's telecommunications sector.For consumers, the expected improvement in digital services and connectivity might translate into higher customer satisfaction and loyalty. Banglalink's ability to streamline user experiences, as a result of this regulatory change, can be a key differentiator in attracting and retaining customers in a competitive market.On the investor front, the announcement may be seen as a positive signal, indicating that Banglalink is in a position to capitalize on the government's digital agenda. This could result in increased investor confidence, potentially impacting VEON Ltd.'s stock performance positively, especially if these changes lead to tangible improvements in Banglalink's financial metrics in subsequent quarters. Financial Analyst The financial outlook for VEON Ltd., in light of Banglalink's receipt of a unified licence, is multifaceted. In the short term, the costs associated with transitioning to the new licence and possibly upgrading infrastructure to leverage the benefits of a technology-agnostic framework may weigh on financials. However, the long-term benefits, such as cost savings from streamlined processes and shared infrastructure, could outweigh these initial investments.Investors should monitor the company's capital expenditures and operational costs closely in upcoming financial statements to gauge the impact of the unified licence. Moreover, the potential for increased revenue through enhanced services and customer base expansion is a critical factor to consider. If Banglalink successfully leverages this regulatory change to improve its market position, it could lead to positive revisions in revenue forecasts and a more favorable assessment of VEON Ltd.'s valuation. 03/18/2024 - 03:30 AM The unified licence consolidates current licences and provides the groundwork for upcoming technologies Amsterdam and Dhaka, 18 March 2024: VEON Ltd.

Economic Development Expert The establishment of the Barrick Academy and the conversion of the Buzwagi mine into a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) represent strategic initiatives that can have substantial economic implications for the region. The training academy is set to develop a skilled workforce, which is a fundamental aspect of fostering sustainable economic development post-mining. The anticipated job creation from the SEZ, totaling 3,000 jobs annually, along with the projected service levies and employment taxes, indicate a significant positive shift in the local economy. The diversification from a single-industry reliance on mining to a multifaceted economic zone can stimulate local entrepreneurship and attract external investment, potentially leading to a more resilient economic structure.In addition, the construction of an airport terminal and the introduction of a scheduled airline service are likely to enhance connectivity and accessibility, further supporting regional economic growth. These developments could attract more businesses and tourism, broadening the economic base beyond the immediate impact of the SEZ. However, the long-term success of such initiatives will depend on consistent management, the adaptability of the workforce and the actualization of the forecasted financial benefits. Environmental Sustainability Analyst The transition of the Buzwagi mine into an SEZ and the launch of Barrick Academy aligns with the growing trend of environmental sustainability and responsible mine closure practices. Repurposing the mine site for economic activities can mitigate the environmental impact often associated with mine closures, such as land degradation and loss of biodiversity. The initiative indicates a proactive approach to environmental stewardship and community engagement, which can enhance the corporation's reputation and stakeholder relations.However, the environmental implications of the new SEZ and its associated industries must be monitored closely. The introduction of manufacturing industries could potentially lead to new environmental challenges, such as increased pollution or resource consumption. It is important that environmental assessments and sustainable practices are integrated into the development of the SEZ to ensure that the positive legacy intended by Barrick is achieved without compromising environmental integrity. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Barrick Gold Corporation's initiative to open a training academy and establish an SEZ might reflect positively on the company's stock market performance. Investors often look favorably upon companies that demonstrate a commitment to corporate social responsibility and long-term strategic planning. The ability to leave a positive legacy and contribute to regional economic growth can be seen as indicators of a company's sustainability and ethical governance.Moreover, the training academy could be a strategic move to enhance the company's competitive advantage by investing in human capital. Skilled managers and workers are key assets that can drive performance and innovation. The market will likely monitor the outcomes of these initiatives in terms of productivity gains and cost efficiencies. Any positive results could potentially be reflected in the company's financial performance and, consequently, investor sentiment. 03/18/2024 - 04:00 AM All amounts expressed in US dollars KAHAMA, Tanzania, March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD)(TSX:ABX) has officially opened its world class training academy at the old Buzwagi mine, in line with Barrick’s mine closure objective of leaving a positive legacy after mining has finished. Launched today, the Barrick Academy is designed to offer tailor-made training programs aimed at developing Barrick’s frontline managers to grow both as individuals and as leaders in their fields, while equipping them with the skills to manage their teams more effectively and to improve performance. The Barrick Academy will be training more than 2,000 foremen, supervisors and superintendents from the Africa and Middle East region in the next 24 months. Looking ahead, we are also gearing up to include our contractors and expand the curriculum to cover wider disciplines, including financial leadership, advanced computer literacy and safety courses. The opening of the Barrick Academy follows the construction of an airport terminal at Buzwagi’s Kahama airstrip in January this year, which has paved the way for a scheduled airline service that can serve more than 200 passengers at a time. It is expected to be a major catalyst for economic growth in the region. According to Barrick’s chief operating officer for the Africa and Middle East region, Sebastiaan Bock, the airport terminal and Academy form part of Barrick’s plan to turn Buzwagi into a Special Economic Zone (SEZ). A feasibility study commissioned in 2021 showed that the creation of the SEZ had the potential to replace the mine as the region’s economic driver and could sustainably create 3,000 jobs annually, generate more than $150,000 each year from service levies for the local municipality and deliver approximately $4.5 million in employment taxes a year. The Government of Tanzania approved the conversion of the mine into a SEZ through a Government Notice that was issued in February this year. A number of investors have started the process of setting up manufacturing industries inside this area. “How we close our mines is just as important to us as how we build and operate them. Our Buzwagi mine was a significant economic powerhouse in the region for nearly 15 years before it poured its last gold in 2021. From our perspective, however, that is not the end of the story for Buzwagi as we transform it into an alternative productive asset that will serve the community for decades to come,” Bock said.

Renewable Energy Analyst With TotalEnergies' announcement of surpassing 1.5 GW in renewable Power Purchase Agreements, the company is underscoring its strategic shift towards renewable energy sources. This shift is not just a corporate responsibility gesture but also a savvy business move. The diversification into renewables, particularly solar energy, is a hedge against volatile fossil fuel markets. By locking in long-term contracts, TotalEnergies is ensuring a steady revenue stream and mitigating risks associated with fluctuating energy prices. Moreover, TotalEnergies is tapping into the distributed generation market, which allows for energy production closer to the point of consumption. This reduces transmission losses and can improve grid resilience. The mention of 'onsite behind-the-meter batteries' is particularly noteworthy as it signifies an investment in energy storage solutions, which are critical for managing the intermittent nature of solar power and ensuring a consistent energy supply. Market Analyst The expansion of TotalEnergies' renewable energy portfolio is indicative of broader market trends where companies are increasingly investing in sustainable and renewable energy sources. The company's progress in renewable energy generation capacity, aiming to reach 35 GW by 2025, reflects an aggressive growth strategy in a sector that is becoming increasingly competitive. Investors are likely to view this as a positive development, considering the growing demand for green energy and the potential for TotalEnergies to capture a significant market share. The energy sector is undergoing a transformation and TotalEnergies' commitment to a diversified energy mix could position it favorably against its peers. The emphasis on operational excellence and long-term price visibility provided by PPAs could attract industrial and commercial clients seeking to stabilize their energy costs in an unpredictable market, potentially leading to increased demand for the company's services. Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Analyst TotalEnergies' strategy aligns with the growing importance of ESG criteria among investors. The company's investment in renewable energy and decarbonization initiatives, such as CO₂ capture and electric mobility, can enhance its ESG profile. This could attract socially responsible investors and funds that prioritize sustainability in their investment decisions. Furthermore, the company's efforts to support the energy transition across various industries could lead to partnerships with businesses that are also looking to improve their own ESG scores. However, it is essential to monitor the execution of these projects and the actual impact on emissions reduction. The long-term success of TotalEnergies' renewables strategy will depend on its ability to deliver on its promises and to effectively integrate these new assets into its overall business model without compromising profitability. 03/18/2024 - 03:49 AM PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News: TotalEnergies (Paris:TTE) (LSE:TTE) (NYSE:TTE) is pleased to announce it has reached over 1.5 GW of signed renewable Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with over 600 industrial and commercial customers worldwide, for self-consumption on their sites and injection into the grid.

Negative Increased costs in the Odda expansion project by EUR 100 million due to integration complexities and delayed deliveries. The total investment amount for the Odda expansion project rises to EUR 950 million. No specific financial data provided regarding revenue growth or profit margins from the new investments. 03/18/2024 - 03:46 AM STOCKHOLM, March 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Boliden has decided to invest in a new tank house at Rönnskär. The investment, which totals SEK 4.8 billion, means that production of copper cathodes as well as precious metals will gradually increase to full capacity during the second half of 2026. In parallel, further investments are being presented today, including extended lifespan of operations within the Boliden Area, as well as an updated investment guidance for 2024. ""All of our major investment projects are on schedule and are now approaching commissioning, which is very pleasing. Through these, both Aitik and Odda are future-proofed for the foreseeable future. It also gives us the opportunity to look ahead and now we present several decisions that create a corresponding situation for Rönnskär and the Boliden Area. In addition, we are announcing a technical breakthrough that has the potential to become a new and significant revenue stream for our smelters"", says Mikael Staffas, President and CEO. New tank house in Rönnskär Boliden has decided to invest SEK 4.8 billion in a new tank house at Rönnskär. The plant means that the production of copper cathodes and precious metals will gradually increase to full capacity during the second half of 2026. The investment, which will be partially financed by potential insurance payout with a maximum amount of SEK 3.4 billion, will begin in 2024. The plant will have a capacity of 230 ktonnes, which is in line with the previous capacity and is granted under existing environmental permit. Extended lifespan of the Boliden AreaIn the Boliden Area, investments will be made in dewatering and paste facilities in order to use tailings as backfill material in the Kankberg, Renström and Maurliden mines. This enables production in the Boliden Area to be extended by around ten years until the end of the thirties. The total investment is SEK 2.5 billion, the majority of which will be implemented between 2024 and 2026. Tests of the new technology show significantly improved environmental performance. The permit application will be submitted shortly. Update ongoing projectsBoliden's ongoing investment projects in Aitik, the Boliden Area and Odda all follows previously communicated timetables. The projects in Aitik and the Boliden Area are also running within the previously communicated investment level. The expansion project in Odda has suffered from increased costs, mainly as a result of underestimated complexity of the integration between new and existing facilities as well as costs related to delayed deliveries of certain key components. This means an increased cost with a total of EUR 100 million, of which approximately half was charged in 2023, and that the total investment amount for the expansion will be EUR 950 million. Updated investment guidance 2024Boliden's investments in 2024 are now expected to amount to SEK 15.5 billion, which is SEK 1.5 billion higher than previously communicated. Of the increase, approximately SEK 1 billion is related to the new investment in Rönnskär and the remaining SEK 500 m is attributable to Odda. Today's decided investment in the Boliden Area will amount to approximately SEK 500 m in 2024 and was included in previously communicated guidance. Supplementary cementitious material with a low climate footprintBoliden has made a significant technical breakthrough where slag from existing metal production in smelters can be converted into supplementary cementitious material. Compared to traditional cement production, this new technology means that the climate impact from cement production can be reduced by around 95 percent. The technology also means that additional metal can be extracted. An initial project has confirmed product and production performance, which has also been verified by established corporations in the cement industry. Patent applications have been submitted and a preliminary study regarding the commercialization of this product has been initiated. In addition, a preliminary study, which is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2025, of a production facility with a capacity of 250,000 tons per year is now initiated. Launch of Low-Carbon NickelBoliden's nickel production in Finland from the Kevitsa mine in the north via the smelter in Harjavalta has, from an international perspective, a very high climate performance. Based on Boliden's deliveries, nickel refineries can produce nickel with less than 5 kg CO2e/kg nickel. This compared to the global average of 34 kg CO2e/kg nickel. With the aim of supporting a responsible supply of nickel, among other things to the growing battery industry, Boliden is therefore launching the Low-Carbon Nickel product today. During today's digital capital market update, in-depth information on the news announced above is presented as well as information on the development of the sustainability area related to dam safety and climate performance. The presentations are available on Boliden's website www.boliden.com.

The company aims to expand its e-commerce logistics services, enhance its business presence, and capitalize on new opportunities. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The equity purchase agreement between Globavend Holdings Limited and Square Gate Capital represents a strategic financial maneuver that could have significant implications for the company's liquidity and capital structure. By securing a US$20,000,000 equity line, Globavend effectively bolsters its financial flexibility, which is particularly important for an emerging e-commerce logistics provider looking to expand. This influx of capital can be utilized for various growth initiatives, such as expanding into new markets or enhancing operational capabilities.From an investment perspective, the agreement introduces a dilution risk for current shareholders as the potential issuance of additional shares could decrease the value of existing shares. However, the company's right to control the timing and amount of equity sold provides a buffer against dilutive effects occurring too rapidly. Investors should monitor the company's use of this facility to gauge whether the capital is being allocated efficiently and driving the promised growth. Market Research Analyst Examining the e-commerce logistics sector, Globavend's move to secure additional capital for expansion is timely. The industry is experiencing rapid growth due to the surge in online shopping and logistics providers are important in ensuring efficient supply chain management. By targeting expansion in Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong, Globavend is tapping into markets with strong e-commerce potential.However, the success of this strategy will largely depend on how well the company can differentiate its services in a competitive landscape. The ability to integrate into different verticals of the logistics supply chain could be a key differentiator. Investors should look for signs of effective execution on these expansion plans and any subsequent market share gains as indicators of the company's long-term potential. Economist In the broader economic context, Globavend's strategic partnership with Square Gate Capital underscores a favorable investment climate for growth-oriented ventures in the e-commerce space. The willingness of institutional investors to commit substantial funds to an emerging player like Globavend signals confidence in the sector's resilience and future profitability.However, it's important to consider macroeconomic factors that could influence the success of this agreement. Fluctuations in consumer spending, shifts in trade policies and currency exchange rates, especially in the targeted expansion regions, could all impact Globavend's growth trajectory. Stakeholders should remain cognizant of these external variables when assessing the potential return on investment in the context of this equity agreement. 03/18/2024 - 03:42 AM PERTH, AUSTRALIA, March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Globavend Holdings Limited (Nasdaq: GVH) (the “Company” or “Globavend”), an emerging e-commerce logistics provider, is pleased to announce that it has entered into a US$20,000,000 equity purchase agreement (the “Equity Purchase Agreement”) with Square Gate Capital Master Fund, LLC – Series 1 (“Square Gate”), as well as a registration rights agreement (“Registration Right Agreement”) related thereto.

JOANN Enters into Agreement to Reduce Debt and Receive $132 Million in New Capital and Related Financial Accommodations with Strong Support of Key Financial and Industry Stakeholders,2024-03-18T04:37:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"JOANN Inc. announces a Transaction Support Agreement to strengthen its financial position, reduce debt by $505 million, and secure $132 million in new financing.

The company continues to operate normally, with commitments to pay all obligations to employees, vendors, landlords, and trade creditors in full. JOANN will become a private company post-restructuring, with stores and website operating as usual. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by JOANN Inc. regarding its financial restructuring under a prepackaged Chapter 11 process is a significant development with potential implications for its stakeholders, including shareholders, creditors and employees. The planned reduction of approximately $505 million in funded debt and the infusion of $132 million in new financing indicate a strategic move to stabilize the company's balance sheet and improve liquidity. However, this comes at the cost of delisting from Nasdaq, which will affect current shareholders as the company transitions to a private entity.From a financial perspective, the fact that 95 percent of JOANN's stores are cash flow positive is a positive indicator of the company's operational health, despite the need for restructuring. Investors should note that while the company's trade creditors are expected to be unimpaired, the equity holders are likely to experience significant dilution or even total loss of their investments as the company's shares will no longer be publicly traded. Market Research Analyst JOANN's focus on the sewing and fabrics category, coupled with its extensive arts and crafts offerings, positions it uniquely in the retail sector. Its commitment to maintaining uninterrupted operations and preserving trade relationships during the restructuring process suggests a strategic emphasis on customer and supplier continuity. This is important for maintaining the brand's reputation and competitive advantage in a niche market.As the company aims to drive long-term growth, it is essential to monitor consumer trends in the arts and crafts sector and how JOANN adapts its product assortments and customer experience enhancements to align with these trends. The impact on the broader retail market will depend on JOANN's ability to emerge from the restructuring process as a more financially robust and agile competitor. Legal Expert The legal implications of JOANN's prepackaged Chapter 11 filing are noteworthy. The company's decision to use a court-supervised process to facilitate its financial restructuring ensures that it can continue operations while addressing its capital structure needs. The 'first day' motions, which are typical in such cases, are intended to minimize disruption to the business and maintain normalcy for employees and trade partners.Stakeholders should be aware of the legal processes involved and the potential timeframe for the company's emergence from Chapter 11. The transition to a private company structure post-restructuring will also involve legal complexities, including the renegotiation of existing agreements and potential changes in governance and oversight. 03/18/2024 - 12:37 AM Stores and JOANN.com Remain Open; Company Continues to Operate as Usual Vendors, Landlords and Other General Unsecured Creditors Are Unimpaired Company Expects to Reduce Approximately $505 Million in Funded Debt Implementing Prepackaged Financial Recapitalization Plan on Expedited Basis HUDSON, Ohio, March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- JOANN Inc. (NASDAQ: JOAN) (“JOANN” or the “Company”), the nation’s category leader in sewing and fabrics with one of the largest arts and crafts offerings, today announced that it has entered into a Transaction Support Agreement (“TSA” or “Agreement”) with a majority of its financial stakeholders and additional industry financing parties to strengthen the Company’s financial position. In connection with the TSA, the Company has received commitments for approximately $132 million in new financing and related financial accommodations and expects to reduce funded debt on its balance sheet by approximately $505 million. The parties have also agreed to a six-month extension of the Company’s existing ABL and FILO credit facilities, effective upon the Company’s emergence from the court-supervised process. Under the TSA and related transaction documents, all obligations to employees, vendors, landlords, and other trade creditors will be paid or otherwise satisfied in full and honored in the ordinary course of business. “Over the past several months, JOANN has made meaningful business improvements through the execution of our Focus, Simplify and Grow cost reduction initiative,” said Chris DiTullio, Chief Customer Officer and co-lead of the Interim Office of the CEO. “We are excited by our progress on both top and bottom-line initiatives in the past year and are confident the steps we are taking will allow JOANN to drive long-term growth. We appreciate the support from our financial and industry stakeholders in this agreement, and their confidence in our ability to continue driving positive business change. There is no other retailer with the same ability to serve sewists, quilters, crocheters, crafters and other creative enthusiasts as we have for the past 80 years, and we take great pride in seeing the passion and engagement of our millions of customers and our Team Members.” Scott Sekella, JOANN’s Chief Financial Officer and co-lead of the Interim Office of the CEO, added, “This agreement is a significant step forward in addressing JOANN’s capital structure needs, and it will provide us with the financial resources and flexibility necessary to continue to deliver best-in-class product assortments and enhance the customer experience wherever they are shopping with us. This includes our more than 800 stores across the United States, 95 percent of which are cash flow positive. We remain committed to our suppliers, partners, Team Members and other stakeholders, and are focused on ensuring we continue to operate as usual so we can continue to best serve our millions of customers nationwide.” The financial restructuring contemplated by the TSA will be implemented through a prepackaged court-supervised process in which JOANN will continue to operate in the ordinary course of business. JOANN’s stores and the JOANN.com website will remain open and continue operating as normal and customers vendors, landlords, and other trade creditors will not see any disruption in services. The Company remains as focused as ever on providing customers with quality products and services that inspire their creativity. To effectuate the recapitalization transactions, JOANN and certain of its affiliates have initiated voluntary prepackaged Chapter 11 cases in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. With the significant support of the Company’s financial stakeholders, JOANN expects to complete this process on an expedited basis, as early as late April 2024. Following this process, the Company expects that JOANN will become a private company owned by certain of its lenders and industry parties, and its shares will no longer be listed on Nasdaq or any other national stock exchange. In connection with this process, JOANN is filing a number of customary “first day” motions to enable it to continue uninterrupted operations during the financial restructuring, including, among others, to continue paying wages and providing benefits to employees and to pay trade vendors and other general unsecured obligations in full in the ordinary course of business.

Full Year Revenues Decline by 16.3% to RMB 2,651.8 Million, with a Net Loss of RMB 271.8 Million in 2023. Positive The fourth quarter of 2023 saw Niu Technologies report revenues of RMB 478.7 million, marking a 21.8% decrease year over year. The net loss for the fourth quarter was RMB 130.2 million, compared to RMB 37.1 million in the same period in the previous year. For the full year 2023, Niu Technologies recorded revenues of RMB 2,651.8 million, showing a decline of 16.3% compared to the previous year. The full year net loss for 2023 was RMB 271.8 million, a significant increase from the net loss of RMB 49.5 million in 2022. Negative The decrease in revenues and increase in net loss for both the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 are negative aspects of the financial performance. The decline in e-scooter sales volume and revenues per e-scooter contributed to the overall decrease in revenues for Niu Technologies in 2023. Market Research Analyst The reported financial results from Niu Technologies show a significant downturn in both quarterly and annual revenue, with a notable increase in net losses. This decline is primarily due to a decrease in e-scooter sales volume and a drop in revenues per e-scooter, which suggests a contraction in both market demand and pricing power. Additionally, the gross margin contraction points to cost pressures or a shift towards lower-margin products.From a market perspective, the increased sales in international markets, despite the overall decline, indicate a strategic pivot or diversification effort. However, the increased operating expenses, particularly in selling and marketing, raise concerns about the efficiency of these expenditures given the revenue decline. Investors might question the return on investment for the aggressive marketing and expansion efforts, especially as they relate to the company's bottom line.Looking at the business outlook, the projected increase in sales volume for 2024 is ambitious, considering the current performance. The forecasted growth will likely depend on the company's ability to innovate, penetrate new markets and optimize costs. The market will closely monitor the company's progress against these projections, as they could be pivotal in determining the company's future trajectory. Financial Analyst Analyzing the financial health of Niu Technologies, the significant net loss increase year over year is a red flag for profitability concerns. The net loss margin has widened substantially, reflecting that losses are growing faster than revenues are declining, which is a troubling sign for financial stability.The balance sheet reveals a decent cash position, which provides some cushion for operational flexibility. However, the presence of restricted cash and short-term borrowings could imply liquidity constraints or upcoming financial obligations that need to be monitored. Investors should consider the company's cash burn rate in relation to its cash reserves to assess the sustainability of its financial position.Income tax benefits indicate some fiscal advantages that the company is currently enjoying, but these are not enough to offset the operational losses. The decrease in government grants year over year also suggests a potential reduction in external financial support, which could impact the company's ability to fund its operations without incurring additional debt or diluting shareholder value through equity offerings. Economist The performance of Niu Technologies can be seen as reflective of broader economic trends affecting the smart urban mobility sector. The decrease in e-scooter sales and revenue per unit may point to a market that is becoming increasingly saturated or experiencing price sensitivity among consumers. This could be due to macroeconomic factors such as reduced consumer spending power or increased competition within the industry.The international market's growth juxtaposed with the domestic decline may indicate shifting consumer preferences or economic conditions that are more favorable abroad. The company's future growth, as suggested by its optimistic sales volume forecast for 2024, will likely hinge on global economic conditions, including trade policies, currency exchange rates and the economic recovery post-pandemic.Furthermore, the transition from petrol to electric in mobility vehicles, as highlighted by the CEO, aligns with global environmental policies and the push for green technology. This macro trend could provide tailwinds for the company if it can capitalize on the increasing demand for eco-friendly transportation solutions and navigate the competitive landscape effectively. 03/18/2024 - 03:00 AM -- Fourth Quarter Revenues of RMB 478.7 million, down 21.8% year over year -- Fourth Quarter Net Loss of RMB 130.2 million, compared to net loss of RMB 37.1 million in the same period of last year -- Full Year Revenues of RMB 2,651.8 million, down 16.3% year over year -- Full Year Net loss of RMB 271.8 million, compared to net loss of RMB 49.5 million in 2022 BEIJING, March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Niu Technologies (“NIU”, or “the Company”) (NASDAQ: NIU), the world’s leading provider of smart urban mobility solutions, today announced its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023.

Gabather files two new patent applications to secure novel findings on the effects of GT-002 for the treatment of psychiatric disorders,2024-03-18T07:46:00.000Z,Neutral,Positive,"Gabather AB announces the filing of two new US provisional patent applications based on novel findings from the EEG/fMRI target engagement study with GT-002, a selective positive allosteric GABAA-receptor modulator, for medical use in psychiatric disorders.

The inventions aim to strengthen Gabather's intellectual property rights and enhance its position in the field of GABAA receptor modulators. Positive None. Negative None. Patent Law Expert The filing of new provisional patent applications by Gabather AB for their GABAA-receptor modulator GT-002 has significant implications for the company's legal and competitive landscape. The strategy to create a robust intellectual property portfolio is a common and effective one, aimed at safeguarding drug products and ensuring market exclusivity. The patents, if granted, will provide Gabather with legal tools to prevent other companies from entering the market with similar products, potentially leading to a monopoly-like situation for a certain period.The mention of 'novel and unexpected' claims suggests that the findings from the EEG/fMRI study could be groundbreaking and non-obvious, two key criteria for patentability. However, the true impact on the company's valuation and market position will only be realized if these applications mature into granted patents and if the subsequent clinical trials are successful. The patent applications themselves do not guarantee market success but do indicate a forward-moving trajectory in their R&D pipeline. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst From a market perspective, the announcement by Gabather AB represents a strategic move to enhance their market position in the neuropsychiatric drug sector. The focus on building layers of patents around drug products is a tactic to extend the commercial lifecycle of a drug, potentially delaying generic competition and maintaining higher profit margins for a longer period. This is particularly important in the pharmaceutical industry where R&D costs are substantial and the window for recouping these investments is limited by patent life.Furthermore, the differentiation of their product through proprietary technology could allow Gabather to command a premium price and establish themselves as a leader in a niche market. The announcement also signals to potential partners and investors that Gabather is progressing towards clinical trials, which is a critical milestone in drug development. However, the success of GT-002 and its impact on the company's financials will largely depend on clinical trial outcomes, regulatory approvals and the ability to successfully market and distribute the drug. Neuropharmacology Specialist The development of GT-002 as a selective positive allosteric GABAA-receptor modulator is noteworthy within the field of neuropharmacology. GABAA receptors are a common target for psychiatric drugs due to their role in modulating neuronal excitability and their involvement in anxiety, depression and other neuropsychiatric conditions. Positive allosteric modulators, by enhancing the receptor's response to the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), offer a potential therapeutic mechanism without directly activating the receptor, which can reduce side effects.That said, the path from patent filings to delivering a successful therapeutic to market is fraught with challenges, including rigorous clinical testing for efficacy and safety. The long-term impact on the business will hinge on the clinical trial results and whether GT-002 can demonstrate a favorable safety profile and clinical efficacy compared to existing treatments. If successful, GT-002 could represent a significant advancement in the treatment of psychiatric disorders, which would be a substantial achievement for Gabather and the medical community. 03/18/2024 - 03:46 AM STOCKHOLM, March 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Gabather AB (Nasdaq First North Growth Market: GABA) today reports that two new US provisional patent applications based on novel findings from the EEG/fMRI target engagement study with GT-002, a selective positive allosteric GABAA-receptor modulator. The inventions relate to the medical use of GT-002 in psychiatric disorders. The claims based on inventions from the results from our EEG/fMRI target engagement study are both novel and unexpected and will strengthen Gabather's intellectual property right (IPR) position in the field of GABAA receptor modulators, and the medical use of GT-002. Our IPR strategy is to build layers of patents around our drug products, generating a strong and attractive IPR position for the products that generates an extended patent protection of the drug product. Gabather has an active portfolio of patents and patent applications covering key products and methods that create significant value to the company, giving Gabather the freedom to operate, product differentiation, as well as a strong negotiation position in potential agreement negotiations. ""When approved by USPTO these patent's will further strengthen our drug products and market position, giving Gabather a strong competitive advantage in providing the next generation neuropsychiatric drugs to the patients. We will move forward into clinical trials in patients and identify the right partner for the continued development of GT-002"" says Michael-Robin Witt, CEO of Gabather AB. About GT-002 GT-002 is a small molecule GABAA receptor Positive Allosteric Modulator (PAM) eliciting both tonic and phasic inhibitory currents. GT-002 improves learning and memory in preclinical models. It restores ketamine induced cognitive deficits in the discrimination learning task model, and inhibits the behavioural effects induced by phencyclidine in the in-vivo model of schizophrenia. GT-002 has been shown to be anxiolytic and to promote social interaction in rats. GT-002 targets a novel binding site on GABAA receptors, different from benzodiazepines (BZD), and has not shown any of the side effects known for BZD. Long-term treatment (28 days) with GT-002 has not shown any withdrawal symptoms upon cessation of treatment both in mice and dogs, indicating no drug abuse liability associated with this drug candidate. GT-002 has completed 3 phase I clinical trials in healthy volunteers. Both single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) studies have been completed. The results from these studies show that GT-002 is safe and well tolerated and that it has excellent pharmacokinetics, allowing for once-a-day oral dosing. An EEG/fMRI target engagement study in healthy volunteers aimed to determine the effects of GT-002 on brain activity across different brain regions and neuronal networks has recently been completed.

(""Troy""or the ""Company"") (CSE:TROY)(OTCQB:TROYF)(FSE:VJ3) is pleased to announce it has completed the staking of a new property highly prospective for rare-earth elements. The Property is 100% owned by the Company and is unencumbered by any royalties at the present time. The Property is located approximately 320 km north of Prince George, BC, and 170 km north-northwest of Mackenzie, BC, on the western side of Williston Lake (Figure 1).HighlightsHighly prospective property acquired through staking minimizing acquisition costs.Stream sediment sampling returned strongly anomalous REE concentrations from multiple creeks and drainages, including 3,647 ppm TREE (total rare earth elements) and 2,550 ppm TREE.Project unencumbered by any royalty or streaming contracts gives the company increased value and potential future financing optionality.Large property encompassing 9 claims totaling 3,924.88 ha., several mineral occurrences and the past producing Family Farm mica mine.Property benefits from good infrastructure and access.Access to the lower elevations is available by various logging roads from Mackenzie. Upper elevations will require the use of a helicopter. Figure 1: Project location map.The Property encompasses several BC Minfile occurrences classified as muscovite pegmatites. The Family Farm occurrence is a past producer of muscovite mica from pegmatites, dating back to the 1920's. The occurrence comprises two concordant dikes of white pegmatite, intruding schist and consisting of mostly muscovite, quartz, and feldspar. Accessory minerals include pyrite, tourmaline, garnet and kyanite. The West Mica Mountain prospect located 3.8 km southwest also reports large muscovite mica crystals up to 33cm. These occurrences are hosted in quartzites and quartz-feldspar-muscovite schists of the Neoproterozoic Swannell Formation.""Our technical team was able to identify this great opportunity to add to our REE portfolio through staking in an area with a lot of REE potential"", said Rana Vig, President and CEO of Troy Minerals Inc. ""British Columbia is already Canada's biggest producer of the critical metal copper, the only producer of molybdenum, and smelts other key critical minerals such as aluminum, zinc and germanium. British Columbia is an outstanding province for critical metal exploration"" he added.Most recent exploration between 2006 and 2010 was focused on assessing the REE potential with surface geochemical sampling consisting of stream sediment, soil and rock sampling. Stream sediment sampling returned strongly anomalous REE concentrations from multiple creeks and drainages, including 3,647 ppm TREE (total rare earth elements) and 2,550 ppm TREE (Figure 2). Widely spaced soil sampling in the two main valleys returned several anomalous values of 809 ppm and 1,005 ppm from the western valley and 908 ppm and 867 ppm TREE from the eastern valley (Figure 2). Historical rock sampling did not identify any anomalous samples, although the dataset is quite small and limited in scope and was focused on two occurrences. Figure 2: Geochemisty plan map, silt and soil samples.An initial phase of data compilation of the historical work will be followed by a field program to confirm historical concentrations and further assess the REE potential.The Company also announces that it has extended its marketing contract with i2i Marketing Group LLC, previously announced on November 24, 2023. The extension will be for a period of 60 days or until fund exhaustion of US $150,000.

The $211 million agreement spans six years with a five-year extension option, focusing on program and asset optimization, value engineering, and innovation. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Jacobs' selection by United Utilities to its Strategic Solutions Team (SST) is significant for stakeholders, as it directly pertains to a substantial contract valued at approximately $211 million. This figure, spread over a six-year base contract period with a potential five-year extension, represents a predictable and stable revenue stream for Jacobs. The focus on program and asset optimization in the water infrastructure sector is a strategic move, considering the essential nature of water services and the increasing global emphasis on sustainable practices.From an investment perspective, the contract could enhance Jacobs' earnings visibility and potentially improve its competitive positioning within the infrastructure management industry. The long-term nature of the agreement also suggests a degree of confidence from United Utilities in Jacobs' capabilities, which may bode well for future contract wins and renewals. It's important to note, however, that the actual impact on Jacobs' financials will depend on the execution of the contract and the company's ability to manage costs effectively while delivering on the promised innovations and efficiencies. Environmental Consultant The emphasis on lowest carbon and cost solutions in Jacobs' contract with United Utilities reflects a growing trend in the utility industry towards environmental sustainability. Jacobs' role in driving innovation and standardization across United Utilities' asset base is critical in an industry facing stringent regulatory pressures and a societal push for greener practices. The integration of digital engineering and AI-driven predictive analytics, such as the Aqua DNA solution, highlights an industry shift towards more proactive and technologically advanced asset management strategies.While this contract is a positive development for both Jacobs and United Utilities, the broader environmental implications are equally noteworthy. By optimizing water infrastructure resilience and performance, there is potential for both reduced environmental impact and improved service delivery. However, the success of these initiatives will hinge on Jacobs' ability to translate innovative concepts into tangible outcomes that align with environmental goals. Market Research Analyst Jacobs' continued partnership with United Utilities, extending over two decades, indicates a strong client-provider relationship, which can be a significant differentiator in the professional services industry. The ability to secure repeat business, particularly in a sector as specialized as water services, suggests a high level of customer satisfaction and a deep understanding of the unique challenges faced by United Utilities.As Jacobs undertakes this new phase of collaboration, the market will be observing how this partnership influences the company's market share and positioning within the water services sector. The integration of innovative solutions like Aqua DNA could potentially set new industry standards and enhance Jacobs' reputation as a leader in digital transformation. However, the market will also be looking for evidence of these strategies translating into improved financial performance over the duration of the AMP8 and AMP9 periods. 03/18/2024 - 04:00 AM Framework to help optimize future asset investment programs Supports the management of water infrastructure resilience in North West England DALLAS, March 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Jacobs (NYSE: J) has been selected by United Utilities, one of the U.K.'s largest listed water companies, to its Strategic Solutions Team (SST) to support program optimization for major capital works through the asset management period (AMP8), which runs from 2025 to 2030, and asset management period 9 (AMP9) which runs from 2030 to 2035. Working with United Utilities and its construction delivery partners, Jacobs will drive program and asset optimization, value engineering, innovation and standardization across the water company's existing and new asset base – developing efficient, integrated solutions and recommending preferred options based on best value, lowest carbon and cost. Jacobs' technical services will range from feasibility and value management studies, commercial modeling, business case development, design and digital engineering, to whole life cost, best value assessments and more. United Utilities values the total framework agreement at approximately $211 million over the base contract period of six years with a five-year extension option. ""This appointment extends our long-term relationship with United Utilities to more than 20 years, reinforcing our position as their trusted advisor,"" said Jacobs Senior Vice President Kate Kenny. ""Taking a program level, holistic approach to asset base optimization is critical to challenging norms and devising strategic water solutions to deliver customer and environmental benefits in the North West of England."" United Utilities provides water and wastewater services to around seven million people in the North West of England supplying three million households and 200,000 business premises. Jacobs has supported United Utilities on the current engineering services framework for the past 10 years, providing a wide range of services from strategic studies and business planning through to asset optimization, project and program management – working together to ensure the resilience of critical assets such as the Haweswater Aqueduct. United Utilities implemented a Dynamic Network Management approach, powered by Jacobs' Aqua DNA—a Digital OneWater solution that collects live data and enhances wastewater network performance using smart sensors and AI-driven predictive analytics—to proactively address challenges and prevent issues. Jacobs has also supported United Utilities with successful submissions in Ofwat's (the Water Services Regulation Authority for England and Wales) past and most recent innovation competition, Water Breakthrough Challenge 3. At Jacobs, we're challenging today to reinvent tomorrow by solving the world's most critical problems for thriving cities, resilient environments, mission-critical outcomes, operational advancement, scientific discovery and cutting-edge manufacturing, turning abstract ideas into realities that transform the world for good.

Fennec to receive €40M upfront, up to €210M in milestones, and royalties. PEDMARQSI holds significant market potential with approvals in EU and UK based on Phase 3 trial data. Positive None. Negative None. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The strategic partnership between Fennec Pharmaceuticals and Norgine represents a significant development in the pediatric oncology market. The licensing agreement leverages Norgine's strong commercial presence in Europe, Australia and New Zealand to distribute PEDMARQSI®, a novel therapy for preventing cisplatin-induced hearing loss. This move could potentially disrupt the market by providing a unique solution to a previously unmet medical need.From a market perspective, the upfront payment of €40 million, coupled with the milestone payments of up to €210 million, reflects the high value attributed to PEDMARQSI®'s market potential. The tiered royalty structure up to the mid-twenties percentage range is indicative of a favorable deal for Fennec, aligning with industry standards for a drug with PEDMARQSI®'s profile. Considering the estimated patient population of over 5,000 in Europe alone, the revenue prospects appear promising.The eight-plus-two-year market and data protection in Europe offers a substantial competitive advantage, shielding PEDMARQSI® from generic competition and allowing Norgine to capitalize on this period to maximize market penetration and return on investment. Pediatric Oncology Specialist The approval and commercialization of PEDMARQSI® address a critical gap in pediatric oncology care. Cisplatin, while effective as a chemotherapy agent, has a well-documented side effect of ototoxicity, leading to hearing loss, which can be particularly detrimental in children. The introduction of PEDMARQSI® as a preventative therapy is a milestone in improving the quality of life for pediatric patients undergoing cisplatin treatment.The clinical data from the SIOPEL 6 and COG Protocol ACCL0431 studies underpinning the approval of PEDMARQSI® suggest that it has a favorable safety and efficacy profile. This is a key consideration for clinicians when prescribing new treatments, especially in a pediatric setting. The therapy's impact on reducing the incidence of hearing loss can have profound implications for a child's development, including their educational and social experiences.Furthermore, the pursuit of approvals in Switzerland, Australia and New Zealand indicates an aggressive expansion strategy, which could lead to a wider global impact and set a precedent for future pediatric oncology treatments. Healthcare Economist The economic implications of PEDMARQSI®'s introduction are multifaceted. On one hand, the prevention of cisplatin-induced hearing loss could lead to a decrease in long-term healthcare costs associated with hearing impairment, such as the need for hearing aids, special education and other support services. This preventative approach aligns with broader healthcare trends focused on reducing long-term costs through early intervention.On the other hand, the cost of the drug itself and the associated expenses of bringing it to market, will be reflected in the pricing strategy. The financial burden on healthcare systems and patients will need to be weighed against the benefits of the treatment. The agreement's structure, with significant milestone payments, suggests confidence in the commercial success of the drug but also places pressure on Norgine to achieve sales targets to recoup the investment.It will be important to monitor how PEDMARQSI® is adopted by healthcare providers and whether it becomes a standard part of pediatric oncology protocols. This will determine its long-term economic impact on the healthcare system and its value proposition to stakeholders. 03/17/2024 - 09:00 PM Agreement pairs Norgine’s commercial expertise and leading European footprint with PEDMARQSI®, the first and only approved therapy in the European Union and U.K. for reducing the risk of cisplatin-induced hearing loss in pediatric patients with localized, non-metastatic solid tumors Fennec will receive €40 million in upfront and up to €210 million in additional commercial and regulatory milestones, and tiered royalties up to the mid-twenties Enhances Norgine’s commitment to bringing transformative therapies to patients in Europe, U.K., Australia, and New Zealand who currently do not have access to a therapy to treat this life altering condition RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C. and UXBRIDGE, United Kingdom, March 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fennec Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: FENC; TSX: FRX), a commercial stage specialty pharmaceutical company, and Norgine, a leading European specialist pharmaceutical company, today announced an exclusive licensing agreement under which Norgine will commercialize PEDMARQSI® in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. PEDMARQSI is the first and only approved therapy in the EU and U.K. for the prevention of ototoxicity (hearing loss) induced by cisplatin chemotherapy in patients 1 month to < 18 years of age with localized, non-metastatic solid tumors. Under the terms of the licensing agreement, Fennec will receive €40 million in upfront consideration and up to €210 million in additional commercial and regulatory milestone payments and double-digit tiered royalties on net sales of PEDMARQSI in the licensed territories up to the mid-twenties. Norgine will be responsible for all commercialization activities in the licensed territories and will hold all marketing authorizations in the licensed territories. It is estimated that more than 5,000 pediatric patients annually are eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy in Europe. PEDMARQSI was granted EU marketing authorization by the European Commission in June 2023, and received UK approval from the MHRA in October 2023. Approvals were based on safety and efficacy data from two open-label, randomized Phase 3 trials, SIOPEL 6 (pivotal) and Clinical Oncology Group [COG] Protocol ACCL0431. The studies compared PEDMARQSI plus cisplatin-based regimens to cisplatin-based regimens alone for the reduction of cisplatin-induced hearing loss in pediatric patients. PEDMARQSI holds eight years plus two years of data and market protection in Europe based on its Pediatric Use Marketing Authorization. Approval in Switzerland, Australia and New Zealand will also be pursued. The first study (SIOPEL-6) involved 114 children with hepatoblastoma (a cancer of the liver), with an average age of about 19 months. The results showed that 35% (20 out of 57) of children who received PEDMARQSI 6 hours after each dose of cisplatin developed hearing loss compared with 67% (35 out of 52) of children who only received cisplatin. The second study involved 125 children aged 1 month to 18 years with different types of cancer, including hepatoblastoma, neuroblastoma (a cancer of immature nerve cells) and tumours of the central nervous system. The study found that hearing loss was experienced by 29% (14 out of 49) of children who received PEDMARQSI after each cisplatin dose compared with 56% (31 out of 55) of those who received only cisplatin. “We are delighted to partner with Norgine, who shares our belief in the potential of PEDMARQSI to mitigate the risk of permanent and irreversible hearing loss that can occur in pediatric patients treated with cisplatin. Further, this partnership is an important step in achieving our mission of expanding PEDMARQSI to patients across the globe who are at risk of suffering from cisplatin-induced ototoxicity,” said Rosty Raykov, Chief Executive Officer of Fennec Pharmaceuticals. “From a deal perspective, the terms provided us many important benefits, including an upfront payment further solidifying our balance sheet, attractive economic terms providing meaningful participation in the ex-US success of PEDMARQSI and an experienced partner to successfully launch PEDMARQSI in the licensed territory.” Chris Bath, Chief Executive Officer of Norgine, said, “We are thrilled to announce our partnership with Fennec, to bring this vital medicine to pediatric patients who are being treated with cisplatin, across Europe and ANZ. We look forward to working with the Fennec team and launching PEDMARQSI in our territories in the coming months, establishing it as the standard of care in this critical patient population with high unmet need. This important milestone for our company builds on our 30-year track record of creating partnerships of enduring value and further underscores Norgine’s position as the specialty pharma partner of choice across Europe and ANZ.” Moelis & Company LLC acted as financial advisor, and LaBarge Weinstein LLP acted as legal advisor to Fennec. Arnold & Porter acted as legal advisor to Norgine.
