Automotive Industry Analyst In assessing the recent partnership between Phoenix Motor Inc. and Cennatic Power, it's essential to evaluate the competitive landscape of the electric vehicle (EV) market and the strategic implications. Phoenix Motor's decision to partner for custom battery packs suggests a proactive approach to resolving a significant bottleneck for EV manufacturers, which is battery supply and technology. This move could potentially lead to cost reductions via economies of scale and improved procurement terms.Integration of Cennatic's advanced battery technology could enhance the value proposition of Phoenix Motor's EVs through longer range and reliability, a key consideration for commercial clients. As the EV market expands, driven by environmental considerations and regulatory encouragement, Phoenix's strategic alignment with a battery supplier could strengthen its market position, possibly translating to a favorable impact on stock performance. Nonetheless, one must consider execution risks and any potential delays in technology development or integration that could affect projected benefits. Environmental Sustainability Analyst From an environmental sustainability perspective, the collaboration between Phoenix Motor and Cennatic aligns with the increasing global emphasis on reducing carbon emissions. The transportation sector is a significant contributor to greenhouse gases and the shift towards electric mobility is important for meeting climate goals. Phoenix's focus on heavy-duty transit buses is particularly noteworthy, as these vehicles can have a disproportionally large impact on emissions.Investors with an interest in socially responsible investing may find Phoenix's efforts in promoting sustainable transportation attractive. However, for the long-term viability of this strategy, it is important to consider the source of electricity for charging the EVs and the lifecycle environmental impact of the batteries themselves, including recycling and disposal procedures. Financial Analyst Financially, the partnership could increase Phoenix Motor’s capital expenditures in the short term due to research and development costs. However, it might improve gross margins over time through potentially reduced battery pack costs and differentiated product features. Market growth projections from $70.9 billion to over $255 billion by 2030 indicate a significant opportunity if Phoenix captures even a fraction of this market share.Investor attention should be on how Phoenix plans to fund the partnership's developmental phase and its impact on cash flow. Additionally, the ability of Phoenix to translate this partnership into increased sales and market share will be pivotal. While the partnership is promising on paper, investors should monitor the subsequent financial quarters for evidence of ROI and the partnership's material effect on operational results. 04/23/2024 - 03:45 AM ANAHEIM, CA / ACCESSWIRE / April 23, 2024 / Phoenix Motor Inc.

SAN JOSE, Calif., April 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ: ZS), the leader in cloud security, today announced the release of the Zscaler ThreatLabz 2024 Phishing Report, which analyzes 2 billion blocked phishing transactions across the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange™ platform, the world’s largest cloud security platform, between January and December 2023. The data revealed a year-over-year increase of nearly 60% in global phishing attacks, fueled in part by the proliferation of generative AI-driven schemes such as voice phishing (vishing) and deepfake phishing. This year’s report includes actionable insights on phishing activity and tactics, along with offering best practices and strategies to enhance an organization’s security posture to prevent and minimize related threats. “Phishing remains a persistent and often underestimated threat within the cybersecurity landscape, growing more sophisticated as threat actors harness cutting-edge advancements in generative AI and manipulate trusted platforms to intensify attacks,” said Deepen Desai, CSO and Head of Security Research. “In this context, the latest ThreatLabz insights are more crucial than ever for informing our strategies and strengthening phishing defenses. These findings emphasize the need for organizations to adopt a proactive layered approach that integrates a robust zero trust architecture with advanced AI-powered phishing prevention controls to effectively counteract these evolving threats.” North America experienced more than half of all phishing attacks, with EMEA and India following In 2023, the United States (55.9%), United Kingdom (5.6%) and India (3.9%) emerged as the top countries targeted by phishing scams. The high occurrence of phishing in the U.S. is attributable to its advanced digital infrastructure, large population of internet-connected users and extensive use of online financial transactions. Canada (2.9%) and Germany (2.8%) rounded out the top five countries that experienced the most phishing attempts. The majority of phishing attacks originated from the U.S., the U.K., and Russia, while Australia entered the top 10 due to a 479% year-over-year surge in the volume of phishing content hosted in the country. Financial industry faces a nearly 400% increase in attacks The finance and insurance sector experienced the highest number of overall phishing attempts, amounting to a 393% increase of attacks from the previous year. Reliance on digital financial platforms provides ample opportunities for threat actors to carry out phishing campaigns and exploit vulnerabilities in this sector. The manufacturing industry also experienced a significant uptick (31%) in phishing attacks from 2022 to 2023, underscoring the growing awareness of the industry's vulnerability. As manufacturing processes become more reliant on digital systems and interconnected technologies like IoT/OT, the risk of exploitation by threat actors seeking unauthorized access or disruption also grows. Microsoft remains the most impersonated brand used in phishing attacks ThreatLabz researchers identified enterprise brands such as Microsoft, OneDrive, Okta, Adobe and SharePoint as prime targets for impersonation due to their widespread usage and the value associated with acquiring user credentials for these platforms. Microsoft (43%) emerged as the top imitated enterprise brand in 2023, with its OneDrive (12%) and SharePoint (3%) platforms also ranking in the top five—serving as lucrative targets for cybercriminals aiming to exploit Microsoft’s vast user base. How a Zero Trust architecture can mitigate phishing attacks Organizations can implement a Zero Trust architecture with advanced AI-powered phishing prevention controls to effectively defend against the ever-evolving threat landscape highlighted in the report. The Zero Trust Exchange platform helps prevent conventional and AI-driven phishing attacks at multiple stages of the attack chain by: Preventing compromise: TLS/SSL inspection at scale, AI-powered browser isolation and policy-driven access controls prevent access to suspicious websites.Eliminating lateral movement: Users connect directly to applications, not the network, while AI-powered app segmentation limits the blast radius of a potential incident.Shutting down compromised users and insider threats: Inline inspection prevents private application exploit attempts, and integrated deception capabilities detect the most sophisticated attackers.Stopping data loss: Inspection of data in-motion and at-rest prevents potential theft by an active attacker.

For more information about NewHydrogen, please visit https://newhydrogen.com/. About NewHydrogen, Inc. NewHydrogen is developing ThermoLoop™ – a breakthrough technology that uses water and heat rather than electricity to produce the world’s cheapest green hydrogen. Hydrogen is the cleanest and most abundant element in the universe, and we can’t live without it. Hydrogen is the key ingredient in making fertilizers needed to grow food for the world. It is also used for transportation, refining oil and making steel, glass, pharmaceuticals and more. Nearly all the hydrogen today is made from hydrocarbons like coal, oil, and natural gas, which are dirty and limited resources. Water, on the other hand, is an infinite and renewable worldwide resource. Currently, the most common method of making green hydrogen is to split water into oxygen and hydrogen with an electrolyzer using green electricity produced from solar or wind. However, green electricity is and always will be very expensive. It currently accounts for 73% of the cost of green hydrogen. By using heat directly, we can skip the expensive process of making electricity, and fundamentally lower the cost of green hydrogen. Inexpensive heat can be obtained from concentrated solar, geothermal, nuclear reactors and industrial waste heat for use in our novel low-cost thermochemical water splitting process. Working with a world class research team at UC Santa Barbara, our goal is to help usher in the green hydrogen economy that Goldman Sachs estimated to have a future market value of $12 trillion.

Nearly a third of Americans who have used a dating app have been targeted by a dating scam, with almost half falling victim. AI technology, while beneficial in some aspects, can also make online dating riskier and more complex. 04/23/2024 - 03:01 AM Amid the excitement of incorporating AI into online dating, romance seekers should still be cautious of dating scams and catfishing TEMPE, Ariz. and PRAGUE, April 23, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- A new global survey from Norton, a consumer Cyber Safety brand of Gen™ (NASDAQ: GEN), has shed light on a new way people are looking to incorporate AI into their lives -- online dating. Two thirds (64%) of current online daters are interested in using AI as their dating coach. This finding is part of a broader exploration in the 2024 Norton Cyber Safety Insights Report – Special Release: Online Dating, which delves into online behaviors when it comes to meeting and exchanging information with prospective partners and romantic interests. We found that people looking for love invest a significant amount of time and money on online dating. In fact, Norton data shows the average online dater currently spends six hours a week and $300 throughout their lifetime on dating apps and services. Given this investment, people are turning to AI as a convenient tool to guide them through online dating to help increase their chances of finding a match. Of those who are currently using an online dating app or service, 71% of people are interested in using AI to write pick up lines and conversation starters, 70% for dating app profile development and 64% for photo enhancement. However, while there's excitement around the possibility of using AI to improve the online dating experience, people need to be aware to how this technology can also lead to the potential threat of romance scams, especially as Norton telemetry found online dating scams increased by 72% since 2023. Norton's data shows that nearly a third of Americans (27%) who have used a dating app say they have been targeted by a dating scam, with almost half (42%) of this 27% falling victim. Additionally, nearly a third (30%) of Americans who have used a dating app said they had been catfished by someone. ""Online dating is notoriously difficult to navigate and using AI as a dating coach seems innocuous when you're on the receiving end of a bad pickup line or trying to draft a thoughtful breakup text. However, AI technology can also make online dating riskier and more complicated when it's utilized in more nefarious ways,"" said Leyla Bilge, Director of Scam Research Labs for Norton. ""Romance scams aren't new, but AI is changing the game and making these types of scams more common and much harder to spot. People need to stay vigilant for signs of romance scams such as individuals who avoid video or phone calls, have very few images on their dating profiles or attempt to progress the relationship quickly."" The report also uncovered: Nearly half (45%) of men prefer to meet a potential partner online. While only a fifth (19%) of women prefer to meet a potential partner online. This could likely be attributed to a lack of perceived safety regarding the people they interact with on the apps.Surprisingly, online daters ranked Instagram (61%) and Bumble (52%) as the perceived safest dating apps.Raya is perceived as the least safe, with only 23% of people agreeing it is safe.Over half (54%) of Americans have used an online dating app while traveling or on vacation.With the increased popularity of AI in online dating and rising scams targeting online daters, there is a critical need for education and awareness around Cyber Safety. Norton helps people leverage AI and digital safety tools to navigate the online dating world safely with products like Norton Genie, a free AI-powered scam detection app. Norton Genie can review suspicious texts, emails or web links, such as those that direct people to fake dating sites or website links from prospective partners, and confirm if it's malicious.

Energy Sector Analyst SFL Corporation's strategic acquisition of two LNG dual-fuel chemical carriers represents a notable forward step in diversifying their maritime asset portfolio. This move aligns with the industry's shift towards more environmentally friendly vessels that also meet rising global demand for chemical transport. The partnership with Stolt Tankers not only ensures a guaranteed revenue stream through long-term charters but also positions SFL within a growth trajectory in the chemical logistics sector. The dual-earning strategy—one vessel on fixed-rate and the other operating in a pool—allows SFL to capitalize on market rate fluctuations while maintaining a steady income base. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the acquisition of these vessels for approximately $114 million and their subsequent long-term employment serves as a significant investment in SFL's future earnings capability. The structured deals involving fixed-rate time-charters, profit share mechanisms and purchase options indicate a savvy approach to managing risk and potential profitability. The longevity of the contracts, spanning at least eight years with extensions, provides a clear view of the future cash flow and could justify the capital expenditure when assessing the impact on SFL's balance sheet. This transaction could lead to an uptick in investor confidence, reflecting positively on the firm's stock valuation. Environmental and Regulatory Affairs Analyst By investing in LNG dual-fuel technology, SFL demonstrates an active commitment to reducing the carbon footprint of its fleet. This move is significant not only from an environmental standpoint but also from a regulatory perspective as it anticipates stricter emissions standards in the maritime industry. It's a proactive approach that could provide SFL with a competitive edge in securing charters with businesses increasingly focused on sustainability. The integration of these vessels into SFL's operations will be closely watched by industry stakeholders, as they lean into the broader trend of green energy adoption in shipping. 04/23/2024 - 02:29 AM SFL Corporation Ltd. (NYSE: SFL) (“SFL” or the “Company”) today announced that it has agreed to acquire two LNG dual-fuel 33,000 dwt chemical carriers. The vessels are built in 2022/2023 and fitted with stainless steel cargo tanks, and the aggregate purchase price is approximately $114 million. SFL has arranged long term employment for the vessels with affiliates of Stolt Tankers, a subsidiary of the world-leading chemical logistics company Stolt-Nielsen Limited (“Stolt-Nielsen”). The Company expects to take delivery of the vessels between June and August this year and both vessels will be employed for a minimum of eight years. One vessel will be on a fixed rate time-charter and one vessel will be employed in a pool with similar-sized vessels. The fixed rate vessel has extension options of up to three years, in addition to purchase options after year five and eight, subject to a profit share mechanism with SFL. Ole B. Hjertaker, CEO of SFL Management AS, said in a comment: «The announcement marks another accretive investment for the Company and will add two sophisticated chemical carriers to our fleet. With these vessels, we will have six LNG dual-fuel vessels in our fleet, and the transaction demonstrates our ability to expand our portfolio of maritime assets with vessels suitable for long term charters to industry leading companies. We are excited to build a new relationship with Stolt-Nielsen who has a market leading position in the logistics for sophisticated chemicals. The market dynamics for stainless-steel chemical tankers are also very favorable now, with steady underlying growth in demand, ageing fleet and a limited orderbook. The combination of fixed-rate charter and pool earnings will therefore give us the opportunity to participate in a strong market, while also providing increased charter backlog.” Commenting on the transaction, Udo Lange, Chief Executive Officer, Stolt-Nielsen said “I’m pleased to announce our new partnership with SFL Corporation on two modern chemical tankers. As well as securing attractively priced on-the-water tonnage in a firm chemical tanker market, these modern, dual-fuel ships will lower the age profile and carbon intensity of our fleet while offering more flexibility in our core 33,000 deadweight segment. This transaction also demonstrates our commitment to asset-light fleet replacement with best-in-class partners like SFL Corporation, NYK Line, and CMB Group to enhance profitability and reduce our balance sheet intensity. As a leading liquid logistics provider, it is critical Stolt-Nielsen balances capital allocation across all our businesses to drive further improvements in our industry leading customer service offering and reliability.” April 23, 2024 The Board of DirectorsSFL Corporation Ltd.Hamilton, Bermuda Investor and Analyst Contacts:Aksel Olesen, Chief Financial Officer, SFL Management AS+47 23 11 40 36André Reppen, Chief Treasurer & Senior Vice President, SFL Management AS+47 23 11 40 55Sander Borgli, Vice President - IR, SFL Management AS +47 23 11 40 73Media Contact:Ole B.

The market will likely react positively to this news, reflecting the perceived value by investors. However, it is essential to consider post-acquisition integration challenges, which could impact the long-term realization of synergies between the two companies. Maintaining Hibbett's headquarters and current CEO suggests an integration strategy that respects Hibbett’s operational culture, potentially smoothing the transition process. M&A Legal Advisor The unanimous board approval and absence of a financing condition underscore the strength and preparedness behind this acquisition. It's important for investors to acknowledge that the deal is structured to proceed smoothly, with the usual due diligence, regulatory approvals and stockholder consent as the remaining hurdles. The legal stipulation to suspend dividend payments and share buybacks until the deal's closure safeguards Hibbett's financial position, which is a prudent measure for both companies. From a legal standpoint, while the transaction seems straightforward, the retail investor should pay attention to potential regulatory concerns that could delay or alter the terms, especially given the increasing global scrutiny of major acquisitions. Market Research Analyst Combining Hibbett's US presence with JD Sports' global footprint creates a formidable player in the athletic retail space. This acquisition aligns with consumer trends favoring specialized athletic apparel and footwear. The market opportunity for both companies lies not just in scale but also in leveraging each other's strengths. Hibbett could benefit from JD Sports' international brand relationships, while JD Sports can utilize Hibbett's established US market presence to drive growth. For the investor, this deal signals potential future growth stemming from an extended distribution platform and enhanced market penetration. However, they should monitor consumer response and the execution of the combined companies' business strategy to ensure the theoretical benefits translate into actual performance. 04/23/2024 - 02:04 AM JD Sports to acquire all outstanding shares for $87.50 per share in cash, in a $1.1 billion transaction Per share price represents a 21% premium to the April 22, 2024, closing price and a 29% premium to the 120-trading day volume weighted average price Combination of best-in-class customer-centric companies offers brand partners an expanded global platform for distribution of the latest athletic fashion products Mike Longo to continue as Hibbett President and CEO, and Jared Briskin to take on role of Hibbett COO; Hibbett will maintain HQ in Birmingham BIRMINGHAM, Ala.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Hibbett, Inc.

(CSE: DTC) (OTCQB: DTCFF) (FSE: DTC) (""Defence"" or the ""Company""), a Canadian biopharmaceutical company developing novel immune-oncology therapeutics and drug delivery technologies, is pleased to announce that its second-generation ARMTM anti-cancer vaccine using AccuTOX®, called ARM-002TM, is therapeutically effective against pre-established melanoma when combined with the anti-PD-1 immune-checkpoint inhibitor.Defence's application of reprogrammed mesenchymal stromal cells (""MSCs"") represents a leading vaccination platform due to its ease in manufacturing and the therapeutic potency that this allogeneic off-the-shelf vaccine can provide. The use of AccuTOX® to reprogram these MSCs relies mainly on the induction of protein aggregation. This process is known to induce the activation of the unfolded protein response, a cellular defense mechanism normally triggered to destroy any captured protein aggregates due to the toxicity and disturbance it causes to cell integrity.""Defence's AccuTOX® was initially known for its ability to kill cancer cells. In addition, our team found that at specific doses, AccuTOX® forms protein aggregates when mixed with tumor lysate, a process that pushes MSCs to degrade these intracellular complexes resulting in potent antigen presentation,"" says Mr. Plouffe, Chief Executive Officer of Defence Therapeutics.The original ARMTM vaccine was potent against melanoma. The ARM-002TM vaccine is even more potent, as it actually requires 10x less protein. This was confirmed both in vitro (using antigen cross-presentation assay) and in vivo where ARM-002TM pulsed with 0.05 mg/ml of tumor lysate resulted in similar outcomes compared to ARM-002TM generated using a dose of 0.5 mg/ml. In addition, the potency of the ARM-002TM vaccine was comparable in both male and female mice, with no noticeable side effects detected in vaccinated animals. Defence is currently testing the ARM-002TM vaccine on ""hard-to-treat"" cancers such as pancreatic, colon and ovarian cancers. These results will set the target indication for the Phase I trials, and it also shows how versatile and adaptable the ARM-002TM anti-cancer vaccine is.About Defence:Defence Therapeutics is a publicly-traded clinical-stage biotechnology company working on engineering the next generation vaccines and ADC products using its proprietary platform. The core of Defence Therapeutics platform is the ACCUM® technology, which enables precision delivery of vaccine antigens or ADCs in their intact form to target cells. As a result, increased efficacy and potency can be reached against catastrophic illness such as cancer and infectious diseases.For further information:Sebastien Plouffe, President, CEO and DirectorP: (514) 947-2272Splouffe@defencetherapeutics.comwww.defencetherapeutics.comCautionary Statement Regarding ""Forward-Looking"" InformationThis release includes certain statements that may be deemed ""forward-looking statements"".

Negative None. 04/23/2024 - 03:38 AM STOCKHOLM, April 23, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Medivir AB (NASDAQ: MVIR) (STO: MVIR), a pharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative treatments for cancer in areas of high unmet medical need, announced today an update from a Type C meeting with the FDA, regarding the company's plans for a global phase 2b study and opening of an IND for fostroxacitabine bralpamide (fostrox) in the US. The key outcome of the Type C meeting was that Medivir's preparations for the randomized phase 2b study, comparing fostrox + Lenvima® with Lenvima alone, continues with two key adjustments to the study design. Firstly, as Medivir plans to use the improved capsule formulation of fostrox in the upcoming phase 2b study, an initial dose run-in as the first part of the study will be added. This means including 20-25 additional patients in an arm with a lower dose, in addition to the 30 mg dose used in the currently ongoing phase 1b/2a study. This change will also further strengthen the study design in relation to FDA's Project Optimus. Secondly, Objective Response Rate (ORR) is a validated surrogate endpoint for Overall Survival. In prior HCC studies, ORR has supported accelerated approvals. Therefore, the primary endpoint in the enhanced study design will be changed to ORR with key secondary endpoints, including duration of response, progression free survival and overall survival. The aim of the study, as well as size and study length, remain similar as previously planned and communicated phase 2b design. The FDA guidance has been discussed with Scientific Advisory Council members and regulatory experts. The next step is to finalize the study design and study protocol before submitting an IND in the US to enable study start in the beginning of 2025. - ""With the outcome of the Type C meeting, we are confidently moving forward with the enhanced phase 2b study design, including the adjustments informed by the discussion with FDA. Our current phase 1b/2a study, in a similar patient population, is still ongoing and patients are staying on treatment longer than expected. With the planned phase 2b study, we are excited to move forward with the development of a promising treatment alternative to second line HCC patients,"" says Pia Baumann, CMO at Medivir. - ""We continue to accelerate the development plan for fostrox. Engaging with FDA, to ensure best possible study design for the next phase, is critical for the program and is an important element in partnering discussions. Clarity on study design for phase 2b also allows us to move forward and perform study feasibility with speed as well as finalize CMC preparations,"" says Jens Lindberg, CEO at Medivir. Medivir will provide additional details regarding the updated study design at the Quarterly Results webcast on April 30. For additional information, please contactMagnus Christensen, CFO, Medivir ABTelephone: +46 8 5468 3100E-mail: magnus.christensen@medivir.com About fostrox Fostrox is a type of smart chemotherapy that delivers the cell-killing compound selectively to the tumor while minimizing the harmful effect on normal cells. This is achieved by coupling an active chemotherapy (troxacitabine) with a prodrug tail. The prodrug design enables fostrox to be administered orally and travel directly to the liver where the active substance is released locally in the liver. With this unique mechanism, fostrox has the potential to become the first liver-targeted, orally administered drug that can help patients with various types of liver cancer. A phase 1b monotherapy study with fostrox has been completed and a phase 1b/2a combination study in HCC is ongoing. About primary liver cancer Primary liver cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common cancer that arises in the liver. Although existing therapies for advanced HCC can extend the lives of patients, treatment benefits are insufficient and death rates remain high. There are approximately 660,000 patients diagnosed with primary liver cancer per year globally and current five-year survival is less than 20 percent1). HCC is a heterogeneous disease with diverse etiologies, and lacks defining mutations observed in many other cancers. This has contributed to the lack of success of molecularly targeted agents in HCC. The limited overall benefit, taken together with the poor overall prognosis for patients with intermediate and advanced HCC, results in a large unmet medical need. About Medivir Medivir develops innovative drugs with a focus on cancer where the unmet medical needs are high. The drug candidates are directed toward indication areas where available therapies are limited or missing and there are great opportunities to offer significant improvements to patients. Medivir is focusing on the development of fostroxacitabine bralpamide (fostrox), a smart, targeted chemotherapy designed to selectively treat liver cancer cells and to minimize side effects. Collaborations and partnerships are important parts of Medivir's business model, and the drug development is conducted either by Medivir or in partnership. Medivir's share (ticker: MVIR) is listed on Nasdaq Stockholm's Small Cap list. www.medivir.com.

Positive FDA approval of ANKTIVA as a breakthrough therapy for BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Activation of NK and killer T-cell immune system against tumor cells, leading to complete responses lasting over 47 months. Durable responses with ANKTIVA in combination with BCG exceeding established clinical benchmarks. Expected availability of ANKTIVA in the U.S. by mid-May 2024. Negative None. Oncology Medical Expert The FDA's approval of ANKTIVA introduces a new treatment paradigm for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, a condition with limited options once patients become unresponsive to BCG therapy. The activation of both natural killer (NK) and CD8+ T cells, along with the enhancement of CD4+ T helper cells, is a unique approach that leverages the immune system's own mechanisms. This could lead to a shift in managing NMIBC, potentially reducing the need for more invasive treatments like cystectomy, which comes with higher complications and impact on quality of life. The reported complete response rates and duration suggest that ANKTIVA could offer a significant clinical benefit. It will be important to monitor ongoing and long-term patient outcomes, as well as real-world effectiveness once the therapy is available. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The approval of ANKTIVA positions ImmunityBio in a competitive market for bladder cancer treatments, potentially creating a new standard of care for NMIBC and impacting the company's financial performance. As a first-in-class IL-15 receptor agonist, the immunotherapy may command a premium price due to its novel mechanism and prolonged duration of response. The therapy's profile suggests a favorable reimbursement scenario, which could lead to rapid market uptake and significant revenue growth for ImmunityBio. Investors should monitor adoption rates post-launch and payer coverage decisions, as these will be important indicators of ANKTIVA's commercial success. 04/22/2024 - 09:56 PM Designated an FDA Breakthrough Therapy, the novel immunotherapy ANKTIVA activates the body’s natural killer (NK) and killer T-cell immune system to attack tumor cells Therapy stimulates memory T cells, leading to long duration of complete response exceeding 47 months and ongoing to date, with a median duration of response yet to be determined The percentage of patients with durable responses at 12 and 24 months exceeded the benchmark for magnitude of clinically meaningful results established by experts at the International Bladder Cancer Group (IBCG) ANKTIVA in combination with BCG is approved for maintenance therapy for up to 37 months with tolerable side effects ranging from 0% to 3% Grade 3/4 adverse events ANKTIVA is expected to be available in the U.S. by mid-May 2024 Conference call and webcast are expected to be held April 26 at 11:00 am EDT CULVER CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ImmunityBio, Inc. (NASDAQ: IBRX), an immunotherapy company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved ANKTIVA (N-803, or nogapendekin alfa inbakicept-pmln) plus Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) for the treatment of patients with BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) with carcinoma in situ (CIS), with or without papillary tumors. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240422820209/en/ImmunityBio’s ANKTIVA is approved for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (Photo: Business Wire) “The FDA’s approval of ANKTIVA marks our launch of a next-generation immunotherapy beyond checkpoint inhibitors,” said Patrick Soon-Shiong, M.D., Executive Chairman and Global Chief Scientific and Medical Officer at ImmunityBio. “ANKTIVA not only proliferates and activates the patient’s own NK cells and CD8+ killer T cells, but also activates CD4+ T helper cells, thus enhancing the proliferation of memory killer T cells. This novel mechanism of action, which mimics the biology of the dendritic cell, begins the evolution of immunotherapy beyond T cells alone. The combination of the proliferation of key cancer-killing immune cells, together with the activation of T cells with memory, results in durable complete responses. The ‘triangle offense’ of tumor cell killing by the body’s immune system with long-term memory is the foundation of our efforts to develop a therapeutic cancer vaccine across multiple tumor types, regardless of the site of origin.” ANKTIVA, a first-in-class IL-15 agonist immunotherapy for NMIBC, received Breakthrough Therapy Designation and approval from the FDA based on the safety and efficacy outcome of complete responses (CR) and duration of complete response (DOR). The 77 evaluable patients in this single-arm, multicenter trial received ANKTIVA with BCG maintenance therapy for up to 37 months. The tumor status was assessed with cystoscopy and urine cytology and will continue for up to five years after each patient began their participation in the trial. The CR rate for the 77 evaluable patients was 62% with the upper end of the confidence interval being 73%. The duration of complete response as of the November 2023 cut-off was more than 47 months and is ongoing to date. These prolonged duration of complete response results beyond 24 months with ANKTIVA and BCG exceed the benchmark for the magnitude of meaningful clinical results suggested by a panel of experts at the IBCG. “We are pleased that treatment with ANKTIVA now exceeds the clinically meaningful benchmarks established by the IBCG in 2016 for durable complete response,” said Roger Buckley, with the IBCG. “We look forward to the global availability of ANKTIVA to potentially reduce the need for cystectomy in many patients worldwide with NMIBC.” The duration of response is ongoing, so the final median duration of response has yet to be determined. Fifty-eight percent (58%) of patients with CR had a DOR ≥ 12 months and 40% had a DOR ≥ 24 months. “The long duration of complete response ranging over 47 months is a game changer for NMIBC patients and provides further clinical evidence of ANKTIVA’s effectiveness for patients who historically have faced high rates of recurrence and significantly diminished quality of life due to radical surgeries,” said Karim Chamie, M.D., Associate Professor of Urology at UCLA and principal investigator for the QUILT 3.032 study. “With this approval, ANKTIVA could represent a new standard of care for patients with NMIBC and has the potential to change the way we treat bladder cancer.” ANKTIVA is expected to be available in the U.S. by mid-May 2024. New Hope for Patients Bladder cancer is the 10th most commonly-diagnosed cancer globally,1 and in the U.S., the American Cancer Society estimates there will be 83,190 new cases and 16,840 deaths from bladder cancer in 2024.2 At the time of diagnosis, about 80% of cases are non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), wherein the cancer is found only on the inner layer of the bladder wall.3 The standard therapy for NMIBC is intravesical instillation (delivery to the bladder via a catheter) of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG).4,5 BCG is a benign bacteria that induces an immune response in the bladder in proximity to the cancer cells, leading to clearance of the cancer in many patients. In ~30-40% of patients, however, BCG will fail, and in ~50% that initially respond, cancer will recur.6 ""A new immunotherapy that builds upon our knowledge and experience with BCG as an immune stimulant is exciting to see,” said Ashish Kamat, M.D., MBBS, an Endowed Professor of Urologic Oncology and Cancer Research at University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. “While patients have had limited options in the past after failure of BCG, nogapendekin alfa inbakicept-pmln, with its reported safety and efficacy, now offers them yet another choice in their quest to avoid a radical cystectomy. This is a big win for NMIBC patients everywhere.” With the approval of ANKTIVA in combination with BCG, NMIBC patients who would otherwise face highly invasive surgery with life-long consequences have an important new therapeutic option with a long-term durable complete response. “ANKTIVA enhances natural killer cell recruitment as well as T cell stimulation. By doing this and stimulating the innate immune memory response, we get an improved ability to kill tumor cells,” said Sam S. Chang, M.D., Professor of Urology and Chief Surgical Officer of the Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center, and a principal investigator for the QUILT 3.032 study. “It’s a potent and exciting combination.” “NMIBC has a high rate of recurrence that sometimes results in major surgery to remove the bladder to prevent further disease progression,” said Andrea Maddox-Smith, CEO of the Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network (BCAN). “The addition of ANKTIVA to BCG gives NMIBC patients and their physicians a much-needed, new option to effectively treat the disease and offers an important non-surgical alternative to a cystectomy.” ANKTIVA was well-tolerated with adverse events consistent with that of BCG alone. Studies of ANKTIVA in BCG-unresponsive and BCG-naive patients are ongoing. Reports of 82 subjects of high risk CIS NMIBC were reported in NEJM Evidence and previously presented. The co-authors of an expert commentary on the published findings for ANKTIVA plus BCG in European Urology—Drs. Peter Black, Jonathan Suderman, and Marie-Pier St-Laurent—from the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, stated, “This appears to be a major advance in disease control in this patient population, especially when the low rate of serious adverse events is considered.” They further stated, “One could make the argument that NAI [ANKTIVA] should now become the standard of care given its more rigorous clinical trial data.” Further updates on the ongoing analysis of QUILT-3.032 (NCT03022825) will be presented by Dr. Soon-Shiong at the upcoming American Urological Association’s annual conference on May 3, 2024. “Today’s approval of ANKTIVA for patients with NMIBC marks an important milestone in our quest to develop cancer vaccines, and preventative vaccines for patients with genetic predisposition to developing cancer such as in Lynch syndrome,” said Soon-Shiong. “We believe that by orchestrating the innate and adaptive immune system and driving long-term complete remission, ANKTIVA has the potential to play a key role as the immunotherapy beyond checkpoints in multiple tumor types in the years to come.” ANKTIVA has been studied in more than 700 patients in multiple Phase 1 and 2 trials in both liquid and solid tumors. In addition to trials in NMIBC, it is currently being studied in trials for non-small-cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, glioblastoma, solid tumors, and HIV. Future studies are planned for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and acute myeloid leukemia. How ANKTIVA (N-803) Works The cytokine interleukin-15 (IL-15) plays a crucial role in the immune system by affecting the development, maintenance, and function of key immune cells—NK and CD8+ killer T cells—that are involved in killing cancer cells. ANKTIVA is a novel IL-15 superagonist complex consisting of an IL-15 mutant (IL-15N72D) fused with an IL-15 receptor alpha, which binds with high affinity to IL-15 receptors on NK, CD4, and CD8 T cells. This mimics the natural biological properties of dendritic cells, and drives the generation of memory killer T cells that have specifically been trained to recognize the cancer cells, resulting in activation and proliferation of these killing cells with durable complete response. ANKTIVA has improved pharmacokinetic properties, longer persistence in lymphoid tissues, and enhanced anti-tumor activity compared to native, non-complexed IL-15 in vivo. Selected Safety Information for ANKTIVA (N-803) The most common (≥15%) adverse reactions, including laboratory test abnormalities, are increased creatinine, dysuria, hematuria, urinary frequency, micturition urgency, urinary tract infection, increased potassium, musculoskeletal pain, chills, and pyrexia. Patient Assistance Program ImmunityBio is committed to helping patients access ANKTIVA and will be offering services to overcome access barriers. ImmunityBio’s Patient Assistance Program will be operational in mid May. This program is designed to help those in need, ensuring access to ImmunityBio’s innovative treatment. More information for patients and healthcare professionals will be available on Anktiva.com.

CEO emphasized focus on customer service and cost control. Historic net profitability in the first quarter, breaking a trend of net losses. Booking curves remain solid, with a focus on profitability in capacity allocation. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported net income of $33 million for Volaris in Q1 2024 is a robust indicator of the company's profitability, particularly given the historical context of seasonal losses in previous first quarters. The earnings per ADS of $0.29 reflect the positive earnings impact on a per-share basis, providing a clear metric for shareholder value. A discerning view of the total operating revenues, which saw a 5.1% year-over-year increase to $768 million, suggests the company is experiencing steady top-line growth.In terms of efficiency, the relatively flat CASM despite reduced ASMs indicates a careful management of expenses relative to capacity. The airline's focus on cost control is further demonstrated by an 11% increase in CASM ex-fuel, which nonetheless did not hinder profitability. The reduction in the average economic fuel cost by 13% to $3.01 per gallon is particularly noteworthy amid fluctuating fuel prices. Additionally, the EBITDAR margin increase to 30.6% signifies a solid operational performance.From a liquidity standpoint, the reserves of $768 million, equating to 23% of the last twelve months' total operating revenue, combined with a reduced net debt-to-LTM EBITDAR2 ratio, present a healthier balance sheet. This financial stability is a reassuring sign for investors, suggesting an enhanced ability to withstand market volatility. Market Research Analyst The increase in TRASM by 21% to $9.34 cents is a significant metric, as it indicates Volaris is generating more revenue for each seat mile available – a key performance indicator in the airline industry. This, along with a substantial 91% increase in EBITDAR, underscores the airline's success in not only effectively managing costs but also maximizing revenue, which suggests a competitive advantage in the ultra-low-cost carrier market.Furthermore, the company's achievement of net profitability in a traditionally weak quarter is a sign of strategic capacity allocation and pricing power. With booking curves remaining solid, there is an implication of forward demand stability, which is pivotal for future revenue projections and, consequently, stock valuation. This positive outlook is tempered by the CEO's caution, indicative of ongoing industry challenges such as economic fluctuations and competitive pressures. Investment Analyst Historically, Volaris' first-quarter profitability has been a challenge, making the reported net income for Q1 2024 a notable turnaround. For investors, this change implies operational improvements and renewed managerial focus on cost-efficiency and revenue optimization. The data suggests a potential shift in investor sentiment, which could be bolstered by the company's emphasis on shareholder value. Yet, it is essential to consider the broader economic conditions and competitive environment to maintain a balanced investment perspective.Regarding future strategy, the cautious optimism expressed by the CEO combined with the reported solid booking curves may indicate a stable growth trajectory. As a result, investors might expect sustained performance pending any unpredictable macroeconomic changes that could affect the airline industry at large. However, it is prudent to monitor how Volaris navigates expected industry challenges. 04/22/2024 - 09:22 PM MEXICO CITY, April 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Controladora Vuela Compañía de Aviación, S.A.B. de C.V.

Over the last six months, our primary focus has been directing operations to enhance our customer service and continuing our emphasis on obsessive cost control. Despite the ongoing industry challenges, we continue to execute well and remain focused on delivering shareholder value. The company produced strong results that exceeded expectations. We generated a remarkable increase in TRASM and ancillaries while costs remained controlled. Moreover, Volaris achieved net profitability in the first quarter, posting a net income of $33 million dollars. This marks a significant achievement, as historically, due to seasonality, our first quarters have resulted in net losses; the last time we recorded a net profit in the first quarter was in 2019.

As we execute our strategy, we prioritize profitability when allocating capacity and are cautiously optimistic about achieving results in line with our updated guidance.” 1 The financial information, unless otherwise indicated, is presented in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).2 Includes short-term investments.

First Quarter 2024(All figures are reported in U.S. dollars and compared to 1Q 2023 unless otherwise noted) Total operating revenue in the quarter was $768 million, a 5.1% increase driven by solid demand and an improvement in total revenue per passenger. Booked passengers amounted to 6.9 million, a decrease of 15%. Mexican domestic booked passengers decreased 23%, while international booked passengers increased 11%. Total capacity, in terms of available seat miles (ASMs) decreased 13% to 8.2 billion due to the accelerated Pratt & Whitney engine inspections and the resulting aircraft groundings. The load factor for the quarter reached 87.0%, representing an increase of 1.9 percentage points. TRASM increased 21% to $9.34 cents, and total operating revenue per passenger stood at $111, representing a 24% increase. The average base fare was $54, a 15% increase. The total ancillary revenue per passenger was $57, a 35% increase. Ancillary revenue represented 51% of total operating revenue, an increase of 4.1 percentage points. Total operating expenses were $664 million, representing 86% of total operating revenue. CASM totaled $8.08 cents and remained relatively flat year over year. The average economic fuel cost decreased 13% to $3.01 per gallon. CASM ex-fuel increased 11% to $5.16 cents. This increase was mainly caused by the aircraft-on-ground (AOG) due to Pratt and Whitney's engine preventive accelerated inspections and the effect of a larger proportion of international capacity with higher landing and navigation fees. This pressure was partially offset by the remeasurement of previously booked redelivery accruals, which reflect the lease extensions from 2024 to 2026. Comprehensive financing result represented an expense of $57 million, compared to $65 million in the same period of 2023. For the period, the average exchange rate was Ps.17.00 per U.S. dollar, a 9.1% appreciation. At the end of the first quarter, the exchange rate stood at Ps.16.68 per U.S. dollar. Income tax expense for the quarter was $14 million, compared to an income tax benefit of $25 million registered in the same period of 2023. Net income in the quarter was $33 million, with an earnings per ADS of $0.29 cents. EBITDAR for the quarter was $235 million, an increase of 91%, primarily attributable to higher unit revenues and lower fuel prices, while EBITDAR margin stood at 30.6%, an increase of 14 percentage points. Balance Sheet, Liquidity and Capital Allocation As of March 31, 2024, cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments were $768 million, representing 23% of the last twelve months total operating revenue. Net cash flow provided by operating activities was $245 million. Net cash flow used in investing and financing activities was $97 million and $171 million, respectively. The financial debt amounted to $642 million, while total lease liabilities stood at $3,021 million, resulting in a net debt of $2,8956 million. Net debt-to-LTM EBITDAR6 ratio stood at 3.1x, compared to 3.3x in the previous quarter and 3.8x in the same period of 2023. 2024 Guidance For the second quarter of 2024, the Company expects: 2Q’242Q’23 (1)2Q’24 Guidance ASM growth (YoY)~ -18%+18.1%TRASM$9.1 to $9.2 cents$7.92 centsCASM ex fuel$5.5 to $5.6 cents$4.82 centsEBITDAR margin31% to 33%27.1%Average USD/MXN ratePs.17.30 to 17.50Ps.17.72Average U.S. Gulf Coast jet fuel price$2.60 to $2.702.29(1) For convenience purposes, actual reported figures for 2Q'23 are included.

The company has begun mass production of the 31.5-inch panel this month, accelerating its push into the high-end gaming display market with new concept products. This groundbreaking Gaming OLED panel allows users to freely choose between a high refresh rate (FHD∙480Hz) and a high-resolution mode (UHD∙240Hz) depending on the content. In high refresh rate mode, users can enjoy games where speed and screen changes are particularly important, such as first-person shooter (FPS) or racing genres. Switching to high-resolution mode offers an exceptionally immersive experience watching movies with rich visual effects or high-definition 4K content. By comparison, conventional panels have a fixed resolution even when the refresh rate is changed, limiting their versatility for multiple applications. Refresh rate refers to the number of images displayed on a monitor per second, while resolution represents the number of pixels that a screen can show. The higher the refresh rate, the smoother and sharper the images appear even during fast screen transitions, while a higher resolution enables more precise video and image quality. LG Display's advanced solution is Dynamic Frequency & Resolution (DFR), its own independently developed new technology. With the arrival of DFR, users can choose which to prioritize between refresh rate and resolution by adjusting the image processing speed. IT has been applied for the first time with LG Display's 31.5-inch Gaming OLED panel. The company's Gaming OLED panel is also equipped with other LG Display technologies to enhance its immersive experience. These include META Technology 2.0 based on the company's Micro Lens Array (MLA) innovation, which maximizes the emission of light from organic materials to elevate image quality. Also, Thin Actuator Sound technology, which directly generates sound from the screen without a separate speaker, has been adopted to provide more vivid sound. LG Display plans to supply its new 31.5-inch Gaming OLED panel to global gaming gear brands, starting with LG Electronics. The company is accelerating its expansion into the high-end gaming display market from this year with a full lineup of Gaming OLED panels spanning 27, 31.5, 34, 39, and 45 inches. Unlike LCDs, which require backlighting, the company's Gaming OLED panels are self-emissive, enabling each pixel to produce perfect blacks and lifelike image quality. With an ultra-high refresh rate (480Hz), they also have the fastest response time (0.03ms) of any panel on the market. Moreover, Gaming OLEDs have less potential to cause eye fatigue than LCD screens even during long gaming sessions, as they emit half the amount of blue light and produce no headache-associated flicker. ""We will create new customer value with OLED's differentiated technologies - such as by offering perfect blacks, fast response times, and ultra-high refresh rates - and strengthen our leadership in the high-end gaming display market,"" said Won-seok Kang, Vice President and Head of the Large Display Product Planning Division at LG Display. About LG Display LG Display Co., Ltd. [NYSE: LPL, KRX: 034220] is the world's leading innovator of display technologies, including thin-film transistor liquid crystal and OLED displays. The company manufactures display panels in a broad range of sizes and specifications primarily for use in TVs, notebook computers, desktop monitors, automobiles, and various other applications, including tablets and mobile devices.

Revenues from improvements to concession assets 1 Revenues from improvements to concession assets (IFRIC-12) decreased by Ps. 1.9 million, or 0.1%, compared to 1Q23. The change was composed of : Improvements to concession assets at the Company’s Mexican airports, which decreased by Ps. 40.1 million, or 2.2%, in accordance with investments under the Master Development Program for the 2020-2024 period.Improvements to concession assets at the Company’s Jamaican airports, which increased Ps. 38.2 million, or 213.4%. _____________________________1 Revenues from improvements to concession assets are recognized in accordance with International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee 12 “Service Concession Arrangements” (IFRIC 12). However, this recognition does not have a cash impact or impact on the Company’s operating results. Amounts included as a result of the recognition of IFRIC 12 are related to construction of infrastructure in each quarter to which the Company has committed. This is in accordance with the Company’s Master Development Programs in Mexico and Capital Development Programs in Jamaica. All margins and ratios calculated using “Total Revenues” include revenues from improvements to concession assets (IFRIC 12), and, consequently, such margins and ratios may not be comparable to other ratios and margins, such as EBITDA margin, operating margin or other similar ratios that are calculated based on those results of the Company that do have a cash impact. Total operating costs increased by Ps. 247.1 million, or 5.8%, compared to 1Q23, mainly due to the increase in concession taxes and technical assistance fees, which jointly increased by Ps. 107.3 million, or 12.9%, as well as an increase in the cost of services of Ps. 105.3 million, or 10.9%, and a Ps. 44.9 million, or 7.3%, increase in depreciation and amortization (excluding the cost of improvements to concession assets (IFRIC-12), operating costs increased Ps. 249.0 million, or 10.3%).

The change in the cost of services at our Mexican airports during 1Q24 was mainly due to: Employee costs increased Ps. 60.7 million, or 17.5%, compared to 1Q23, mainly due to the hiring of 317 additional personnel during 2023 and 1Q24, as well as the adjustments in salaries and cost related to changes in Labor Law.Cost of business operated directly by us increased by Ps. 24.5 million or 49.7%, compared to 1Q23, derived from increased operations and income in VIP lounges and convenience stores.Maintenance costs increased by Ps. 12.9 million, or 11.4%, compared to 1Q23, mainly due to the expansion of the terminal and airfield.These increases were offset by a decrease in other operating expenses by Ps. 25.8 million, or 115.2%, compared to 1Q23, mainly due to a combined decrease of Ps. 25.1 million in the allowance for credit losses and travel expenses. Jamaican Airport: Operating costs increased by Ps. 111.2 million, or 16.6%, compared to 1Q23, mainly due to a Ps. 66.0 million, or 19.0%, increase in concession taxes, increase in the cost of improvements to concession assets (IFRIC-12) by Ps.38.2 million, or 213.4%, and the increase in cost of services by Ps. 17.0 million, or 9.8%. Operating income margin went from 48.9% in 1Q23 to 46.9% in 1Q24. Excluding the effects of IFRIC-12, the operating income margin went from 62.7% in 1Q23 to 59.9% in 1Q24. Income from operations decreased by Ps. 92.1 million, or 2.3%, compared to 1Q23. EBITDA margin went from 56.3% in 1Q23 to 54.7% in 1Q24. Excluding the effects of IFRIC-12, EBITDA margin went from 72.3% in 1Q23 to 69.8% in 1Q24. The nominal value of EBITDA decreased by Ps. 47.2 million, or 1.0%, compared to 1Q23. Financial results decreased by Ps. 80.6 million, or 11.9%, from a net expense of Ps. 674.3 million in 1Q23 to a net expense of Ps. 593.7 million in 1Q24. This change was mainly the result of: Foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which went from a loss of Ps. 166.9 million in 1Q23 to an income of Ps. 28.9 million in 1Q24. This generated a foreign exchange gain of Ps. 195.9 million. This was mainly due to the appreciation of the peso. Currency translation effect loss decreased Ps. 141.4 million, compared to 1Q23.Interest expenses increased by Ps. 80.1 million, or 9.9%, compared to 1Q23, mainly due to higher debt as a result of the issuance of long-term debt securities and the drawdown of credit lines.Interest income decreased by Ps. 35.2 million, or 11.6%, compared to 1Q23, mainly due to a decrease in the cash and cash equivalents average balance. In 1Q24, comprehensive income increased by Ps. 14.3 million, or 0.7%, compared to 1Q23. Income before taxes decreased by Ps. 11.5 million, mainly due to the increase in cost of operation by Ps. 247.1 million, offset by a revenue increase of Ps. 155.0 million. Net and comprehensive income increased mainly due to the decrease of the effect of foreign currency translation by Ps. 141.4 million, offset by an increase in cash flow hedges by Ps. 32.4 million. During 1Q24, net income decreased by Ps. 94.5 million, or 3.7%, compared to 1Q23. Income taxes increased by Ps. 60.3 million and the benefit for deferred taxes decreased by Ps. 22.7 million, mainly due to a decrease in the inflation rate, from 1.7% in 1Q23 to 1.4% in 1Q24. Statement of Financial Position Total assets as of March 31, 2024 increased by Ps. 907.3 million compared to March 31, 2023, primarily due to the following items: (i) an increase of Ps. 6,795.5 million in net improvements to concession assets, (ii) a Ps. 890.7 million increase in other current assets, (iii) a Ps. 330.0 million increase in trade accounts receivable, and iv) a Ps. 178.5 million combined increase in net machinery, equipment and leasehold improvements, and advances to suppliers. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of Ps. 7,349.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. Total liabilities as of March 31, 2024, decreased by Ps. 223.6 million compared to March 31, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to the following items: (i) issuance of Ps. 602.0 million (net) in long-term debt securities, (ii) a decrease of Ps. 392.1 million in income taxes payable, and (iii) Ps. 312.7 million in accounts payable. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of (i) Ps. 667.0 million in bank loans, (ii) Ps. 502.5 in concession taxes payable, among others. Adoption of accounting criteria On November 13, 2023, a Decree was published that modifies the Mexican Federal Duties Law, establishing that as of January 1, 2024, the concession fee that concession holders must pay for the use of federal airports, was increased from 5% to 9% of their total revenues derived from such use concessioned in Mexico. Following the Tariff Regulation, payments in favor of the government over those included in the last tariff review will be added to the Reference Value of the next review of the Maximum Tariff. Therefore, the amount of the 4% excess over aeronautical revenues paid to the government during fiscal year 2024 will be recognized as an intangible asset under IAS 38, beginning its amortization from January 2025 and until the end of the concession period. The amount recognized as intangible assets during 1Q24 amounts to Ps. 175.5 million, which corresponds to 4.0% of the aeronautical revenues of our airports in Mexico.

As a part of the adoption of IFRS, the effects of inflation on common stock recognized under Mexican Financial Reporting Standards (MFRS) through December 31, 2007, were reclassified as retained earnings because accumulated inflation recognized under MFRS is not considered hyperinflationary according to IFRS. For Mexican legal and tax purposes, Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacífico, S.A.B. de C.V., as an individual entity, will continue preparing separate financial information under MFRS. Therefore, for any transaction between the Company and its shareholders related to stockholders’ equity, the Company must take into consideration the accounting balances prepared under MFRS as an individual entity and determine the tax impact under tax laws applicable in Mexico, which requires the use of MFRS. For purposes of reporting to stock exchanges, the consolidated financial statements will continue to be prepared following IFRS, as issued by the IASB.

Positive Cohen & Steers raised $70 million in gross proceeds through the ATM Program. 1,007,057 shares were sold at an average price of $69.60 per share. Expected net proceeds after expenses are approximately $68.4 million. The funds will be used for general corporate purposes, including seeding track record strategies and investment vehicles. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent move by Cohen & Steers to raise capital through an at-the-market equity offering indicates a strategic decision to bolster its financial position. By securing approximately $68.4 million in net proceeds, the firm enhances its liquidity, which can be pivotal in funding ongoing operations or investing in growth initiatives. It's notable that the transaction was executed at an average price of $69.60, which may reflect current market valuation perceptions. Investors should consider how the injection of capital could potentially improve the company's financial flexibility, particularly for seeding new investment vehicles, which may drive future revenue growth. However, this benefit needs to be weighed against the dilutive effect on existing shareholders, as the increase in outstanding shares could lead to potential earnings per share dilution. Market Research Analyst Cohen & Steers' decision to terminate the ATM Program post-transaction is a calculated one, likely reflecting the company's assessment that it has raised the necessary funds for the near term. Investors should take note of the company's intended use of proceeds for 'seeding track record strategies and investment vehicles,' as it underscores a commitment to expand its product offerings. The success of these strategies and the market's reception to new investment products will be important to monitor, as they could enhance the firm's competitive position and attract additional assets under management. However, the effectiveness of these investments and their impact on the company's market share will only become apparent with time. Investment Strategist The termination of the ATM Program by Cohen & Steers following this equity offering is an indicator of the company's confidence in its current capital structure. As an investor, it's important to understand the implications of such a capital raise. On one hand, the additional funds can be seen as positive, providing the company with the ability to seed new strategies that may attract more assets and generate additional fee income. On the other hand, investors should remain vigilant about the company's future capital allocation decisions and how they might affect returns. The strategic deployment of these funds into successful strategies is key for long-term shareholder value creation. 04/22/2024 - 06:33 PM NEW YORK, April 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Cohen & Steers, Inc.

Financial Analyst Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste's (ASUR) first quarter results for 2024 reveal a robust year-over-year revenue increase of 15.3%, attributed to growth in both passenger traffic and commercial revenue per passenger. The company displayed resilience particularly in its Puerto Rico operations, where a significant 12.2% growth in passenger traffic was noted. Despite a decrease in Colombian domestic traffic, international numbers there soared, which could indicate a strategic pivot in ASUR's operations to capitalize on global travel trends.From an investment perspective, the substantial 22.5% surge in net income is noteworthy. Earnings per share followed suit, which typically signifies a company's profitability and efficiency gains. Additionally, the reported negative Net Debt to EBITDA LTM ratio conveys a strong balance sheet position. Investors might see this as a hedge against market volatility and a foundation for sustainable growth.However, the slight dip in Adjusted EBITDA margin, although marginal, could suggest a need to monitor cost structures and pricing strategies moving forward, especially considering their capital expenditures rose by 27.7%. The company's strategic investments in infrastructure and services must be weighed against these margins to evaluate the long-term return on investment. Market Research Analyst Analyzing ASUR's financials indicates a healthy recovery trajectory in the aviation sector. The diversified geographical portfolio seems to be mitigating risks and aiding growth, which is pivotal for investor confidence. The impressive growth in commercial revenues per passenger in Colombia, which saw an 18.7% increase, demonstrates ASUR's ability to monetize its services effectively amidst varying market conditions.From a market trend perspective, the uptick in international traffic across ASUR's network mirrors global economic reopening and revival of travel demand post-pandemic. Long-term investors might find ASUR's performance indicative of the sector's resilience and potential for rebound, especially considering the company's strategic positioning in emerging markets like Colombia and established markets like Mexico and Puerto Rico. 04/22/2024 - 04:30 PM Total passenger traffic in 1Q24 increased 3.9% YoY MEXICO CITY, April 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste, S.A.B. de C.V.

In Mexico and Puerto Rico, ASUR is required by IFRIC 12 to include in its income statement an income line, ""Construction Revenues,"" reflecting the revenue from construction of, or improvements to concessioned assets made during the relevant period. The same amount is recognized under the expense line ""Construction Costs"" because ASUR hires third parties to provide construction services. Because equal amounts of Construction Revenues and Construction Costs have been included in ASUR's income statement as a result of the application of IFRIC 12, the amount of Construction Revenues does not have an impact on EBITDA, but it does have an impact on EBITDA Margin. In Colombia, ""Construction Revenues"" include the recognition of the revenue to which the concessionaire is entitled for carrying out the infrastructure works in the development of the concession, while ""Construction Costs"" represents the actual costs incurred in the execution of such additions or improvements to the concessioned assets. Majority Net Income reflects ASUR's equity interests in each of its subsidiaries and therefore excludes the 40% interest in Aerostar that is owned by other shareholders. Other than Aerostar, ASUR owns (directly or indirectly) 100% of its subsidiaries. EBITDA means net income before provision for taxes, deferred taxes, profit sharing, non-ordinary items, participation in the results of associates, comprehensive financing cost, and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income, as an indicator of our operating performance, as an alternative to cash flow or as an indicator of liquidity. Our management believes that EBITDA provides a useful measure that is widely used by investors and analysts to evaluate our performance and compare it with other companies. EBITDA is not defined under U.S. GAAP or IFRS and may be calculated differently by different companies. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing EBITDA by total revenues excluding construction services revenues for Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Colombia and excludes the effect of IFRIC 12 with respect to the construction of, or improvements to concessioned assets. ASUR is required by IFRIC 12 to include in its income statement an income line reflecting the revenue from construction of, or improvements to concessioned assets made during the relevant period. The same amount is recognized under the expense line ""Construction Costs"" because ASUR hires third parties to provide construction services. In Mexico and Puerto Rico, because equal amounts of Construction Revenues and Construction Costs have been included in ASUR's income statement as a result of the application of IFRIC 12, the amount of Construction Revenues does not have an impact on EBITDA, but it does have an impact on EBITDA Margin, as the increase in revenues that relates to Construction Revenues does not result in a corresponding increase in EBITDA. In Colombia, construction revenues do have an impact on EBITDA, as construction revenues include a reasonable margin over the actual cost of construction. Like EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA Margin should not be considered as an indicator of our operating performance, as an alternative to cash flow or as an indicator of liquidity and is not defined under U.S. GAAP or IFRS and may be calculated differently by different companies.

Energy Sector Analyst The collaboration between NuBlu Energy and CNX Resources introduces ZeroHP CNG and Clean mLNG technologies, which aim to revolutionize the production of CNG and LNG by utilizing Geobaric Energy. This approach could materially decrease capital and operational costs while diminishing the environmental impact associated with these fuels. From an investor's perspective, this could signify a potential increase in profitability for both companies due to reduced production expenses and the attraction of environmentally conscious investors. Moreover, the ability to deploy these technologies in remote locations without existing pipeline infrastructure could open up new markets and revenue streams. Environmental Impact Analyst In terms of environmental implications, the emission reductions promised by ZeroHP CNG—up to a 50% decrease in carbon intensity compared to conventional CNG—could be a considerable step towards more sustainable energy practices. This may resonate positively with stakeholders focused on environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria, potentially increasing CNX's attractiveness to a growing segment of socially responsible investors. The shift towards localized production of CNG also aligns with broader decarbonization goals and could reduce the dependency on foreign-sourced liquid fuels, contributing to energy independence and security. Market Dynamics Specialist In the context of market dynamics, the potential displacement of Middle Eastern petroleum products as well as transatlantic and transpacific imports is monumental. Should these technologies be adopted at scale, we could see a significant reshaping of global energy supply chains. This could have far-reaching consequences for international trade balances, geopolitical relationships and even the price stability of alternative energy sources. For investors, the anticipation of such changes could drive strategic portfolio adjustments, with a focus on companies positioned to capitalize on these shifts in the energy landscape. 04/22/2024 - 04:30 PM Partnership combines engineering innovation, technology, and natural gas assets to revolutionize the CNG and micro-scale LNG industries CNX achieves first-of-its-kind ZeroHP CNG™ production at scale on pad in Southwestern Pennsylvania, catalyzing Company entry into downstream energy markets with leading, innovative technology solutionsZero Horsepower (ZeroHP) CNG creates decentralized CNG production market to better meet growing demand for clean, affordable energyLow Horsepower, Clean mLNG™ advances cost-effective and lower emissions production of small-scale LNGCENTER, Texas and PITTSBURGH, April 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- NuBlu Energy (NuBlu), a leading Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) company specializing in energy transition solutions and CNX Resources Corp. (NYSE: CNX), Appalachia's premier ultra-low carbon intensive natural gas technology and development firm, jointly unveiled two solutions today, ZeroHP CNG and Clean mLNG, that represent step change advancements in the scale and efficiency at which compressed natural gas (CNG) and micro-scale liquefied natural gas (LNG) can be produced, all while materially lowering the cost and carbon footprint of both products. ZeroHP CNG is an innovative production technology that redefines CNG by eliminating the need for mechanical compressors. Instead of leveraging conventional mechanical compression, ZeroHP CNG exploits high gas pressures found naturally, within deep shale formations. This previously untapped renewable energy source, referred to as ""Geobaric Energy™,"" is being harnessed using CNX's patent pending technology in a first-of-its-kind application at a CNX ZeroHP CNG facility in Southwestern Pennsylvania. ZeroHP CNG represents a paradigm shift in compressed natural gas production, offering unparalleled advantages over traditional methods by drastically reducing: Capital costs,Operating costs,Environmental footprint,Maintenance requirements,Trailer fill time (capable of filling the largest virtual pipeline trailers in approximately one hour without the need for refrigeration).ZeroHP CNG opens new possibilities for decentralized clean CNG production, positioning it as an ideal solution for meeting the growing demand for clean, affordable energy. The unique design allows for rapid deployment without the requirement of utility power, offering remote locations, stranded assets, or exploratory wells access to market without the need for pipeline infrastructure. Additionally, the team is proud to introduce the Clean mLNG system, a micro-scale LNG liquefaction solution that leverages both Geobaric Energy and NuBlu's proven methane-only refrigeration technology, mLNG. Leveraging cutting-edge processes and patent-pending technologies, Clean mLNG achieves cost savings and environmental benefits exceeding those of traditional mega-scale LNG processes. Doing so marks a significant milestone in the industry by enabling the cost-effective production of small-scale LNG without compromising performance, and by providing a path to zero Scopes 1 and 2 upstream emissions. ""We are thrilled to introduce these groundbreaking technologies in collaboration with CNX Resources,"" said Rob Harman, NuBlu Energy President. ""We are not just pushing the boundaries of what's possible in energy production; we are reshaping the landscape of the industry, paving the way for cleaner, more efficient solutions."" By leveraging advanced processes and proprietary technologies, NuBlu and CNX aim to drive a transition in the CNG and LNG space toward a more sustainable future. Products manufactured from these systems may displace conventional, foreign-sourced liquid fuels with a local, cleaner-burning, more cost-effective option. This disruptive solution has the market potential to displace traditional diesel, kerosene, and propane uses. Additionally, recent obstructions to interstate natural gas infrastructure projects have created a market opportunity for regional mobile energy solutions. CNG is capable of providing the energy equivalent to diesel at less than half the current price while reducing well-to-wheel carbon emissions by 35% and tailpipe SOx and NOx by approximately 40% and 90%, respectively. ZeroHP CNG also provides a 50% reduction in carbon intensity compared to conventional CNG. The total estimated addressable market for these technologies in the United States has the potential to displace all the petroleum products imported from the Middle East. Specifically, it could displace 56% of transatlantic and transpacific petroleum imports which would reduce global emissions by 80 million metric tonnes CO2e on an annual basis. ""Converting Appalachian-produced natural gas to CNG and LNG unlocks significant cost savings and a decentralized decarbonization solution that can transform regional sectors including transportation, manufacturing, aviation, heating and power generation, among others,"" said Ravi Srivastava, CNX President of New Technologies. ""CNX's New Tech segment is committed to delivering cutting-edge technologies that vertically and horizontally expand the use of lower cost and lower emissions products, which catalyze new clean energy industries and revitalize the Appalachian region. We're excited about what's in store for us, NuBlu, and the entire region with these innovative ZeroHP CNG and Clean mLNG solutions."" Officially launched in 2021, CNX New Technologies business unit develops proprietary technology for vertical and horizontal business growth that are rooted in the company's extensive legacy asset base, intellectual assets, and innovative tradition. The group is focused on waste methane capture and abatement, as well as forging strategic partnerships for the use of low carbon intensity feedstocks and the creation of derivative products in transportation fuels, manufacturing processes, and other markets.

Financial Analyst Cathay General Bancorp's Q1 report indicates a contraction in net income and a drop in earnings per share. This signifies a decremental trend, suggesting headwinds or operational challenges. The dip in earnings is partly attributed to a mark-to-market loss and increased FDIC assessments, which could be one-off items or indicative of evolving market conditions. Notably, a decline in the efficiency ratio, albeit slight, suggests improved cost management. However, the reduced net interest margin points to pressure on profitability, likely from rising deposit costs. Investors should assess the sustainability of deposit growth alongside loan portfolio quality, given the uptick in non-accrual loans. The company remains well-capitalized, an essential buffer against potential loan losses. Market Research Analyst The banking sector is highly sensitive to interest rate changes and Cathay General Bancorp's experience is consistent with current economic trends. Rising interest rates have increased the cost of funds, impacting net interest margins—a critical metric for banks. Despite the increase in total deposits, the reduction in net interest income underscores the challenges of asset-liability management in a volatile rate environment. Investors should monitor the Federal Reserve's policy trajectory as it will significantly influence the bank's interest rate spread and future profitability. 04/22/2024 - 04:30 PM LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cathay General Bancorp (the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) (Nasdaq: CATY), the holding company for Cathay Bank, today announced its unaudited financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.

Diluted earnings per share decreased to $0.98 for the first quarter of 2024 compared to $1.13 for the fourth quarter of 2023 due in part to changes in equity securities valuations. “For the first quarter of 2024, our total deposits increased by $520.8 million, or 10.8% annualized, to $19.85 billion,” commented Chang M. Liu, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. INCOME STATEMENT REVIEW FIRST QUARTER 2024 COMPARED TO THE FOURTH QUARTER 2023 Net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, was $71.4 million, a decrease of $11.1 million, or 13.5%, compared to net income of $82.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2024 was $0.98 per share compared to $1.13 per share for the fourth quarter of 2023. The first quarter net income included a $9.0 million, or $0.09 per diluted share mark-to-market loss from equity securities held by the Company and a $2.9 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, accrual for an increase in the FDIC special assessment. Return on average stockholders’ equity was 10.40% and return on average assets was 1.23% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to a return on average stockholders’ equity of 12.21% and a return on average assets of 1.40% in the fourth quarter of 2023. Net interest income before provision for credit losses Net interest income before provision for credit losses decreased $13.5 million, or 7.4%, to $168.6 million during the first quarter of 2024, compared to $182.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. The decrease was due primarily to an increase in deposit interest expense and a decrease in interest income from loans and securities. The net interest margin was 3.05% for the first quarter of 2024 compared to 3.27% for the fourth quarter of 2023. For the first quarter of 2024, the yield on average interest-earning assets was 6.01%, the cost of funds on average interest-bearing liabilities was 3.87%, and the cost of interest-bearing deposits was 3.78%. In comparison, for the fourth quarter of 2023, the yield on average interest-earning assets was 5.99%, the cost of funds on average interest-bearing liabilities was 3.59%, and the cost of interest-bearing deposits was 3.50%. The increase in the costs of average interest-bearing liabilities was mainly a result of higher interest rates on interest bearing deposits. The net interest spread, defined as the difference between the yield on average interest-earning assets and the cost of funds on average interest-bearing liabilities, was 2.14% for the first quarter of 2024, compared to 2.40% for the fourth quarter of 2023. Provision for credit losses The Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared with $1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. As of March 31, 2024, the allowance for credit losses, comprised of the reserve for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded loan commitments, increased $760 thousand to $164.4 million, or 0.85% of gross loans, compared to $163.6 million, or 0.84% of gross loans, as of December 31, 2023.

The decrease was primarily due to an $18.0 million decrease in unrealized gains on equity securities offset, in part, by a $1.4 million recovery from the sale of a previously written-off security, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Non-interest expense Non-interest expense decreased $17.3 million, or 15.7%, to $93.2 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $110.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. The decrease in non-interest expense in the first quarter of 2024 was primarily due to a decrease of $11.7 million in amortization expense of investments in low-income housing and alternative energy partnerships, a decrease of $8.3 million in FDIC and state assessments and a decrease of $1.3 million in professional services expenses offset, in part, by an increase of $3.5 million in salaries and employee benefits when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. The efficiency ratio, defined as non-interest expense divided by the sum of net interest income before provision for loan losses plus non-interest income, was 53.22% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to 53.84% for the fourth quarter of 2023.

(NYSE American: AZTR), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative therapies for precision dermatology, today announced preclinical data from the Company’s platform and pipeline. The data will be presented on Friday, May 10, 2024, in two oral sessions entitled “Engineered Staphylococcus Epidermidis as a Protein Delivery System for Treating Skin Diseases” and “Staphylococcus epidermidis Strain Expressing LEKTI-D6 (ATR12-351) for Netherton Syndrome.” “We are thrilled to announce new preclinical data for our precision dermatology platform that demonstrate proof-of-concept data supporting the use of genetically engineered skin commensals to deliver proteins to the skin,” said Travis Whitfill, Azitra’s co-founder and COO. “These data show the robust preclinical activity of ATR-12 in Netherton syndrome models and further supports the rationale behind our Phase 1b clinical trial in Netherton syndrome patients.” ATR-12 is an engineered strain of S. epidermidis that expresses a fragment of human lympho-epithelial Kazal-type-related inhibitor (LEKTI) protein, which is missing in patients with Netherton syndrome, a chronic and sometimes fatal disease of the skin estimated to affect approximately one to nine in every 100,000. ATR-12 has been engineered to deliver missing LEKTI protein when applied topically to Netherton syndrome patients. Azitra has an open IND for a Phase 1b clinical trial in adult patients (NCT06137157). The data in the abstracts released online today show that topical application of ATR-12 in preclinical models reduced produced reduced IL-36γ by 93% compared to skin extracts induced to overexpress IL-36γ. Additionally, topical application of ATR-12 significantly reduced protease activity in skin samples compared to a Netherton syndrome model skin (p<0.01). Finally, ATR-12 produced higher amounts of LEKTI compared to topical application of LEKTI protein alone (6.0 µg vs. 2.3 µg, respectively, p<0.01) after 24 hours and resulted in deeper skin penetration of LEKTI. About Azitra, Inc.

We show that circular single strand DNA templates can be efficiently delivered to HSPCs and enable unprecedented efficiency of gene insertion without compromising the viability, fitness and differentiation capacity of edited cells” commented Julien Valton, Ph.D., Vice President of Gene Therapy at Cellectis. “We also illustrate a novel TALEN® mediated-DNA template insertion approach that rewires the natural ability of myeloid cells to cross the blood brain barrier to efficiently vectorize a genetically encoded-therapeutic protein to the brain. This approach is, by essence, versatile and could be used to vectorize an array of therapeutic proteins to the brain and potentially address multiple neurological disorders.” Poster presentation: Intron Editing of HSPC Enables Lineage-Specific Expression of Therapeutics Gene therapy using edited hematopoietic and progenitor stem cells (HSPCs) has the potential to provide a lifelong supply of genetically encoded therapeutics. Today, most therapies are impacted with the difficulty to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB is a continuous endothelial membrane that, along with pericytes and other components of the neurovascular unit, limits the entry of toxins, pathogens, protein and small molecules to the brain. Cellectis has developed a TALEN® mediated promoter-less intron editing technology that enables the expression of a therapeutic transgene exclusively by monocyte derived from edited HSPCs. The edited cells containing genetically encoded therapeutic proteins have the capacity to cross the blood-brain barrier and secrete the corresponding therapeutic within the brain. This novel editing approach is an important addition to the HSPC gene editing toolbox that might unlock new strategies for the treatment of metabolic and neurological diseases. Research data showed that: Intron editing can be performed within B-cell, T-cell, Monocyte-specific endogenous genes (CD20, CD4 and CD11b, respectively)Intron editing allows expression of transgenes in a lineage-specific manner without markedly impacting the expression of the endogenous gene targetedEditing of CD11b intron using a therapeutic transgene encoding IDUA (the enzyme missing in Type-1 Mucopolysaccharidosis patients) enables to restrict the expression of IDUA to the myeloid lineage.Edited HSPCs efficiently engraft in the bone-marrow of immunodeficient mice and differentiate into edited myeloid cells that can cross the BBB and populate the brain.The intron editing strategy described in this work is versatile and could be potentially used to vectorize multiple genetically encoded-therapeutic proteins to the brain and thus address multiple metabolic and neurological disorders.

Financial Analyst Vertex Inc.'s preliminary financial results indicate a robust increase in revenue year-over-year, suggesting a strong market position and effective business strategy going forward. A 17 to 19 rise in revenues is significant, showcasing that the demand for their indirect tax solutions remains high. Furthermore, the increase in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) by approximately 17 to 18 exemplifies a reliable revenue stream, which is highly valued by investors for its predictability. The expected net income reversal from a loss to a profit is further evidence of improving operational efficiency or cost management, which is paramount for sustaining growth. However, it's worth noting that part of the Adjusted EBITDA outperformance is due to delayed expenses and higher capitalized R&D, which may affect future quarters. Investors will need to monitor how these deferred costs impact the long-term financial health of the company. Market Research Analyst The net revenue retention rate between 111 to 113 and a gross revenue retention between 94 to 96 are particularly telling metrics for Vertex's customer base loyalty and product stickiness. This slight increase in net retention could reflect successful up-sell and cross-sell strategies, or lower churn rates. The market for tax compliance software is typically less volatile than other sectors and these numbers could be an indicator of Vertex's competitive advantage in this space. The provided figures could imply strong customer satisfaction and an effective response to competitive pressures. Going forward, this retention rate will be key in assessing the company's growth trajectory and market share stability. Tech Industry Analyst The mention of a higher percentage of capitalized R&D costs warrants a closer look. Capitalization of R&D can indicate that Vertex is investing in developing new products or significantly improving existing ones, which can lead to future revenue streams. Given the tech industry's rapid evolution, such investments are important for maintaining a competitive edge. However, it challenges investors to discern whether these capitalizations will translate into marketable products that will drive future growth. For a retail investor, understanding the balance between expensed R&D for immediate innovation against capitalized R&D for future growth potential is essential when assessing the company's strategic direction and potential for long-term success. 04/22/2024 - 04:17 PM KING OF PRUSSIA, Pa., April 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vertex, Inc. (NASDAQ:VERX), a leading global technology provider of indirect tax solutions, today announced preliminary financial results for the period ended March 31, 2024. “Vertex’s first quarter financial results were strong across our business,” noted David DeStefano, President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairperson of the Board. “We look forward to providing investors with full details when we announce our full first quarter financial results in early May.” Revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are expected to be between $155.5 million and $157.5 million, compared to $132.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, representing an increase of approximately 17% to 19%. Annual Recurring Revenue at March 31, 2024 is expected to be between $523.5 million to $525.5 million, compared to $446.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, representing an increase of approximately 17% to 18%. Net revenue retention at March 31, 2024 is expected to be between 111% and 113%, as compared to 110% at March 31, 2023.

Forward Looking Statements Any statements made in this press release that are not statements of historical fact, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements and should be evaluated as such. Forward-looking statements include, among other statements, information concerning our preliminary results of operations. Forward-looking statements are based on Vertex management’s beliefs, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, them. Because such statements are based on expectations as to future financial and operating results and are not statements of fact, actual results may differ materially from those projected. Factors which may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to: our ability to attract new customers on a cost-effective basis and the extent to which existing customers renew and upgrade their subscriptions; our ability to sustain and expand revenues, maintain profitability, and to effectively manage our anticipated growth; our ability to identify acquisition targets and to successfully integrate and operate acquired businesses; our ability to maintain and expand our strategic relationships with third parties; the potential effects on our business from the existence of a global endemic or pandemic; and the other factors described under the heading “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”), as may be subsequently updated by our other SEC filings. Copies of such filings may be obtained from the Company or the SEC. Our unaudited financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2024 presented above are preliminary, based upon our good faith estimates and subject to completion of our financial closing procedures. This summary is not a comprehensive statement of our financial results for the quarterly period. We have provided ranges for our expectations described above because our fiscal quarter closing procedures are not yet complete. While we expect that our final financial results for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2024, following the completion of our financial closing procedures, will be within the ranges described above, our actual results may differ materially from these estimates as a result of the completion of our financial closing procedures as well as final adjustments and other developments that may arise between now and the time that our financial results for this quarterly period are finalized. All of the data presented above has been prepared by and is the responsibility of management. No independent registered public accounting firm has audited, reviewed or compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to these preliminary results, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on these preliminary estimated results. All forward-looking statements reflect our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date of this press release. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances, except as required by applicable law. Definitions of Certain Key Business Metrics Annual Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) We derive the vast majority of our revenues from recurring software subscriptions. We believe ARR provides us with visibility to our projected software subscription revenues in order to evaluate the health of our business. Because we recognize subscription revenues ratably, we believe investors can use ARR to measure our expansion of existing customer revenues, new customer activity, and as an indicator of future software subscription revenues. ARR is based on monthly recurring revenues (“MRR”) from software subscriptions for the most recent month at period end, multiplied by twelve. MRR is calculated by dividing the software subscription price, inclusive of discounts, by the number of subscription covered months. MRR only includes direct customers with MRR at the end of the last month of the measurement period. AARPC represents average annual revenue per direct customer and is calculated by dividing ARR by the number of software subscription direct customers at the end of the respective period. Net Revenue Retention Rate (“NRR”) We believe that our NRR provides insight into our ability to retain and grow revenues from our direct customers, as well as their potential long-term value to us. We also believe it demonstrates to investors our ability to expand existing customer revenues, which is one of our key growth strategies. Our NRR refers to the ARR expansion during the 12 months of a reporting period for all direct customers who were part of our customer base at the beginning of the reporting period. Our NRR calculation takes into account any revenues lost from departing direct customers or those who have downgraded or reduced usage, as well as any revenue expansion from migrations, new licenses for additional products or contractual and usage-based price changes. Gross Revenue Retention Rate (“GRR”) We believe our GRR provides insight into and demonstrates to investors our ability to retain revenues from our existing direct customers. Our GRR refers to how much of our MRR we retain each month after reduction for the effects of revenues lost from departing direct customers or those who have downgraded or reduced usage. GRR does not take into account revenue expansion from migrations, new licenses for additional products or contractual and usage-based price changes. GRR does not include revenue reductions resulting from cancellations of customer subscriptions that are replaced by new subscriptions associated with customer migrations to a newer version of the related software solution. Use and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to our results determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”) and key business metrics described above, we have calculated Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measures. We have provided tabular reconciliations of this non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, and to evaluate financial performance and liquidity. Our non-GAAP financial measures are presented as supplemental disclosure as we believe they provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results, prospects, and liquidity period-over-period without the impact of certain items that do not directly correlate to our operating performance and that may vary significantly from period to period for reasons unrelated to our operating performance, as well as comparing our financial results to those of other companies. Our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, the financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024. We calculate this non-GAAP financial measure as follows: Adjusted EBITDA is determined by adding back to GAAP net income or loss the net interest income or expense (including adjustments to the settlement value of deferred purchase commitment liabilities), income taxes, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, depreciation and amortization of capitalized software and acquired intangible assets included in cost of subscription revenues, amortization of acquired intangible assets included in selling and marketing expense, amortization of cloud computing implementation costs in general and administrative expense, asset impairments, stock-based compensation expense, severance expense, acquisition contingent consideration, changes in the settlement value of deferred purchase commitment liabilities recorded as interest expense, litigation settlements, and transaction costs, included in GAAP net income or loss for the respective periods. The table below provides a reconciliation of preliminary Adjusted EBITDA to the closest comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, net income, for the three months ended March 31, 2024.

(NASDAQ: VERX) (“Vertex”), a leading global provider of indirect tax solutions, today announced that it intends to offer and sell, subject to market conditions and other factors, $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2029 (the “notes”) in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). In connection with the offering of the notes, Vertex expects to grant the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase, for settlement within a period of 13 days from, and including, the date the notes are first issued, up to an additional $37.5 million aggregate principal amount of notes. The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of Vertex and will bear interest payable semi-annually in arrears and will mature on May 1, 2029, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms. Prior to November 1, 2028, the notes will be convertible only upon satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods. From and after November 1, 2028, the notes will be convertible at any time at the election of the holders of the notes until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. Upon conversion, the notes may be settled in shares of Vertex’s Class A Common Stock, cash or a combination of cash and shares of Vertex’s Class A Common Stock, at Vertex’s option. Holders of the notes will have the right to require Vertex to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at 100% of their principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable repurchase date, upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (to be defined in the indenture governing the notes), subject to a limited exception. Vertex may not redeem the notes prior to May 5, 2027. On or after May 5, 2027 and on or before the 40th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, Vertex may, at its option, redeem the notes for cash in whole or in part (subject to certain limitations) at anytime, and from time to time, but only if the last reported sale price of Vertex’s Class A Common Stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive), including the trading day immediately preceding the date on which Vertex provides notice of redemption, during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which Vertex provides notice of redemption. The redemption price will equal 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. No sinking fund is provided for the notes. Vertex intends to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to fund the cost of the capped call transactions described below and the remainder for working capital or other general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, potential acquisitions and strategic transactions. However, Vertex has not designated any specific uses and has no current agreements with respect to any acquisition or strategic transaction. In connection with the pricing of the notes, Vertex expects to enter into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain of the initial purchasers of the notes and/or their respective affiliates and/or other financial institutions (the “option counterparties”). The capped call transactions are expected to cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the notes, the number of shares of Vertex’s Class A Common Stock underlying the notes. If the initial purchasers of the notes exercise their option to purchase additional notes, Vertex expects to use a portion of the additional net proceeds to fund the cost of entering into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to Vertex’s Class A Common Stock upon any conversion of the notes and/or to offset any cash payments Vertex is required to make in excess of the principal amount of the converted notes, as the case may be, upon any conversion of the notes. If, however, the market price per share of Vertex’s Class A Common Stock, as measured under the terms of the capped call transactions, exceeds the cap price of the capped call transactions, there would nevertheless be dilution and/or there would not be an offset of such potential cash payments, in each case, to the extent that such market price exceeds the cap price of the capped call transactions. In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates expect to purchase shares of Vertex’s Class A Common Stock and/or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Vertex’s Class A Common Stock concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Vertex’s Class A Common Stock or the notes at that time. In addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to Vertex’s Class A Common Stock and/or purchasing or selling shares of Vertex’s Class A Common Stock or other of Vertex’s securities in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and from time to time prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so (x) during any observation period related to a conversion of the notes or following any redemption of the notes by Vertex or following any repurchase of the notes by Vertex in connection with any fundamental change and (y) following any repurchase of the notes by Vertex other than in connection with any such redemption or fundamental change if Vertex elects to unwind a corresponding portion of the capped call transactions in connection with such repurchase). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of Vertex’s Class A Common Stock or the notes, which could affect the ability of holders of the notes to convert the notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of notes, it could affect the number of shares of Vertex’s Class A Common Stock and value of the consideration that holders of notes will receive upon conversion of such notes. The notes and the shares of Vertex’s Class A Common Stock potentially issuable upon conversion of the notes will be offered only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The offer and sale of the notes and the shares of Vertex’s Class A Common Stock potentially issuable upon conversion of the notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and such securities may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements. This press release does not and shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any notes or shares of Vertex’s Class A Common Stock, nor shall there be any offer, solicitation or sale of notes or such Class A Common Stock in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.

The abstract describes our proprietary capabilities to deliver to and edit genes in the eye, opening a potential new focus area. Multiple LNPs as well as modified gRNAs and mRNAs were screened to achieve maximal editing in vivo. These optimized components have been applied to target myocilin (MYOC). Mutations of MYOC in trabecular meshwork cells have been linked to severe glaucomatous conditions. In human primary trabecular meshwork cells, up to 95% MYOC editing and 85% protein knockdown were seen. This novel approach aims to facilitate glaucoma treatment using transient expression of editing machinery targeting MYOC.

About CRISPR Therapeutics Since its inception over a decade ago, CRISPR Therapeutics has transformed from a research-stage company advancing programs in the field of gene editing, to a company that recently celebrated the historic approval of the first-ever CRISPR-based therapy and has a diverse portfolio of product candidates across a broad range of disease areas including hemoglobinopathies, oncology, regenerative medicine, cardiovascular, autoimmune, and rare diseases. CRISPR Therapeutics advanced the first-ever CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited therapy into the clinic in 2018 to investigate the treatment of sickle cell disease or transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia, and beginning in late 2023, CASGEVY™ (exagamglogene autotemcel) was approved in some countries to treat eligible patients with either of those conditions. The Nobel Prize-winning CRISPR science has revolutionized biomedical research and represents a powerful, clinically validated approach with the potential to create a new class of potentially transformative medicines. To accelerate and expand its efforts, CRISPR Therapeutics has established strategic partnerships with leading companies including Bayer and Vertex Pharmaceuticals. CRISPR Therapeutics AG is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, with its wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary, CRISPR Therapeutics, Inc., and R&D operations based in Boston, Massachusetts and San Francisco, California, and business offices in London, United Kingdom.

In 2023, 34% of PG&E's total electricity delivered to retail customers—residential customers and businesses to whom the company directly sells electricity—came from specified eligible-renewable resources, including solar and wind power, small hydroelectric generation and biopower. PG&E retail customers also received 53% of their electric deliveries from carbon-free nuclear power generated by Diablo Canyon Power Plant, and 13% from large hydroelectric power. The company's GHG-free electric retail sales are one important indicator of PG&E's clean-energy performance. In another example, PG&E also reached an important battery energy storage milestone, passing the 2,100-megawatt mark for capacity. ""We're all in on creating a clean energy future,"" said Patti Poppe, Chief Executive Officer, PG&E Corporation. ""Providing retail customers with 100% greenhouse gas-free electricity in 2023 highlights that PG&E's electric generation portfolio supports achievement of California's climate goals."" California's goals include reaching carbon neutrality by 2045. PG&E is committed to reaching carbon neutrality by 2040, and to actively removing more greenhouse gases than the company emits by 2050. Solar Leads for Renewables Large-scale solar energy accounts for the largest share of PG&E's renewable energy mix. The company has more than 260 Renewables Portfolio Standard-eligible power purchase agreements totaling more than 6,000 megawatts. According to the California Independent System Operator (ISO), one megawatt produces enough electricity to power about 750 homes. PG&E also owns 430 megawatts of eligible-renewable generation. That includes 277 megawatts of small hydroelectric, and 13 solar generation plants, mostly in the Central Valley, which generate up to 153 megawatts of clean power. PG&E also remains a leader in helping customers go solar. The company has connected more than 800,000 customers with rooftop solar to the electric grid. PG&E continues to support customers with resources before, during and after going solar. PG&E's resources for customers include help finding a solar contractor, as well as a solar calculator to help estimate their savings. PG&E Crosses Battery Energy Storage Milestone PG&E also continues to invest in battery energy storage systems to enhance grid reliability, integrate additional renewables into the grid and save customers energy and money. As of March 2024, PG&E has brought online a total of more than 2,100 megawatts of new incremental battery storage capacity, with an additional 772 megawatts planned in 2024 and 687.5 megawatts planned in 2025. PG&E has more than 3.5 gigawatts of total battery energy storage under contract. According to the ISO, California's renewable resources sometimes generate more electricity during the day than customers can use. Battery energy storage allows PG&E and other utilities to store excess solar or wind power for use later in the evening to displace natural gas-fired resources that would otherwise be dispatched to serve the evening peak. ""We're proud of our clean energy leadership, but we know there is more to do to ensure that clean energy is available at all times of the day and all seasons of the year,"" Poppe said. ""By unleashing the full potential of battery storage to integrate additional greenhouse gas-free sources of electricity, we will continue to reduce emissions across our energy system and make progress toward our goal of net-zero emissions by 2040 at the lowest possible cost."" Large-scale battery storage brought online in 2023 included: The 350-megawatt MOSS350 Energy Storage project in Moss Landing, (Monterey County) which brought Vistra's Moss Landing battery to 750 megawatts, making it the largest battery of its kind anywhereThe 169-megawatt Edwards Sanborn Energy Storage project in Mojave (Kern County)The 132-megawatt North Central Valley Energy Storage project in Linden (San Joaquin County)In addition to large, grid-scale battery energy storage, PG&E connects hundreds to thousands of new, behind-the-meter (BTM) battery energy storage systems to its grid every month. Through January 2024, behind-the-meter battery storage systems among PG&E customers totaled more than 670 megawatts—35% of the nation's behind-the-meter storage capacity.

Table 1: Total Shareholder Returns (TSR)1 Actual TSR Performance 1-Year 2-Year 3-Year 5-Year 7-year 10-Year CCI -10 % -39 % -18 % 28 % 73 % 127 % AMT 5 % -22 % 4 % 53 % 139 % 234 % SBAC -8 % -33 % -7 % 63 % 156 % 194 % S&P 500 24 % 0.08 % 27 % 90 % 113 % 158 % CCI's Relative TSR Performance 1-Year 2-Year 3-Year 5-Year 7-year 10-Year AMT -292 % -82 % -542 % -47 % -47 % -46 % SBAC -26 % -19 % -153 % -56 % -53 % -34 % S&P 500 -142 % -51,630 % -168 % -69 % -35 % -19 % Unsurprisingly, Crown Castle's TSR has lagged its two tower peers for the tenures of all of its legacy directors. Once again, the table below tells the story. Table 2: Total Shareholder Returns (TSR) of Directors2 Directors Tenure CCI's Relative TSR Performance toAMT CCI's Relative TSR Performance to SBAC P.

Kabat (2023) 0.7 years -36 % -21 % In Crown Castle's own preliminary proxy statement, dated April 4, 2024, the Board states ""[we] acknowledge that our stockholder returns have been disappointing and not what we or our investors expect from the Company."" This moment of candor was struck from the Company's definitive proxy statement filed on April 11, 2024. A TRACK RECORD OF FAILED STEWARDSHIP, CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, AND EXECUTION The decision to file our proxy solicitation was only made after considering the feedback and views of many large institutional shareholders. Apart from overwhelming frustration with Crown Castle's performance, shareholders have expressed uncertainty regarding the Company's continued stewardship, corporate governance, and execution. Consider the following areas: 1. Lack of relevant skillsets Until just a few months ago, not one independent director on the Board had tower company operating experience. Now, the closest they come to meeting this criterion is one independent director that served as CFO of a tower company. Only one independent director has even been a public-company CEO. And that was for a bank. The current Board's lack of tower company experience has exacerbated the impact of its failed management and operational strategy. It was easy to mask such shortcomings during a period of low interest rates, as tower companies delivered yield when there was precious little available to investors. But with rates much higher, the stresses for REIT management teams are also higher. Crown Castle still must deliver the dividend checks on time, but it has less investor rope to allocate capital as poorly as it has. It needs operators and doers – at both the executive and Board level – to make Crown Castle a more efficient and valuable company. Boots Capital's four nominees bring expertise where Crown Castle's board is weakest: The tower-industry itself. Our nominees founded this company and this industry, and have over 50 years of direct experience in towers. 2. Failure of strategic oversight Crown Castle's directors have presided over a 12-year misallocation of approximately $22 billion of investor capital. By the Company's own numbers, fiber investments have produced cash yield on invested capital of 7.3%, while its own weighted-average cost of capital is 7.8%.4 The Board spent this money without making return-on-investment criteria part of how executives were compensated. The opportunity costs of these decisions are immense: Today, the Company's shares are worth approximately $41 billion, and according to our work, the value of the fiber assets has shrunk by approximately $10 billion. Moreover, while Crown Castle was divesting its international assets, American Tower entered the international market and has since increased its market cap to approximately $80 billion, about twice that of Crown Castle today. 3. Excessive executive turnover and leadership turmoil The Board has failed in one of its most essential governance duties: Overseeing a stable change in important leadership roles. Since acquiring the fiber assets, more than a dozen senior executives across the Company's fiber acquisitions have resigned, and within the last three years the two EVP/COO leading the Company's tower segment departed. In October 2023, the Company announced the departure of its Chief Financial Officer followed by the sudden retirement of the Company's CEO, Jay A. Brown at the end of 2023. The CFO was re-hired in 2024. Additionally, on April 11 and in the midst of a proxy contest, it was announced that the VP of Investor Relations, Chris Hickman, resigned and took a job with another tower company. The Board also oversaw the shutdown of the Company's 1,000+ employee Canonsburg, Pennsylvania campus, only to reverse its decision less than two months later. We believe this turmoil has affected overall employee morale and productivity. We have spoken to more than a dozen current and former employees who say they have lost faith in the Company. Signs of operational dysfunction are rife: Most recently, the Company took the extreme decision of taking to trial one of its most important customers – Dish Wireless – over how Dish allegedly made use of three extra feet of space on tower sites. The final insult came when the jury found against Crown Castle. Given the high turnover and long-standing instability, the appointment of Stephen Moskowitz as full-time CEO marks a step in the right direction. However, Mr. Moskowitz's presence alone is not enough to overcome the issues facing Crown Castle, as demonstrated by the fact that the Company continues to pay both the prior CEO and prior interim CEO as consultants. And on its April 17 earnings call, it cited ""consultants"" – not the Board – as identifying potential operational improvements to fiber. Notably, there was no mention of identifying such potential operational improvements to the tower sector. We believe our team's experience and plan are the missing pieces, without which Mr. Moskowitz is not set up for success at this pivotal inflection point. 4. Lack of accountability There is inadequate accountability for directors on the Crown Castle Board, most notably those who have presided over a decade-plus of miserable performance by the Company, its investments, and its stock price. This same Board rewarded its two most recent CEOs, W. Benjamin Moreland and Jay Brown, total compensation of $76.7 million and $101.2 million5 during their respective senior-management tenures with no return on capital performance thresholds. In connection with Elliott's first campaign in 2020, the Company appointed three new directors while facing pressure to institute ROIC-pegged compensation and a strategic review of fiber – neither of those things happened. The Company's performance continued to deteriorate, as demonstrated by the Company's TSR since then – negative 542% compared to AMT and negative 153% compared to SBAC. Nonetheless, these directors, as well as many of the directors that oversaw a decade-plus of value destruction, remain on the Board today. These are symptoms of an entitled and unaccountable culture. We thus believe it is time to replace three of the Company's longest serving directors – Ari Fitzgerald, 21+ years; Cindy Christy, 16+ years; and P. Robert Bartolo, 10+ years – as these ""Legacy Directors"" have demonstrated they cannot be trusted to drive the Company forward in the best interest of all shareholders. Further, we think it is in the best interest of shareholders to replace Kevin T. Kabat with a member of the Boots team who brings far greater and more relevant tower company operating experience. Mr. Kabat served as the CEO of a bank. We have two nominees on the Boots team, one of whom served as the Founder and CEO of a public tower company and the other served as the Founder and CEO of a notable private tower company. The remaining Board directors along with our nominees will create the accountability this Board has needed for the last decade. 5. Entrenchment The incumbent Board has not observed basic shareholder protections. In December 2023, to ward off a second potential proxy fight from Elliott, the Board hastily agreed in three weeks to an entrenching ""cooperation agreement"" in which the directors handed over essential shareholder rights, including fixing the size of the Board, in exchange for Elliott supporting the Company's directors at the annual meeting. Shortly after we challenged this deal in Delaware court, the Company and Elliott twice amended and eliminated certain provisions of the cooperation agreement, after the Delaware Chancery Court suggested they may be coercive to shareholders' rights. Entering into this agreement with Elliott – prior to the Company's window for other shareholders to submit nominations – calls into question whether the Board puts the security of its seats ahead of its responsibility to shareholders. The closing stock price of Crown Castle on December 19, 2023, the day the Company entered into the cooperation agreement with Elliott, was $113.99. The closing stock price on April 19, 2023, was down to $95.20. 6. Refusing to engage constructively to resolve the proxy contest While and after presenting our proposal to the Board and its advisors, we received limited questions, mostly from the Company's advisors. Since that time, the Board has failed to meaningfully engage with us, and has not requested to review the diligence materials that informed our plan, including the sale of fiber and potential tax benefits. Furthermore, after we made our initial nomination submissions on a confidential basis to the Board, the Board interviewed each of our nominees. We believe that these interviews were effectively a pretense. They were structured as two 30-minute interviews of two nominees at the same time. Their conclusion to reject all of our nominees on the basis of lack of ""expertise and experience"" did not seem like a good faith judgment, given the unrivaled tower industry backgrounds of our nominees. Then, in a March 8 hearing, the Delaware Chancery Court requested Crown Castle's Board give notice to Boots if there were to be any major corporate developments6. We believe shareholders would find this to be highly important information, but the Company never disclosed it. Crown Castle has still never informed shareholders of the court's direction, nor did it respect the Chancery Court's instruction in our view when expanding the Board to 13 members later in April, during the critical, late-stages of a proxy contest. The Board's lack of disclosure and entrenchment behavior carried through to the supposed ""fresh look"" review period offered to the Boots nominees by Crown Castle's Board pursuant to the ongoing litigation. In mid-March, Mr. Miller flew to meet Board chairman Rob Bartolo at a Peet's Coffee shop near Mr. Bartolo's home. There, Mr. Miller proposed significant concessions to end the proxy fight, including eliminating Executive Chairman from our proposal. Notably, the Company continued to highlight this point in its latest press release, with full knowledge that we have revised our proposal. However, it soon became clear that the Board was not interested in engaging in good faith: On March 24, Mr. Bartolo sent Mr. Miller an email at 11:49 pm agreeing to schedule another meeting. Before the sun had even risen in Houston the following morning, Crown Castle had filed its preliminary proxy that heavily criticized Boots, retained its original recommendation against our nominees, and incorrectly questioned our recital of the facts. It appears that the Company never disclosed the notice obligation or the ""fresh look"" because it never intended to comply with either. 7. False Statements about the Boots Proposal Even though the Board has not engaged with us to review the diligence materials underlying our proposal, the Company recently issued a press release questioning two components of our plan 1) the number of buyers and financing sources who took part in our process and 2) the legitimacy of possible tax benefits we have highlighted. There are 25 prospective buyers and financing sources who signed our NDA. This includes 3 strategic acquirors, 14 infrastructure/private equity firms and 8 financing sources. These buyers and financing sources represent blue chip, highly qualified market participants capable of executing a $10+ billion carve-out transaction. We told this to the Board directly in our meeting. These entities are not precluded from working with the Company. They are precluded from disclosing the nature of their relationship with Boots. Therefore, the Company is in no position to allege that these buyers and financing sources have not reached out to them as a result of these restrictions. Moreover, it is plausible that these parties have not reached out to the Company because they do not believe in the existing Board's conviction or ability to execute a fiber sale. This consideration is likely a component of what led these buyers and financing sources to engage with us and not the Company in the first place. We have offered to sign a separate NDA with the Company so we could begin the process of gaining the relevant permissions in order for us to share all of this information with the Board. But the Company has refused to take this step. As with any large transaction, developing an effective tax strategy is complicated, but crucial to obtaining the best possible outcome. We have extensively analyzed the proposed transaction and developed various alternatives to address the significant tax issues the Company will face upon a sale of the fiber business. We presented the results of our work to the Board, yet the Board had very few questions about the tax considerations of our plan or about the contents of our plan generally. The Company's overly simplistic response that ""Crown Castle, being a REIT, is exempt from paying taxes as long as it distributes its taxable income to shareholders each year"" demonstrates a lack of care and determination on the part of the Board. Reflexively falling back upon the ability to make extraordinary distributions to shareholders (which are fully taxable to them) rather than developing viable strategies that allow proceeds to be used to repay debt, fund stock repurchases and/or reinvest in the Company's core business (without tax to either the Company or its shareholders) certainly does not reflect how other publicly traded REITs (or any well-managed businesses) operate. Boots has identified a number of alternative approaches to manage the taxable income associated with a sale of the fiber business and has offered on more than one occasion to discuss those strategies. Those alternative strategies are not limited to a transaction that closes in 2024 and Boots has never recommended moving forward with ""reckless urgency"" as the Company alleges; instead, Boots has developed a number of alternatives that allow the Company to move forward with appropriate urgency. Our philosophy has been to engage however we can to help the Company. That is why we had our tax advisors in attendance during our January 30 meeting with the Board, subsequently offered to facilitate a meeting between the Company's tax advisors and our tax advisors and offered to share the full extent of our findings pursuant to a confidentiality agreement between the parties. A response to this request never came. The facts show this Board would rather ignore a significant value opportunity for the Company and issue press releases inaccurately calling our analysis into question. BOOTS CAPITAL'S NOMINEES HAVE A CLEAR, DETAILED, AND ACTIONABLE PLAN TO TURN CROWN CASTLE'S BUSINESS AROUND The Boots nominees have been analyzing and preparing a plan for Crown Castle since August 2023. We reached out directly to Crown Castle management five times before we even received a response. And to this day, the Company has willfully ignored our offer to share months of detailed analysis around fiber divestment, likely buyers, and resetting the Company's overall capital expenditure profile. In short, the Board has not put forth a comprehensive plan, and yet it remains arrogant enough to publicly criticize our plan while privately refusing to engage with our materials in earnest, such that it could act with an informed opinion. The fiber review committee has been in place since December, yet no comprehensive plan has been put forward for shareholders. Even after producing its definitive proxy statement, Crown Castle has left shareholders with open questions as to the future of the fiber asset. Part of what we originally proposed was to contribute our work to the Company to speed up its review. Instead, we have been rebuffed and shareholders have paid the price. In fact, the Company's recent disclosures proudly boast of the financial analysis conducted by its advisors – the same work we completed, aided by a major, internationally recognized consulting firm, and offered to share with the Company four months ago. We have spent considerable resources over the last eight months to build a detailed, comprehensive strategic plan to solve Crown Castle's crisis. Our strategic plan to enhance shareholder value and improve operations has three core tenets: Accelerate the Sale of Crown Castle's Fiber Business: We go only where the facts take us and what shareholders have indicated they would like to see happen. And right now, the facts show that a separation of Crown Castle's fiber unit – including its small cells assets – is essential for our intended value-creating path. These business lines are projected by the Company to chew through an additional $1.4 billion in capital in 2024. If historical performance is any indicator, this CapEx will also struggle to exceed the Company's cost of capital.Putting these businesses in the right hands allows Crown Castle to be a pure-play tower company whose comparable peers trade for 25 times EBITDA, compared to the Company's current multiple of 18 times. Rather than heed this urgent and justifiable warning, the Board has instead decided to gamble with even more shareholder chips by delaying and criticizing our plan instead of taking action. Two investment banks are now performing their costly and redundant work rather than leveraging the work we had already done. All the while, time is of the essence.Reboot Crown Castle as a Pure-Play Tower Company: The Company needs well-rounded knowledgeable industry veterans who not only understand operations and finance but have the ability to be strategic and innovative. It's time to get back to basics and run the Company with a real entrepreneurial and operational mindset.That means becoming more efficient and aligning the ratio of employees to towers to meet or exceed industry benchmarks. It also means utilizing new technologies to digitize the asset base and automate workflows so that the same information is being shared across the enterprise requiring fewer resources and saving time and money. And it means rewriting incentive plans – as Mr. Miller did at Crown Castle and as Chairman of the Compensation Committee at publicly-traded Affiliated Computer Services Inc. to provide clear goals and rewards.Revamp and Stabilize Crown Castle Leadership: Adding our nominees fills the Board's current void of industry-specific experience, and further imbues it with energy, accountability and entrepreneurship. We seek to end the 'brain drain' of executive departures and improve employee morale (just read one employee website – www.thelayoff.com/crown-castle-international -- to get a flavor for the decay of culture and morale). Our nominees have the necessary industry connections to help support and fill key positions at the Company as needed to kick-start the rebuild of the Company and its culture.The Company will argue that there have already been recent changes to the Crown Castle Board. But what is needed is not just new Board members – the Company needs the right Board members with the deep experience to fix both Crown Castle and the issues it faces. BOOTS CAPITAL'S NOMINEES HAVE DEEP TOWERS EXPERIENCE, ENTREPRENEURIAL ENERGY, AND LEADERSHIP CREDIBILITY NECESSARY TO REBOOT CROWN CASTLE Our nominees have over 50 combined years of leadership in the towers space. For more information about our nominees' experience and credentials, please visit www.RebootCrownCastle.com.

Negative None. Financial Analyst BIO-key International's notice of non-compliance from Nasdaq due to a delay in filing their annual report could raise concerns about the company's internal financial processes and controls. Investors often view such delays as red flags, potentially reflecting deeper issues within a company. The market reaction to this kind of news tends to be negative, as uncertainty about the company's financial health can lead to a decrease in investor confidence.For retail investors, this situation is a critical reminder of the importance of regulatory compliance and timely financial reporting. The delay could suggest operational inefficiencies or more serious financial complications, which may not yet be fully disclosed. The 60-day period to submit a plan for regaining compliance and the possible 180-day extension for filing allows some breathing room, but the longer the delay, the more pronounced the impact could be on the stock's volatility and investor sentiment. Market Research Analyst The Identity and Access Management (IAM) sector is highly competitive and fast-growing, with Identity-Bound Biometrics being a key differentiator for companies like BIO-key International. Delays in financial reporting could impede the company's ability to raise capital and invest in research and development, potentially causing them to fall behind in the innovation race. It's important to note that while the notification from Nasdaq does not immediately affect the stock's listing or trading, the perceived risk by the market may lead to short-term selling pressure, affecting the stock's liquidity and price.Investors should monitor the company's progress toward resolving the filing delay and assess whether this is an isolated incident or indicative of systemic issues. Given the reliance of modern businesses on effective cybersecurity measures, BIO-key's position in the market could be adversely affected if they're unable to quickly address and correct the reasons for the filing delay. Compliance & Governance Expert From a governance standpoint, BIO-key International's delay in filing its Form 10-K reflects a potential oversight in meeting Nasdaq's stringent listing requirements. While such an event doesn't necessarily presage poor financial performance, it does raise questions about the company's governance practices. The additional scrutiny from being non-compliant poses risks to the company's reputation among investors who prioritize governance quality in their investment decisions.The ramifications of this delayed filing might not only be limited to market perception but could also incur subsequent regulatory scrutiny. Retail investors should be aware of these governance issues, as they could influence the company's long-term value creation and strategic positioning. The onus is on BIO-key to not only remedy the current situation but also to implement measures preventing future occurrences, reassuring stakeholders of its commitment to sound governance principles. 04/22/2024 - 04:30 PM HOLMDEL, N.J., April 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BIO-key International, Inc.

TRACER™ generated capsids have demonstrated superior and widespread gene expression in the CNS compared to conventional AAV capsids as well as cell- and tissue-specific transduction, including to areas of the brain that have been traditionally difficult to reach, while de-targeting the liver and dorsal root ganglia. As part of its external partnership strategy, Voyager has established multiple collaboration agreements providing access to its next-generation TRACER™ capsids to potentially enable its partners’ gene therapy programs to treat a variety of diseases.

Core property operating revenues rose by 5.8% and Core Income from property operations increased by 7.1% compared to Q1 2023. Negative None. Financial Analyst An examination of Equity LifeStyle Properties, Inc.'s Q1 2024 financial performance reveals an unambiguous surge in net income by approximately $27.5 million, a growth of over 33% year-over-year. The reported increase in Funds from Operations (FFO) and Normalized FFO per share, key metrics in the real estate sector to assess a company's cash flow, further solidifies its financial standing. Notably, the Normalized FFO per share increment of 8.6%, aligning with their guidance, represents significant operational efficiency and revenue growth. Additionally, the strategic move to secure interest rate swap agreements points towards a proactive approach to manage interest rate risk, which is particularly pertinent in a fluctuating rate environment.To distill this for investors, ELS is demonstrating robust financial health backed by increasing revenues and controlled expenses. This growth trajectory, if sustained, could signal market confidence, potentially positively influencing the stock's attractiveness. The guidance for the upcoming quarters delineates anticipated growth, albeit contingent upon handling inflationary pressures and operational efficiencies. Real Estate Market Analyst ELS's performance in the first quarter of 2024 reflects a noteworthy uptick in core property operating revenues and income, indicative of the company's solid market positioning within the Manufactured Housing (MH) and Recreational Vehicle (RV) sectors. A closer look at the MH base rental income growth of 6.4%, primarily through rate increases, suggests a healthy pricing power and a stable demand within this niche market. Additionally, the company's capacity to increase the number of MH homeowners and maintain stable occupancy rates underlies a resilient consumer base.From an investor's lens, the steady performance in the RV and marina segments paints a picture of a diversified and resilient portfolio that is less susceptible to sector-specific headwinds. The provided guidance implies growth, yet also cautions investors about potential headwinds such as managing expenses and integration of acquisitions, which could impact the projected income from property operations. Insurance and Risk Management Advisor The completion of property and casualty insurance renewal with managed premium increases of 9% suggests that ELS is not only well-insured but has also effectively negotiated terms amidst a broader market where insurance costs have seen escalations. Such a renewal emphasizes the importance of risk management in real estate, particularly for a company with a sizable asset portfolio exposed to potential property damages.For shareholders, this indicates that ELS is exercising due diligence to safeguard assets against unforeseen events, which could otherwise result in substantial financial burdens. The preemptive interest rate swaps illustrate a strategic financial hedge against potential interest rate hikes, enhancing the company's long-term financial stability and indirectly protecting shareholder value. 04/22/2024 - 04:18 PM Continued Strong Performance CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Equity LifeStyle Properties, Inc.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures Definitions and Reconciliations The following Non-GAAP financial measures definitions have been revised and do not include adjustments in respect to membership upgrade sales: (i) FFO; (ii) Normalized FFO; (iii) EBITDAre; (iv) Adjusted EBITDAre; (v) Property operating revenues; (vi) Property operating expenses; and (vii) Income from property operations, excluding property management. For comparability, prior periods’ non-GAAP financial measures have also been updated. FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (FFO). We define FFO as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of properties, depreciation and amortization related to real estate, impairment charges and adjustments to reflect our share of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. We compute FFO in accordance with our interpretation of standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”), which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. We believe FFO, as defined by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, is generally a measure of performance for an equity REIT. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance for equity REITs, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP, and it should not be considered as an alternative to these indicators in evaluating liquidity or operating performance. NORMALIZED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (NORMALIZED FFO). We define Normalized FFO as FFO excluding non-operating income and expense items, such as gains and losses from early debt extinguishment, including prepayment penalties, defeasance costs, transaction/pursuit costs and other, and other miscellaneous non-comparable items. Normalized FFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to Normalized FFO presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same methodology for computing this amount. FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION (FAD). We define FAD as Normalized FFO less non-revenue producing capital expenditures. We believe that FFO, Normalized FFO and FAD are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the performance of an equity REIT. We believe that by excluding the effect of gains or losses from sales of properties, depreciation and amortization related to real estate and impairment charges, which are based on historical costs and may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance, FFO can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity REITs. We further believe that Normalized FFO provides useful information to investors, analysts and our management because it allows them to compare our operating performance to the operating performance of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis without having to account for differences not related to our normal operations. For example, we believe that excluding the early extinguishment of debt and other miscellaneous non-comparable items from FFO allows investors, analysts and our management to assess the sustainability of operating performance in future periods because these costs do not affect the future operations of the properties. In some cases, we provide information about identified non-cash components of FFO and Normalized FFO because it allows investors, analysts and our management to assess the impact of those items. INCOME FROM PROPERTY OPERATIONS, EXCLUDING PROPERTY MANAGEMENT. We define Income from property operations, excluding property management as rental income, membership subscriptions and upgrade sales, utility and other income less property and rental home operating and maintenance expenses, real estate taxes, membership sales and marketing expenses, excluding property management expenses. Property management represents the expenses associated with indirect costs such as off-site payroll and certain administrative and professional expenses. We believe exclusion of property management expenses is helpful to investors and analysts as a measure of the operating results of our properties, excluding items that are not directly related to the operation of the properties. For comparative purposes, we present bad debt expense within Property operating, maintenance and real estate taxes in the current and prior periods. We believe that this Non-GAAP financial measure is helpful to investors and analysts as a measure of the operating results of our properties.

We define EBITDAre as net income or loss excluding interest income and expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, gains or losses from sales of properties, impairments charges, and adjustments to reflect our share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated joint ventures. We compute EBITDAre in accordance with our interpretation of the standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to EBITDAre reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. We define Adjusted EBITDAre as EBITDAre excluding non-operating income and expense items, such as gains and losses from early debt extinguishment, including prepayment penalties and defeasance costs, transaction/pursuit costs and other, and other miscellaneous non-comparable items. We believe that EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre may be useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance and liquidity because the measures are widely used to measure the operating performance of an equity REIT. ____________________ Represents insurance recovery revenue for reimbursement of capital expenditures related to Hurricane Ian.

(Nasdaq: HSTM) meldete starke Finanzergebnisse für das erste Quartal 2024, mit Einnahmen von 72,8 Millionen Dollar, ein Anstieg um 6% gegenüber dem Vorjahr. Das Betriebsergebnis stieg um 97% auf 5,7 Millionen Dollar und der Nettogewinn wuchs um 99% auf 5,2 Millionen Dollar. Das bereinigte EBITDA erhöhte sich um 24% auf 17,1 Millionen Dollar. Das Unternehmen erklärte eine vierteljährliche Bardividende von 0,028 Dollar pro Aktie. HealthStream bestätigte seine Prognose für 2024 mit erwarteten Einnahmen von 292,0 bis 296,0 Millionen Dollar und einem angepassten EBITDA von 64,5 bis 67,5 Millionen Dollar. Positive Revenue for the first quarter of 2024 increased by 6% to $72.8 million compared to the same period in 2023. Operating income saw a significant increase of 97% to $5.7 million in the first quarter of 2024. Net income for the first quarter of 2024 grew by 99% to $5.2 million. Earnings per share (EPS) also showed significant growth to $0.17 per share in the first quarter of 2024. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 24% to $17.1 million in the first quarter of 2024. The Company announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.028 per share. HealthStream reaffirmed its guidance for 2024, with revenue expected to be between $292.0 - $296.0 million and adjusted EBITDA between $64.5 - $67.5 million. Negative None. Financial Analyst The significant rise of 97% in operating income and 99% in net income for HealthStream in Q1 2024 is indicative of strong operational efficiency and cost management, especially considering the reduction in labor costs due to prior restructuring. The company’s ability to increase subscription revenues by 6% amidst a competitive healthcare technology market underscores a robust business model and potential for scalable growth. However, investors should be mindful of the capital expenditures of $6.9 million, which have implications for the company’s future revenue streams and may affect liquidity in the short term. Additionally, the lack of debt indicates a conservative capital structure, but it may also signal a potential underutilization of leveraging opportunities for growth. Market Research Analyst An analysis of the healthcare workforce solutions market suggests HealthStream’s focus on engaging and developing healthcare personnel is well-timed. The reiteration of financial guidance for 2024 reflects confidence in the company's strategic direction and market position. However, the guidance does not account for potential acquisitions or economic downturns, which could introduce variability in these projections. The declared quarterly cash dividend might appeal to income-focused investors but also reflects a modest yield that should be weighed against the company's growth prospects. This balance between dividend payments and reinvestment in the business is critical for long-term value creation. Tech Industry Expert HealthStream’s investment in software development, as indicated by increased capitalized labor, suggests a forward-looking approach to innovation within healthcare technology. This strategic allocation of resources may contribute to competitive differentiation and customer retention in the long run. The conclusion of the share repurchase program without any buybacks in Q1 2024 could signal a prioritization of financial stability or other strategic initiatives over shareholder return through buybacks. Tech investors should monitor how these funds are reallocated to assess the impact on future growth trajectories. 04/22/2024 - 04:30 PM NASHVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- HealthStream, Inc. (the “Company”) (Nasdaq: HSTM), a leading healthcare technology platform for workforce solutions, announced today results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024. First Quarter 2024 Revenues of $72.8 million in the first quarter of 2024, up 6% from $68.9 million in the first quarter of 2023 Operating income of $5.7 million in the first quarter of 2024, up 97% from $2.9 million in the first quarter of 2023 Net income of $5.2 million in the first quarter of 2024, up 99% from $2.6 million in the first quarter of 2023 Earnings per share (EPS) of $0.17 per share (diluted) in the first quarter of 2024, up from $0.09 per share (diluted) in the first quarter of 2023 Adjusted EBITDA1 of $17.1 million in the first quarter of 2024, up 24% from $13.7 million in the first quarter of 2023 Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.028 per share, payable on May 17, 2024 to holders of record on May 6, 2024 1 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income and disclosure regarding why we believe adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors is included later in this release. Financial Results: First Quarter 2024 Compared to First Quarter 2023 Revenues for the first quarter of 2024 increased by $3.8 million, or six percent, to $72.8 million, compared to $68.9 million for the first quarter of 2023. Subscription revenues increased $4.2 million, or six percent, and professional services revenues declined by $0.4 million. Operating income was $5.7 million for the first quarter of 2024, up 97 percent from $2.9 million in the first quarter of 2023. The improvement in operating income was primarily attributable to increased revenues, a reduction in labor costs (primarily resulting from $1.0 million of severance charges incurred during the first quarter of 2023 in connection with the Company’s restructuring under a single platform strategy), a decrease in professional fees, and an increase in capitalized labor associated with software development activities, which were partially offset by increases in software, cloud hosting expenses, royalties, amortization, and general marketing expenses. Net income was $5.2 million in the first quarter of 2024, up 99 percent from $2.6 million in the first quarter of 2023, and EPS was $0.17 per share (diluted) in the first quarter of 2024, up from $0.09 per share (diluted) in the first quarter of 2023. Net income and EPS for the first quarter of 2023 were negatively impacted by severance charges recognized in the amounts of $0.8 million and $0.03 per share (diluted), respectively, in connection with the 2023 restructuring discussed above. Adjusted EBITDA was $17.1 million for the first quarter of 2024, up 24 percent from $13.7 million in the first quarter of 2023. At March 31, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $83.7 million. The Company does not have any outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money. Capital expenditures incurred during the first quarter of 2024 were $6.9 million. Other Business Updates On September 13, 2023, the Company announced a share repurchase program under which the Company was authorized to repurchase up to $10.0 million of its outstanding shares of common stock. Pursuant to this authorization, the Company repurchased shares valued at an aggregate of $8.9 million, with no shares repurchased during the three months ended March 31, 2024. The program expired on March 31, 2024. On April 22, 2024, the Board approved a quarterly cash dividend under the Company's dividend policy of $0.028 per share, payable on May 17, 2024 to holders of record on May 6, 2024. Financial Outlook for 2024 The Company reaffirms its guidance for 2024 for the measures set forth below as previously announced on February 19, 2024. For a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure defined later in this release, to projected net income (the most comparable GAAP measure) for 2024, see the table included on page nine of this release. Full-Year 2024 Guidance Low High Revenue $ 292.0 - $ 296.0 million Adjusted EBITDA1 $ 64.5 - $ 67.5 million Capital Expenditures $ 28.0 - $ 30.0 million 1 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA to projected net income (the most comparable GAAP measure) is included later in this release. The Company’s guidance for 2024 as set forth above reflects the Company’s assumptions regarding, among other things, expectations for new sales and renewals, and assumes that general economic conditions, including inflationary pressures, do not deteriorate. This consolidated guidance does not include the impact of any acquisitions that we may complete during 2024, gains or losses from changes in the fair value of minority investments, or impairment of long-lived assets. Commenting on first quarter 2024 results, Robert A. Frist, Jr., Chief Executive Officer, HealthStream, said, “We were pleased to achieve record quarterly revenues, record adjusted EBITDA, and a strong quarter overall, giving us confidence to reiterate our previously announced financial guidance. We believe our workforce solutions are well-aligned with the current industry focus to engage, retain, and develop the healthcare workforce.” A conference call with Robert A. Frist, Jr., Chief Executive Officer, Scott A. Roberts, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President, and Mollie Condra, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, will be held on Tuesday, April 23, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. (ET).

A replay of the conference call and webcast will be archived on the Company’s website in the Investor Relations section under “Events & Presentations.” Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release presents adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure used by management in analyzing the Company’s financial results and ongoing operational performance. In order to better assess the Company’s financial results, management believes that net income before interest, income taxes, stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, and changes in fair value of, including gains (losses) on the sale of, non-marketable equity investments (“adjusted EBITDA”), is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of the Company because adjusted EBITDA reflects net income adjusted for certain GAAP accounting, non-cash, and/or non-operating items which may not, in any such case, fully reflect the underlying operating performance of our business. In addition, as discussed below, for periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2023, adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of the deferred revenue write-downs associated with fair value accounting for acquired businesses. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors to assess the Company’s ongoing operating performance and to compare the Company's operating performance between periods. In addition, certain short-term cash incentive bonuses and performance-based equity awards are based on the achievement of adjusted EBITDA (as defined in applicable bonus and equity grant documentation) targets. As previously disclosed, prior to the Company early adopting ASU 2021-08 effective January 1, 2022, following the completion of any acquisition by the Company, the Company was required to record the acquired deferred revenue at fair value as defined in GAAP, which typically resulted in a write-down of the acquired deferred revenue. In connection therewith, management determined that including an adjustment in the definition of adjusted EBITDA for the impact of the deferred write-downs associated with fair value accounting for businesses acquired prior to the January 1, 2022 effective date of the Company's adoption of ASU 2021-08 (the “Pre-2022 Acquisitions”) provided useful information to investors because the deferred revenue write-down recognized in periods after any such Pre-2022 Acquisitions could, given the nature of this non-cash accounting impact, cause our GAAP financial results during such periods to not fully reflect our underlying operating performance. Following the adoption of ASU 2021-08, contracts acquired in an acquisition completed on or after January 1, 2022 have been measured as if the Company had originated the contract (rather than the contract being measured at fair value) such that, for such acquisitions, the Company no longer records deferred revenue write-downs associated with acquired businesses. With respect to periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2023, the Company has included an adjustment in the calculation of adjusted EBITDA for the impact of deferred revenue write-downs associated with the Pre-2022 Acquisitions consistent with this prior accounting standard, given the ongoing impact of such deferred revenue on our financial results under GAAP over this time period. With respect to periods beginning on and after January 1, 2024, the Company is no longer recognizing any deferred revenue write-downs associated with the Pre-2022 Acquisitions under GAAP, and accordingly such deferred revenue write-downs are no longer an adjustment in connection with the calculation of adjusted EBITDA for periods beginning on and after January 1, 2024. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Because adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP, adjusted EBITDA is susceptible to varying calculations. Accordingly, adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and has limitations as an analytical tool. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance, which are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA to net income (the most comparable GAAP measure), which is set forth below in this release.

(Nasdaq: ACET), a clinical stage biotechnology company discovering and developing allogeneic gamma delta T cell therapies for autoimmune diseases and cancer, today announced that an abstract featuring new preclinical data highlighting ADI-270, an armored allogeneic “off-the-shelf” gamma delta CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) T cell therapy candidate targeting CD70 positive cancers, has been selected for an oral presentation at the ASGCT 27th Annual Meeting taking place from May 7-11, 2024, in Baltimore, MD. The oral presentation will take place on May 10, 2024 in the Targeted Gene and Cell Therapy session, co-chaired by Adicet Bio’s Chief Scientific Officer, Blake Aftab, Ph.D. “We look forward to sharing new preclinical data at ASGCT further illustrating ADI-270’s robust anti-tumor activity with a differentiated method for targeting CD70 across multiple solid and hematologic cancers,” said Blake Aftab, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of Adicet Bio. “ADI-270 is a next-generation CAR T cell therapy candidate designed to capitalize on potent tumor infiltration associated with the gamma delta T cell platform. ADI-270 is further enhanced with armoring to address suppressive tumor microenvironments and to address clearance by host T cells. In preclinical studies, ADI-270 demonstrated enhanced functional persistence and potency, including unique contribution of innate anti-tumor immunity, compared to multiple clinically relevant benchmarks in cancers expressing CD70. Supported by these encouraging data, we look forward to advancing ADI-270’s clinical development and remain on track to file an IND in renal cell carcinoma this quarter.” Findings from this study have further characterized and have provided comparative benchmarking for the mechanisms by which ADI-270 provides enhanced functionality and potency in CD70 positive expressing tumors such as clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and facilitates a robust anti-tumor effect that supports its continued development. The preclinical findings indicate: ADI-270 demonstrated potent in vitro cytotoxicity against multiple CD70 positive tumor cell lines expressing varying levels of CD70. ADI-270 demonstrated robust cytotoxicity against heterogeneous CD70 negative and CD70 positive tumor cell cultures, highlighting the potential of gamma delta CAR T cells to be effective against tumors with mixed antigen expression. ADI-270’s unique use of CD27-based targeting of CD70 demonstrated robust CAR-mediated killing in multiple cancer models including ccRCC, non-small cell lung cancer and T cell lymphoma, and including those models with lower levels of CD70 expression. ADI-270 inhibited tumor growth in the context of suppressive tumor microenvironment attributed to inclusion of dominant-negative transforming growth factor beta receptor and demonstrated resilience to clearance by host T cells attributed to the function of CD27-based CAR targeting of CD70 also expressed on host T cells. Robust anti-tumor effects in an in vivo model of ccRCC, such as tumor infiltration, proliferation, and effector function, were observed after administration, resulting in eradication of CD70 positive tumor cells.

Adjusted operating income decreased by 14.1% to $54.1 million in Q1 2024 compared to $63.0 million in Q1 2023. Free cash flow was negative at ($35.7) million in Q1 2024 compared to ($41.5) million in Q1 2023. Capital expenditures increased to $28.7 million in Q1 2024 compared to $18.1 million in Q1 2023. Financial Analyst Hexcel Corporation's reported increased sales reflect a positive trend in revenue growth, signaling an overall increase in demand for their aerospace and defense products. However, this is juxtaposed with a decrease in net income and diluted earnings per share (EPS), both on a GAAP and adjusted basis. This discrepancy suggests potential cost pressures or inefficiencies in the company's operations that may have emerged during the period.Investors should note the significant decrease in industrial sales, potentially indicative of sector-specific challenges or shifts in customer preferences. Additionally, the company's share repurchase activity is a robust signal of self-confidence in future performance yet reflects a substantial use of capital that might otherwise be used to bolster operations or invest in growth opportunities.Finally, the commitment to a dividend payout, despite the cash flow being negative, underscores management's commitment to shareholder returns but raises questions about long-term financial sustainability if free cash flow does not improve. Market Research Analyst The company's statement regarding the rebound of the aerospace market—particularly with the uptick in global air passenger traffic and new orders for widebody aircraft—is a valuable insight into the industry's recovery post-pandemic. For investors, this provides context for potential future demand for Hexcel's products, which are integral to lightweight, fuel-efficient aircraft manufacturing.The Space & Defense sector's growth, spurred by programs like the Lockheed F-35 and Airbus A400M, is promising. As defense spending remains generally stable, investors can expect this sector to continue to be a reliable revenue stream for Hexcel. 04/22/2024 - 04:15 PM STAMFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Hexcel Corporation (NYSE: HXL): Q1 2024 GAAP diluted EPS of $0.43 compared to Q1 2023 GAAP diluted EPS of $0.50.

Financial Analyst The acquisition of Wilshire Advisors' risk and performance analytics solutions by Clearwater Analytics signifies an expansion of Clearwater's product suite, particularly strengthening its presence in the investment management industry. By integrating Wilshire's established models, Clearwater diversifies its offerings and enhances its competitive edge. The deal should be examined for the potential to increase market share and drive revenue growth. In the short-term, costs associated with integrating new services and platforms could affect profitability margins. However, long-term prospects appear positive, as the acquisition is aimed at providing a more comprehensive solution for clients, which can result in higher retention rates and attract new customers.Key metrics to observe in the upcoming quarters would be the growth in client base, any increase in average revenue per user (ARPU) and the efficiency of the integration process as reflected in the operating margins. Investors should also keep an eye on how the acquisition is reflected in the balance sheet, particularly goodwill and intangible assets, which might give an indication of the premium paid for the acquired assets and potential future amortization expenses. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the strategic integration of Clearwater's and Wilshire's technologies aims to address evolving needs for sophisticated risk and performance analytics among front and middle office clients. This is particularly relevant as the investment landscape becomes more complex and data-driven.

The offering of 14,260,000 shares at $21.00 per share, which includes the full exercise of the underwriters' option to cover over-allotments, has injected a considerable amount of capital into the company. This move likely aims to fund growth initiatives, drive expansion, or possibly reduce existing debt. The involvement of entities affiliated with Carl C. Icahn, a well-known investor, signals a potential vote of confidence in Centuri's business model and future prospects as these entities have purchased a sizeable amount of shares at the IPO price. It is imperative for investors to scrutinize the registration statement on Form S-1 to understand the company's financials, risk factors and use of proceeds from the IPO. Market Research Analyst Centuri's position as a pure-play North American utility infrastructure services company is significant, as this sector is typically characterized by long-term contracts and stable cash flows. The market will be observing how the company utilizes the IPO proceeds to address the demands of a growing infrastructure market. Considering the underwriters' pedigree, including top-tier firms like UBS Investment Bank, BofA Securities and J.P. Morgan, the offering might be viewed as having strong institutional backing.

Financial Analyst The reported increase in EPS to $1.12 and an adjusted EPS of $1.22 indicates a robust financial performance by Crane Company, especially when deliberating on the raised full-year EPS guidance. A hike from $4.55-$4.85 to $4.75-$5.05 not only reflects confidence in the company's future earnings but also sets a positive expectation for investors who monitor such metrics closely.Core sales growth of 5% alongside core orders and backlog growth of 11% each, suggest that the company's products and services continue to be in strong demand, which could translate to sustained revenue streams. The dividend declaration further reinforces the stability and commits to shareholder returns, which is generally seen as a sign of financial health. M&A (Mergers and Acquisitions) Analyst Crane's strategic acquisition of CryoWorks for $61 million is a tactical move, potentially catalyzing its Hydrogen business within the Process Flow Technologies segment. With CryoWorks' $28 million in annual sales and $5 million in adjusted EBITDA, the buyout could be accretive to Crane's earnings.This acquisition could be an astute leap forward, facilitating vertical integration and potentially leading to improved margins due to synergies. Investors typically seek such strategic acquisitions for signs of diversification and growth potential, which it seems Crane has tactfully portrayed with this move. Market Research Analyst The nature of the Process Flow Technologies segment, particularly within the burgeoning hydrogen space, is indicative of forward-thinking alignment with green energy trends. The significance of this sector's growth cannot be understated, as increased emphasis on sustainable energy solutions drives market demand.Investors aware of the clean energy shift might view Crane's growth initiatives and subsequent acquisition as a stride towards capitalizing on a market that is anticipated to expand in the coming years. This positions Crane in a growth trajectory in alignment with global sustainability targets. 04/22/2024 - 04:15 PM First Quarter 2024 Highlights Earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $1.12 and adjusted EPS of $1.22.

STAMFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Crane Company (""Crane,"" NYSE: CR) today announced its financial results for the first quarter of 2024 and updated its full-year outlook. Max Mitchell, Crane's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated: “Crane is off to a great start in 2024, with strong results reflecting continued differentiated execution and accelerating results from growth initiatives. Core year-over-year sales growth of 5% was accompanied by continued strong orders and backlog growth, increasing our confidence in our outlook for the full year."" Mr. Mitchell added: “We are also pleased to announce that we signed an agreement to acquire CryoWorks, a leading supplier of vacuum insulated pipe systems for hydrogen and cryogenic applications which is highly synergistic with the ongoing organic development of our CRYOFLO brand. Based in Jurupa Valley, CA, CryoWorks has annual sales of approximately $28 million and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $5 million. The transaction is expected to close April 30, 2024."" Mr. Mitchell concluded: “With the first quarter of 2024 behind us, we are extremely confident about our opportunities and prospects in the quarters and years ahead. As expected and previously communicated, there are still some persistent supply chain challenges at Aerospace & Electronics, and ongoing weakness in the European Chemical markets; however, our overall outlook for the remainder of this year is improving, supported by our strong first quarter performance, and robust growth in both orders and backlog. Balancing all of these factors, we are raising our full-year adjusted EPS guidance range by $0.20 to $4.75 to $5.05.""

Additional Information Crane operated as part of Crane Holdings, Co. for the entire first quarter of 2023 prior to completion of the separation transaction on April 3, 2023.

This press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating margin, adjusted EPS, Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow, that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are an addition, and not a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income, net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. We believe that these non-GAAP measures of financial results (including on a forward-looking or projected basis) provide useful supplemental information to investors about Crane Company. Our management uses certain forward looking non-GAAP measures to evaluate projected financial and operating results. However, there are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-GAAP measures and their nearest GAAP equivalents. For example, other companies may calculate non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to calculate their financial performance, and therefore our non-GAAP measures may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of certain forward-looking and projected non-GAAP measures for post-separation Crane Company, including Adjusted EPS, and Adjusted segment margin to the closest corresponding GAAP measure are not available without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability, complexity and low visibility with respect to the charges excluded from these non-GAAP measures, which could have a potentially significant impact on our future GAAP results. For Crane Company, these forward looking and projected non-GAAP measures are calculated as follows: ""Adjusted operating margin"" is calculated as adjusted operating profit divided by sales. Adjusted operating profit is calculated as operating profit before Special Items which include transaction related expenses such as professional fees, and incremental costs related to the separation; and repositioning related (gains) charges. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures that exclude these items provide investors with an alternative metric that can assist in predicting future earnings and profitability that are complementary to GAAP metrics. ""Adjusted EPS"" is calculated as adjusted net income divided by diluted shares. Adjusted net income is calculated as net income adjusted for Special Items which include transaction related expenses such as professional fees, and incremental costs related to the separation; repositioning related (gains) charges; and, the impact of pension non-service costs. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures adjusted for these items provide investors with an alternative metric that can assist in predicting future earnings and profitability that are complementary to GAAP metrics. We believe that each of the following non-GAAP measures provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s financial conditions and operations: ""Adjusted Operating Profit"" and ""Adjusted Operating Margin"" add back to Operating Profit items which are outside of our core performance, some of which may or may not be non-recurring, and which we believe may complicate the interpretation of the Company’s underlying earnings and operational performance. These items include income and expense such as: transaction related expenses and repositioning related (gains) charges. These items are not incurred in all periods, the size of these items is difficult to predict, and none of these items are indicative of the operations of the underlying businesses. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures that exclude these items provide investors with an alternative metric that can assist in predicting future earnings and profitability that are complementary to GAAP metrics. ""Adjusted Net Income"" and ""Adjusted EPS"" exclude items which are outside of our core performance, some of which may or may not be non-recurring, and which we believe may complicate the presentation of the Company’s underlying earnings and operational performance. These measures include income and expense items that impacted Operating Profit such as: transaction related expenses and repositioning related (gains) charges. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures exclude income and expense items that impacted Net Income and Earnings per Diluted Share such as the impact of pension non-service costs. These items are not incurred in all periods, the size of these items is difficult to predict, and none of these items are indicative of the operations of the underlying businesses. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures that exclude these items provide investors with an alternative metric that can assist in predicting future earnings and profitability that are complementary to GAAP metrics. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" adds back to net income: net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, miscellaneous expense, net, and Special Items including transaction related expenses. ""Adjusted EBITDA Margin"" is calculated as adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. We believe that adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin provide investors with an alternative metric that may be a meaningful indicator of our performance and provides useful information to investors regarding our financial conditions and results of operations that is complementary to GAAP metrics. “Free Cash Flow” and “Adjusted Free Cash Flow” provide supplemental information to assist management and investors in analyzing the Company’s ability to generate liquidity from its operating activities. The measure of free cash flow does not take into consideration certain other non-discretionary cash requirements such as, for example, mandatory principal payments on the Company’s long-term debt. Free Cash Flow is calculated as cash provided by operating activities less capital spending. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is calculated as Free Cash Flow adjusted for certain cash items which we believe may complicate the interpretation of the Company’s underlying free cash flow performance such as certain transaction related cash flow items related to the separation transaction. These items are not incurred in all periods, the size of these items is difficult to predict, and none of these items are indicative of the operations of the underlying businesses. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures that exclude these items provide investors with an alternative metric that can assist in predicting future cash flows that are complementary to GAAP metrics.

Positive Net income of $8.0 million and $0.43 diluted earnings per share Return on average assets of 0.81% Net interest margin of 2.69% Stock repurchase program for up to 1 million shares of common stock Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent financial performance of RBB Bancorp, marked by a net income of $8.0 million, demonstrates a contraction when juxtaposed against the previous quarter's net income of $12.1 million. This descending trajectory, especially in terms of net income and diluted earnings per share (from $0.64 to $0.43), indicates a reduction in profitability. The Return on Average Assets (ROAA) softening from 1.20% to 0.81% and a dip in the Return on Average Common Equity (ROACE) from 9.48% to 6.30% potentially reflect tightened interest margins or increased asset sensitivity amidst a fluctuating interest rate environment. An authorized stock repurchase program and the actual repurchase of 80,285 shares for $1.5 million might suggest a management belief in undervaluation, aiming to accrete value to shareholders and bolstering the Earnings Per Share (EPS) metric in future periods. However, investors should consider the possibility of an equity dilution offset should the share repurchases not lead to a marked improvement in the company's underlying performance. Increases in both book value and tangible book value per share—minor upticks to $27.67 and $23.68, respectively—indicate a steady, if not robust, growth in shareholder equity. Nevertheless, the nuanced interplay of these metrics warrants investor scrutiny to ascertain the fundamental drivers of said growth, particularly in light of the broader economic context. Banking Industry Analyst Dissecting the net interest margin (NIM) decrease of 4 basis points to 2.69% reveals subtle pressures impacting the bank's core lending business. In a climate where interest rates are dynamic, the management's ability to maintain a relatively stable NIM is commendable, although it does hint at limited room for maneuver should external rate pressures intensify. It is essential to monitor this metric closely as it is a critical barometer for the bank's efficiency in generating income from its interest-earning assets. Of note, the inclusion of a Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) Equitable Recovery Program (ERP) award in the previous quarter's financials muddies the year-over-year comparison and must be accounted for when considering the stark contrast in profitability. The award's one-time nature accentuates the importance of evaluating core earnings power, devoid of episodic boosts, to gauge the bank's financial health. Market Strategist With the formal appointment of Lynn Hopkins as Chief Financial Officer, the stability at the executive level could bode well for investor confidence. In times of financial retrenchment or market volatility, leadership continuity, especially in the financial stewardship of a company, may serve as a beacon for cautious optimism among stakeholders. While management changes are typically less impactful on a company's stock performance in the short term, they can have enduring effects if strategic shifts follow. Given the announced stock repurchase program, market participants might interpret this as a positive signal, indicative of management's outlook on the intrinsic value of the company. However, the effectiveness of such programs ultimately hinges on the long-term execution of operational strategies and the external economic landscape. Retail investors should weigh the potential benefits of share buybacks against the broader performance trends and industry benchmarks. 04/22/2024 - 04:15 PM RBB Bancorp Announces Appointment of Lynn Hopkins as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- RBB Bancorp (NASDAQ:RBB) and its subsidiaries, Royal Business Bank (the “Bank”) and RBB Asset Management Company (“RAM”), collectively referred to herein as “the Company,” announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. First Quarter 2024 Highlights Net income totaled $8.0 million, or $0.43 diluted earnings per share. Return on average assets of 0.81%, compared to 1.20% for last quarter. Net interest margin of 2.69%, down 4 basis points, compared to 2.73% for last quarter. Return on average common equity of 6.30% and return on average tangible common equity(1) of 7.37%, down from 9.48% and 11.12% for last quarter. Board authorized a stock repurchase program for up to 1 million shares of common stock. Repurchased 80,285 shares of common stock for $1.5 million during the first quarter. Book value and tangible book value per share(1) increased to $27.67 and $23.68, up from $27.47 and $23.48 at the end of last quarter. The Company reported net income of $8.0 million, or $0.43 diluted earnings per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to net income of $12.1 million, or $0.64 diluted earnings per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. The results for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 included a Community Development Financial Institution (“CDFI”) Equitable Recovery Program (“ERP”) award of $5.0 million on a pre-tax basis. “First, I am happy to share the formal appointment of Lynn Hopkins as the Company’s Chief Financial Officer. We have sincerely appreciated her expertise since joining RBB in late 2024 with her interim title and we now look forward to her ongoing contributions as an official member of our Company’s leadership team. “Turning to our first quarter financial performance, our earnings and margins showed signs of stabilizing in the first quarter with loan balances remaining flat and our net interest margin declining just 4 basis points,” said David Morris, CEO of RBB Bancorp. “While changing expectations about the timing and size of rate cuts makes forecasting challenging, we are cautiously optimistic that margins should start to recover as deposit costs stabilize and loan yields continue to increase.” “The team has done a good job stabilizing results during a challenging period,” said Dr. James Kao, Chairman of the Company. “The Board of Directors believes we are well-positioned to succeed and enhance shareholder value over the coming quarters.” (1) Reconciliations of the non–U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) measures included at the end of this press release. Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Net interest income was $24.9 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $25.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. The $792,000 decrease in net interest income was due to higher interest expense of $755,000 and lower interest income of $37,000. The increase in interest expense was due to higher average rates paid on total interest-bearing liabilities, offset by lower average balances of total interest-bearing liabilities, including the impact of the Company’s $55 million redemption of subordinated notes in the prior quarter. Net interest margin was 2.69% for the first quarter of 2024, a decrease of four basis points from 2.73% in the fourth quarter of 2023. The decrease was due to the 16 basis point increase in the overall cost of funds exceeding the 10 basis point increase in the yield on average total interest-earning assets. The yield on average total interest-earning assets increased to 5.92% for the first quarter of 2024 compared to 5.82% for the fourth quarter of 2023 due mainly to an 11 basis point increase in the yield on average total loans to 6.07% for the first quarter of 2024 compared to 5.96% for the fourth quarter of 2023. The 16 basis point increase in the overall cost of funds was due primarily to a 24 basis point increase in the average cost of total interest-bearing deposits to 4.32% in the first quarter of 2024, offset by the positive impact of the Company’s $55 million redemption of subordinated notes during the fourth quarter of 2023. The cost of total interest-bearing deposits increased due primarily to repricing deposits as a result of the higher interest rate environment and peer bank deposit competition. In addition, while average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $7.2 million, the ratio of average noninterest-bearing deposits to average total funding sources remained unchanged from the prior quarter at 16%. Provision for Credit Losses The Company recorded no provision for credit losses for the first quarter of 2024 compared to a reversal of its provision for credit losses of $431,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023. The $0 provision for the first quarter of 2024 took into consideration factors including: lower specific reserves, changes in the loan portfolio mix, ongoing uncertainty in the economy related to inflation and outlook on market interest rates, and credit quality metrics, including higher nonperforming loans at the end of the first quarter of 2024 compared to the end of 2023. Noninterest Income Noninterest income for the first quarter of 2024 was $3.4 million, a decrease of $4.0 million from $7.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. The decrease was due primarily to the CDFI ERP award of $5.0 million on a pre-tax basis recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023 with no similar income in the first quarter of 2024. This decrease was partially offset by gain on the transfer of loans to other real estate owned (“OREO”) of $560,000 and higher net gains on the sale of OREO of $221,000 (both of which are included in “Gain/(loss) on OREO”). We also recognized higher gain on sale of loans of $196,000. Noninterest Expense Noninterest expense for the first quarter of 2024 was $17.0 million, an increase of $576,000 from $16.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. This increase was due primarily to higher salaries and employee benefits expenses of $1.1 million, partially offset by lower legal and professional fees of $411,000 and lower insurance and regulatory assessments of $140,000. The increase in salaries and benefits is attributed to the timing of taxes and benefits, which are higher in the first quarter of the year. The annualized operating expense ratio for the first quarter of 2024 was 1.72%, up from 1.63% for the fourth quarter of 2023. Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 28.8% for the first quarter of 2024 and 29.4% for the fourth quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate includes the impact of lower income housing tax credits. The effective tax rate for 2024 is estimated to be 29.5%. Balance Sheet At March 31, 2024, total assets were $3.9 billion, a $148.0 million decrease compared to December 31, 2023, and a $232.1 million decrease compared to March 31, 2023. Loan and Securities Portfolio Loans held for investment, net of deferred fees and discounts, totaled $3.0 billion as of March 31, 2024, a decrease of $4.5 million from December 31, 2023. The decrease from December 31, 2023 was primarily due to a $24.3 million decrease in single-family residential mortgages, an $8.7 million decrease in commercial and industrial loans, and a $1.4 million decrease in other loans, partially offset by a $16.6 million increase in construction and land development loans, a $10.6 million increase in commercial real estate loans, and a $2.6 million increase in Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loans. The loan to deposit ratio was 98.6% at March 31, 2024 compared to 94.2% at December 31, 2023 and 104.7% at March 31, 2023. As of March 31, 2024, available-for-sale securities totaled $335.2 million, including $288.3 million maturing in over 12 months. As of March 31, 2024, gross unrealized losses totaled $30.2 million, a $2.1 million increase due to increases in market interest rates, compared to gross unrealized losses of $28.1 million as of December 31, 2023. Deposits Total deposits were $3.0 billion as of March 31, 2024, a $146.4 million, or 4.6%, decrease compared to December 31, 2023. This decrease was due to a decrease in interest-bearing deposits as noninterest-bearing deposits remained relatively stable at $539.5 million. The decrease in interest-bearing deposits included a decrease in time deposits of $156.4 million, offset by an increase in non-maturity deposits of $10.1 million. The decrease in time deposits included a $171.9 million decrease in wholesale deposits (brokered deposits and collateralized State of California certificates of deposit). Wholesale deposits totaled $163.0 million at March 31, 2024 and $334.9 million at December 31, 2023. Credit Quality Nonperforming assets totaled $37.0 million, or 0.95% of total assets, at March 31, 2024, compared to $31.6 million, or 0.79% of total assets, at December 31, 2023. The $5.4 million increase in nonperforming assets was due to loans placed on non-accrual status of $7.7 million, consisting primarily of single-family residential mortgages, and new OREO of $1.1 million (included in “Accrued interest and other assets”), partially offset by payoffs or paydowns of $3.0 million of non-accrual loans, loans that migrated to accruing status of $257,000, and non-accrual loan charge-offs of $125,000. Special mention loans totaled $20.6 million, or 0.68% of total loans, at March 31, 2024, compared to $32.8 million, or 1.08% of total loans, at December 31, 2023. The decrease was due to upgrades to pass loans of $6.5 million, a downgrade to substandard loans of $3.9 million, and loan paydowns of $2.7 million, partially offset by additional special mention loans of $674,000. Substandard loans totaled $57.2 million, or 1.89% of total loans, at March 31, 2024, compared to $61.1 million, or 2.02% of total loans, at December 31, 2023. The $3.9 million decrease was due to loan paydowns of $11.0 million, upgrades to pass loans of $277,000, an upgrade to special mention loans of $200,000, and substandard loan charge-offs of $125,000, partially offset by a downgrade from special mention loans of $3.9 million and additional substandard loans of $3.8 million. 30-89 day delinquent loans, excluding nonperforming loans, increased $4.1 million to $21.0 million as of March 31, 2024 compared to $16.8 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in past due loans was due to $19.6 million in new delinquent loans, partially offset by $7.3 million in loans that converted to non-accrual status, $5.9 million in loans that migrated back to past due for less than 30 days, and $2.2 million in loan payoffs or paydowns. As of March 31, 2024, the allowance for credit losses totaled $42.4 million and was comprised of an allowance for loan losses of $41.7 million and a reserve for unfunded commitments of $671,000 (included in “Accrued interest and other liabilities”). This compares to the allowance for credit losses of $42.5 million comprised of an allowance for loan losses of $41.9 million and a reserve for unfunded commitments of $640,000 at December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses decreased $184,000 during the first quarter of 2024 due to net charge-offs. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans held for investment was 1.38% at March 31, 2024, unchanged from December 31, 2023. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans was 116% at March 31, 2024, a decrease from 133% at December 31, 2023. (dollars in thousands) For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 Allowance For Loan Losses Reserve for Unfunded Loan Commitments Allowance For Credit Losses Beginning balance $ 41,903 $ 640 $ 42,543 (Reversal)/provision for credit losses (31 ) 31 — Less loans charged-off (214 ) — (214 ) Recoveries on loans charged-off 30 — 30 Ending balance $ 41,688 $ 671 $ 42,359 Shareholders' Equity and Capital Actions At March 31, 2024, total shareholders' equity was $514.0 million, a $2.7 million increase compared to December 31, 2023, and a $19.2 million increase compared to March 31, 2023. The increase in shareholders' equity for the first quarter was due to net earnings of $8.0 million and $542,000 from the exercise of stock options, offset by dividends paid of $3.0 million, share repurchases totaling $1.5 million, and higher net unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities of $1.5 million. As a result, book value per share increased to $27.67 from $27.47 and tangible book value per share(1) increased to $23.68 from $23.48. On April 18, 2024, the Company announced the Board of Directors had declared a common stock cash dividend of $0.16 per share, payable on May 13, 2024 to shareholders of record on May 1, 2024. On February 29, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 956,465 shares were available as of March 31, 2024. The repurchase program permits shares to be repurchased in open market or private transactions, through block trades, and pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-8.

Auch das Netto-Betriebsergebnis stieg um 6%. Die Divisionen American Income Life und Liberty National zeigten Wachstum bei den Nettoumsätzen und Prämien im Lebensversicherungsbereich.

Total underwriting margin increased by 5% over the year-ago quarter. Net investment income saw a 10% growth compared to the previous year. Globe Life projects net operating income between $11.50 to $12.00 per diluted common share for the full year ending December 31, 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst Globe Life Inc.'s reported increase in net income to $2.67 per diluted common share, up from $2.28 in the previous year's quarter and net operating income of $2.78 per share from $2.53, reflects a robust financial performance. The reported 14% year-over-year growth in net income is particularly noteworthy as it may indicate operational efficiency and potential for sustained profitability. Furthermore, the 6% growth in net operating income, though more modest, still underscores operational strength. The differentiation between net income and net operating income is essential for investors, as the latter excludes non-operating items, offering a clearer view of the company's core business performance.When assessing Globe Life's Return on Equity (ROE), the net income ROE of 21.3% is high, signaling effective use of shareholders' equity. However, a slight decrease from the previous year's 22.9% could signal deeper trends worth monitoring. The 14.3% ROE, when AOCI is excluded, remains stable. It's important for investors to note that exclusions such as AOCI can significantly alter ROE calculations, presenting different pictures of financial health. Market Research Analyst The insurance sector is characterized by its reliance on agent-driven sales growth and Globe Life's report of a 15% increase in the average producing agent count at its American Income Life Division and a 14% at Liberty National Division could signify strategic expansions yielding results. The corresponding increases in life net sales and premiums by 17% and 7%, respectively, for American Income and a 7% increase in life premiums for Liberty National, highlight effective salesforce performance and market penetration.Furthermore, the health net sales and premiums growth reported by the Family Heritage Division, at 11% and 8% respectively, is indicative of the company's versatility and adaptability within different insurance segments. For individuals assessing market trends, the balance between life and health insurance growth is a positive indicator of diversified risk and product appeal. Investment Analyst Globe Life's excess investment income increase of 50% presents an under-discussed but critical element of an insurance company's financial health. This growth may represent strategic asset management and favorable interest rate environments. Excess investment income is a measure of the profitability of an insurer's invested premiums after accounting for the obligations owed to policyholders, thus its significant growth suggests a strengthening investment strategy. Investors could see this as an indicator of Globe Life's ability to generate income from its investments that could support dividends or reinvestment into business growth.Additionally, Globe Life Inc.'s fixed maturity portfolio demonstrated a taxable equivalent yield increase, though slight from 5.18% to 5.24%, reflecting steady investment income. Fixed maturity investments are considered a cornerstone to an insurance firm's investment portfolio due to their predictable income streams and the company's avoidance of high-risk vehicles like credit default swaps or securities lending may be viewed favorably by conservative investors. 04/22/2024 - 04:15 PM MCKINNEY, Texas, April 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Globe Life Inc.

GLOBE LIFE INC. Earnings Release—Q1 2024 (Dollar amounts in thousands, except share and per share data) (Unaudited) RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net operating income, a non-GAAP(1) financial measure, has been used consistently by Globe Life's management for many years to evaluate the operating performance of the Company, and is a measure commonly used in the life insurance industry. It differs from net income primarily because it excludes certain non-operating items such as realized investment gains and losses and certain significant and unusual items included in net income. Management believes an analysis of net operating income is important in understanding the profitability and operating trends of the Company's business. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

GAAP MEASURES Shareholders' equity, excluding AOCI, and book value per share, excluding AOCI, are non-GAAP measures that are utilized by management to view the business without the effect of changes in AOCI, which are primarily attributable to fluctuation in interest rates. Management views the business in this manner because it creates more meaningful and easily identifiable trends, as we exclude fluctuations resulting from changes in interest rates. Shareholders' equity and book value per share are the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

Financial Analyst Medpace Holdings, Inc.'s reported first-quarter financials indicate robust growth, underpinned by a 17.7% increase in revenue year-over-year. The reported backlog conversion rate of 18.2% demonstrates effective use of existing contracts, as this metric reflects the portion of the backlog that has been realized as revenue within the period. The book-to-bill ratio of 1.20x is particularly promising, as it signifies that the company is securing more new contracts than the revenue it is recognizing during the quarter, indicating potential revenue growth in upcoming periods.From an investor standpoint, the growth in GAAP net income to $102.6 million is a strong signal of profitability, especially when paired with the improvement in net income margin to 20.1% from 16.8%. An increase in EBITDA to $115.7 million further reflects operational efficiency, with the EBITDA margin expanding to 22.6%. For retail investors, these figures are indicative of a company that is successfully managing costs and scaling its operations.Looking at the balance sheet, a healthy cash and cash equivalents position of $407.0 million coupled with substantial cash flow from operations positions the company well for future investments or share repurchase programs. The provided 2024 financial guidance forecasts continued revenue growth and suggests management's confidence in the company's direction. However, investors should also be cognizant of the increase in SG&A expenses, as this could impact future net income if not managed in line with revenue growth. Market Research Analyst The clinical research organization (CRO) industry, where Medpace operates, is characterized by long-term contracts, signified by a company's backlog. Medpace's significant backlog growth to over $2.9 billion underscores its competitive positioning and demand for its services. The net new business awards figure of $615.6 million in this quarter also provides insights into the health of the industry and Medpace's growth trajectory.For the retail investor, understanding the industry dynamics is key. The CRO industry is increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies outsource more clinical trial work to manage costs and improve efficiency. Medpace's consistent performance in securing new business, as reflected in the book-to-bill ratio, suggests resilience in its market strategy against the backdrop of an industry on an upward trend.When evaluating Medpace's stock, investors should consider not only the company’s operational performance but also its strategic positioning within the CRO industry. Its performance metrics suggest an ability to capture market share and grow revenue, which could be an indicator of future stock performance. While past performance is not indicative of future results, the robust financial metrics suggest a strong outlook for Medpace in the near term. 04/22/2024 - 04:15 PM Revenue of $511.0 million in the first quarter of 2024 increased 17.7% from revenue of $434.1 million for the comparable prior-year period, representing a backlog conversion rate of 18.2%.

It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all important factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of such factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. These and other important factors discussed under the caption “Risk Factors” in Item 1A, Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and our other reports filed with the SEC could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements made in this press release. We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized. Achievement of anticipated results is subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. If known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included in this release and in our filings with the SEC. Any such forward-looking statements represent management’s estimates as of the date of this press release. While we may elect to update such forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we disclaim any obligation to do so, even if subsequent events, developments or circumstances cause our views to change. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Certain financial measures presented in this press release, such as EBITDA and EBITDA margin, are not recognized under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP. Management uses EBITDA and EBITDA margin or comparable metrics as a measurement used in evaluating our operating performance on a consistent basis, as a consideration to assess incentive compensation for our employees, for planning purposes, including the preparation of our internal annual operating budget, and to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our operational strategies. EBITDA and EBITDA margin have important limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for, analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. See the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this release for our U.S. GAAP results. Additionally, for reconciliations of EBITDA and EBITDA margin to our closest reported U.S. GAAP measures, refer to the appendix of this press release. We believe that EBITDA and EBITDA margin are useful to provide additional information to investors about certain material non-cash and non-recurring items. While we believe these financial measures are commonly used by investors to evaluate our performance and that of our competitors, because not all companies use identical calculations, this presentation of EBITDA and EBITDA margin may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be considered as an alternative to performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA is calculated as net income attributable to Medpace Holdings, Inc. before income tax expense, interest expense, net, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing EBITDA by Revenue, net for each period. Our presentation of EBITDA and EBITDA margin should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. MEDPACE HOLDINGS, INC.

Positive The company achieved impressive net sales of $530.6 million in the first quarter of 2024. Income from operations stood at $96.1 million, reflecting solid financial performance. Net income per diluted share was reported at $1.77, indicating profitability. Simpson Manufacturing Co., Inc. is recognized as an industry leader in engineered structural connectors and building solutions. Investors can refer to the Segment and Product Group Information table for detailed segment data. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported net sales of $530.6 million indicate a performance metric that shareholders often scrutinize for growth trends. However, the significance of this figure hinges on historical data and industry benchmarks. An upward trajectory in net sales suggests the company is expanding its market share or benefiting from price increases, while a downturn could signal declining demand or competitive pressures. Income from operations at $96.1 million reflects the efficiency of the company's core business activities. A high income from operations relative to net sales implies robust operational management and cost control. Conversely, a lower ratio may point to rising costs or inefficiencies that could erode profit margins over time. The net income per diluted share of $1.77 offers insight into the company's profitability and value generation for its shareholders. This measure is particularly salient for investors as it directly affects the value of their investment. An increase in this metric over previous periods could be a harbinger of strong financial health, whereas a decrease might raise concerns about the company's earnings potential. Market Research Analyst Focusing on the broader implications, Simpson Manufacturing's performance must also be contextualized within the larger economic environment and the construction sector. Factors such as housing starts, commercial construction rates and infrastructure spending can greatly influence the demand for the company's products. An understanding of these variables is vital for assessing future sales potential and the sustainability of current growth levels.Furthermore, regulatory changes affecting building codes and material standards can also sway the company's market position. Such changes could either create new opportunities or pose challenges for compliance and product adoption. Investors should keep an eye on legislation and industry standards as they evolve, as these can materially impact the company's strategic direction and financial performance. 04/22/2024 - 04:15 PM PLEASANTON, Calif., April 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Net sales of $530.6 millionIncome from operations of $96.1 millionNet income per diluted share of $1.77Simpson Manufacturing Co., Inc.

Gross margin decreased to 46.1% from 47.3%.North America gross margin decreased to 49.3% from 50.6%, primarily due to higher warehouse and freight costs, as a percentage of net sales.Europe gross margin decreased to 36.5% from 37.5%, also primarily due to higher warehouse and freight costs, as a percentage of net sales.Consolidated income from operations of $96.1 million decreased 18.8% from $118.4 million. The decrease was primarily due to higher operating expenses including: personnel costs resulting from the increase in the number of employees supporting production, engineering and sales activities; professional fees; software licenses; and Information Technology (""IT"") spending, coupled with the decrease in gross profit. Consolidated operating margin decreased to 18.1% from 22.1%.North America income from operations of $98.9 million decreased 13.5% from $114.4 million. The decrease was primarily due to increased personnel costs, travel-related expenses, advertising, promotion and tradeshow costs, software licenses and IT spending, as well as a decrease in gross profit, as noted above.Europe income from operations of $8.3 million decreased 38.7% from $13.5 million, primarily due to lower gross profit and higher personnel costs.Net income of $75.4 million, or $1.77 per diluted share of the Company's common stock, decreased 14.3% compared to net income of $88.0 million, or $2.05 per diluted share primarily from reduced income from operations, as noted above, offset by a lower effective tax rate.Adjusted EBITDA1 of $117.3 million decreased 14.4% compared to $137.0 million.Cash flow provided by operating activities increased approximately $5.6 million from $3.0 million to $8.6 million, due primarily to increases in working capital.Cash flow used in investing activities increased approximately $12.3 million from $27.0 million to $39.3 million. Capital expenditures were approximately $39.4 million compared to $19.0 million. 1 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to U.S. GAAP (""GAAP"") net income see the schedule titled ""Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA."" Management Commentary ""I am pleased with our first quarter performance in what continues to be a challenging market for new housing starts in both the U.S. and Europe,"" commented Mike Olosky, President and Chief Executive Officer of Simpson Manufacturing Co., Inc. ""Our first quarter net sales totaled $530.6 million, reflecting a modest decline year-over-year. In North America, our volumes increased 8% year-over-year with strength across all of our end markets, which was partly offset by the timing of when volume discount estimates were applied in both quarters, along with price decreases we implemented in the prior year period. In Europe, while macroeconomic challenges and lower overall construction activity continued to pressure our volumes, our gross margin remained elevated given our ongoing focus on pricing discipline and cost management."" Mr. Olosky continued, ""Our first quarter operating income margin of 18.1% reflected costs incurred to drive organic growth in the business including significant investments in people, engineering, equipment and other capabilities. For 2024, we continue to expect low single digit growth in U.S. housing starts with European housing starts below prior year. We are expanding our facilities for increased capacity and improving overall efficiencies to provide high-levels of service and customer support for an expected housing market recovery in 2025, leading to mid-single digit U.S. housing starts growth. We believe the strategic investments we are making in the business will help us accelerate our historical average performance for compounded annual growth in North America sales volumes above the market of approximately 250 basis points over the mid to long-term while also returning to top quartile profitability."" Business Outlook The Company has updated its 2024 financial outlook based on one quarter of financial information to reflect its latest expectations regarding demand trends, raw material costs and operating expenses. Based on business trends and conditions as of today, April 22, 2024, the Company's outlook for the full fiscal year ending December 31, 2024 is as follows: Operating margin is estimated to be in the range of 20.0% to 21.5%.The effective tax rate is estimated to be in the range of 24.5% to 25.5%, including both federal and state income tax rates as well as international income tax rates, and assuming no tax law changes are enacted.Capital expenditures are estimated to be approximately $185.0 million, which includes $105.0 million for the Columbus facility expansion and the new Gallatin fastener facility construction.Conference Call Details Investors, analysts and other interested parties are invited to join the Company's first quarter 2024 financial results conference call on Monday, April 22, 2024, at 5:00 pm Eastern Time (2:00 pm Pacific Time).

The company is also providing an update on progress in restoring Change Healthcare’s products and services. Based on initial targeted data sampling to date, the company has found files containing protected health information (PHI) or personally identifiable information (PII), which could cover a substantial proportion of people in America. To date, the company has not seen evidence of exfiltration of materials such as doctors’ charts or full medical histories among the data. “We know this attack has caused concern and been disruptive for consumers and providers, and we are committed to doing everything possible to help and provide support to anyone who may need it,” said Andrew Witty, chief executive officer of UnitedHealth Group. Data Assessment and Support for Impacted Individuals Given the ongoing nature and complexity of the data review, it is likely to take several months of continued analysis before enough information will be available to identify and notify impacted customers and individuals. As the company continues to work with leading industry experts to analyze data involved in this cyberattack, it is immediately providing support and robust protections, rather than waiting until the conclusion of the data review. People can visit a dedicated website at changecybersupport.com to get more information and details on these resources. A dedicated call center has been established to offer free credit monitoring and identity theft protections for two years to anyone impacted. The call center will also include trained clinicians to provide support services. Given the ongoing nature and complexity of the data review, the call center will not be able to provide any specifics on individual data impact at this time. The call center can be reached at 1-866-262-5342 and further details can be found on the website. The company, along with leading external industry experts, continues to monitor the internet and dark web to determine if data has been published. There were 22 screenshots, allegedly from exfiltrated files, some containing PHI and PII, posted for about a week on the dark web by a malicious threat actor. No further publication of PHI or PII has occurred at this time. While this comprehensive data analysis is conducted, the company is in communication with law enforcement and regulators and will provide appropriate notifications when the company can confirm the information involved. This is not an official breach notification. The company will reach out to stakeholders when there is sufficient information for notifications and will be transparent with the process. To help ease reporting obligations on other stakeholders whose data may have been compromised as part of this cyberattack, UnitedHealth Group has offered to make notifications and undertake related administrative requirements on behalf of any provider or customer. Change Healthcare Service Restoration Change Healthcare has made continued strong progress restoring services impacted by the event. We have prioritized the restoration of services that impact patient access to care or medication. Pharmacy services are now back to near-normal levels, with 99% of pre-incident pharmacies able to process claims. Medical claims across the U.S. health system are now flowing at near-normal levels as systems come back online or providers switch to other methods of submission. Change Healthcare realizes there are a small number of providers who continue to be adversely impacted and is working with them to find alternative submission solutions and will continue to provide financial support as needed. Payment processing by Change Healthcare, which represents approximately 6% of all payments in the U.S health care system, is at approximately 86% of pre-incident levels and is increasing as additional functionality is restored. Other Change Healthcare services, including eligibility software and analytical tools, are being restored on a rolling basis with the active reconnection of our customers now the priority. To date, approximately 80% of Change functionality has been restored on the major platforms and products, and the company expects full restoration of other systems to be completed in the coming weeks.

Presentations will focus on the progression of Sangamo’s neurology-focused pre-clinical pipeline, including data supporting innovations in zinc finger epigenetic regulation, advances in AAV capsid engineering, and discovery of next-generation integrase technology. “We are thrilled to be showcasing at ASGCT the strong depth of our neurology pipeline, including various applications for our zinc finger epigenetic regulation platform, exciting advances in our capsid delivery technology, and new, potentially transformative Modular Integrases (MInts), that together reflect our continued commitment to developing potential neurology genomic medicines for patients in need,” said Amy Pooler, Head of Research at Sangamo. “Potent epigenetic regulation in diseases such as prion disease and tauopathies are complemented by our exceptional AAV delivery capabilities, a combination that is essential to the development of effective potential genomic medicine treatments to treat devastating neurological conditions.” “These data showcase the deep expertise of our scientific team in engineering DNA-protein interactions and the broad potential reach of our innovative pre-clinical approaches, including exciting new discoveries for site-directed integration of large DNA sequences via engineered MInts,” said Greg Davis, Head of Technology at Sangamo. “Using compact, protein-guided integrases built from Bxb1 variants as a means of targeted integration expands our genome editing abilities and underscores our drive to develop technologies that enable potentially transformative new medicines.” Data presentations at the ASGCT Annual Meeting include three oral presentations, two of which detail Sangamo’s potent delivery capabilities developed through its AAV capsid engineering platform SIFTER, and one that will discuss a new breakthrough in programming Bxb1, a large serine recombinase, for the development of MInts to potentially enable large-scale genome engineering. These data will showcase a novel AAV capsid, STAC-BBB, that exhibited robust and widespread central nervous system transduction in cynomolgus macaques after intravenous delivery, as well as another novel AAV capsid, STAC-150, engineered to accelerate the discovery of potent and highly specific epigenetic regulators. Sangamo will also showcase data highlighting the use of MInts, derived from compact Bxb1 variants, to integrate large sequences of DNA into the genome with minimal double-stranded DNA breaks and without the need for assistance from ancillary genome editing or DNA-repair modulating cargo. Additional poster presentations at the ASGCT Annual Meeting will showcase the use of zinc finger activators and repressors for the potential treatment of neurological diseases such as prion disease, tauopathies, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A), Dravet Syndrome, SOD1-mediated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Phelan-McDermid syndrome, Parkinson’s disease, Angelman syndrome, and other CNS disorders. Sangamo will also present additional data from its AAV capsid engineering platform SIFTER and its efforts for integrase evolution and utilization.

Positive Total revenues increased by 32.1% linked-quarter annualized and 6.6% year-over-year Net income per diluted common share was $1.57 for Q1 2024, a 10.8% decrease from Q1 2023 The firm's total assets were $48.9 billion as of March 31, 2024 Pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue decreased by 2.2% compared to the previous year Capital and soundness metrics remained stable Negative Net income per diluted common share decreased by 10.8% from Q1 2023 Noninterest expense increased by 14.5% year-over-year Net charge-offs to average loans increased to 0.20% in Q1 2024 Nonperforming assets increased primarily due to downgrading of certain loans Financial Analyst An examination of Pinnacle Financial Partners' financial performance for the first quarter of 2024 reveals several nuanced elements that merit investor attention. Notably, a year-over-year decline in diluted EPS from $1.76 to $1.57 warrants further scrutiny. While top-line revenue growth appears robust at 6.6 year-over-year, this is somewhat overshadowed by the increase in the allowance for credit losses, now at 1.12 of total loans. This uptick suggests a conservative approach to risk management amid an unsettled interest rate landscape.Additionally, the bank has increased its reserve as a response to a specific borrower's heightened credit risk and the broader interest rate environment. The FDIC special assessment, which has seen a collective increase to roughly $36.3 million over two quarters, also impacts the firm's expense line, indicating heightened regulatory costs. However, the one-time recognition of a $11.8 million mortgage servicing asset offers some offset to these increased expenses.Investors should consider the implications of these factors on the bank's profitability and risk profile. The bank's proactive steps in adjusting its credit loss provisions reflect a responsive management strategy to the current economic climate, characterized by persistent inflation and a potentially prolonged period of higher interest rates. Market Research Analyst Pinnacle's business model, which includes aggressive recruitment and expansion into new markets, is reflected in the reported growth of total assets, now at $48.9 billion. The firm's strategy of hiring new revenue producers is a direct effort to stimulate loan and deposit growth, which has been effective, albeit with a slight underperformance in loan growth relative to targets for the year. The increase in core and noninterest-bearing deposits, despite a decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits year-over-year, is indicative of a strong deposit base.The bank's continued focus on commercial and industrial, as well as owner-occupied commercial real estate lending, which accounted for approximately half of the loan growth, aligns with its long-term growth strategy. This sector-specific emphasis can be advantageous as it leverages the bank’s expertise in these areas and may enhance the asset quality.From a market perspective, the bank operates in competitive Southeast markets, which have historically experienced robust growth. Thus, Pinnacle's market share gains are significant for its long-term growth projections and ability to withstand economic volatility. The bank's recognition as a top workplace may also contribute positively to its brand and ability to attract top talent, which is vital in the competitive banking industry. Risk Management Analyst The increase in the allowance for credit losses and the slightly heightened net charge-off rate to 0.20 reflect a cautiously adjusted risk posture. The firm's acknowledgement of cash flow issues in two downgraded loans within their construction and C&I portfolios suggests a proactive monitoring approach to potential vulnerabilities. Moreover, nonperforming assets have seen an uptick, yet they remain within manageable levels when compared against historical norms. It is prudent for investors to recognize the subtleties of these indicators, as they embody the dynamic risk environment confronting the banking sector.Such preemptive measures in credit loss provisioning could be seen as a safeguard against deteriorating loan quality, which is critical given the 'higher-for-longer' rate environment expressed by Pinnacle's Chief Financial Officer. While these steps may put a damper on short-term returns, they could be instrumental in maintaining long-term capital adequacy and financial stability. The bank's capital ratios remain healthy, with a robust tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio at 8.5 and a decent increase in tangible book value per common share, signifying a resilient balance sheet. 04/22/2024 - 06:22 PM Total revenues increased 32.1 percent linked-quarter annualized and 6.6 percent year-over-year NASHVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc. (Nasdaq/NGS: PNFP) reported net income per diluted common share of $1.57 for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to net income per diluted common share of $1.76 for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, a decrease of 10.8 percent. Several meaningful items impacted first quarter 2024 results. The firm’s allowance for credit losses increased to 1.12 percent of total loans at March 31, 2024, compared to 1.08 percent at Dec. 31, 2023. Although, key loan quality metrics like the potential problem loans to total loans ratio and the classified asset ratio remain better than many of the firm's peers and lower than where the firm has historically operated over the longer term, the firm determined additional reserves were needed to account for incremental weakness of one previously disclosed problem borrower and to better position the firm to navigate the credit implications of a higher-for-longer interest rate environment. Additionally, the firm recognized a mortgage servicing asset associated with its Freddie Mac Small Business Lending (SBL) platform of approximately $11.8 million, which has been reflected in other noninterest income. Lastly, in response to information provided by the FDIC during the quarter, the firm increased its other noninterest expense by $7.3 million for a FDIC special assessment. This is in addition to the $29.0 million that the company recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023. ""Inflation appears to be more difficult to tame than the Fed had predicted,"" said M. Terry Turner, Pinnacle's President and Chief Executive Officer. ""Regardless of the economic landscape, our focus continues to be on strengthening our balance sheet and growing our earnings and tangible book value, while continuing to take steps that we believe will position our firm for long-term growth. ""We continued to execute our unique business model during the first quarter. We are reporting strong core earnings inclusive of a meaningful provision for credit losses. We recruited 37 new revenue producers during the quarter, including 14 in our newer markets of Atlanta, Washington D.C., Birmingham and Jacksonville. And as another demonstration of why we are so successful in hiring the best bankers in our markets, FORTUNE and Great Place to Work® recognized our firm as No. 11 on their list of the 100 Best Companies to Work For in the United States. We have been on FORTUNE’s top 100 list for the last eight years, but this is our highest ranking, further demonstrating the staying power of our culture, even as we have become a larger, high-growth bank. ""Our firm is uniquely positioned in what we believe are many of the best banking markets in the Southeast. As a result, combined with our distinctive operating model, we remain confident in our ability to generate long-term sustainable growth in loans, deposits and earnings in spite of the current economic volatility."" BALANCE SHEET GROWTH AND LIQUIDITY: Total assets at March 31, 2024, were $48.9 billion, an increase of approximately $934.3 million from Dec. 31, 2023, and $3.8 billion from March 31, 2023, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 8.4 percent and a linked-quarter annualized increase of 7.8 percent, respectively.

Approximately 46.5 percent of first quarter 2024 loan growth was related to commercial and industrial and owner-occupied commercial real estate categories, two segments the firm intends to continue to emphasize throughout the remainder of 2024. On-balance sheet liquidity, defined as cash and cash equivalents plus unpledged securities, remained strong, totaling $7.6 billion as of March 31, 2024, representing a $646.7 million increase from the on-balance sheet liquidity level of $6.9 billion as of Dec. 31, 2023. Increased deposit inflows during the quarter contributed to the increase in other interest earning assets and are expected to be used to fund future loan growth of the firm. Noninterest bearing deposits increased 2.6 percent on a linked-quarter annualized basis as of March 31, 2024, when compared to Dec. 31, 2023. In comparison to March 31, 2023, noninterest bearing deposits decreased by 11.8 percent. The average balance of the firm’s noninterest bearing accounts was $31,353 at March 31, 2024, compared to $31,603 at Dec. 31, 2023. ""We are particularly pleased with our strong deposit growth during the first quarter, which grew $862.2 million in the quarter, a 9.0 percent linked-quarter annualized growth rate,"" Turner said. ""Importantly, our end-of-period noninterest-bearing demand deposit accounts grew 2.6 percent linked-quarter annualized after having experienced declining demand deposit volumes for several quarters. During the first quarter, our loans grew at an annualized rate of 6.0 percent, which is slightly below what we expect for all of 2024. While we are benefited by operating in several of the best banking markets in the Southeast, our loan and deposit growth is primarily a result of the market share movement associated with our ongoing hiring in those markets over the last several years."" PRE-TAX, PRE-PROVISION NET REVENUE (PPNR) GROWTH: Pre-tax, pre-provision net revenues (PPNR) for the three months ended March 31, 2024, were $185.8 million, a decrease of 2.2 percent from the $190.0 million recognized in the three months ended March 31, 2023.

Net interest income for the first quarter of 2024, was $318.0 million, compared to $317.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $312.2 million for the first quarter of 2023, a year-over-year growth rate of 1.9 percent. Net interest margin was 3.04 percent for the first quarter of 2024, compared to 3.06 percent for the fourth quarter of 2023 and 3.40 percent for the first quarter of 2023. Noninterest income for the first quarter of 2024, was $110.1 million, compared to $79.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $89.5 million for the first quarter of 2023, a year-over-year increase of 23.0 percent. Wealth management revenues, which include investment, trust and insurance services, were $26.0 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $23.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $22.5 million for the first quarter of 2023, a year-over-year increase of 15.7 percent. The increase in wealth management revenues was attributable to several factors, but primarily is the result of an increase in capacity with more revenue producers and the placement of those producers in Pinnacle’s newer markets like Washington D.C., Birmingham and others. During the first quarter of 2024, net gains from mortgage loans sold were $2.9 million, compared to $879,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $2.1 million in the first quarter of 2023. Similar to wealth management, the increase in mortgage fee income was primarily attributable to increases in capacity with more originators in Pinnacle's newer markets. Income from the firm's investment in Banker's Healthcare Group (BHG) was $16.0 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $14.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $19.1 million for the first quarter of 2023, a year-over-year decline of 16.0 percent. BHG's loan originations decreased to $692 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $786 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $1.0 billion in the first quarter of 2023. Loans sold to BHG's community bank partners were approximately $533 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to approximately $446 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $704 million in the first quarter of 2023. BHG increased its reserves for on-balance sheet loan losses to $306 million, or 10.3 percent of loans held for investment at March 31, 2024, compared to 9.3 percent at Dec. 31, 2023 and 5.2 percent at March 31, 2023. The year-over-year increase in reserves as a percentage of loans held for investment was impacted by BHG's adoption for lifetime credit losses associated with its implementation of the current expected credit loss (CECL) methodology on Oct. 1, 2023. BHG increased its accrual for estimated losses attributable to loan substitutions and prepayments to $391 million, or 5.7 percent of the unpaid loan balances that were previously purchased by BHG's community bank network, at March 31, 2024, compared to 5.4 percent, or $357 million, at Dec. 31, 2023 and 5.81 percent, or $350 million, at March 31, 2023. Other noninterest income increased $24.1 million between the first quarter of 2024 and the fourth quarter of 2023 and $17.6 million from the first quarter of 2023. Impacting other noninterest income was approximately $11.8 million associated with the aforementioned recognition of the SBL mortgage servicing asset, as well as increased income from the firm’s Bank Owned Life Insurance (BOLI) policies compared to the first quarter of 2023. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the firm incurred approximately $7.2 million in policy surrender charges and $9.1 million in tax penalties attributable to restructuring BOLI policies. The firm believes the reimbursement (""payback"") period from the date of the restructuring should approximate 18 months. Noninterest expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, was $242.4 million, compared to $251.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $211.7 million in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 14.5 percent. Salaries and employee benefits were $146.0 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $133.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $135.7 million in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 7.6 percent. Full-time equivalent associates increased to 3,386.5 at March 31, 2024 from 3,357.0 at Dec. 31, 2023 and 3,281.5 at March 31, 2023, a year-over-year increase of 3.2 percent. Incentive costs in the first quarter of 2024 were approximately $1.7 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2023 and $1.1 million higher than the amounts recorded in the first quarter of 2023. Employee benefits costs reflect the seasonality of payroll taxes, medical deductibles, and other benefits costs. Benefit costs in the first quarter of 2024 were approximately $5.5 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2023 and $898,000 higher than the amounts recorded in the first quarter of 2023. Equipment and occupancy costs were $39.6 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $38.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $30.4 million in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 30.6 percent. Impacting the quarterly changes in equipment and occupancy expense between the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 was the impact of new equipment and facilities annual rent escalators on various properties and equipment that have been placed into service. Compared to the first quarter of 2023, several factors contributed to the increase of equipment and occupancy costs, including new equipment and facilities, rent escalators on various properties and the previously disclosed sale-leaseback transaction executed in the second quarter of 2023. Noninterest expense categories, other than those specifically noted above, were $56.7 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $79.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $45.7 million in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 24.2 percent. Primarily impacting the quarterly changes in other noninterest expense between the fourth quarter of 2023 and first quarter of 2024 was the impact of a reduction in the amount of FDIC special assessment charges in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. The special assessment also impacted the comparison of other noninterest expense to the first quarter of 2023, given there was no special assessment last year. ""With the most recent CPI release, we have adjusted our forecast for Fed funds rate decreases from four to two with the first of those starting late in the third quarter of this year,” said Harold R. Carpenter, Pinnacle's Chief Financial Officer. ""Therefore, we are modifying our net interest income outlook slightly for the year. Our belief is that we will experience 8 to 10 percent growth in net interest income for this year. As to fee income, we believe the strong start in the first quarter means our core fee revenues should be higher than originally anticipated for 2024. Accordingly, excluding the impact of BHG, the recognition of the $11.8 million of mortgage servicing rights in the first quarter of this year and, in the case of 2023, the $85.7 million gain on the sale of fixed assets as a result of the sale-leaseback transaction, $19.7 million in losses on sale of investments securities and $7.2 million in BOLI restructuring charges, we believe our growth in fee revenues should approximate 10 to 14 percent in 2024 over 2023. ""We continue to estimate that BHG fee income should approximate a mid-single digit percentage increase in 2024 over the $85.4 million in 2023. BHG's first quarter was impacted by the successful completion of their ninth securitization issuance of approximately $300 million. This securitization was comprised completely of consumer loans with a yield difference between the borrower's coupon rate and the securitization borrowing rate of approximately 10.1 percent, one of the highest spreads for a securitization by BHG in its history, reflective of the significant amount of interest BHG received for the transaction. BHG's ability to access the capital markets to secure incremental funding through securitizations of its held-for-investment loan portfolio has contributed to additional flexibility for BHG to fund its operations. ""Excluding the additional FDIC special assessment in the first quarter of 2024, our operating expense was in line with our expectations. We did reduce our anticipated incentive costs for the first quarter primarily as a result of increased provision expense triggered largely by the increase in our allowance for credit losses. We currently are accruing for payout on our annual cash incentive plan at approximately 80 percent of target, less than we had originally planned. Even through all of these matters, we are maintaining our expense outlook at $950 million to $975 million for the year, exclusive of the impact of the FDIC special assessments we incurred in the first quarter and any additional assessments the FDIC may decide to impose this year."" CAPITAL AND SOUNDNESS: As of March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 March 31, 2023 Shareholders' equity to total assets 12.5 % 12.6 % 12.6 % Tangible common equity to tangible assets 8.5 % 8.6 % 8.3 % Book value per common share $ 76.23 $ 75.80 $ 71.24 Tangible book value per common share $ 51.98 $ 51.38 $ 46.75 Annualized net loan charge-offs to avg. loans (1) 0.20 % 0.17 % 0.10 % Nonperforming assets to total loans, ORE and other nonperforming assets (NPAs) 0.33 % 0.27 % 0.15 % Classified asset ratio (Pinnacle Bank) (2) 4.94 % 5.22 % 2.71 % Construction and land development loans as a percentage of total capital(3) 77.50 % 84.20 % 88.50 % Construction and land development, non-owner occupied commercial real estate and multi-family loans as a percentage of total capital(3) 258.00 % 259.00 % 261.10 % Allowance for credit losses (ACL) to total loans 1.12 % 1.08 % 1.04 % (1): Annualized net loan charge-offs to average loans ratios are computed by annualizing quarterly net loan charge-offs and dividing the result by average loans for the quarter. (2): Classified assets as a percentage of Tier 1 capital plus allowance for credit losses. (3): Calculated using the same guidelines as are used in the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council's Uniform Bank Performance Report. The allowance and provision for credit losses both increased at March 31, 2024, over Dec. 31, 2023, and March 31, 2023, to account for incremental weakness of a certain borrower as well as better position the firm to navigate the credit implications of a higher-for-longer interest rate environment. Nonperforming assets increased at March 31, 2024, over Dec. 31, 2023, and March 31, 2023, primarily as a result of downgrading of two loans, one in the Company's construction portfolio and another in its C&I portfolio, each experiencing cash flow challenges at this time. Both of the firm’s ratios associated with construction and land development and CRE loans in comparison to total capital decreased from the prior quarter. Importantly, and consistent with the firm’s target of achieving a threshold of below 70 percent, the firm’s ratio of construction and land development in relation to total capital at March 31, 2024 showed continued progress and decreased to 77.5 percent. ""Net charge-offs to average loans for the first quarter of 2024 increased during the quarter to 0.20 percent from 0.17 percent in the prior quarter,"" Carpenter said. ""We also experienced modest increases in nonperforming loans in relation to total loans and, conversely, we experienced improvement in similar ratios for past dues and potential problem loans. Net charge-offs at 0.20 percent compare favorably to longer-term historical levels, as do our ratios for nonperforming assets, past dues and potential problem loans. That said, we strive to be diligent with respect to monitoring our entire loan portfolio. A higher-for-longer rate environment coupled with stubborn inflation has required banks to maintain a higher level of caution with respect to credit. Accordingly, we now estimate net charge-offs for the firm may range between 0.20 percent and 0.25 percent of average loans for 2024. ""Also, during the quarter, we experienced an increase in book value per common share from $75.80 to $76.23, an annualized linked-quarter increase of 2.3 percent and an increase in tangible book value per common share from $51.38 at Dec. 31, 2023 to $51.98 at March 31, 2024, an annualized linked-quarter increase of 4.7 percent. As we've previously communicated, increasing our tangible book value per common share remains an important priority for our firm’s leadership.""

Non-GAAP Financial Matters This release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including, without limitation, total revenues, net income to common shareholders, earnings per diluted common share, revenue per diluted common share, PPNR, efficiency ratio, noninterest expense, noninterest income and the ratio of noninterest expense to average assets, excluding in certain instances the impact of expenses related to other real estate owned, gains or losses on sale of investment securities, gains associated with the sale-leaseback transaction completed in the second quarter of 2023, losses on the restructuring of certain BOLI contracts, charges related to the FDIC special assessment, income associated with the recognition of a mortgage servicing asset in the first quarter of 2024 and other matters for the accounting periods presented. This release may also contain certain other non-GAAP capital ratios and performance measures that exclude the impact of goodwill and core deposit intangibles associated with Pinnacle Financial's acquisitions of BNC, Avenue Bank, Magna Bank, CapitalMark Bank & Trust, Mid-America Bancshares, Inc., Cavalry Bancorp, Inc. and other acquisitions which collectively are less material to the non-GAAP measure as well as the impact of Pinnacle Financial's Series B Preferred Stock. The presentation of the non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any measure prepared in accordance with GAAP. Because non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release are not measurements determined in accordance with GAAP and are susceptible to varying calculations, these non-GAAP financial measures, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Pinnacle Financial believes that these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate making period-to-period comparisons and are meaningful indications of its operating performance. In addition, because intangible assets such as goodwill and the core deposit intangible, and the other items excluded each vary extensively from company to company, Pinnacle Financial believes that the presentation of this information allows investors to more easily compare Pinnacle Financial's results to the results of other companies. Pinnacle Financial's management utilizes this non-GAAP financial information to compare Pinnacle Financial's operating performance for 2024 versus certain periods in 2023 and to internally prepared projections.

(3) Yields realized on interest-bearing assets less the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The net interest spread calculation excludes the impact of demand deposits. Had the impact of demand deposits been included, the net interest spread for the three months ended March 31, 2024 would have been 2.91% compared to a net interest spread of 3.32% for the three months ended March 31, 2023. (4) Net interest margin is the result of annualized net interest income calculated on a tax equivalent basis divided by average interest-earning assets for the period.

PINNACLE FINANCIAL PARTNERS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA – UNAUDITED 1. Ratios are presented on an annualized basis. 2. Net interest margin is the result of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis divided by average interest earning assets. 3. Total revenue is equal to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income. 4. Efficiency ratios are calculated by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income. 5. Annualized net loan charge-offs to average loans ratios are computed by annualizing quarter-to-date net loan charge-offs and dividing the result by average loans for the quarter-to-date period. 6. Capital ratios are calculated using regulatory reporting regulations enacted for such period and are defined as follows: Equity to total assets – End of period total shareholders' equity as a percentage of end of period assets. Tangible common equity to tangible assets - End of period total shareholders' equity less end of period preferred stock, goodwill, core deposit and other intangibles as a percentage of end of period assets less end of period goodwill, core deposit and other intangibles. Leverage – Tier I capital (pursuant to risk-based capital guidelines) as a percentage of adjusted average assets. Tier I risk-based – Tier I capital (pursuant to risk-based capital guidelines) as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets. Total risk-based – Total capital (pursuant to risk-based capital guidelines) as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets. Classified asset - Classified assets as a percentage of Tier 1 capital plus allowance for credit losses. Tier I common equity to risk weighted assets - Tier 1 capital (pursuant to risk-based capital guidelines) less the amount of any preferred stock or subordinated indebtedness that is considered as a component of Tier 1 capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets. 7. Book value per common share computed by dividing total common shareholders' equity by common shares outstanding. Tangible book value per common share computed by dividing total common shareholders' equity, less goodwill, core deposit and other intangibles by common shares outstanding. 8. Amounts are included in the statement of income in ""Gains on mortgage loans sold, net"", net of commissions paid on such amounts. 9. At fair value, based on information obtained from Pinnacle's third party broker/dealer for non-FDIC insured financial products and services. 10. Core deposits include all transaction deposit accounts, money market and savings accounts and all certificates of deposit issued in a denomination of less than $250,000. The ratio noted above represents total core deposits divided by total funding, which includes total deposits, FHLB advances, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, subordinated indebtedness and all other interest-bearing liabilities. 11. Associate retention rate is computed by dividing the number of associates employed at quarter end less the number of associates that have resigned in the last 12 months by the number of associates employed at quarter end. 12. Adjusted pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue excludes the impact of ORE expenses and income, investment gains and losses on sales of securities, the impact of BOLI restructuring, the impact of the FDIC special assessment and the recognition of the mortgage servicing asset. 13. Represents investment gains (losses) on sales and impairments, net occurring as a result of gains or losses incurred as the result of a change in management's intention to sell a bond prior to the recovery of its amortized cost basis. 14. The dividend payout ratio is calculated as the sum of the annualized dividend rate for dividends paid on common shares divided by the trailing 12-months fully diluted earnings per common share as of the dividend declaration date. 15. Earnings from equity method investment includes the impact of the funding costs of the overall franchise calculated using the firm's subordinated and other borrowing rates. Income tax expense is calculated using statutory tax rates. 16. Tax effect calculated using the blended statutory rate of 25.00 percent for all periods in 2024 and 2023. For periods prior to 2023, tax effect calculated using the blended statutory rate of 26.14 percent. 17.

Financial Highlights Revenues of $2.3 million and $8.4 million for Q4 and fiscal year 2023 increased 35% and 13%, respectively, from $1.7 million and $7.5 million for Q4 and fiscal year 2022, primarily due to incremental RNG production from the completion of the Phase I RNG expansion project at GrowTEC and the commencement of the 10-year organic waste processing agreement with the City of Regina. Revenues are expected to continue to increase in future periods, relative to previous periods, following the completion and ramp up of the Fraser Valley Biogas RNG Expansion Project. Net loss of $1.8 million and $4.7 million for Q4 and fiscal year 2023 increased 16% and 15%, respectively, from $1.5 million and $4.1 million for Q4 and fiscal year 2022, primarily due to a decrease in insurance proceeds recognized for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase in finance costs mainly relating to the drawdown of the facility used to fund the Fraser Valley Biogas Expansion, partially offset by an increase in revenues, as described above, a decrease of a contingent consideration loss, and an increase in income tax recovery. Adjusted EBITDA of $nil and $0.8 million for Q4 and fiscal year 2023, respectively decreased compared to Q4 and fiscal year 2022, primarily due to a decrease in earnings at the Fraser Valley Biogas RNG facility during the construction and commissioning of the RNG expansion project and a decrease in insurance proceeds recognized for the year ended December 31, 2023, partially offset by an increase in revenues, as described above. “2023 was a pivotal year for EverGen as we were able to successfully bring the Fraser Valley Biogas project online,” says EverGen CEO, Mischa Zajtmann. “As we ramp up Fraser Valley Biogas and continue to advance our project pipeline, we have set the foundation for continued growth in 2024.” Financial and Operational Summary The following table presents EverGen’s Consolidated Financial and Operating Summary: Three months ended Year ended In thousands of Canadian Dollars Dec 31, 2023 Dec 31, 2022 Dec 31, 2023 Dec 31, 2022 FINANCIAL Revenue 2,314 1,716 8,442 7,459 Net loss (1,765) (1,526) (4,743) (4,110) Net loss per share ($), basic and diluted (0.12) (0.11) (0.32) (0.30) EBITDA (1) (705) (914) (1,720) (1,067) Adjusted EBITDA (1) (9) 274 773 1,986 Capital expenditures 2,743 3,723 17,493 10,973 Total assets 93,534 85,956 93,534 85,956 Total long-term liabilities 28,001 17,463 28,001 17,463 Cash and cash equivalents 585 8,852 585 8,852 Working capital surplus (deficit) (1) (3,558) 6,125 (3,558) 6,125 OPERATING Incoming organic feedstock (tonnes) 22,768 16,972 80,608 76,730 Organic compost and soil sales (yards) 4,763 6,575 27,066 33,972 RNG (gigajoules) 22,926 10,847 62,891 51,848 Electricity (MWh) 669 572 3,116 1,270 (1) Please refer to ""Non-GAAP Measures”.

First Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights Gross loans increased by $100.2 million, or 8.9%, to $1.23 billion as of March 31, 2024, compared to $1.13 billion at March 31, 2023, and increased by $19.4 million, or 1.6%, compared to $1.21 billion at December 31, 2023.Total deposits increased by $59.7 million, or 4.4%, to $1.42 billion as of March 31, 2024, compared with $1.36 billion a year earlier, and decreased by $19.8 million, or 1.4%, from $1.44 billion as of December 31, 2023. Noninterest-bearing deposits were $612.9 million and represent 43.3% of total deposits at March 31, 2024.The allowance for credit losses (""ACL"") as a percentage of gross loans increased from 1.47% at March 31, 2023, to 1.54% at March 31, 2024.Credit quality remains strong with nonaccrual loans representing 0.06% of total gross loans at March 31, 2024, up from 0.00% as of March 31, 2023.The Community Bank Leverage Ratio for the Bank as of March 31, 2024, was 11.59%, compared to 10.70% at March 31, 2023.Net Income Available to Common Shareholders Net income available to common shareholders for the first quarter of 2024 was $7.3 million, or $2.90 per diluted common share, compared with $7.8 million, or $3.09 per diluted common share, for the linked quarter ended December 31, 2023. Net income available to common shareholders was $7.0 million, or $2.79 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2023. Net income available to common shareholders decreased $0.4 million, or 5.6%, compared to the linked quarter, and increased $0.3 million, or 4.5%, compared to the same prior year period. Notable variances comparing to the linked quarter include decreases in net interest income, increased non-interest expense, and increased provision for credit losses, which were partially offset by decreased provision for income taxes and increased non-interest income. Compared to the first quarter of 2023, net interest income and non-interest income increased, which were partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense, an increase in the provision for income taxes, and an increase in the provision for credit losses. Net Interest Income Net interest income was $17.7 million, or 4.54%, of average earning assets (""net interest margin""), for the first quarter of 2024, compared with $16.8 million, or a net interest margin of 4.78%, for the same period a year earlier, and $17.8 million, or a net interest margin of 4.58%, for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. Net interest income increased by $0.9 million, or 5.4%, compared to the same prior year period driven by growth in the Company's total earning assets along with a significant increase in yields on earning assets. Loan interest income and fee accretion from the first quarter of 2023 to the current quarter increased by $3.6 million. In addition to the increase in loan interest income, the Company also experienced increased interest income from interest earning deposits in other banks and investment securities of $0.6 million and $0.4 million, respectively. Offsetting these increases, interest expense for the current quarter increased $3.7 million, compared to the same prior year period, primarily due to a $3.6 million increase in interest expense on deposits. Net interest income decreased for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to the linked quarter by $0.1 million, or 0.7%, due primarily to increased interest expense on deposits which outpaced increased interest income. Interest expense on deposits increased $0.6 million, for the current quarter, compared to the linked quarter, due to increased costs on interest bearing deposits and higher average balances. Interest income increased $0.5 million, for the current quarter, compared to the linked quarter, primarily due to a shift in the earning asset mix to higher yielding loans, increased yields on loans, and growth in average quarterly loan balances. The net interest margin was 4.54% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to 4.78% for the same prior year period, and 4.58% for the linked quarter ended December 31, 2023. Asset yields have increased 67 basis points, but the cost of funds has risen 96 basis points leading to the year-over-year 24 basis point decline in the quarterly net interest margin. Average interest-bearing liabilities have grown $183.3 million outpacing the growth in average interest-earning assets of $136.5 million, when compared to the same prior year period. It is worth noting that the significant rise in the Company's cost of funds was expected given we remain in a ""higher for longer"" rate environment with increased competition and non-interest bearing deposits shifting into interest bearing accounts; however, comparing to a peer group consisting of all California Commercial Banks from S&P Capital IQ as of December 31, 2023, Mission's cost of funds had risen 36% less than the group average of 132 basis points, while still achieving annual deposit growth of 7.3% for 2023. The yield on loans, investment securities, and interest earning deposits in other banks have increased by 56 basis points to 6.44%, 86 basis points to 4.36%, and 88 basis points to 5.31%, respectively. Additionally, average balances on loans increased $122.0 million, or 11.3%, average balances on investment securities declined $14.9 million, or 5.9%, and average balances on interest bearing deposits in other banks increased $27.8 million, or 34.2%, when compared to the same prior year period. The 4 basis point decrease in the net interest margin for the first quarter of 2024, compared to the linked quarter is primarily attributable to both higher average balances and costs of interest-bearing liabilities. The Company's yields on earning assets increased 13 basis points since the fourth quarter, average interest-bearing liabilities balances and costs increased by $25.0 million and 24 basis points, respectively, which led to net interest margin compression during the quarter. The average balances on loans increased $31.0 million, average investment securities increased $3.9 million, while average interest earning deposits in other banks decreased by $15.4 million during the quarter. The cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 25 basis points to 2.65% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to the linked quarter ended December 31, 2023, and 155 basis points, compared to the same prior year period. In the third quarter of 2023 the Company entered into two pay-fixed, receive floating, interest rate swap contracts with notional balances totaling $108.0 million, to hedge future interest rate increases. These swap contracts consist of a $50.0 million hedge on the commercial real estate loan portfolio with a three-year maturity and a $58.0 million hedge on the municipal investment security portfolio with a five-year maturity. For the quarter ending on March 31, 2024, the interest rate swap contract associated with the loan portfolio generated an additional $0.1 million in loan interest income and added 5 basis points to the yield on loans, compared to $0.2 million and 5 basis points for the linked quarter, respectively. The interest rate swap contract on the investment securities portfolio added $0.2 million in investment securities interest income and added 38 basis points to the yield on investment securities, compared to $0.2 million and 42 basis points for the prior quarter ended December 31, 2023, respectively. Combined, the interest rate swap contracts generated $0.4 million of additional interest income and 10 basis points of additional earning asset yield during the quarter ended March 31, 2024. Provision for Credit Losses A $0.7 million provision for credit losses was recorded for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to $0.3 million for the linked-quarter and $0.6 million for the same period a year ago. The Company's quarterly credit loss provisions over the past year have been recorded primarily to account for growth in the loan portfolio and changes in macro-economic conditions which impact the calculated ACL under the current expected credit loss (""CECL"") model, rather than in response to changing conditions in the Company's loan portfolio, which have remained stable, demonstrating a low credit risk profile during the past twelve months. Non-Interest Income Non-interest income for the first quarter of 2024 was $1.6 million, compared to $1.3 million for the linked quarter, and $1.2 million for the same period a year earlier. The increase in non-interest income when compared to the linked quarter is primarily attributable to a decrease in loss on sale of securities associated with a $0.4 million loss recorded in the linked quarter and increase in SBA servicing fees and gain on sale of loans, which were partially offset by decreased service charges, fees, and other income. The increase in non-interest income when compared to the same period a year earlier was primarily due to a decrease in loss on sale of securities associated with a $0.3 million loss recorded in the same prior year period, and increase in SBA servicing fees and gain on sale of loans, which was partially offset by a decrease in gain on sale of premises and equipment associated with a gain recorded in the same prior year period. Non-Interest Expense Non-interest expense increased by $0.5 million, or 6.4%, to $8.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to $8.0 million for the linked quarter, and increased by $0.7 million, or 9.0%, compared to $7.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. The increase in non-interest expense for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the linked quarter was primarily due to a $0.9 million increase in salaries and benefits expense, partially offset by a $0.3 million decrease in professional services expense. The increase in salaries and benefits expense was primarily the result of estimated employee incentive compensation accruals and payroll taxes. The decrease in professional services expense was primarily due to decreased legal expenses and other professional services. The increase in non-interest expense for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023 was primarily due to a $0.6 million increase in salaries and benefits expense associated with increased base compensation expense, payroll taxes, and estimated employee incentive compensation accruals. Operating Efficiency The Company's operating efficiency ratio increased to 44.0% for the first quarter of 2024, compared to 43.3% for the first quarter of 2023, and increased from 41.7% compared to the linked quarter. Total non-interest expense as a percentage of average assets, another measure of the Company's efficiency, was 2.07% for the first quarter of 2024, compared to 2.09% for the first quarter of 2023, and 1.94% for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $2.8 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $2.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, and $3.1 million for the linked quarter ended December 31, 2023. The Company's effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2024 was 27.5%, compared to 27.2% for the same period a year ago, and 28.8% for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. Asset and Equity Returns The return on average equity for the first quarter of 2024 was 18.3%, down from 22.3% for the same prior year period, and down from 20.9% for the linked quarter. The quarterly return on average assets for the first quarter of 2024 was 1.79%, declining from 1.89% for both the same prior year period, and the linked quarter. The decline in quarterly returns on both average equity and average assets for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to the first quarter of 2023, is primarily attributable to the 25.8% growth in average equity and the 8.9% growth in average assets, which outpaced the 4.5% increase in quarterly net income. The decrease in quarterly returns on both average equity and average assets for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to the linked quarter, is primarily attributable the 5.6% decrease in net income. Balance Sheet Total assets increased by $92.6 million, or 6.0%, to $1.64 billion at March 31, 2024, compared to March 31, 2023, and decreased by $11.8 million, or 0.7%, compared to December 31, 2023. Cash and cash equivalents increased by $2.9 million, or 1.6%, to $119.0 million at March 31, 2024, compared to the same prior year period, and decreased by $30.8 million, or 20.5%, compared to December 31, 2023. The nominal increase in the Company's cash position over the last year is primarily the result of deposit growth, earnings, and bond portfolio repayment and amortization, which narrowly outpaced loan portfolio growth. The decrease in the Company's cash position over the past quarter is primarily due to loan growth, which outpaced deposit growth for the quarter. Investment securities decreased by $18.7 million or 7.2%, to $240.4 million at March 31, 2024, compared to $259.1 million at March 31, 2023, and decreased by $2.3 million, or 0.9%, compared to $242.7 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease in the investment securities portfolio over the past year is attributable to repayments and amortization of the bond portfolio to supplement significant lending demand. The decrease in the investment securities portfolio during the first quarter of 2024, compared to the linked quarter is primarily attributable to bond portfolio repayments and amortization. Loans increased by $100.2 million, or 8.9%, to $1.23 billion at March 31, 2024, compared to March 31, 2023, and increased by $19.4 million, or 1.6%, compared to December 31, 2023. Loan growth during the last year has been diversified across the portfolio, with notable growth primarily concentrated in owner and non-owner occupied commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, and agricultural production segments of the loan portfolio, which were partially offset by the contraction in construction and land development loans. Loan growth during the last quarter has been primarily concentrated in owner and non-owner occupied commercial real estate and commercial and industrial segments of the loan portfolio, which were partially offset by a decrease in agricultural production loans. Total deposits increased by $59.7 million, or 4.4%, to $1.42 billion as of March 31, 2024, from $1.36 billion as of March 31, 2023, and decreased by $19.8 million, or 1.4%, from $1.44 billion at December 31, 2023. Noninterest-bearing deposits decreased by $78.8 million, or 11.4%, during the last year, and by $32.4 million, or 5.0%, since December 31, 2023. The decrease in noninterest bearing deposits experienced over the last year is attributable to both cash utilization by business customers as well as the migration of funds in search of higher yields. Noninterest-bearing deposits represented 43.25% of total deposits on March 31, 2024. Total shareholders' equity was $165.1 million at March 31, 2024, an increase of $33.3 million, or 25.2%, compared to March 31, 2023, and an increase of $8.3 million, or 5.3%, compared to December 31, 2023, due primarily to quarterly earnings, net of changes in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. The accumulated other comprehensive loss component of equity decreased $0.2 million during the past quarter due to a $0.8 million increase in the accumulated other comprehensive gain associated with the interest rate swap contract which is a hedge on interest rates of the investment securities portfolio, partially offset by a $0.6 million decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive loss on the investment securities portfolio. The accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased by $0.8 million during the past year resulting from an increase in the fair market value of the interest rate swap contract on the investment securities portfolio, and to a lesser extent, an increase in the fair market value of our securities portfolio, attributable to interest rates and not related to credit quality. Nonperforming assets were $0.7 million at Mach 31, 2024, up from $0.4 million at December 31, 2023, and up from $0.1 million at March 31, 2023. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets were 0.04% at March 31, 2024, up from 0.02% at December 31, 2023, and up from 0.00% at March 31, 2023. Non-accrual loans currently recorded have been fully reserved for, in line with Management's prudent credit management standards. Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses (""ACL"") as a percentage of gross loans increased to 1.54% at March 31, 2024, from 1.50% at December 31, 2023, and from 1.47% at March 31, 2023. The rise in our ACL as a percentage of gross loans over the last twelve months is a result of prudent management amid ongoing economic uncertainties stemming from sustained inflationary pressures and elevated interest rates. The increase illustrates Management's proactive approach to risk management and ensures resilience in dynamic market conditions. Regulatory Capital The Bank's reported regulatory capital ratio exceeded the ratio generally required to be considered a ""well capitalized"" financial institution for regulatory purposes. The Community Bank Leverage Ratio for the Bank was 11.59%, at March 31, 2024, compared with the requirement of 9.00% to generally be considered a ""well capitalized"" financial institution for regulatory purposes. The Bank's Community Bank Leverage ratio has increased by 89 basis points from 10.70%, and increased by 26 basis points from 11.33%, as of the periods ended March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2023, respectively. Strong earnings over the past year and quarter outpaced the growth in average assets, resulting in an increase in regulatory capital ratios.

The company completed a business combination with Arrowroot Acquisition Corp. and began trading as a public company under the ticker 'AILE'. Recent business highlights include strong customer and partner growth, reaching 4.4 million licensed users, and appointing new members to its Board of Directors. Negative None. Financial Analyst Observing iLearningEngines' recent financial report, the 39% year-over-year growth in Q4 revenue to $116 million and a full year increase of 36% reaching $421 million indicate considerable top-line expansion. This is a robust signal of the company's ability to scale its operations and increase its market share. Moreover, a 43% increase in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) suggests a strong, predictable cash flow and a solid customer base. This is critical as ARR is a telling metric for the health and potential longevity of a subscription-based company. However, investors should consider the context of a net loss of $4 million reported both for the fourth quarter and the full year. While this figure is not uncommon for growth-stage tech companies reinvesting in expansion, it bears watching how this investment translates to bottom-line improvement in the future. Furthermore, the expansion of Adjusted EBITDA margin by 240 basis points in Q4 reflects operational efficiency improvements. Yet, given that Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure, investors would benefit from also considering GAAP-based margins for a holistic view of profitability. Tech Industry Analyst With iLearningEngines' focus on AI-powered learning automation, the increase to more than 4.4 million licensed users underscores a significant uptrend in user adoption. In tech, especially platforms driven by network effects and data, this user growth can lead to improved algorithms and more robust datasets, augmenting the product's value proposition. Investment in R&D is indicative of iLearningEngines' commitment to maintaining a competitive edge in the fast-evolving AI sector. Their intent to productize institutional knowledge could be transformative in client industries, given AI's leverage in data analysis and decision-making processes. The strategic addition of three new value-added resellers (VARs) is also key, as it can amplify market penetration and distribution capabilities without a proportional increase in marketing costs. Market Research Analyst The company's recent business combination with Arrowroot Acquisition Corp and subsequent public listing could serve as a platform to enhance visibility and attract further capital. Yet, new investors should be aware that post-IPO periods can be volatile, as market sentiment adjusts to the new influx of available shares and the company's performance against public market expectations. Additionally, the appointment of new board members often brings diverse expertise, which might aid in steering the company through its next growth phase. However, the effectiveness of these appointments and the strategic decisions that follow will be pivotal. For retail investors, keeping an eye on whether the company's investments in expansion align with increased market share and profitability remains crucial. 04/22/2024 - 04:30 PM Fourth quarter revenue grew 39% year-over-year to $116 million Posts record full year revenue of $421 million, up 36% year-over-year, and ARR growth accelerates to 43% year-over-year BETHESDA, Md., April 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- iLearningEngines, Inc.

ARR is useful for assessing the performance of the Company’s recurring maintenance and support revenue base and identifying trends affecting the Company’s business. ARR mitigates fluctuations due to seasonality, contract term, sales mix, and revenue recognition timing resulting from revenue recognition methodologies under GAAP. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue as it is an operating measure and is not intended to be combined with or to replace GAAP revenue.(b) “NDR” or “Net Dollar Retention” means an operational performance measure that is used to assess client retention and its dollar impact on business. NDR is defined as the ARR in dollars generated in the current period by clients that existed in the prior comparable period divided by the ARR in dollars by those same clients in the prior period. NDR illustrates the impact of upgrades, downgrades, and cancellations in the current period on the existing client base. Since NDR does not factor in revenue from clients acquired in the current period and includes any churn from existing contracted customers, it is believed that it is an accurate measure of client retention. For the avoidance of doubt, NDR does not exclude prior year contracted customers that were not retained in the current year. NDR is calculated as the dollar value of recurring revenue from existing clients at the end of the prior period, plus the current period’s dollar impact of upsells or cross-sells from the prior period’s existing clients, minus the current period’s dollar impact of churn or downgrades from the prior period’s existing clients, divided by prior period recurring revenues from existing clients.The dollar impact of upsells or cross-sells is calculated as the sum of incremental recurring revenue between the end of the prior period and the end of the current period from the prior period’s existing clients that expanded usage of our products resulting in incremental recurring revenues earned in the current period.The dollar impact of churn or downgrades is calculated as the difference in recurring revenue between the end of the prior period and the end of the current period from the prior period’s existing clients that have decreased in usage or are no longer revenue contributing customers.

These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this press release, and on the current expectations of the iLearningEngines’ management and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as and must not be relied on by an investor as a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction, or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions this press release relies on. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of iLearningEngines. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political, and legal conditions; iLearningEngines’ failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the Business Combination; risks related to the rollout of iLearningEngines’ business and the timing of expected business milestones; iLearningEngines’ dependence on a limited number of customers and partners; iLearningEngines’ ability to obtain sufficient financing to pay its expenses incurred in connection with the closing of the business combination; the ability of iLearningEngines to issue equity or equity-linked securities or obtain debt financing in the future; risks related to iLearningEngines' need for substantial additional financing to implement its operating plans, which financing it may be unable to obtain, or unable to obtain on acceptable terms; iLearningEngines’ ability to maintain the listing of its securities on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange; the risk that the Business Combination disrupts current plans and operations of iLearningEngines; the effects of competition on iLearningEngines future business and the ability of iLearningEngines to grow and manage growth profitably, maintain relationships with customers and suppliers and retain its management and key employees; risks related to political and macroeconomic uncertainty; the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against iLearningEngines or any of their respective directors or officers, including litigation related to the Business Combination; the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on any of the foregoing risks; and those factors discussed in the Company’s registration statement on Form S-4, as amended or supplemented, under the heading “Risk Factors,” and other documents the Company has filed, or will file, with the SEC.

Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), this press release also contains adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. The Company believes these measures provide investors and management with supplemental information relating to operating performance and trends that facilitate comparisons between periods. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated net (loss) income plus: (1) interest, (2) taxes, (3) depreciation and amortization, (4) stock-based compensation and other stock-settled obligations; (5) goodwill, long-lived assets and intangible asset impairments; (6) legal reserves and settlements; (7) restructuring and other related reorganization costs; and (8) non-recurring expenses and income. Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure that the Company uses to assess its operating performance and the operating leverage within its business. The Company monitors Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP financial measure to supplement the financial information it presents in accordance with GAAP to provide investors with additional information regarding its financial results. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. The Company believes the use of non-GAAP financial measures helps indicate underlying trends in the Company’s business and are important in comparing current results with prior period results and understanding projected operating performance. Non-GAAP financial measures provide the Company and its investors with an indication of the Company’s baseline performance before items that are considered by the Company not to be reflective of the Company’s ongoing results. See the attached reconciliation tables for details of the amounts excluded and included to arrive at certain of the non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, from time to time in the future there may be other items that the Company may exclude for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures; and the Company may in the future cease to exclude items that it has historically excluded for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures. Likewise, the Company may determine to modify the nature of its adjustments to arrive at its non-GAAP financial measures. The Company strongly encourages investors to review its consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and cautions investors that the non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.

Cidara Therapeutics, Inc. a rapporté les résultats financiers pour le quatrième trimestre et l'année complète 2023, soulignant les principales réalisations de leur plateforme Cloudbreak® et du programme REZZAYO®, y compris les approbations dans l'UE et au Royaume-Uni. L'entreprise a présenté de nouvelles données lors de diverses réunions médicales et a terminé l'inscription d'essai de phase 3 en Chine. Les revenus ont augmenté, les réserves de trésorerie ont augmenté et les pertes nettes ont diminué par rapport à l'année précédente. Cidara Therapeutics, Inc. berichtete über die Finanzergebnisse für das vierte Quartal und das gesamte Jahr 2023, indem wichtige Erfolge auf ihrer Cloudbreak®-Plattform und dem REZZAYO®-Programm, einschließlich Zulassungen in der EU und Großbritannien, hervorgehoben wurden. Das Unternehmen stellte neue Daten bei verschiedenen medizinischen Treffen vor und schloss die Patientenanwerbung für eine Phase-3-Studie in China ab. Der Umsatz stieg, die Bargeldreserven wuchsen und der Nettoverlust ging im Vergleich zum Vorjahr zurück. Positive Revenue increased to $17.6 million for Q4 and $63.9 million for full year 2023. REZZAYO was approved in the EU and UK for invasive candidiasis, earning milestone payments of $11.1 million and $2.8 million.

Decrease in research and development expenses compared to the previous year. Decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses compared to the previous year. Financial Analyst Reviewing the financial performance of Cidara Therapeutics, the reported increase in revenue during the fourth quarter from $10.2 million in 2022 to $17.6 million in 2023 is noteworthy, reflecting a robust 73% year-over-year growth. This growth is attributed to milestone payments and ongoing R&D services. Notably, the full year revenue saw a slight decrease from $64.4 million to $63.9 million, likely due to the prior year's transfer of an IP license generating a substantial one-time revenue. The cash position improved marginally from $32.7 million to $35.8 million. In terms of operational expenses, the reduced R&D spend from $77.4 million to $68.5 million, alongside the drop in SG&A expenses from $20.5 million to $18.3 million, contributed to a narrower net loss shrinking from $33.6 million to $22.9 million. This suggests improved operational efficiency and cost management. The restatement of the financials due to an issue with indirect taxes suggests administrative oversight, potentially raising concerns over internal controls, though the impact appears to be corrected without significant material effect on the reported results. Biotechnology Market Analyst Cidara's recent approval of REZZAYO in the EU and UK aligns with the global trend of biotech firms expanding their market footprint through international regulatory achievements. The milestone payments from these approvals, approximately $11.1 million and $2.8 million respectively, provide not just an immediate financial boost but also pave the way for future royalty income. Moreover, the complete enrollment in the Phase 3 ReSTORE trial in China signals Cidara's commitment to tap into the Asian market, a strategic move considering the region's growing pharmaceutical market demand. The development of their Cloudbreak® DFC platform, particularly the IND filing for CBO421, represents an advancement in novel cancer therapies that could position Cidara at the forefront of oncological innovation. Their diversified pipeline, spanning from influenza to cancer, is important for long-term sustainability in an industry where pipeline diversity correlates strongly with resilience to market fluctuations. Medical Research Analyst Focusing on the clinical implications, Cidara's strides in drug development, especially the Cloudbreak® platform, are of significant interest. The CD388 influenza program partnered with Janssen and the anticipation around the IND filing for CBO421 demonstrate Cidara's innovative approach towards unmet medical needs. The approval of REZZAYO for invasive candidiasis in the EU and UK, coupled with the completion of the Phase 3 ReSTORE trial in China, illustrate the company's commitment to addressing global infectious disease challenges. These developments are important for both patients requiring new treatment options and investors looking for companies with potential for market expansion. As a novel antifungal, REZZAYO's progress will be closely watched for its potential impact on patient outcomes and healthcare cost savings over existing treatments. 04/22/2024 - 05:10 PM SAN DIEGO, April 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.

Research and development expenses were $14.7 million and $68.5 million for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, compared to $20.1 million and $77.4 million for the same periods in 2022. The decrease in research and development expenses for the full year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the full year ended December 31, 2022 is primarily due to lower clinical expenses associated with the rezafungin clinical trials and lower consulting and personnel costs, offset by higher clinical expenses associated with our Cloudbreak platform. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $5.4 million and $18.3 million for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, compared to $3.6 million and $20.5 million for the same periods in 2022. The decrease in SG&A expenses for the full year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the full year ended December 31, 2022 is primarily due to lower consulting, personnel and legal costs, and lower amortization of contract costs related to obtaining the Melinta License Agreement, offset by higher selling expenses related to REZZAYO. Net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was $3.2 million, compared to a net loss of $13.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Net loss for the full year ended December 31, 2023 was $22.9 million, compared to a net loss of $33.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Yield on net loans, loans held for sale, and leases excluding accretion, was 6.46% for the first quarter of 2024, up 3 basis points from 6.43% for the fourth quarter of 2023.

Total deposits were $38.1 billion as of March 31, 2024, a decline of $376.9 million from the prior quarter. The decline included a $262.8 million reduction in brokered deposits as the Company continues to reduce its use of brokered deposits. Total public fund balances declined $874.0 million from the linked quarter to $4.8 billion at March 31, 2024, reflecting seasonal volatility in these balances. Importantly, core customer deposits, which excludes brokered deposits and public funds, reflected organic growth of approximately $400.0 million compared to December 31, 2023.

Cash, due from balances and deposits at the Federal Reserve declined $1.2 billion to $3.0 billion at March 31, 2024, as the Company continued to reinvest in securities, reduce reliance on brokered deposits and fund loan growth. Additionally, the Company refinanced the $3.5 billion bank term funding program borrowing early in the first quarter, lowering the cost from 4.84% at December 31, 2023 to 4.76% at March 31, 2024.

The linked quarter increase in adjusted noninterest revenue(1) was driven primarily by growth in mortgage banking revenue, as well as deposit service revenue.

These changes are expected to result in a reduction in revenue of approximately $3 million per year and are fully reflected in the first quarter 2024 run rate. Other noninterest revenue was $24.0 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared with $29.8 million for the first quarter of 2023 and $27.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. The decline compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 was driven by a number of smaller variances including declines in death benefits on bank-owned life insurance, payroll processing revenue, and equity investment valuations. Mortgage production and servicing revenue totaled $6.5 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared with $8.4 million for the first quarter of 2023 and $3.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. The net MSR valuation adjustment was insignificant for the first quarter of 2024, compared with a negative $2.3 million for the first quarter of 2023 and a negative $5.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. Mortgage origination volume for the first quarter of 2024 was $437.2 million, compared with $454.2 million for the first quarter of 2023 and $434.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. Noninterest Expense Noninterest expense for the first quarter of 2024 was $263.2 million, compared with $284.6 million for the first quarter of 2023 and $329.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. Adjusted noninterest expense(1) for the first quarter of 2024 was $263.5 million, compared with $270.4 million for the first quarter of 2023 and $269.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. The adjusted efficiency ratio(1) was 60.1% for the first quarter of 2024, meaningfully improved from 66.0% for the fourth quarter of 2023 and 61.3% for the first quarter of 2023. The $6.2 million, or 2.3%, linked quarter decline in adjusted noninterest expense(1) was driven by declines in data processing and software expense as well as other noninterest expense, partially offset by a seasonal increase in salaries and employee benefits. Salaries and employee benefits increased $8.6 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 with nearly half of the increase as a result of seasonal increases in payroll tax expense resulting from the annual FICA reset and 401(k) expense related to annual incentive compensation payouts. Additionally, certain other incentive based accruals increased as a result of strong operating performance. Data processing and software expense declined $2.9 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily as a result of certain seasonal and volume related factors as well as timing. Other noninterest expense declined $11.4 million on an adjusted basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. This decline included decreases in a number of expense items including legal fees, advertising and public relations, contributions and operational losses. Capital Management Total shareholders' equity was $5.2 billion at March 31, 2024 compared with $4.5 billion at March 31, 2023 and $5.2 billion at December 31, 2023. Estimated regulatory capital ratios at March 31, 2024 included Common Equity Tier 1 capital of 11.7%, Tier 1 capital of 12.1%, Total risk-based capital of 14.5%, and Tier 1 leverage capital of 9.5%. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company repurchased 657,593 shares of common stock under its 10 million share authorization for 2024. Outstanding common shares were 182.7 million as of March 31, 2024. Summary Rollins concluded, ""I'm excited to see the hard work of teammates across our organization bear fruit in the financial results we've reported this quarter. Our efforts to improve our balance sheet profile, improve operating efficiency, and produce disciplined growth have contributed to meaningful improvement in virtually all of our key performance metrics. We've also been able to maintain stable credit quality metrics and a strong capital base. I'm encouraged by this momentum as we look to the remainder of the year and beyond."" Key Transactions Effective November 30, 2023, the Company completed the sale of its insurance subsidiary, Cadence Insurance, to Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. for approximately $904 million, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. The Transaction resulted in net capital creation of approximately $620 million, including a net gain on sale of approximately $520 million. The gain along with Cadence Insurance's historical financial results for periods prior to the divestiture have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations. Additionally, current and prior period adjusted earnings exclude the impact of discontinued operations. The purchase price and related gain remain subject to additional adjustments in accordance with the purchase agreement.

utilizing certain financial measures not calculated in accordance with GAAP, including adjusted income from continuing operations, adjusted income from continuing operations available to common shareholders, pre-tax pre-provision net revenue from continuing operations, adjusted pre-tax pre-provision net revenue from continuing operations, total adjusted noninterest revenue, total adjusted noninterest expense, tangible common shareholders' equity to tangible assets, total shareholders' equity (excluding AOCI), common shareholders' equity (excluding AOCI), tangible common shareholders' equity to tangible assets (excluding AOCI), return on average tangible common equity from continuing operations, return on average tangible common equity, adjusted return on average tangible common equity from continuing operations, adjusted return on average tangible common equity, adjusted return on average assets from continuing operations, adjusted return on average assets, adjusted return

equivalent), adjusted efficiency ratio (tax equivalent), dividend payout ratio from continuing operations, and adjusted dividend payout ratio from continuing operations. The Company has included these non-GAAP financial measures in this release for the applicable periods presented. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures: (i) provides important supplemental information that contributes to a proper understanding of the Company's capital position and adjusted performance, (ii) enables a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company's business and (iii) allows investors to evaluate the Company's performance in a manner similar to management, the financial services industry, bank stock analysts and bank regulators. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are presented in the tables below. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as substitutes for GAAP financial measures, and the Company strongly encourages investors to review the GAAP financial measures included in this news release and not to place undue reliance upon any single financial measure. In addition, because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this news release with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names.

Net loss attributed to increased withholding tax and one-off dividends. Management change with CFO resignation due to personal reasons. Financial Analyst Lufax's report indicates a substantial 31% decline in total income and a shift from a net profit to a net loss. This shift is significant and suggests that investors should consider the reasons behind these changes, such as the decrease in new loan sales and loan balances. The reduction in marketing expenses could be a double-edged sword; cost-saving in the short term but potentially limiting growth if it affects the company's ability to attract new customers.Investors should also be aware of the increased risk exposure, with the company now bearing risk on 100% of new loans enabled. This approach can increase potential returns but also heightens the risk of credit losses.With credit impairment losses decreasing by 8.6%, the company's approach to credit risk management appears to be yielding results. However, investors should closely monitor this along with the DPD 90+ delinquency rate, which has increased slightly. Market Research Analyst The shift in Lufax's strategy towards consumer finance products and the use of a 100% guarantee model are pivotal. With 42% of new loan sales in consumer finance, a significant market movement is noted. Although it's a strategy to diversify and possibly reduce risk exposure, it's also an attempt to capture a different segment of the lending market, which may show adaptability and an innovative response to market conditions.Moreover, the take rate improvement from 7.3% to 9.0% is a positive indicator of the company's ability to monetize its lending activities. Investors may find this metric valuable for assessing the company's revenue-generating efficiency. Risk Management Analyst The increase in the proportion of loans under the 100% guarantee model from 22.6% to 100% is a considerable change in Lufax's risk profile. This change necessitates careful analysis of the company's capability to manage potential defaults, especially with the outstanding balance of loans enabled dropping by 45.4%.While the capital adequacy ratio and the leverage ratio of the subsidiaries are within regulatory limits, the sustainability of these ratios should be watched, particularly given the increased risk assumption by the company. 04/22/2024 - 05:30 PM SHANGHAI, April 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Lufax Holding Ltd (""Lufax"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: LU and HKEX: 6623), a leading financial services enabler for small business owners in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024.

Meanwhile, all new loans during the quarter were either granted by our consumer finance subsidiary or enabled by our guarantee company under our 100% guarantee model. This switch will have a positive impact on our take rate as it eases the burden of elevated CGI premiums, though the upfront provisioning of these loans means our bottom-line will take longer to recover. In terms of asset quality, the C-M3 flow rate for our Puhui business improved from the fourth quarter of 2023 to the first quarter of 2024. Having already witnessed preliminary enhancements to some key operating metrics, we believe that our strategic initiatives have created a solid foundation for ongoing success. We will remain vigilant, and plan to embrace a cautious approach to our operations for the foreseeable future."" Mr. Gregory Gibb, Co-Chief Executive Officer of Lufax, commented, ""We began to feel the impact of our refined strategic initiatives during the first quarter of 2024. We witnessed the growth of our consumer finance business, with consumer finance loans accounting for 42% of new loan sales in the quarter, up from 24% in the same period last year. Consumer finance loans now comprise 14% of our total balance, an increase from both the year and quarter prior. We have also been growing the portion of loans under our 100% guarantee model, with 26% of Puhui's loan balance now enabled under this model. As of the end of the first quarter, our take rate stood at 9.0% as we built up this balance, and we expect it to rise further in the future through ongoing strategic execution. The improvement in the macro environment, removal of temporary negative impacts from our geographic and direct sales restructuring in the third quarter, and the vintage run off as we build up a new book helped improve our asset quality."" Mr. David Choy, Chief Financial Officer of Lufax, commented, ""We remain committed to ongoing cost optimizations, as evidenced by the 37% year-over-year decrease in total expenses, excluding credit and asset impairment losses, finance costs, and other losses, and the 27% year-over-year decrease in our total expenses. Furthermore, our leverage level remains low, and both of our main operating entities are well-capitalized. Our guarantee subsidiary's leverage ratio increased to 2.4x, driven by the increase of our guarantee balance associated with our increased risk exposure and the decrease of net assets due to the distribution of dividends, compared to a maximum regulatory limit of 10x. Our consumer finance company's capital adequacy ratio stood at approximately 15.1%, exceeding the required 10.5% regulatory requirement. As of March 31, 2024, our cash at bank balance amounted to RMB39.4 billion."" [1] The take rate of retail credit enablement business is calculated by dividing the aggregated amount of loan enablement service fees, post-origination service fees, net interest income, guarantee income and the penalty fees and account management fees by the average outstanding balance of loans enabled for each period. [2] C-M3 flow rate estimates the percentage of current loans that will become non-performing at the end of three months, and is defined as the product of (i) the loan balance that is overdue from 1 to 29 days as a percentage of the total current loan balance of the previous month, (ii) the loan balance that is overdue from 30 to 59 days as a percentage of the loan balance that was overdue from 1 to 29 days in the previous month, and (iii) the loan balance that is overdue from 60 to 89 days as a percentage of the loan balance that was overdue from 30 days to 59 days in the previous month. Loans from legacy products and consumer finance subsidiary are excluded from the flow rate calculation. [3] DPD 30+ delinquency rate refers to the outstanding balance of loans for which any payment is 30 to 179 calendar days past due divided by the outstanding balance of loans. Loans from legacy products and consumer finance subsidiary are excluded from the calculation. [4] DPD 90+ delinquency rate refers to the outstanding balance of loans for which any payment is 90 to 179 calendar days past due divided by the outstanding balance of loans. Loans from legacy products and consumer finance subsidiary are excluded from the calculation. [5] Non-performing loan ratio for consumer finance loans is calculated by using the outstanding balance of consumer finance loans for which any payment is 91 or more calendar days past due and not written off, and certain restructured loans, divided by the outstanding balance of consumer finance loans.

Total expenses excluding credit impairment losses, finance costs and other (gains)/losses decreased by 37% to RMB3,580 million (US$496 million) in the first quarter of 2024 from RMB5,685 million in the same period of 2023.

Capri Holdings risponde alla sfida della FTC riguardo l'acquisizione proposta da Tapestry, Inc., sottolineando le dinamiche di mercato e l'impegno a difendere il caso in tribunale. Capri Holdings responde al desafío de la FTC sobre la adquisición propuesta por Tapestry, Inc., destacando la dinámica del mercado y el compromiso de defender el caso en la corte. Capri Holdings는 Tapestry, Inc.의 제안된 인수에 대해 FTC의 도전에 응답하며 시장 역학을 강조하고 법정에서 사건을 방어할 의지를 밝혔습니다. Capri Holdings répond au défi de la FTC concernant l'acquisition proposée par Tapestry, Inc., en mettant en avant la dynamique du marché et l'engagement à défendre l'affaire devant les tribunaux. Capri Holdings reagiert auf die Herausforderung der FTC bezüglich der vorgeschlagenen Übernahme durch Tapestry, Inc., hebt die Marktdynamik hervor und verpflichtet sich, den Fall vor Gericht zu verteidigen. Positive None. Negative None. Legal Expert The FTC's intervention to challenge the acquisition of Capri by Tapestry is a significant legal maneuver that underscores the regulatory emphasis on antitrust laws. The FTC's action suggests it believes this merger could potentially reduce competition in the luxury fashion market, despite Capri's assertion of the industry being 'highly fragmented'. It is essential to scrutinize the FTC's claim by understanding the market share that a combined entity would hold and the impact on competitive pricing and product diversity. If the FTC's assessment gains legal traction, the acquisition might face substantial delays or ultimately be prohibited, which could affect the market value and strategic positioning of both Capri and Tapestry, potentially leading to volatility in their stock prices. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the regulatory challenge introduces uncertainty into the market, which can lead to investor apprehension. Typically, this type of news triggers a risk-averse sentiment that might be reflected in the trading behavior affecting the stock prices of the companies involved. If Capri's legal defense proves unsuccessful, the costs associated with the court proceedings and the potential for a breakup fee, can have a tangible impact on their financials. On the flip side, should the deal proceed, synergies and the potential for increased market presence could enhance shareholder value in the long term. Evaluating the price-to-earnings ratio of both companies in relation to their peers could provide additional context on the potential financial outcome of this transaction. Market Research Analyst From a market dynamics standpoint, the FTC's challenge indicates heightened scrutiny of the luxury sector's consolidation. The claim of low barriers to entry by Capri needs to be weighed against the brand equity and market penetration that established players like Capri and Tapestry command. Understanding consumer behavior, brand loyalty and the purchasing patterns within the luxury segment is important to assess whether the merger would indeed not 'limit, reduce, or constrain competition' as Capri suggests. A deep dive into the luxury handbag market and consumer trends could reveal whether the FTC's concerns are warranted or if the current competition is indeed sufficient to maintain a healthy market post-acquisition. 04/22/2024 - 05:10 PM LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Capri Holdings Limited (NYSE:CPRI), a global fashion luxury group, today issued the following statement in response to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) unprecedented challenge to the proposed acquisition of Capri by Tapestry, Inc. (NYSE: TPR): This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240422772581/en/(Photo: Business Wire) “Capri Holdings strongly disagrees with the FTC’s decision. The market realities, which the government’s challenge ignores, overwhelmingly demonstrate that this transaction will not limit, reduce, or constrain competition. Tapestry and Capri operate in the fiercely competitive and highly fragmented global luxury industry. Consumers have hundreds of handbag choices at every price point across all channels, and barriers to entry are low. Capri intends to vigorously defend this case in court alongside Tapestry and complete the pending acquisition. The U.S. FTC is the only regulator that did not approve this transaction, which received required approvals from all other jurisdictions. We remain confident in this combination and the value it will bring to all stakeholders.” About Capri Holdings Limited Capri Holdings is a global fashion luxury group consisting of iconic, founder-led brands Versace, Jimmy Choo and Michael Kors.

Financial Analyst Intrusion Inc.'s decision to issue 1,348,569 shares at $1.95 per share, totaling $2.6 million in net proceeds, underscores the company's immediate need for capital to sustain its operations. The offering price reflects a valuation that investors need to scrutinize concerning the company's current market price and future prospects. The associated warrants, allowing purchase of additional shares, could lead to dilution of existing shareholders’ equity, which is a common concern in such transactions. However, the capital infusion might also lead to a stronger balance sheet, potentially making the company more attractive in the long run. Retail investors should monitor how these funds are allocated towards working capital and general corporate purposes, as effective use could enhance the company's competitive position in the cybersecurity market.

The fresh capital from this private placement is pivotal for Intrusion to potentially expand its product offerings and improve existing solutions. Investors should consider how this financial maneuver positions Intrusion relative to its competitors and whether the investment in growth can lead to an increased market share. The focus should not only be on the immediate financial impact but also on the company's strategic initiatives to stay relevant in a sector where customer trust and technological edge are key drivers of success. 04/22/2024 - 05:30 PM PLANO, TX / ACCESSWIRE / April 22, 2024 / Intrusion Inc.

Mark Wall, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, commented: ""Q 1 2024 is generally the toughest quarter at the GK Mine operations with the annual resupply via the ice-road in full swing and the challenges of operating in the far north with limited sunlight and very low temperatures. I am pleased to report that the ice-road resupply is now fully completed, with all necessary materials and consumables safely on site. The Quarter also saw a positive safety milestone, with the site recognizing the milestone of one year free of Lost Time Injuries. The important metrics of 'ore treated per day' and 'overall plant utilization' were both improved in Q1 2024 versus Q1 2023, which are positive process plant performance metrics. The GK Mine also recovered almost 2m tonnes of ore in the Quarter and has built up considerable stockpiles. Work continues on an optimized mine plan and I hope to be able to update the market on that work towards the end of quarter 2.""

Positive Net income of $24.2 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, for Q1 2024 Adjusted net income of $26.0 million, or $0.63 per diluted share for Q1 2024 Quarterly dividend declared at $0.38 per share of common stock Net charge-offs of 0.00% annualized and low nonperforming assets at 0.34% Total capital ratio grew to 11.68% and TCE ratio to 7.62% Opened first full-service branch in San Antonio, Texas market Focused strategy on credit quality, reduced borrowings, and capital growth Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in Independent Bank Group's net income from $14.9 million to $24.2 million illustrates a robust improvement in profitability, which may be attributed to disciplined credit management and strategic loan repricing. The reported earnings per share (EPS) growth from $0.36 to $0.58, coupled with a consistent dividend payout, signals a strong return on equity that could attract dividend investors. The expansion of the loan portfolio yield by 10 basis points, amidst a competitive rate environment, suggests the bank's effective asset yield management. Additionally, the reduction in borrowing balances and the expansion of total capital ratio and tangible common equity ratio by 11 basis points and 7 basis points, respectively, demonstrate a solid balance sheet and might be seen as indicators of financial stability and prudent liquidity management. Market Research Analyst The entry into the San Antonio market indicates strategic geographic diversification, which could potentially unlock new revenue streams. However, loan portfolio contraction on an annualized basis indicates cautious lending or a maturing market, which may temper investor enthusiasm for aggressive growth expectations. Moreover, the low net charge-offs and nonperforming assets suggest the company's asset quality remains high; a key factor in assessing risk in banks. The market may respond favorably to these indicators of risk management, particularly in the context of recent bank volatility. Investors should monitor how effectively the bank can grow its San Antonio presence without diluting its traditionally strong credit quality. Tax Specialist The recorded federal income tax expense at an effective rate of 21.2% is marginally below the statutory rate. This discrepancy may be due to tax-advantaged investments or credits and is worth noting as it impacts the bank's net income. While the prior year's tax benefit suggests an anomalous loss position, the current rate indicates a return to normalization. Investors should consider these tax rates as they reflect the overall fiscal efficiency of the bank and might influence the net profitability and consequently the valuation of the company. 04/22/2024 - 05:00 PM McKINNEY, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Independent Bank Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: IBTX) today announced net income of $24.2 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to $14.9 million, or $0.36 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. Adjusted (non-GAAP) net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 was $26.0 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, compared to $25.5 million, or $0.62 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. The Company also announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.38 per share of common stock. The dividend will be payable on May 16, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 2, 2024. Highlights Net charge-offs of 0.00% annualized Low nonperforming assets of 0.34% Loan portfolio yield expanded by 10 basis points to 5.93% Reduced borrowing balances to the lowest level in over a year Total capital ratio grew by 11 basis points to 11.68%, and (non-GAAP) tangible common equity (TCE) ratio grew by 7 basis points to 7.62% Opened first full-service branch in the San Antonio, Texas market on March 6, 2024 “For the first quarter, we maintained exceptional credit quality while continuing to reprice our maturing fixed-rate loans upward. While growth was seasonally slow during the first quarter, we were able to reduce our borrowings to the lowest level in over a year and grow our total capital and TCE ratios. This positions us well to capitalize on new opportunities such as our expansion into the San Antonio, Texas, market, which gained momentum this quarter when we opened our first full-service branch there on March 6th,” said Independent Bank Group Chairman & CEO David R. Brooks. “I remain very encouraged by the discipline of our teams across Texas and Colorado as we execute our strategy to win business and serve our communities across four of the strongest metropolitan markets in the country.” First Quarter 2024 Balance Sheet Highlights Loans Total loans held for investment, excluding mortgage warehouse purchase loans, were $14.1 billion at March 31, 2024 compared to $14.2 billion at December 31, 2023 and $13.6 billion at March 31, 2023. Loans held for investment, excluding mortgage warehouse purchase loans, decreased $101.3 million, or 2.9% on an annualized basis, during first quarter 2024. Average mortgage warehouse purchase loans were $455.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 compared to $408.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, and $298.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, an increase of $47.3 million, or 11.6% from the linked quarter and an increase of $157.7 million, or 52.9% year over year. Asset Quality Nonperforming assets totaled $65.1 million, or 0.34% of total assets at March 31, 2024, compared to $61.4 million or 0.32% of total assets at December 31, 2023, and $60.1 million, or 0.32% of total assets at March 31, 2023. Nonperforming loans totaled $56.3 million, or 0.40% of total loans held for investment at March 31, 2024, compared to $51.8 million, or 0.37% at December 31, 2023 and $37.3 million, or 0.27% at March 31, 2023. The increase in nonperforming loans for the linked period was primarily due to two commercial loan relationships totaling $2.9 million and a $1.5 million commercial real estate loan added to nonaccrual, while the year over year period also reflects the addition of a $13.0 million commercial real estate loan to nonaccrual in fourth quarter 2023. The increase in nonperforming assets for the linked quarter reflects the nonperforming loan additions discussed above offset by the sale of an $805 thousand other real estate property. The year over year change in nonperforming assets was due to the nonaccrual additions discussed above offset by the disposition and partial write-down of an $11.0 million other real estate property and a $3.0 million write-down on the only remaining other real estate property, both occurring in fourth quarter 2023. Net charge-offs were 0.00% annualized in the first quarter 2024 compared to 0.01% annualized in the linked quarter and 0.04% annualized in the prior year quarter. Deposits, Borrowings and Liquidity Total deposits were $15.7 billion at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 compared to $14.1 billion at March 31, 2023. Total borrowings (other than junior subordinated debentures) were $497.0 million at March 31, 2024, a decrease of $124.8 million from December 31, 2023 and a decrease of $1.6 billion from March 31, 2023. The linked quarter change reflects the payoff of $350.0 million in FHLB advances offset by $225.0 million in lower costing BTFP advances taken in first quarter 2024. The year over year change primarily reflects a $1.8 billion reduction in short-term FHLB advances as well as paydowns of $66.3 million on the Company's unsecured line of credit offset by an increase of $225.0 million in borrowings against the BTFP as discussed above. Capital The Company continues to be well capitalized under regulatory guidelines. At March 31, 2024, the estimated common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets, Tier 1 capital to average assets, Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and total capital to risk-weighted asset ratios were 9.60%, 8.91%, 9.94% and 11.68%, respectively, compared to 9.58%, 8.94%, 9.93%, and 11.57%, respectively, at December 31, 2023 and 9.70%, 9.01%, 10.05%, and 11.88%, respectively at March 31, 2023. First Quarter 2024 Operating Results Net Interest Income Net interest income was $103.0 million for first quarter 2024 compared to $127.9 million for first quarter 2023 and $106.3 million for fourth quarter 2023. The decrease from the prior year was primarily due to the increased funding costs on our deposit products, including brokered deposits, as well as FHLB advances and other borrowings due to Fed rate increases over the last year offset to a lesser extent by increased earnings on interest-earning assets, primarily loans and interest-bearing cash accounts. The decrease from the linked quarter was primarily due to continued increases in deposit funding costs due to the competitive environment as well as increased average brokered deposits offset by increased earnings on higher average loans due to organic loan growth in the linked quarter. The first quarter 2024 includes $753 thousand in acquired loan accretion compared to $1.0 million in first quarter 2023 and $725 thousand in fourth quarter 2023. The average balance of total interest-earning assets grew by $734.2 million and totaled $17.1 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 compared to $16.4 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 and increased $162.7 million from $16.9 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. The increase from the prior year and linked quarter is primarily due to increases in average loans of $681.9 million and $178.2 million due to organic growth primarily occurring in the second half of 2023 while the prior year increase also reflects a $151.7 million increase in average interest-bearing cash balances offset by declines in average securities balances. The yield on interest-earning assets was 5.53% for first quarter 2024 compared to 4.98% for first quarter 2023 and 5.44% for fourth quarter 2023. The increase in asset yield compared to the prior year and linked quarter is primarily a result of increases in the benchmark rates over the last year. The average loan yield, net of acquired loan accretion was 5.91% for the current quarter, compared to 5.33% for prior year quarter and 5.81% for the linked quarter. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities, including borrowings, was 4.11% for first quarter 2024 compared to 2.63% for first quarter 2023 and 3.98% for fourth quarter 2023. The increase from the prior year is reflective of higher funding costs, primarily on deposit products, FHLB advances and other short-term borrowings as a result of Fed Funds rate increases in 2023. Both period funding costs were negatively impacted by the shift from non-interest bearing deposits into interest-bearing products as well as an increase in higher cost brokered deposits for the respective periods. The linked quarter change positively reflects a shift in borrowings from higher cost FHLB advances into other lower cost borrowing products. The net interest margin was 2.42% for first quarter 2024 compared to 3.17% for first quarter 2023 and 2.49% for fourth quarter 2023. The net interest margin excluding acquired loan accretion was 2.40% for first quarter 2024 compared to 3.14% for first quarter 2023 and 2.47% for fourth quarter 2023. The decrease in net interest margin from the prior year and linked quarter was primarily due to the increased funding costs on deposits, offset by higher earnings on loans due to organic growth and rate increases for the respective periods. Noninterest Income Total noninterest income increased $116 thousand compared to first quarter 2023 and increased $2.3 million compared to fourth quarter 2023. The increase from the prior year quarter is primarily due to increases of $251 thousand in service charges on deposit accounts, $343 thousand on investment management fees, $216 thousand in mortgage warehouse purchase program fees and $178 thousand in increase in cash surrender value of BOLI, offset by a $923 thousand decrease in other noninterest income. Other noninterest income was elevated in the prior year quarter primarily due to a $318 thousand BOLI benefit claim as well as other increases in various types of miscellaneous income. The increase from the linked quarter primarily reflects a $1.8 million loss on sale of an other real estate property recognized in fourth quarter 2023, compared to a $13 thousand gain recorded in first quarter 2024. Noninterest Expense Total noninterest expense decreased $100.9 million compared to first quarter 2023 and decreased $6.7 million compared to fourth quarter 2023. The decrease in noninterest expense in first quarter 2024 compared to the prior year is due primarily to the $102.5 million litigation settlement occurring in first quarter 2023. In addition, there were decreases of $1.3 million in professional fees and $2.3 million in other noninterest expense offset by increases of $1.1 million in salaries and employee benefits and $3.4 million in FDIC assessment. The decrease from the linked quarter primarily reflects decreases of $5.8 million in FDIC assessment and $1.8 million in other noninterest expense offset by a $2.7 million increase in salaries and benefits expense. In addition, other real estate impairment was $345 thousand in the current quarter compared to $3.0 million in the linked quarter. The increase in salaries and benefits from the prior year is due primarily to $1.3 million higher combined salaries, bonus, employee insurance, payroll taxes and 401(k) expenses compared to the prior year quarter offset by $560 thousand in lower contract labor costs. The linked quarter change reflects higher salaries of $415 thousand due to merit increases occurring mid-quarter as well as $685 thousand additional stock grant amortization due to equity compensation shares granted as part of the merit process. The linked quarter was also impacted by higher employee insurance costs of $466 thousand and $1.1 million more payroll taxes, which are seasonally higher in the first quarter. The increase in FDIC assessment compared to the prior year was due to an additional special assessment of $2.1 million accrued in first quarter 2024 assessed to recover uninsured deposit losses due to bank failures in early 2023, as well as increases in the quarterly assessment's liquidity stress rates for the year over year period. The linked quarter was impacted by the accrual of a special assessment totaling $8.3 million. The decrease in professional fees from the linked quarter was primarily due to lower consulting fees of $912 thousand due to less active projects. The decrease in other noninterest expense from the prior year was primarily due to a decrease of $673 thousand in loan-related expenses as well as an $802 thousand asset impairment charge in the prior year, compared to none in the current quarter. The decrease from the linked quarter was due primarily to decreases of $565 thousand in charitable contributions and $488 thousand in business meals, entertainment and travel expenses as well as decreases in other miscellaneous expenses. Provision for Credit Losses The Company reversed provision for credit losses of $3.2 million for first quarter 2024, compared to recording provision expense of $90 thousand for first quarter 2023 and $3.5 million for the linked quarter. Provision expense (reversal) during a given period is generally dependent on changes in various factors, including economic conditions, credit quality and past due trends, as well as loan growth or decline and charge-offs or specific credit loss allocations taken during the respective period. The credit provision for first quarter 2024 reflects negative loan growth in addition to an improved economic forecast. The allowance for credit losses on loans was $148.4 million, or 1.06% of total loans held for investment, net of mortgage warehouse purchase loans, at March 31, 2024, compared to $146.9 million, or 1.08% at March 31, 2023 and compared to $151.9 million, or 1.07% at December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet exposures was $4.1 million at March 31, 2024 compared to $4.8 million at March 31, 2023, compared to $3.9 million at December 31, 2023. Changes in the allowance for unfunded commitments are generally driven by the remaining unfunded amount and the expected utilization rate of a given loan segment. Income Taxes Federal income tax expense of $6.5 million was recorded for the first quarter 2024, an effective rate of 21.2% compared to federal tax benefit of $11.3 million and an effective rate of 23.1% for the prior year quarter and income tax expense of $3.5 million and an effective rate of 18.9% for the linked quarter. The higher effective tax rate for first quarter 2023 reflects the Company's loss position for the period, while the lower effective rate for fourth quarter 2023 resulted from the recognition of a tax benefit due to the expiration of the statute of limitations on an immaterial uncertain tax position. Subsequent Events The Company is required, under generally accepted accounting principles, to evaluate subsequent events through the filing of its consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 on Form 10-Q. As a result, the Company will continue to evaluate the impact of any subsequent events on critical accounting assumptions and estimates made as of March 31, 2024 and will adjust amounts preliminarily reported, if necessary.

Such statements are typically, but not exclusively, identified by the use in the statements of words or phrases such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “goal,” “guidance,” “intend,” “is anticipated,” “is estimated,” “is expected,” “is intended,” “objective,” “plan,” “projected,” “projection,” “will affect,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will decrease,” “will grow,” “will impact,” “will increase,” “will incur,” “will reduce,” “will remain,” “will result,” “would be,” variations of such words or phrases (including where the word “could,” “may” or “would” is used rather than the word “will” in a phrase) and similar words and phrases indicating that the statement addresses some future result, occurrence, plan or objective. The forward-looking statements that the Company makes are based on its current expectations and assumptions regarding its business, the economy, and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to future results and occurrences, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks, and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. The Company’s actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements, which are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. Many possible events or factors could affect the Company’s future financial results and performance and could cause those results or performance to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. These possible events or factors include, but are not limited to: 1) the Company’s ability to sustain its current internal growth rate and total growth rate; 2) changes in geopolitical, business and economic events, occurrences and conditions, including changes in rates of inflation or deflation, nationally, regionally and in the Company’s target markets, particularly in Texas and Colorado; 3) worsening business and economic conditions nationally, regionally and in the Company’s target markets, particularly in Texas and Colorado, and the geographic areas in those states in which the Company operates;

6) changes in asset quality, including increases in default rates on loans and higher levels of nonperforming loans and loan charge-offs generally; 7) concentration of the loan portfolio of Independent Financial, before and after the completion of acquisitions of financial institutions, in commercial and residential real estate loans and changes in the prices, values and sales volumes of commercial and residential real estate; 8) the ability of Independent Financial to make loans with acceptable net interest margins and levels of risk of repayment and to otherwise invest in assets at acceptable yields and that present acceptable investment risks; 9) inaccuracy of the assumptions and estimates that the managements of the Company and the financial institutions that the Company acquires make in establishing reserves for credit losses and other estimates generally; 10) lack of liquidity, including as a result of a reduction in the amount of sources of liquidity the Company currently has; 11) material increases or decreases in the amount of insured and/or uninsured deposits held by Independent Financial or other financial institutions that the Company acquires and the cost of those deposits; 12) the Company’s access to the debt and equity markets and the overall cost of funding its operations; 13) regulatory requirements to maintain minimum capital levels or maintenance of capital at levels sufficient to support the Company’s anticipated growth; 14) changes in market interest rates that affect the pricing of the loans and deposits of each of Independent Financial and the financial institutions that the Company acquires and that affect the net interest income, other future cash flows, or the market value of the assets of each of Independent Financial and the financial institutions that the Company acquires, including investment securities; 15) fluctuations in the market value and liquidity of the securities the Company holds for sale, including as a result of changes in market interest rates; 16) effects of competition from a wide variety of local, regional, national and other providers of financial, investment and insurance services;

As a result of these and other matters, including changes in facts, assumptions not being realized or other factors, the actual results relating to the subject matter of any forward-looking statement may differ materially from the anticipated results expressed or implied in that forward-looking statement. Any forward-looking statement made in this filing or made by the Company in any report, filing, document or information incorporated by reference in this filing, speaks only as of the date on which it is made. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law. A forward-looking statement may include a statement of the assumptions or bases underlying the forward-looking statement. The Company believes that these assumptions or bases have been chosen in good faith and that they are reasonable. However, the Company cautions you that assumptions as to future occurrences or results almost always vary from actual future occurrences or results, and the differences between assumptions and actual occurrences and results can be material. Therefore, the Company cautions you not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained in this filing or incorporated by reference herein. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to results presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures and ratios include “adjusted net income,” “adjusted earnings,” “tangible book value,” “tangible book value per common share,” “adjusted efficiency ratio,” “tangible common equity to tangible assets,” “adjusted net interest margin,” “return on tangible equity,” “adjusted return on average assets” and “adjusted return on average equity” and are supplemental measures that are not required by, or are not presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We consider the use of select non-GAAP financial measures and ratios to be useful for financial operational decision making and useful in evaluating period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain expenditures or assets that we believe are not indicative of our primary business operating results. We believe that management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, analyzing and comparing past, present and future periods. We believe that these measures provide useful information to management and investors that is supplementary to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP; however we acknowledge that our financial measures have a number of limitations relative to GAAP financial measures. Certain non-GAAP financial measures exclude items of income, expenditures, expenses, assets, or liabilities, including provisions for credit losses and the effect of goodwill, other intangible assets and income from accretion on acquired loans arising from purchase accounting adjustments, that we believe cause certain aspects of our results of operations or financial condition to be not indicative of our primary operating results. All of these items significantly impact our financial statements. Additionally, the items that we exclude in our adjustments are not necessarily consistent with the items that our peers may exclude from their results of operations and key financial measures and therefore may limit the comparability of similarly named financial measures and ratios. We compensate for these limitations by providing the equivalent GAAP measures whenever we present the non-GAAP financial measures and by including a reconciliation of the impact of the components adjusted for in the non-GAAP financial measure so that both measures and the individual components may be considered when analyzing our performance. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included at the end of the financial statements tables.

See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information and see the Non-GAAP reconciliation Billy Carroll, President & CEO, stated: “Our company started 2024 with nice momentum. The first quarter was highlighted by continued growth in both loans and deposits, each growing 4% and 12%, respectively, along with expense discipline and focus on operating leverage improvement. The investments we’ve made over the last few years have positioned us well and with a margin inflection point on the horizon, we remain very bullish.” SmartFinancial's Chairman, Miller Welborn, concluded: “Our team continued to make substantial forward progress on our key strategic initiatives in the first quarter. Our associates worked diligently to grow revenue and control expenses, setting the stage for operating leverage gains for the remainder of 2024. Continued commitment to EXCELLENT client service and growing shareholder value remains “top of mind” for our team.” Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Net interest income was $31.7 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $31.5 million for the prior quarter. Average earning assets totaled $4.50 billion, an increase of $116.4 million from the prior quarter. The increase in average earnings assets was primarily driven by an increase in average interest-earning cash of $64.0 million, average loans and leases of $49.7 million and average securities of $2.7 million. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $144.2 million from the prior quarter, attributable to an increase in average deposits of $146.3 million, offset by a decrease in average borrowings of $2.2 million. The tax equivalent net interest margin was 2.85% for the first quarter of 2024, compared to 2.86% for the prior quarter. The tax equivalent net interest margin was negatively impacted by the increased cost of interest-bearing liabilities, coupled with a slower rise on yield on interest-earning assets, quarter-over-quarter. The yield on loans and leases, excluding loan fees, was 5.71% for the first quarter, compared to 5.61% for the prior quarter. The cost of total deposits for the first quarter of 2024 was 2.52% compared to 2.35% in the prior quarter. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased to 3.23% for the first quarter of 2024, compared to 3.07% for the prior quarter. The cost of average interest-bearing deposits was 3.16% for the first quarter of 2024, compared to 3.00% for the prior quarter, an increase of 16 basis points.

Balance Sheet Trends Total assets at March 31, 2024 were $4.95 billion compared to $4.83 billion at December 31, 2023. The $125.3 million increase is primarily attributable to increases in cash and cash equivalents of $125.7 million and loans and leases of $33.1 Asset increases were offset by a decrease in securities of $35.1 million. Total liabilities increased to $4.49 billion at March 31, 2024 from $4.37 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase of $118.4 million was primarily from organic deposit growth of $126.3 million, offset by a decrease in borrowings of $3.2 million and other liabilities of $4.7 million. Shareholders' equity at March 31, 2024, totaled $466.8 million, an increase of $6.9 million, from December 31, 2023. The increase in shareholders' equity was primarily driven by net income of $9.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, offset by the negative change of $1.5 million in accumulated other comprehensive income and dividends paid of $1.3 million. Tangible book value per share1 was $21.12 at March 31, 2024, compared to $20.76 at December 31, 2023.

SmartFinancial management uses several Non-GAAP financial measures, including: (i) operating earnings, (ii) operating return on average assets, (iii) operating pre-provision net revenue return on average assets, (iv) operating return on average shareholders' equity, (v) return on average tangible common equity, (vi) operating return on average tangible common equity, (vii) operating efficiency ratio, (viii) operating noninterest income, (ix) operating pre-provision net revenue earnings, (x) operating noninterest expense, (xi) tangible common equity, (xii) average tangible common equity, (xiii) tangible book value per common share, (xiv) tangible assets; and ratios derived therefrom, in its analysis of the company's performance. Operating earnings excludes the following from net income: securities gains and losses and merger related and restructuring expenses. Operating return on average assets is the annualized operating earnings (Non-GAAP) divided by average assets. Operating pre-provision net revenue return on average assets is the annualized operating pre-provision net revenue income earnings (Non-GAAP) by average assets. Operating return on average shareholders' equity is the annualized operating earnings (Non-GAAP) divided by average equity. Return on average tangible common equity is the annualized net income divided by average tangible common equity (Non-GAAP). Operating return on average tangible common equity is the annualized operating earnings (Non-GAAP) divided by average tangible common equity (Non-GAAP). The operating efficiency ratio includes an adjustment for taxable equivalent yields and excludes securities gains and losses and merger related and restructuring expenses from the efficiency ratio. Operating noninterest income excludes the following from noninterest income: securities gains and losses. Operating pre-provision net revenue earnings is net interest income plus operating noninterest income (Non-GAAP) less operating noninterest expense (Non-GAAP). Operating noninterest interest income and operating noninterest expense exclude non-operating related income and expense items. A detailed reconciliation of these items are available in the Non-GAAP reconciliations. Tangible common equity (Non-GAAP) and average tangible common equity (Non-GAAP) excludes goodwill and other intangible assets from shareholders' equity and average shareholders' equity, respectively. Tangible book value per common share (Non-GAAP) is tangible common equity (Non-GAAP) divided by common shares outstanding. Tangible assets (Non-GAAP) excludes goodwill and other intangibles from total assets. Management believes that Non-GAAP financial measures provide additional useful information that allows investors to evaluate the ongoing performance of the company and provide meaningful comparisons to its peers. Management believes these Non-GAAP financial measures also enhance investors' ability to compare period-to-period financial results and allow investors and company management to view our operating results excluding the impact of items that are not reflective of the underlying operating performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance or financial condition as promulgated under GAAP, and investors should consider SmartFinancial's performance and financial condition as reported under GAAP and all other relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of the company. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the results or financial condition as reported under GAAP.

Positive None. Negative None. Transport Industry Analyst Saia Inc.'s expansion with new terminals in New Jersey and Utah signifies a strategic move to bolster their distribution network in regions marked by economic growth. By situating facilities in Trenton, a nexus for regional commerce and St. George, a burgeoning economic hub, Saia aims to leverage local market dynamics to enhance service delivery. The logistics sector often relies on network density to improve operational efficiency and Saia's investment in infrastructure is a textbook approach to minimize transit times and optimize load consolidation. This expansion could be a response to heightened customer demand, indicating a robust customer base in these areas. From an investor's perspective, the allocation of $1 billion this year into capital expenditures reflects confidence in future revenue growth, but it also necessitates scrutiny of return on investment timelines. The substantial investments over the past five years show a company in growth mode, yet investors should monitor how these capital outlays translate into improved margins and market share. Financial Analyst The decision by Saia to open two new terminals represents a significant capital investment. It is important for investors to consider the potential impact on the company's financial health. The short-term financials are likely to reflect the costs associated with these openings, such as capital expenditure on facilities and technology and initial operating costs. However, investors should also consider the long-term potential for increased revenue streams and improved efficiency from these investments. It's critical to watch the next few quarters for evidence of these terminals contributing to top-line growth and operational efficiency. Investors should also consider Saia's current debt levels and interest coverage ratio to ensure that the company maintains a healthy balance sheet amidst these expansions. The strategic placement of these terminals should be viewed within the context of Saia's overall network and the extent to which they contribute to a competitive advantage in the freight and logistics industry. Market Research Analyst Saia's strategic expansion in New Jersey and Utah, areas experiencing economic development, is a move that should be carefully observed for how it captures emerging market opportunities. The logistics industry can be intensely competitive and positioning terminals in economically vibrant locations is a critical factor for future growth. Analyzing customer response to Saia's enhanced service offerings will be key to understanding the effectiveness of their investment. Furthermore, the broader economic conditions and industry trends will also influence the success of these new terminals. Stakeholders should look for indicators such as increased customer acquisition, market penetration and enhanced service levels that could lead to a stronger competitive stance for Saia. It's important not to overlook the potential risks associated with rapid expansion, such as operational disruptions and integration challenges. 04/22/2024 - 05:56 PM JOHNS CREEK, Ga., April 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Saia Inc.

WaFd, Inc. (Nasdaq: WAFD) berichtete über die Ergebnisse des zweiten Quartals des Geschäftsjahres 2024 nach der erfolgreichen Fertigstellung der Fusion mit Luther Burbank. Trotz eines Rückgangs des Nettoergebnisses im Vergleich zu vorherigen Quartalen bleibt der Präsident und CEO des Unternehmens optimistisch über den strategischen Erwerb und die potenziellen Vorteile, die er in der Zukunft bringen wird. Positive Successful completion of the merger with Luther Burbank Net earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, were $15,888,000, a decrease of 73% from the previous quarter. Adjusted net earnings without merger costs would have been $54.8 million, a 6% decrease from the December quarter. Return on common shareholders' equity was 2.09% and return on assets was 0.26%. The acquisition of Luther Burbank is expected to result in earnings per share accretion of 8% in fiscal 2025 and 16% in fiscal 2026. Initiated a program to sell a portion of the LBC multifamily loan portfolio to potential buyers, up to $3.2 billion. Front-line bankers in the California branches and support teams successfully executed the conversion plan with minimal impact on deposit accounts. Negative Net earnings decreased by 73% from the previous quarter and 76% from the same quarter last year. Return on common shareholders' equity and return on assets declined compared to previous quarters. Merger-related costs and non-operating expenses of $51.1 million impacted the quarter's financial results. Challenging interest rate environment made strategic execution more difficult. Financial Analyst The reported decrease in net earnings following the merger with Luther Burbank Corporation is a clear indicator of initial costs associated with such transactions. A decline from $58,453,000 to $15,888,000 in net earnings represents a sharp decline of 73% on a quarterly basis. This is a significant drop and highlights the immediate financial impact of the merger. However, investors should be aware of the typical nature of these expenses; they are one-time and may not reflect the ongoing financial health of the company.The reported adjusted figures, excluding the merger-related costs, are key to understanding the underlying performance. An adjusted return on equity of 8.7% still reflects a downturn from the previous year's 12.01%, suggesting there may be operational challenges beyond merger costs affecting profitability. Furthermore, a slight 6% decrease in net income when excluding non-operating items indicates that the core business may be experiencing pressure, possibly from the broader challenging interest rate environment.On a strategic note, the rapid integration of LBC and the minimal decrease in deposit accounts post-merger (1.1%) is a positive sign of customer retention and operational efficiency. The planned sale of up to $3.2 billion of the LBC multifamily loan portfolio could provide a significant liquidity event. The proposed redeployment of these funds into higher yielding assets is anticipated to drive earnings per share growth, with projections of 8% in fiscal 2025 and 16% in fiscal 2026, which if realized, could offset the initial costs of the merger and eventually lead to increased profitability. Market Research Analyst The strategic rationale behind the acquisition of Luther Burbank Corporation centers around the increase in market presence and asset size, with LBC's assets constituting 34% of WaFd's standalone assets. This move represents a significant expansion, particularly in the California market, which could enhance WaFd's competitive stance in the region. The long-term strategy to strengthen the bank's footprint in key markets should be evaluated by stakeholders for the potential to generate greater market share and customer base growth.While the short-term financial impact of the merger appears steep, President and CEO Brent Beardall's comments underline a vision for transformational growth. Investors should consider the historical performance of similar banking acquisitions when assessing long-term outcomes. It's also important to acknowledge that the banking sector operates on thin margins, where strategic acquisitions can lead to economies of scale and potentially better long-term earnings through expanded operations. However, the emphasis on the 'noise' of the quarter may suggest there are more variables at play than presented and investors would be prudent to look for further clarity in future earnings reports and operational updates. 04/22/2024 - 05:00 PM SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- WaFd, Inc. (Nasdaq: WAFD) (the ""Company""), parent company of Washington Federal Bank (""WaFd Bank"" or the ""Bank""), today announced quarterly earnings after successfully completing the merger of California-based Luther Burbank Corporation (""LBC""). Earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 were $15,888,000, a decrease of 73% from net earnings of $58,453,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 and a decrease of 76% from net earnings of $65,934,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. After the effect of dividends on preferred stock, net income available for common shareholders was $0.17 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to $0.85 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, a $0.68 or 80% decrease, and $0.95 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, a $0.78 or 82% decrease in fully diluted earnings per common share. For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, return on common shareholders' equity was 2.09% and return on assets was 0.26%. These results reflect merger-related costs and certain non-operating expenses of $51.1 million for the quarter. Adjusted for these expenses, return on common shareholders' equity for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 was 8.7% compared to 10.21% for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 and 12.01% for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. Adjusted, return on assets for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 was 0.9% compared to 1.0% for the previous quarter and 1.2% for the same quarter in the prior year. For a reconciliation, see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below. President and CEO Brent Beardall commented, ""In the future, when we look back at the acquisition of Luther Burbank, we will see the addition of this $8 billion asset franchise in California as a transformational event for WaFd Bank. As expected, there is a lot of noise in the quarter so we have provided disclosures showing what earnings would have been without the merger costs and certain non-operating income and expenses. Absent these items, net income would have been $54.8 million, a 6% decrease from the December quarter. While the continuation of the challenging interest rate environment has made strategic execution more difficult, we remain excited by the potential of this purchase. ""I am especially proud of how quickly we were able to complete this acquisition once regulatory approval was granted. We closed on the acquisition of LBC on February 29, 2024. The next day, Friday March 1st, we started the systems conversions and branch re-branding and completed the work just two days later, opening our doors March 4th as WaFd branches operating on WaFd's core systems. To my knowledge this was one of, if not the fastest close-to-conversion in modern history for U.S. banking for transactions over $1 billion. Speed only matters if you are able to execute with quality and our teams, especially our front-line bankers in the California branches and the support teams in operations and technology, were remarkably successful executing the conversion plan. The best indicator of this success is the behavior of the impacted clients. From conversion until quarter end, deposit accounts are down only 1.1%. ""A lot has changed since we announced the acquisition of LBC in November 2022. Importantly, we have identified a portion of the LBC multifamily loan portfolio (up to $3.2 billion) that would be attractive to potential buyers and have initiated a program to sell these loans. We have engaged a third party to facilitate this process. There has been a lot of interest in these loans, we are working through the bidding process and expect to execute on the sale in the next few months. We are mindful of the benefits of selling these loans, the resulting liquidity and the options going forward, whether to pay down debt, originate new loans or a combination of both. Ultimately, the amount of loans sold is dependent on price and certainty for execution. ""An acquisition of the size of LBC is meaningful for WaFd; their assets were 34% of standalone WaFd assets. Why did we do it? Why take the risk? We believe this acquisition will accrue to the benefit of our clients, our communities, our shareholders and our employees. Now that it is substantially complete, we believe common shareholders will experience earnings per share accretion of 8% in fiscal 2025 and 16% in fiscal 2026. These estimates factor in the redeployment of the funds received in the potential loan sale into higher yielding assets. Projections that lead to those returns are contained in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below. ""We are grateful to be one of the strongest regional banks in the now nine western states in which we operate. Our value proposition is straightforward, we provide relationship banking to our clients through a platform that is large enough to be meaningful but small enough to be nimble and responsive to our clients. We are more optimistic today about our future prospects than any time in my 24 years at WaFd. ""There have been significant changes in interest rates and market values of assets since the merger announcement and the table below calls out what we were expecting in November of 2022 compared to what we are expecting today.""

See page 13 for additional information on our use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures. As a result of the merger on February 29, 2024, the Company's balances as of March 31, 2024 reflect the newly combined entity and the activity for the quarter then ended include one month of LBC-related activity. Given this, the Company's financial results are not directly comparable to prior reported periods. Total assets were $30.1 billion as of March 31, 2024, compared to $22.5 billion at September 30, 2023, primarily due to the addition of $7.7 billion of LBC assets at fair value on February 29, 2024. Net loans held for investment increased by $3.3 billion, or 19.0%, from September 30, 2023 to March 31, 2024 reflecting the addition of LBC loans with a fair value of $3.2 billion. The fair value of total loans obtained in the merger was $6.2 billion. The Company has identified approximately $3.2 billion of the acquired multifamily loans to sell and has classified these as Loans Held for Sale at fair value. Cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2024 increased by $525.1 million, or 53.5%, since September 30, 2023. Investment securities increased by $477.3 million during the quarter due to the addition of $529.2 million in securities obtained in the merger. Customer deposits totaled $21.3 billion as of March 31, 2024, an increase of 32.8% since September 30, 2023 due to $5.6 billion in deposits obtained in the merger. Transaction accounts increased by $1.6 billion or 14.6% during that period, while time deposits increased $3.7 billion or 69.7% as 66% of the LBC deposit portfolio was time deposits. As a result of this mix, the percentage of the Company’s transaction accounts at March 31, 2024 decreased to 57.8% compared to 67.0% at September 30, 2023. Core deposits, defined as all transaction accounts and time deposits less than $250,000, totaled 82.1% of deposits at March 31, 2024. Deposits that are uninsured or not collateralized were 25.5% as of March 31, 2024, a slight decrease from 25.7% as of September 30, 2023. Borrowings totaled $5.3 billion as of March 31, 2024, up from $3.7 billion at September 30, 2023 with $1.4 billion attributable to the merger. The Company also assumed additional debt in connection with the merger in the form of approximately $50 million in floating rate junior subordinated debentures, due June 2036 and June 2037, and $94 million in 6.5% senior unsecured term notes maturing September 30, 2024. The effective weighted average interest rate of the combined borrowings and debt was 4.48% as of March 31, 2024, compared to 3.98% at September 30, 2023 as a result of adding the LBC borrowings. The Company had loan originations of $0.8 billion for the second fiscal quarter of 2024, compared to $1.0 billion of originations in the same quarter one year ago. Offsetting loan originations in each of these quarters were loan repayments of $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. The Bank has intentionally slowed new loan production to temper net loan growth. Commercial loans represented 77% of all loan originations during the second fiscal quarter of 2024 and consumer loans accounted for the remaining 23%. Commercial loans are viewed by the Bank as preferable; they generally have floating interest rates and shorter durations. The weighted average interest rate on the loan portfolio was 5.02% as of March 31, 2024, a decrease from 5.22% as of September 30, 2023, due primarily to adding the lower yielding LBC portfolio. Credit quality continues to be monitored closely in light of the shifting economic and monetary environment. As of March 31, 2024, non-performing assets were $68 million, or 0.2% of total assets, from $58 million, or 0.3%, at September 30, 2023. The percentage of delinquent loans was 0.4% of total loans for both March 31, 2024 and September 30, 2023 as a result of the increased loan balance. The following table shows the effect the merger had on the change in non-performing assets and delinquencies. Non-Performing Assets Delinquencies (In thousands) Balance at September 30, 2023 $ 57,924 $ 63,315 Decrease in balance (2,536 ) (5,258 ) Balance at December 31, 2023 55,388 58,057 Merger-related additions 13,487 23,258 Decrease in balance (514 ) (5,267 ) Balance at March 31, 2024 $ 68,361 $ 76,048 The allowance for credit losses including the reserve for unfunded commitments (""ACL"") totaled $225 million as of March 31, 2024, and was 1.00% of gross loans outstanding, as compared to $202 million, or 1.04% of gross loans outstanding, as of September 30, 2023. The increase in the ACL reflects the $16.0 million provision recorded on LBC loans held for investment that are not credit deteriorated and the $7.4 million estimated lifetime credit losses for those that are considered purchased credit deteriorated (""PCD""). Net charge-offs were $146,000 for the second fiscal quarter of 2024, compared to net charge-offs of $6 million for the prior year same quarter. The Company paid quarterly dividends on Series A preferred stock on January 15, 2024 and April 15, 2024. On March 8, 2024, the Company paid a regular cash dividend on common stock of $0.26 per share, which represented the 164th consecutive quarterly cash dividend. During the quarter, the Company repurchased 7,837 shares of common stock at a weighted average price of $30.38 per share and has authorization to repurchase 1,853,453 additional shares. Tangible common shareholders' equity per share decreased by $1.41, or 5.0%, to $26.64 since September 30, 2023. Over the past 12 months, tangible book value decreased per share by $0.21 or 0.8%. The ratio of total tangible shareholders' equity to tangible assets decreased to 8.31% as of March 31, 2024. See the reconciliation for these non-GAAP measures starting on page 13. Net interest income was $159 million for the second fiscal quarter of 2024, a decrease of $16.4 million or 9.4% from the same quarter in the prior year. The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to the 129 basis point increase in the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities outpacing the 38 basis point increase in the average rate earned on interest-earning assets. Net interest income also increased by $6.4 million compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2023 due to a larger increase in the average interest earning assets than the increase in interest bearing liabilities as a result of the merger. Net interest margin was 2.73% in the second fiscal quarter of 2024 compared to 2.91% for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 and 3.51% for the prior year quarter. Total other income was $13.4 million for the second fiscal quarter of 2024 compared to $10.1 million in the prior year same quarter. The increase is primarily due to recording $1.8 million less unrealized losses for certain equity method investments in the current quarter compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2023. Small increases in insurance agency commissions recognized by the WAFD Insurance Group and increased fees earned as a result of the merger account for the remaining change. Total other expense was $133.7 million in the second fiscal quarter of 2024, an increase of $36.8 million, or 38.0%, from the prior year's quarter. Compensation expense increased as a result of $19 million in merger-related retention, severance and change-in-control expenses combined with a larger post-merger workforce. FDIC premiums increased $3.9 million compared to the same period last year and included a $1.8 million expense for an FDIC special assessment. Total other expense also increased by $10.9 million compared to the same quarter in the prior year. This is largely due to $5.9 million in merger related expenses in the quarter as well as $5 million in non-operating expenses including a $2 million charitable donation and $3 million in accruals related to legal and compliance related items. The Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $16.0 million in the second fiscal quarter of 2024, compared to a provision for credit losses of $3.5 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2023. The provision for loan losses in the quarter ended March 31, 2024 represents the preliminary lifetime loss estimate for the non-PCD loans obtained in the merger. The Company’s efficiency ratio in the second fiscal quarter of 2024 was 58.5% (as adjusted, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures below), compared to 58.0% in the prior quarter and 52.3% for the same period one year ago. Income tax expense totaled $5.1 million for the second fiscal quarter of 2024, as compared to $18.6 million for the prior year same quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 was 24.21% compared to 20.81% for the year ended September 30, 2023. Although the Company’s effective tax rate may vary from the statutory rate mainly due to state taxes, tax-exempt income and tax-credit investments, much of the change in the current quarter resulted specifically from the merger and consideration of California State and Local taxes.

The Company considers these items to be non-operating in nature as they are items that Management does not consider indicative of the Company's on-going financial performance. We believe that the tables presented reflect our on-going performance in the periods presented and, accordingly, are useful to consider in addition to our GAAP financial results. These measures should not be considered a substitution for GAAP basis disclosures.

Positive 67% increase in mine life to 11 years based on Mineral Reserves 64% increase in contained copper after replacing depletion to 0.5Mt in Mineral Reserves 42% increase in total contained copper in Mineral Resources Plans to convert Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources to Mineral Reserves Three-year production guidance forecasts increasing copper production Exploration ongoing to further increase Resource and Reserve Historical data being digitized for potential inclusion in future estimates Mineral Reserves at 14.9Mt @ 3.3% Cu and 13 g/t Ag Potential for optimization of production plan based on evolving data Focus on maximizing copper production at lower costs Negative Reduction in Mineral Reserve grade from 4% Cu to 3.3% Cu Potential challenges in converting Inferred Resources to Reserves Historical data inclusion may impact future Resource and Reserve estimates Variable cut-off grades based on operational factors Mining Analyst Metals Acquisition Limited's updated Resource and Reserve Statement and Production Guidance signal substantial growth, with a 67% increase in mine life and a 64% increase in contained copper. These developments are anticipated to enhance the company's position in terms of resource longevity and operational scale. The sizeable rise in Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources to 229 ktonnes of copper at an average grade of 4.9% demonstrates an improvement in future production potential. The projection of an extended mine life is particularly notable. This longer-term asset longevity might result in increased investor confidence and potential upward pressure on the company's stock price. Additionally, the successful capital raising via a public offer, amounting to A$325 million, provides financial backing for the proposed capital investments aimed at optimizing the mine plan. Increasing drilling and the inclusion of level mapping data have played a significant role in enhancing the Mineral Resource base, which in turn may influence production costs and production rates positively. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the substantial increase in Copper (Cu) reserves and the extended mine life could translate into predictable long-term cash flows, which is often a key metric for investors. The 83% increase in contained Cu after replacement of depletion in the Measured and Indicated Resources categories and the 3-Year Production Guidance offering a clear trajectory of increasing copper production are positive indicators of future revenue growth. The financial outlay for growth capital spending, which aims to further optimize the mine plan, is supported by the recent equity raise, reducing financial risk and potentially increasing the company's borrowing capacity. This strategic investment should be closely monitored to ensure it yields the expected operational efficiencies and cost savings. Investors should consider the potential for commodity price volatility and operational risks typical in the mining sector. Metal price assumptions used in reserve estimation are in line with long-term forecasts, yet divergences from these could impact profit margins. Environmental & Sustainability Analyst An aspect investors should not overlook is the environmental and sustainability angle. With Metals Acquisition Limited's expansion of drilling activities, the impact on the local environment and the company's adherence to sustainable mining practices will increasingly come under scrutiny. Responsible resource management, as evidenced by the strategic approach to optimizing production plans, can reduce environmental impacts and foster a positive relationship with stakeholders. The progressive conversion of Inferred Mineral Resources to Measured and Indicated Categories also indicates a commitment to efficient resource utilization. The company's growth strategy must balance resource exploitation with environmental stewardship to maintain social license to operate and align with global sustainability trends, which can affect long-term valuation. 04/22/2024 - 05:00 PM ST. HELIER, Jersey--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Metals Acquisition Limited (NYSE: MTAL; ASX:MAC) This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240422290327/en/Figure 1 – Location of Zinc and Lead Mineralisation (Graphic: Business Wire) Metals Acquisition Limited ARBN 671 963 198 (NYSE: MTAL; ASX: MAC), a private limited company incorporated under the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands (“MAC” or the “Company”) is pleased to release its Resource and Reserve Statement (as at 31 August 2023) (“R+R”) and 3 Year Production Guidance for the CSA Copper Mine in NSW. In accordance with Item 1300 of Regulation S-K (17 CFR Part 229) (“S-K 1300”), all Mineral Resources are reported exclusive of Mineral Reserves. Resource and Reserve Statement Highlights from the R+R include: 67% increase in mine life to 11-years (end of 2034) based on Mineral Reserves only, compared to the 6-year mine life in the 2022 Resources and Reserves Statement 64% increase in contained copper (“Cu”) after replacement of depletion to 0.5Mt in Mineral Reserves (Refer Table 3 for breakdown) at an average grade of 3.3% Cu Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources increased to 229 ktonnes of Cu from zero in the prior (Refer Table 2 for breakdown) at an average grade of 4.9% Cu An additional 184 ktonnes of Cu in the Inferred Mineral Resources, an approximate 5% reduction on the prior year as Inferred material was promoted to Measured and Indicated Categories 83% increase in contained Cu after replacement of depletion in the Measured and Indicated Resources categories 2023 Mineral Reserve only extends 95m vertically below the current decline position Above increases have come after only ten months of ownership and based on data from two and a half months post-closing of the acquisition with the effective date for the R+R being 31 August 2023 All deposits (other than QTSSU-A (feasibility study), are open in at least one direction and drilling is continuing to further increase the R+R, subject to exploration success and economic factors The effective date for the R+R is 31 August 2023 and as such, any new information received after that time has not been incorporated into the R+R at this stage. Work is continuing on updating the mine plans as new information is received and importantly following on from the completion of MAC’s dual listing on the ASX and public offer that raised A$325 million of equity the Company is pushing forward with its growth capital spending to further optimise the mine plan. MAC CEO, Mick McMullen commented “Whilst this Resource and Reserve Statement is a snapshot in time based on information available back in August 2023, it does validate our belief that the CSA Copper Mine can be a long-life asset. Importantly, despite the near doubling of the Mineral Reserves and a 67% increase in the mine life, we still have 4.7Mt @ 4.9% Cu (230Kt Cu) in the Measured and Indicated Category and 3.3Mt @ 5.5% Cu (180Kt Cu) in the Inferred Category that are not included in the Mineral Reserves and work is underway to convert these to our Mineral Reserve estimates in the future. We have always believed that the CSA Copper Mine would have a long future and this Resource and Reserve Statement upgrade confirms this and also provides us with the underlying Mineral Resource base from which to put long term plans in place that simply hasn’t been possible for the last generation when the mine has always had a 5 to 6-year reserve mine life ahead of it. There has perhaps been a view by some observers that the CSA Copper Mine has a relatively short mine life, with today’s Resource and Reserve Statement announcement we can dispel that view and now focus on mining more Copper faster and at lower costs. We are but ten months into our ownership of the mine and it has a lot of potential to be uncovered still.” Three Year Production Guidance Based on the updated R+R, the Company is providing the following production guidance for the next three years: Table 1 - CSA Copper Mine Production Guidance 2024 2025 2026 Low Range High Range Low Range High Range Low Range High Range Cu Production (tonnes) 38,000 43,000 43,000 48,000 48,000 53,000 This three-year production guidance is based primarily on Mineral Reserves but also on measured and indicated Mineral Resources (as at 31 August 2023) and, given that all the deposits are open and a large drill program is underway, MAC considers it likely that there will be changes over the relevant period as the Company’s overall plan to continue operational and production improvement continues to develop. The 42% and 64% increase in contained Cu after replacement of depletion for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves respectively in the R+R has come after ten months of ownership and based on data from two and a half months post-closing of the acquisition. The CSA Copper Mine has been producing for almost 60 years with very limited exploration away from the known deposits and there is potential to further optimise this production plan. As discussed below, exploration in the top 850m of the deposit is just starting and initial results highlight strong potential to open additional mining fronts. Mineral Resources The Mineral Resources have been updated based on data to 31 August 2023 and allowing for depletion to that date. Total S-K 1300 Mineral Resources are shown in Table 2 below: Table 2- CSA Copper Mine Mineral Resources System Resource Category Tonnes Mt Cu % Cu Metal kt Ag g/t Ag Metal Moz All Systems Measured 3.3 5.6 182 19 2.0 Indicated 1.4 3.4 47 6 0.3 Meas + Ind 4.7 4.9 229 15 2.3 Inferred 3.3 5.5 184 21 2.2 Total 8.0 5.2 413 18 4.5 Notes: Mineral Resources are reported as of 31 August 2023; Mineral Resources are reported in accordance with S-K 1300, including with respect to defined terms; Mineral Resources are reported exclusive of Mineral Reserves; The Qualified Person who prepared the statement is Mike Job, of Cube Consulting Pty Ltd; Price assumptions used in the estimation include US$8,279/t of copper and US$22.60/troy ounce (“oz”) of silver; in line with long term Broker Consensus forecast copper pricing as at August 8, 2023; Geological mineralization boundaries defined at a nominal 2.5% Cu cut off for high grade lenses, and 1.5% Cu for the lower-grade halo. Resources reported above a 1.5% Cu cut-off grade; Costs assumptions underlying cut-off grade calculation include US$78/t ore mined, US$20/t ore milled and US$21/t G&A ore milled; Metallurgical recovery assumptions used in the estimation were 97.5% copper recovery and 80% silver recovery; Mineral Resources reported as dry, raw, undiluted, in-situ tonnes; and Figures are subject to rounding. As discussed above, not only has total contained Cu in Mineral Resources increased by 42%, the Measured and Indicated portions available for Mineral Reserve conversion has increased by 83%. This is a result of increased drilling and the inclusion of level mapping data where levels have been developed through the deposits and not previously been included in the Mineral Resource. Overall grade has reduced from 5.3% Cu in the 2022 R+R to 4.9% in the 2023 R+R which is predominately a result of the inclusion of 2.2Mt of material between the new cut-off grade of 1.5% Cu and the previous cut-off grade of 2.5% Cu. In terms of contained Cu this material had a relatively small impact to the overall change, with the larger changes coming from the inclusion of new drilling and level mapping data. As evidenced by the recent drill results released by the Company,1 including 19.2m @ 10.4% Cu in UDD23025 and 16m @ 10.5% Cu in UDD23024 these deposits are characterised by high grade lodes that have a long vertical extent that project well past the 2023 R+R. In addition, whilst the mine is currently a producer of high quality Cu concentrates, it did start life as a high grade zinc (“Zn”) mine. As seen in the recently released QSD060 result of 4.3m @ 14.2% Zn, 3.9% Pb and 0.8% Cu the shallower portions of the deposits do host significant Zn mineralisation that is yet to be modelled. The current R+R starts at a depth of 850m below surface (except for the small QTSS Upper-A deposit) as the data for this area has not historically been in the digital database. A large amount of historical data is available for these shallower portions of the mine and approximately 70% of this has now been digitized. None of this information has been included in the 2023 R+R. Drilling is underway to verify the presence of the mineralisation included in this historical dataset, with the first hole intercepting Zn and Cu massive sulphides as predicted by the historical data at a depth below surface of approximately 330m. This mineralisation is vertically extensive and occurs adjacent to existing mine development with the interval in EWDD24005 located 30m from existing development as seen in Figure 1. Figure 2 shows the core from the most recent drilling in this area that was targeted at the indicated position of this mineralisation based on the historical data. Figure 1 – Location of Zinc and Lead Mineralisation Figure 2 - Massive Zn and Cu Mineralisation in EWDD24005 Mineral Reserves The Mineral Reserves have been updated based on data to 31 August 2023 and allowing for depletion to that date. Total S-K 1300 Mineral Reserves are 14.9Mt @ 3.3% Cu and 13 g/t Ag and are shown in Table 3 below: Table 3 - CSA Copper Mine Mineral Reserves CSA Copper Mine Proved Probable Proved and Probable M tonnes 8.3 6.6 14.9 Cu % 3.5 3.1 3.3 Contained Cu ktonnes 293 201 494 Ag g/t 14 11 13 Contained Ag M oz 3.9 2.4 6.2 Notes: Mineral Reserves are reported as of 31 August 2023 and are reported using the definitions in S-K 1300; The Qualified Person who prepared the statement is Jan Coetzee, an officer of MAC, the Registrant’s Australian subsidiary; Price assumptions used in the estimation include US$8,279/t of copper and US$22.60/troy ounce (“oz”) of silver; in line with long term Broker Consensus forecast copper pricing as at August 8, 2023; Mineral Reserves reported as dry, diluted, in-situ tonnes using a Stope breakeven cut-off grade of 2.2% Cu for 2024 to 2026 and a cut-off-grade of 1.65% for the remaining periods and a Development breakeven cut-off grade of 1.0% Cu; Costs assumptions underlying cut-off grade calculation include US$78/t ore mined, US$20/t ore milled and US$21/t G&A ore milled; Metallurgical recovery assumptions used in the estimation were 97.5% copper recovery and 80% silver recovery; and Figures are subject to rounding. Ore Reserves were estimated at a Cu price of US$8,279/t Cu, which compares to a spot price of US$9,905/t Cu as at 20 April 2024. Mineral Reserve grade at 3.3% Cu is down from 4% Cu in the prior year which is a reflection of the lower cost base that the mine is now operating under. This is as a result of reduced mine site operating costs and offsite charges. Cut-off grade is variable based on the ability to mine at higher rates once the Return Air Rise (“RAR”) are complete and ranges from 2.2% Cu near term to 1.65% Cu for the longer term. The mine plan strategy is somewhat determined by the requirement for additional RAR ventilation at the bottom of QTSN, during which time the mine plan mines the higher grade core. Once the RAR system is in place then the mine plan reverts to a more bulk tonnage model given the large excess processing plant capacity at the mine. At elevated Cu prices the goal is to maximise Cu production where possible and to defer any lower grade material to the back end of the mine plan. Figure 3 illustrates the changes in the Mineral Reserves from the prior year. Figure 3 – CSA Copper Mine Contained Cu in Reserve Changes 2022 to 2023 Spatially, the location of the 2023 Mineral Reserve compared to the 2022 Mineral Reserve is shown in Figure 4 below. The bulk of the increases have been in QTSN where the deposit has been increasing in strike length and QTSC where drilling has expanded the lateral and vertical extend of the deposit. All deposits are open and as seen in Figures 5 and 6 below the Mineral Reserves terminate at RL’s based on drill density with the deposits extending significantly past the 2023 Mineral Reserves. Figure 4 - Location of the 2023 Mineral Reserve compared to the 2022 Mineral Reserve The bulk of the Mineral Reserves (84% of total contained Cu) are from the QTSN and QTSC deposits and Figures 5 and 6 illustrate the location of the Mineral Reserves compared to the various resource classifications. Figure 5 - Location of Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resource Classification - QTSN Mineral Reserves in QTSN have been extended to the 8300mRL, with current stoping active on the 8430m RL and the decline at the 8395mRL. As such, the current 11 year mine life is only mining a further 95m vertically below the bottom of the decline position at the end of March 2024. Figure 6- Location of Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resource Classification – QTSC The material R+R increase from the R+R at the time of purchase will now enable the Company to optimise mining rates with a view to producing more Cu sooner given the potential for even longer mine life subject to converting the non Mineral Reserve material. This will also be instrumental in right sizing the capital structure of the Company. Life of Mine (“LOM”) Plan The LOM plan is based on Mineral Reserves only and on data from the end of August 2023. Several of the deposits being mined or planned to be mined still contain elevated levels of Inferred Resources that are not included in the LOM under both the JORC and S-K 1300 Codes.

Forward Looking Statements This release has been prepared by Metals Acquisition Limited (“Company” or “MAC”) and includes “forward-looking statements.” The forward-looking information is based on the Company’s expectations, estimates, projections and opinions of management made in light of its experience and its perception of trends, current conditions and expected developments, as well as other factors that management of the Company believes to be relevant and reasonable in the circumstances at the date that such statements are made, but which may prove to be incorrect. Assumptions have been made by the Company regarding, among other things: the price of copper, continuing commercial production at the CSA Copper Mine without any major disruption, the receipt of required governmental approvals, the accuracy of capital and operating cost estimates, the ability of the Company to operate in a safe, efficient and effective manner and the ability of the Company to obtain financing as and when required and on reasonable terms. Readers are cautioned that the foregoing list is not exhaustive of all factors and assumptions which may have been used by the Company. Although management believes that the assumptions made by the Company and the expectations represented by such information are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking information will prove to be accurate. MAC’s actual results may differ from expectations, estimates, and projections and, consequently, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Words such as “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “budget,” “forecast,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “believes,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue,” and similar expressions (or the negative versions of such words or expressions) are intended to identify such forward- looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, MAC’s expectations with respect to future performance of the CSA Copper Mine. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Most of these factors are outside MAC’s control and are difficult to predict. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: the supply and demand for copper; the future price of copper; the timing and amount of estimated future production, costs of production, capital expenditures and requirements for additional capital; cash flow provided by operating activities; unanticipated reclamation expenses; claims and limitations on insurance coverage; the uncertainty in Mineral Resource estimates; the uncertainty in geological, metallurgical and geotechnical studies and opinions; infrastructure risks; and other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in MAC’s other filings with the SEC and the ASX. MAC cautions that the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. MAC cautions readers not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. MAC does not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in its expectations or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such statement is based. More information on potential factors that could affect MAC’s or CSA Copper Mine’s financial results is included from time to time in MAC’s public reports filed with the SEC and the ASX. If any of these risks materialize or MAC’s assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements.

In addition, forward-looking statements reflect MAC’s expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this communication. MAC anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause its assessments to change. However, while MAC may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, MAC specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, except as required by law. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing MAC’s assessment as of any date subsequent to the date of this communication. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements. Appendix 1 – CSA Copper Mine Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Mineral Resource Statement Mineral Resources The following summary of all information material to understanding the reported estimates of Mineral Resources in relation to the following matters is provided. Geology and geological interpretation The CSA deposit is located within the Cobar mineral field, in the Cobar Basin. Mineralisation is hosted in the Silurian-age CSA Siltstone, a member of the Amphitheatre Group of the Cobar Supergroup sequence of rocks and is associated with zones of deformation and shearing. The CSA Siltstone consists of a sequence of rhythmic bedded siltstones and sandstones. The rock sequence was structurally deformed during the development of the Cobar Basin in the early Devonian period. Interpretation of the wireframes is based on geological mapping in the mine, drill core logging, and the structural model that has been developed over time. CSA used a threshold of 2.5% Cu to guide the interpretation of the high-grade lenses. These wireframes are generally constructed manually in Datamine software. For the QTSS Upper A however, the mineralised domains are constructed using an implicit modelling method to create the wireframes (using the Datamine vein modelling function). There is a new lower grade domain which covers the five systems for QTSN, QTSC, QTSS, Eastern and Western. These domains use a value of 1.5% Cu and form a lower-grade halo to the high-grade lenses. The construction of these lower-grade halo domains is different from the manual domain interpretations traditionally used for the high-grade lenses. In this case, a categorical indicator is applied to one metre down-hole composited drill sample assays at 1.5% Cu, and this indicator is estimated by Ordinary Kriging into a block model. The low-grade halo domain wireframe is then created at an indicator probability value of 0.4. Sampling and sub-sampling techniques Half core samples are mostly 1m in length with sample weights averaging 1.9kg. The cutting and sampling process is carried out at CSA Mine. The sampling procedures includes interval checks, cutting intervals, sampling intervals, inserting standards and blanks, sampling duplicates, weighing samples and dispatching samples. All parts of the core processing cycle are tracked and recorded electronically. Drilling techniques Drilling comprised mostly NQ and NQ2 diamond drill holes using standard tube although in 2023 all underground drilling was NQ3 size. Minor sampling from HQ, BQ, LTK48 and LTK60 sized diamond core holes. Criteria for classification Mineral Resource Classification takes into account: location of mine development, drill spacing, grade continuity, search criteria, and copper Kriging metrics. In summary: Measured has a diamond drill spacing of approximately ≤20m north-south by 37.5m vertical for QTS North and 20m north-south by 20m vertical for other systems. Indicated has a diamond drill spacing of approximately ≤40m north-south by 70m vertical (QTS North) and 40m north-south by 40m vertical (all other systems). Inferred has a diamond drill spacing of approximately ≥40m north-south by 70m vertical (QTS North) and 40m north-south by 40m vertical (all other systems). Drill density is sufficient to give confidence that the lens persists down plunge/dip. Sample analysis method Samples for assay are sent to the ALS Laboratory in Orange, NSW. All samples are assayed using ALS’ Assay Procedure – ME-OG46, Ore Grade Elements by Aqua Regia Digestion Using Conventional ICP-AES Analysis for a list of elements including Cu, Ag, Pb, Zn, Fe and S. Estimation methodology Grade estimation is by Ordinary Kriging using 1m composites within hard boundary domains defined using a 2.5% Cu threshold width a lower-grade halo around the high-grade zones using a 1.5% Cu threshold. 1m Cu composites are not top-cut as extreme values are considered real and have been accounted for by geological domain boundaries. However, Ag composites are top-cut due to extreme values for certain geological domains. Cut-off grade(s) including the basis for the selected cut-off grade(s) Mineral resources are reported above a 1.5 Cu (%) cut-off. The high-grade mineralisation interpretation is based on geology and represents a natural 2.5% Cu cut-off. Mining and metallurgical methods and parameters (other material modifying factors considered to date) The mineral resource interpretations are steeply plunging and ideal for the long hole stoping methods adopted at CSA. Stope size and standard mining block units also influenced parent block size selection. Copper processing recoveries at CSA are typically 96.8 - 98.5% producing a concentrate grade of approximately 25.98% Cu. Mineral Reserves The following is a summary of all information material to understanding the reported estimates of Mineral Reserves in relation to the following matters: Material Assumptions The material assumptions used in preparation of this Mineral Reserve are as follows: 2023 Mineral Resource estimate; Heading advance and stoping rates in-line with historical performance; Modifying factors are in line with historical data and industry norms; Mine design principles (ie: strike length, transverse width, level intervals, etc.) are in line with currently utilised mining methods and design principles; No material changes to metallurgical recoveries are expected; Production gradually ramps up from 1.1 Mtpa to 1.4 Mtpa at a rate of approximately 0.1 Mtpa per year; and Price assumptions used in the estimation include US$8,279/t of copper and US$22.60/troy ounce (“oz”) of silver; in line with long term Broker Consensus forecast copper pricing as at August 8, 2023; Mineral Reserves reported as dry, diluted, in-situ tonnes using a Stope breakeven cut-off grade of 2.2% Cu for 2024 to 2026 and a cut-off-grade of 1.65% for the remaining periods and a Development breakeven cut-off grade of 1.0% Cu; and Costs assumptions underlying cut-off grade calculation include US$78/t ore mined, US$20/t ore milled and US$21/t G&A ore milled. Criteria for Classification The criteria used for classification, including the classification of the Mineral Resources on which the Mineral Reserves are based and the confidence in the modifying factors applied are as follows: Mineral Reserves were classified based on the ration of contained Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources; Measured Mineral Resources are converted to Proved Mineral Reserves, and Indicated Mineral Resources are converted to Probable Mineral Reserves; Any contained Inferred Mineral Resource is considered as waste; No Measured Mineral Resource has been downgraded to Probable Mineral Reserve; and Appropriate modifying factors have been applied based on historic performance and in line with industry norms. Mining Methodology The mining method selected and other mining assumptions, including mining recovery factors and mining dilution factors are as follows: The mining method used is sub-level open stoping, primary in the form of top-down, transverse stoping with cemented paste backfill. There is also longitudinal and modified Avoca stoping. Some areas are mined bottom-up. There is significant operating experience with these mining methods at CSA Mine; Recovery factors used are 99% for transverse stopes, 91% for longitudinal stopes, and 97% for modified Avoca stopes; and Dilutions factors used are 13% for transverse stopes, 20% for longitudinal stopes, and 26% for modified Avoca stopes. Processing Method The processing method selected and other processing assumptions, including the recovery factors applied and the allowances made for deleterious elements are as follows: On-site processing is using a conventional flotation concentrator which has been in operation since 1965. This produces concentrate which is sent off-site for smelting and refining to produce copper cathode; Copper processing recoveries are expected to average 97.5% - 98.5% and silver recoveries are expected to be 80%; and Any deleterious elements encountered are expected to be maintained below penalty levels by managing the ore feed blend, if required. Basis for cut-off grade(s) or quality parameters applied The basis for cut-off grade(s) or quality parameters applied are as follow: A stope break-even cut-off grade of 1.65% Cu was calculated: Based on historical operating costs with gradually applied efficiency improvements reasonably anticipated by MAC; and Copper price of US$8,250 per tonne and silver price of 21.70 per troy ounce; and A stope cut-off grade of 2.20% Cu was applied prior to end-of-year 2026 with 1.65% Cu applied thereafter. This was to manage metal production during a period of increasing mining rate. Estimation Methodology The procedure used (estimation methodology) in the preparation of the Mineral Reserve are as follows: Mineable shapes were generated using Deswik.SO software; Stope dimensions are based on existing operating practices; These mineable shapes were re-evaluated against the various Mineral Resource models with all inferred material grades set to zero Shapes were then manually refined removing stopes below cutoff, in isolated areas, adding pillars as required, and removing shapes which could not practically be mined due to proximity to voids or infrastructure; Cut-offs were evaluated post application of modifying factors; Development designs and sequencing were completed for all areas to generate a Deswik schedule; The variable cut-off grade was applied, and where possible stope below the variable cutoff were delayed to later in the mine life; and The schedule was levelled based on production and development constraints to generate the Mineral Reserve Schedule. Material modifying factors Material modifying factors, including the status of environmental approvals, mining tenements and approvals, other government factors and infrastructure requirements for selected mining methods and for transportation to market are as follows: CSA Mine is an operating mine and holds Consolidated Mining Lease 5 (CML5) and two small mining purposes leases, 1093 and 1094 (MPL1093, MPL1094): CML5, MPL1093, and MPL 1094 are due to expire in 2028, 2029, and 2029 respectively; and All required government approvals and licenses for operation are in place; All materially required mining infrastructure is in place on-site for the purposes of mining, processing, and shipment of concentrate to market; and The mining methods used for the Mineral Reserve estimate are currently in use at CSA mine with extensive operating history. ____________________ 1 Please refer to MAC’s Announcement dated 19 March 2024 titled ‘CSA Copper Mine Reports Drill Results’.

As previously reported in the Company’s Notification of Late Filing on Form 12b-25 filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024, the Company was unable to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, within the prescribed period because of delays experienced by the Company in preparing its consolidated financial statements. The delays relate to recent finance staff turnover of those directly involved in preparing the Delinquent Report, and the need for additional time to complete the calculation of revenue recognition for certain contracts for the year ended December 31, 2023. Jeff Wolf, CEO of Scorpius, stated, “We regret the delay in filing our Form 10-K, due in part to substantive changes within our organization. We expect to file our year-end financial results in short order. Most importantly, we remain committed to maintaining the highest standards of financial reporting and corporate governance.” The Company is now subject to the procedures and requirements set forth in Section 1007 of the NYSE American Company Guide. Within five days of the date of the Filing Delinquency Notification, the Company was required to (a) contact the Exchange to discuss the status of the Delinquent Report and (b) issue a press release disclosing the occurrence of the Filing Delinquency, the reason for the Filing Delinquency and, if known, the anticipated date such Filing Delinquency will be cured via the filing or refiling of the applicable report, as the case may be. During the six-month period from the date of the Filing Delinquency (the ""Initial Cure Period""), the NYSE will monitor the Company and the status of the Delinquent Report and any subsequent delayed filings, including through contact with the Company, until the Filing Delinquency is cured. If the Company fails to cure the Filing Delinquency within the Initial Cure Period, the Exchange may, in the Exchange’s sole discretion, allow the Company’s securities to be traded for up to an additional six-month period (the ""Additional Cure Period"") depending on the Company’s specific circumstances. If the Exchange determines that an Additional Cure Period is not appropriate, suspension and delisting procedures will commence in accordance with the procedures set out in Section 1010 of the NYSE American Company Guide. If the Exchange determines that an Additional Cure Period of up to six months is appropriate and the Company fails to file its Delinquent Report and any subsequent delayed filings by the end of that period, suspension and delisting procedures will generally commence. An issuer is not eligible to follow the procedures outlined in Section 1009 with respect to these criteria. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, the Exchange may in its sole discretion decide (i) not to afford an issuer any Initial Cure Period or Additional Cure Period, as the case may be, at all or (ii) at any time during the Initial Cure Period or Additional Cure Period, to truncate the Initial Cure Period or Additional Cure Period, as the case may be, and immediately commence suspension and delisting procedures if the Company is subject to delisting pursuant to any other provision of the Company Guide, including if the Exchange believes, in the NYSE’s sole discretion, that continued listing and trading of an issuer's securities on the Exchange is inadvisable or unwarranted in accordance with Sections 1001-1006 hereof. The Company intends to regain compliance with the NYSE American continued listing standards. There can be no assurance that the Company will ultimately regain compliance with all applicable NYSE American continued listing standards. Scorpius Holdings, Inc.

Legal Expert The Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) move to block the merger between Tapestry, Inc. and Capri Holdings Limited has significant implications. In similar historical contexts, antitrust suits challenge the structure of a potentially monopolistic market where consumer choice could be hampered. Tapestry's rebuttal centers on the defense that the luxury market is neither homogenous nor static, implying that the merger would not result in unfair competitive advantage. From a legal standpoint, the outcome of this suit will hinge on how the court interprets market dynamics and competitive environments within antitrust laws.For investors, the legal battle that lies ahead introduces uncertainty which could affect stock volatility for both companies. A prolonged legal proceeding might strain resources and attention from corporate strategy, potentially impacting financial performance in the short to medium term. However, should Tapestry prevail, the acquisition could indeed position the new entity for a more robust global presence and diversified product offering, potentially unlocking shareholder value over the long term. Financial Analyst The FTC's action against Tapestry's proposed acquisition is a critical financial juncture for the company. Investors should be cognizant of how regulatory scrutiny can impact mergers and acquisitions, often causing delays or even derailing deals. The stakes are high for Tapestry, as the merger promises access to new markets and consumer segments, likely translating into revenue growth opportunities.Should the transaction proceed, synergies from the merger could lead to cost reductions and increased efficiency. On the flip side, the costs associated with defending the transaction in court could weigh on Tapestry's financials. It's essential to monitor how the legal costs, potential divestitures, or other concessions to regulators might affect the company's balance sheet and overall financial health. Market Research Analyst The assertion that the luxury goods sector is fragmented and highly competitive is a critical component of Tapestry's argument. From a market analysis perspective, the merger's potential to drive growth hinges on successfully leveraging each brand's distinct consumer base and geographic reach. The combined entity's ability to innovate and appeal to consumers can be a key differentiator in a market where brand loyalty and consumer trends shift rapidly.The investor community should pay close attention to consumer reactions to the merger announcement and any potential changes in brand perception. While Tapestry anticipates positive consumer response, any negative public sentiment or brand dilution could impact long-term profitability. Understanding consumer behavior in high-end markets is essential for evaluating the potential success of such a merger. 04/22/2024 - 04:59 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Tapestry, Inc. (NYSE: TPR), a house of iconic accessories and lifestyle brands consisting of Coach, Kate Spade, and Stuart Weitzman, today issued the following statement in response to the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) attempt to block its proposed acquisition of Capri Holdings Limited (NYSE: CPRI), a global luxury fashion group consisting of Versace, Jimmy Choo, and Michael Kors: “There is no question that this is a pro-competitive, pro-consumer deal and that the FTC fundamentally misunderstands both the marketplace and the way in which consumers shop. Tapestry and Capri operate in an intensely competitive and highly fragmented industry alongside hundreds of rival brands, including both established players and new entrants. We also compete for consumers who are cross-shopping a wide range of channels and brands along a vast pricing spectrum when considering what to purchase. The reality is that consumers have a host of choices when shopping for luxury handbags and accessories, footwear, and apparel, and they are exercising them. The bottom line is that Tapestry and Capri face competitive pressures from both lower- and higher-priced products. In bringing this case, the FTC has chosen to ignore the reality of today’s dynamic and expanding $200 billion global luxury industry. This transaction will unite six brands that offer products across a wide range of categories. With Capri, Tapestry will gain access to a broader set of global luxury consumers and geographies and will drive sustainable, healthy growth for Capri’s iconic brands, building desire and engagement with consumers globally. Tapestry has a strong record of not only innovating for consumers but also providing industry-leading wages and benefits for our employees. The combined company will continue to set the bar for both consumer and employee experiences. We have full confidence in the merits and pro-competitive nature of this transaction. It will bring significant benefits to the combined company’s customers, employees, partners, and shareholders in the U.S. and around the world. We have strong legal arguments in defense of this transaction and look forward to presenting them in court and working expeditiously to close the transaction in calendar year 2024.” The FTC is the last regulator yet to approve the transaction. About Tapestry, Inc. Our global house of brands unites the magic of Coach, kate spade new york and Stuart Weitzman. Each of our brands are unique and independent, while sharing a commitment to innovation and authenticity defined by distinctive products and differentiated customer experiences across channels and geographies. We use our collective strengths to move our customers and empower our communities, to make the fashion industry more sustainable, and to build a company that’s equitable, inclusive, and diverse.

Browning West is urging shareholders to vote for their highly qualified director candidates at the upcoming Annual Meeting of Shareholders on May 28, 2024. Negative The Board's reluctance to reinstate Glenn as CEO despite shareholder demands could lead to continued unrest. The reactive sale process collapse could impact the company negatively in the long term. The ongoing board disputes and entrenchment tactics may create uncertainty among investors. The potential disruption caused by the Board's actions could affect the company's performance and shareholder value. 04/22/2024 - 04:50 PM Gratified That Board Leadership, Including the Chairman and Every Committee Chair, Has Seemingly Acknowledged Their Many Failures by Resigning En Masse Question Why the Board Has Gone to Such Lengths to Allow Vince Tyra to Remain CEO Despite His Track Record of Value Destruction and Amid Unprecedented Shareholder Calls to Reinstate Glenn Chamandy Remind Shareholders That Electing the Full Browning West Slate is the Only Clear Path to Reinstating Glenn Chamandy as CEO to Generate Outstanding Shareholder Returns LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Browning West, LP (together with its affiliates, “Browning West” or “we”), which is a long-term shareholder of Gildan Activewear Inc. (NYSE: GIL) (TSX: GIL) (“Gildan” or the “Company”) that beneficially owns approximately 5.0% of the Company’s outstanding shares and Glenn Chamandy, Gildan’s co-founder and former CEO, today issued the following statements regarding the Company’s defensive maneuver to add replacement directors to its Board of Directors (the “Board”). Usman S. Nabi and Peter M. Lee of Browning West commented: “The Board’s list of failures grows by the week: beginning with its botched succession process, followed by numerous diligence failures, a reactive and misguided sale process, and now a desperate and defensive Board refreshment. The most glaring omission in the Board’s latest maneuver is its failure to reinstate Glenn as CEO and its unwavering commitment to Vince Tyra – including from new directors – despite his record of value destruction and poor personal judgment. The reinstatement of Glenn has been a central and consistent demand from an unprecedented mass of shareholders, which the Board refuses to acknowledge in favor of its own interests. It is also clear that the newly announced directors are objectively less qualified than Browning West’s director candidates, who possess best-in-class track records of value creation and relevant experience. It is critical for shareholders to understand that only through the appointment of our full slate can Glenn return as CEO and implement our superior value creation plan, which is designed to deliver a stock price of over $60 USD by the end of 2025 and $100 USD within five years. Contrary to the Board’s false and misleading statements, support for Glenn and our full slate is growing and stronger than ever. While we are gratified that every single incumbent director responsible for the Board’s many failures is stepping aside, we are disappointed that it is due in part to the Board’s relentless focus on protecting Vince Tyra to avoid accountability. We remain steadfast in our belief that the election of each of our eight highly qualified directors and Glenn’s return as CEO represent the best path forward for Gildan. Considering the Board has a history of diligence failures and recruiting underqualified executives, it has not earned the right to hand-select its own replacement directors. Finally, we believe that today’s announcement was likely triggered by the collapse of the Board’s reactive sale process, which it is clearly trying to bury in the 2,500+ word press release. It is time for Gildan’s Board to immediately cease its excessive and wasteful spending of shareholder capital on its misguided sale process and numerous entrenchment tactics.” Glenn Chamandy, Gildan’s co-founder and former CEO, commented: “When I return to Gildan as CEO, I want to be supported by the highest quality Board with relevant experience. I have spent time with members of the Browning West slate and believe they possess necessary track records of value creation, expertise in successful succession planning and corporate governance, and relevant operational, industry, and ESG experience. In addition, it is critical that I am supported by a Chairman who has a strong record as an operating CEO and Chair, which Mike Kneeland clearly possesses, and that there is an owners’ mindset in the boardroom, which Peter Lee of Browning West clearly possesses. The Browning West slate represents the best Board for all Gildan stakeholders.” As a reminder, Browning West is seeking to elect eight highly qualified and independent director candidates to Gildan’s Board at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders on May 28, 2024. Browning West’s director candidates possess strong track records of value creation, expertise in successful succession planning, relevant industry and governance experience, as well as proven management and board service pedigrees in Canada and the U.S. Shareholders are encouraged to visit www.SuperchargeGildan.com to download a copy of the slate’s operating plan, learn how to vote for Browning West’s slate of highly qualified director candidates, and sign up for important campaign updates.

La First Bank ha annunciato un forte primo trimestre del 2024 con un utile netto di 12,5 milioni di dollari, che riflette miglioramenti nei parametri di redditività, una costante qualità degli asset e una crescita del valore contabile tangibile per azione. Il ritorno su asset medi, patrimonio netto e patrimonio tangibile della Banca ha registrato significativi aumenti rispetto all'anno precedente. I ricavi da interessi netti, i ricavi non derivanti da interessi e gli asset totali hanno mostrato trend positivi. Tuttavia, le spese non derivanti da interessi sono aumentate, influenzando l'andamento complessivo della Banca. First Bank anunció un sólido primer trimestre de 2024 con un ingreso neto de $12.5 millones, reflejando mejoras en los indicadores de rentabilidad, calidad estable de los activos y crecimiento en el valor tangible del libro por acción. El retorno sobre los activos promedio, el patrimonio y el patrimonio tangible del Banco mostraron incrementos significativos en comparación con el año anterior.

First Bank a annoncé un solide premier trimestre 2024 avec un revenu net de 12,5 millions de dollars, reflétant une amélioration des indicateurs de rentabilité, une qualité d'actif stable et une croissance de la valeur comptable tangible par action. Les retours sur les actifs moyens, les capitaux propres, et les capitaux tangibles de la Banque ont tous connu des augmentations significatives par rapport à l'année précédente. Les revenus d'intérêts nets, les revenus non-intérêts et les actifs totaux ont également montré des tendances positives. Cependant, les dépenses non-intérêts ont augmenté, impactant la performance globale de la Banque. Die First Bank verkündete ein starkes erstes Quartal 2024 mit einem Nettogewinn von 12,5 Millionen Dollar, was verbesserte Rentabilitätskennzahlen, eine stabile Vermögensqualität und Wachstum im materiellen Buchwert pro Aktie widerspiegelt. Die Bank verzeichnete im Vergleich zum Vorjahr signifikante Zuwächse bei der Rendite auf durchschnittliche Vermögenswerte, Eigenkapital und materielles Eigenkapital. Auch die Nettozins- und Nichtzins-Erträge sowie die Gesamtvermögen zeigten positive Trends. Jedoch stiegen die Nichtzinskosten, was sich auf die Gesamtleistung der Bank auswirkte. Positive Net income for the first quarter of 2024 was $12.5 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, up from $7.0 million in the same period in 2023. Return on average assets, equity, and tangible equity increased to 1.41%, 13.36%, and 15.64%, respectively. Total deposits and loans remained stable, asset quality improved, and tangible book value per share grew by 13%. Net interest income rose by $7.5 million, driven by higher interest income on loans. Non-interest income increased to $2.0 million, reflecting growth in customer activity and a one-time benefit. Total assets increased by 27.5% to $3.59 billion, with total loans growing by 25.1% to $2.99 billion. Nonperforming loans and assets decreased, and the Bank maintained a strong liquidity position. The Bank declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share to common stockholders. Overall, the Bank demonstrated strong performance metrics and solid financial health in the first quarter of 2024. Negative Non-interest expenses increased by 31.9% due to operating expenses associated with acquisitions. Net interest margin decreased slightly, impacted by increased deposit costs and loan prepayment penalties. Total loans decreased by 1.0% from the prior quarter, driven by reductions in investor real estate lending. The Bank recorded a credit loss benefit of $698,000, but non-interest expenses rose by $4.3 million. While total assets and deposits increased, there was a decline in total loans and an increase in non-interest expenses. Financial Analyst The reported net income increase of $12.5 million for the first quarter for First Bank represents a substantial uptick, especially considering the year-over-year growth from $7.0 million. This signifies a robust enhancement in profitability, potentially driven by strategic initiatives such as the Malvern acquisition, which is also reflected in the amplified net interest income of $30.3 million, a 33% year-over-year climb.As loan portfolios expanded further, the growth in interest income has outpaced interest expense, notwithstanding the increased cost of deposits – a healthy sign for net interest margins, which have expanded by 12 basis points. However, investors should weigh these positives against the decline in total loans by 1% compared to the previous quarter, which suggests a strategic shift towards more profitable commercial lending, albeit potentially limiting top-line growth prospects.In terms of efficiency, the Bank's efficiency ratio staying below 60% for the nineteenth consecutive quarter is notable. This indicates that the Bank is managing its expenses well relative to its revenue, which is an important aspect for investor consideration regarding operational effectiveness. Credit Risk Analyst Maintaining strong asset quality is imperative for banks and First Bank’s reduction in nonperforming assets to 0.64% of total assets reflects well-implemented credit risk controls. These metrics are particularly important given the current uncertain economic climate. Moreover, the Bank has reported a credit loss benefit of $698,000, suggesting that First Bank has not only managed current risks well but also expects stable or improving asset quality going forward.Excluding the impact from Purchased Credit Deteriorated (PCD) loans, the slight uptick in nonperforming loans could be seen as a potential warning sign. However, this needs to be balanced against the overall context of their asset mix and the strategic disposal of specific loan categories. The continued decline in the allowance for credit losses ratio—from 1.40% at 2023 end, to 1.22%—aligns with these positive asset quality indicators, yet it requires ongoing vigilance in monitoring. Market Analyst The tangible book value per share increase to $13.06 suggests that shareholders' equity is strengthening, which is an essential metric for evaluating the underlying value of the Bank. It’s noteworthy that this measure grew 13% annualized from the previous quarter, indicating a solid underlying financial health from a market perspective.Additionally, the Bank’s strategic management of its deposit mix in response to changing interest rate environments and the retirement of high-cost subordinated notes associated with the Malvern acquisition are both affirmations of a proactive interest rate risk management strategy. This could have positive implications for their interest expense and overall cost of capital moving forward.Looking at the declared cash dividend of $0.06 per share, it underlines a commitment to shareholder returns, providing a direct benefit to investors and signaling confidence in the Bank’s liquidity and profit-generating capacity. 04/22/2024 - 04:37 PM Results benefited from our expanded customer base, repositioned balance sheet, and solid asset qualityHAMILTON, N.J., April 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- First Bank (Nasdaq Global Market: FRBA) (the Bank) today announced results for the first quarter of 2024. Net income for the first quarter of 2024 was $12.5 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, compared to $7.0 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2023. Return on average assets, return on average equity and return on average tangible equity[i] for the first quarter of 2024 were 1.41%, 13.36% and 15.64%, respectively, compared to 1.03%, 9.70% and 10.39%, respectively, for the first quarter of 2023. First Quarter 2024 Performance Highlights: The Bank’s primary measures of profitability broadly improved from the first quarter of 2023. Return on average assets grew by 38 basis points, return on average equity grew by 366 basis points, return on average tangible equity grew by 525 basis points, and net interest margin expanded by 12 basis points to 3.64%.Total deposits of $2.97 billion at March 31, 2024 remained in line with balances for the linked quarter ended December 31, 2023.Total loans measured $2.99 billion at March 31, 2024, declining 1% from the linked quarter as the Bank continued to prioritize profitable commercial lending and reduced its investor real estate portfolio.Strong asset quality continued, with nonperforming assets declining to 0.64% of total assets at March 31, 2024 compared to 0.69% at December 31, 2023.Net recoveries, excluding purchase credit deteriorated (PCD) loans, as a percentage of average loans measuring (0.03)% for first quarter 2024, and a credit loss benefit measuring $698,000 recorded for the quarter.Tangible book value per share[ii] grew to $13.06 at March 31, 2024, increasing 13.0%, annualized, from $12.65 at December 31, 2023. Patrick L. Ryan, President and CEO of First Bank, reflected on the Bank’s performance, stating, “First Bank’s first quarter 2024 performance demonstrated our ability to deliver outstanding results in a challenging environment. We entered 2024 primed for profitability with a reconfigured balance sheet, an expanded customer base, outstanding asset quality, and a solid liquidity position. During the first quarter we continued to drive core deposits, produced a solid net interest margin of 3.64%, grew tangible book value per share by an annualized 13%, and maintained an efficiency ratio under 60% for the nineteenth consecutive quarter — all without growing the balance sheet. Our results demonstrate our ability to build on the momentum we created in 2023.” Mr. Ryan added, “We continue to seek ways to optimize our franchise, as demonstrated by the recent quarter’s subordinated notes redemption, which eliminated a costly source of acquired debt. Our continued focus on core deposit generation should further support our liquidity position, particularly as we continue to grow our specialty niche lending businesses and grow and improve our online banking capabilities. Likewise, we maintain a steady focus on quality lending – loans that are attractively priced and structured, to the most creditworthy customers. We expect our well-positioned balance sheet, alongside thoughtful investments in business units and information technology, will continue to support a meaningful return for our shareholders.” Income Statement In the first quarter of 2024, the Bank’s net interest income increased to $30.3 million, growing $7.5 million, or 33.0%, compared to the same period in 2023. Growth reflects an increase of $17.6 million in interest income on loans which outpaced the $11.4 million increase in interest expense on deposits in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter in 2023. The increase was primarily a result of higher interest income from loans due to substantial loan growth related to the Malvern acquisition in the third quarter of 2023 and higher loan yields, which were partially offset by increased interest expense related to the higher cost of deposits and expanded deposit base. Net interest income decreased $681,000, or 2.2%, over the linked fourth quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by an increase of $1.1 million in interest expense on deposits, which resulted from continued deposit pricing pressure and the gradual shift of deposit mix towards higher-cost, interest-bearing deposits in the current interest rate environment. The Bank’s tax equivalent net interest margin measured 3.64% for the first quarter of 2024, increasing by 12 basis points compared to the prior year quarter and decreasing by four basis points from 3.68% for the fourth quarter of 2023. Impacting our tax equivalent margin was loan prepayment penalty fees and amortization of premiums and discounts from fair value measurements of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions. For the quarter ended March 31, 2024 loan prepayment penalty fees totaled $445,000 compared to $198,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 and $238,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2023. Amortization of premiums and discounts from fair value measurements of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions totaled $4.2 million during the first quarter of 2024 compared to $25,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 and $3.9 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. Excluding the impact of purchase accounting accretion, we continued to see pressure on the net interest margin, primarily driven by increased deposit costs which outpaced increased yields on interest-earning assets. The Bank recorded a credit loss benefit totaling $698,000 during the first quarter of 2024, compared to a credit loss expense totaling $1.1 million for the same period of the previous year and a $294,000 credit loss benefit for the fourth quarter of 2023. The benefits during the current and linked quarters were primarily due to the Bank’s strong and stable asset quality and lack of loan growth during the quarters. The credit loss expense for the first quarter of 2023 was commensurate with organic loan growth during the quarter. In the first quarter of 2024, the Bank recorded non-interest income totaling $2.0 million, compared to $1.0 million during the same period in 2023 and non-interest income measuring $(3.0) million during the fourth quarter of 2023. Non-interest income grew $1.0 million from the prior year quarter, reflecting increased customer activity related to the Malvern acquisition and a $187,000 one-time bank-owned life insurance (BOLI) death benefit in first quarter 2024. Results for the fourth quarter of 2023 included $4.7 million in combined losses on the sale of investments and loans, which were netted against non-interest income on the consolidated statements of income. The losses were primarily related to the Bank’s 2023 balance sheet repositioning initiatives, which included the sale of Malvern investments and lower-yielding residential and commercial investor real estate loans. Non-interest expense for the first quarter of 2024 was $17.8 million, an increase of $4.3 million, or 31.9%, compared to $13.5 million for the prior year quarter. Higher non-interest expense was largely due to the increased operating expenses associated with the Malvern acquisition, including increases of $2.2 million in salaries and employee benefits due to a larger employee base, $447,000 in occupancy and equipment due to an expanded network of facilities, $368,000 in regulatory fees, and $1.1 million in other expense. The increase in other expense was primarily due to an increase in core deposit intangible amortization and higher Pennsylvania shares tax. This was partially offset by the absence of merger-related expenses for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $461,000 recorded during the first quarter of 2023. On a linked quarter basis, non-interest expense declined $126,000, or 0.7%, from $17.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. The linked quarter change reflects the largely offsetting impact of a $1.0 million increase in salaries and benefits and decreases of $338,000 in merger-related expenses, $241,000 in regulatory fees, $236,000 in other professional fees, $172,000 in marketing and advertising costs, and $213,000 in other expenses. These declines primarily related to the full impact of cost savings realized from the Malvern acquisition coupled with some one-time/non-recurring expenses during the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase in salary and employee benefits was due to a combination of companywide year-end salary increases at the beginning of March 2024, higher payroll taxes due to bonus payments made in the first quarter of 2024 and to a lesser extent increases in bonus expense and other employee benefit costs. Income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $2.7 million with an effective tax rate of 17.5%, compared to $2.2 million with an effective tax rate of 23.7% for the first quarter of 2023 and $2.0 million with an effective tax rate of 19.1% for the fourth quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2024 was lower due to certain one-time adjustments primarily related to the finalization of Malvern tax returns during the period. We expect our effective tax rate to be in-line with historic levels between 23-25% going forward. Balance Sheet The Bank reported total assets of $3.59 billion as of March 31, 2024, an increase of $774.5 million, or 27.5%, from $2.82 billion at March 31, 2023. Total loans increased $599.8 million, or 25.1%, to $2.99 billion at March 31, 2024 compared to $2.39 billion at March 31, 2023. Increases primarily reflect growth from the Malvern acquisition, partially offset by sales of loans and investment securities totaling approximately $238.2 million during 2023. Excluding loans acquired from Malvern totaling $582.3 million at March 31, 2024, which is net of loan sales and pay-downs since the acquisition, net organic loan growth was $17.5 million during the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 which reflects our prioritization of balance sheet efficiency over growth. Total assets decreased $17.9 million, or 0.5%, from December 31, 2023 to March 31, 2024. Total loans decreased $29.1 million, or 1.0%, from December 31, 2023 to March 31, 2024. A decline of commercial investor real estate loans totaling $42.8 million, including multi-family and construction and development, was partially offset by growth totaling $15.4 million across the owner-occupied commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loan portfolios during the first quarter of 2024. The Bank continues to prioritize relationship-based commercial lending while actively reducing our concentration in investor real estate lending. As of March 31, 2024, the Bank's total deposits were $2.97 billion, an increase of $728.5 million, or 32.5%, from $2.24 billion at March 31, 2023. Excluding $671.9 million in deposits acquired from Malvern, deposit balances increased $56.6 million, or 2.5% for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. Organic deposit growth was primarily due to our team’s success in attracting new deposit relationships and maintaining existing balances while also allowing some higher-cost and non-core funding to leave the Bank. Heightened industry-wide pricing competition also tempered deposit growth. While deposits remained stable at $2.97 billion compared to December 31, 2023, we experienced a slight shift of customers moving into higher-yielding interest-bearing deposits. During the first quarter of 2024, increases in money market deposits and savings, and time deposits totaling $48.2 million and $33.7 million, respectively, were offset by declines in interest-bearing demand deposits and non-interest-bearing deposits totaling $48.2 million and $31.0 million, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, stockholders’ equity increased by $11.4 million, primarily due to net income, partially offset by dividends. As of March 31, 2024, the Bank continued to exceed all regulatory capital requirements to be considered well-capitalized, with a Tier 1 Leverage ratio of 9.27%, a Tier 1 Risk-Based capital ratio of 9.46%, a Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio of 9.46%, and a Total Risk-Based capital ratio of 11.39%. The tangible stockholders' equity to tangible assets ratio[iii] increased to 9.27% as of March 31, 2024 compared to 8.89% at December 31, 2023. Asset Quality First Bank's asset quality metrics for the first quarter of 2024 remained favorable. Total nonperforming loans declined from $25.0 million at December 31, 2023 to $17.1 million at March 31, 2024 while total nonperforming assets declined from $25.0 million to $23.1 million. The decline in nonperforming loans was primarily attributable to the transfer of an $11.5 million Malvern-acquired PCD loan with a $5.5 million specific reserve, which was reserved for through acquisition accounting marks at the time of the Malvern acquisition, to other real estate owned (OREO). This transfer increased OREO by $6.0 million, reduced the Bank’s total nonperforming loans and the $5.5 million specific reserve was charged-off through the allowance for credit losses. PCD loans totaled $5.4 million at March 31, 2024 and $17.0 million at December 31, 2023. Excluding PCD loans, nonperforming loans increased from $8.0 million at December 31, 2023 to $11.7 at March 31, 2024. Nonperforming loans, excluding PCD loans, as a percentage of total loans were 0.39% at March 31, 2024, compared to 0.26% at December 31, 2023 and 0.33% at March 31, 2023. The Bank recorded net recoveries of $202,000 during the first quarter of 2024, excluding the $5.5 million PCD loan charge-off, compared to net charge-offs of $209,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023 and net charge-offs of $315,000 in the first quarter of 2023. The allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of total loans measured 1.22% at March 31, 2024, compared to 1.40% at December 31, 2023 and 1.25% at March 31, 2023. The decline from December 31, 2023 to March 31, 2024 reflected the elimination of the Bank’s reserves on the PCD loan transferred to OREO during the period. Liquidity and Borrowings On February 15, 2024, the Bank retired $25 million of subordinated notes inherited from Malvern as part of its balance sheet repositioning initiative. The notes carried a 9.79% interest rate at the time of redemption. The Bank maintained its stable liquidity position in the first quarter of 2024. Despite utilizing cash to retire the subordinated debt, total cash and cash equivalents increased by $1.0 million to $229.0 million at March 31, 2024. Borrowings declined by $7.5 million compared to December 31, 2023. The Bank’s current liquidity position coupled with the balance sheet flexibility gained after the Malvern acquisition provides the Bank with a strong liquidity base and a diverse source of funding options. Cash Dividend Declared On April 16, 2024, the Bank’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share to common stockholders of record at the close of business on May 10, 2024, payable on May 24, 2024.

Further, certain factors that could affect our future results and cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: changes in market interest rates may increase funding costs and reduce earning asset yields thus reducing margin; the impact of changes in interest rates and the credit quality and strength of underlying collateral and the effect of such changes on the market value of First Bank's investment securities portfolio; whether First Bank can: successfully implement its growth strategy, including identifying acquisition targets and consummating suitable acquisitions, integrate acquired entities and realize anticipated efficiencies, sustain its internal growth rate, and provide competitive products and services that appeal to its customers and target markets; difficult market conditions and unfavorable economic trends in the United States generally, and particularly in the market areas in which First Bank operates and in which its loans are concentrated, including the effects of declines in housing market values; the effects of the recent turmoil in the banking industry (including the failures of two financial institutions in early 2023); the impact of public health emergencies, such as COVID-19, on First Bank, its operations and its customers and employees; an increase in unemployment levels and slowdowns in economic growth; First Bank's level of nonperforming assets and the costs associated with resolving any problem loans including litigation and other costs; the extensive federal and state regulation, supervision and examination governing almost every aspect of First Bank's operations, including changes in regulations affecting financial institutions and expenses associated with complying with such regulations; uncertainties in tax estimates and valuations, including due to changes in state and federal tax law; First Bank's ability to comply with applicable capital and liquidity requirements, including First Bank’s ability to generate liquidity internally or raise capital on favorable terms, including continued access to the debt and equity capital markets; and possible changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies, laws and regulations and other activities of governments, agencies, and similar organizations. For discussion of these and other risks that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, please refer to “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in First Bank’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and any updates to those risk factors set forth in First Bank’s proxy statement, subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K. If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if First Bank’s underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from what First Bank anticipates. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and First Bank does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. All forward-looking statements, expressed or implied, included in this communication are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. This cautionary statement should also be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that First Bank or persons acting on First Bank’s behalf may issue. i Return on average tangible equity is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure and is calculated by dividing net income by average tangible equity (average equity minus average goodwill and other intangible assets).

La baisse était principalement due au remboursement d'une dette de 3,0 millions de dollars, entraînant une radiation de 566 000 dollars.

März 2024 endete, bekannt und meldete einen Nettogewinn von 2,6 Millionen Dollar oder 0,24 Dollar pro verwässerter Aktie, verglichen mit 3,1 Millionen Dollar oder 0,39 Dollar pro Aktie im gleichen Zeitraum des Vorjahres. Der Rückgang war hauptsächlich auf die Tilgung von Schulden in Höhe von 3,0 Millionen Dollar zurückzuführen, was zu einer Abschreibung von 566.000 Dollar führte. Die Rendite auf durchschnittliche Vermögenswerte und Eigenkapital verringerte sich, während Kredite und Einlagen leichte Zuwächse verzeichneten. Das Unternehmen verbuchte eine Vorsorge für Kreditverluste und verzeichnete Veränderungen in seiner finanziellen Lage, Verbindlichkeiten, Einlagen und Eigenkapital der Aktionäre. Nicht leistungsfähige Vermögenswerte blieben stabil, und die Betriebsergebnisse zeigten einen Rückgang des Nettozins- und Nichtzins-Einkommens sowie einen Anstieg der Nichtzins-Ausgaben.

Return on average assets and equity decreased compared to the same period last year. Loans increased by $3.9 million, while deposits increased by $5.4 million from the previous quarter. The company recorded a provision for credit losses of $18,000 in Q1 2024. Total assets, liabilities, and stockholders' equity showed changes during the quarter. Non-performing assets remained stable at $10.9 million. Net interest income and noninterest income saw declines, while noninterest expenses increased. Income tax expenses and effective tax rates fluctuated between Q1 2024 and Q1 2023. Negative The decrease in net income was primarily due to paying off debt and a write-off of $566,000. Return on average assets and equity decreased compared to the same period last year. Noninterest income decreased primarily due to lower income on insurance policies. Noninterest expenses increased, driven by higher compensation and benefits expenses. Income tax expenses and effective tax rates fluctuated between Q1 2024 and Q1 2023. Financial Analyst The recent financial disclosure by BV Financial, Inc. indicates a decrease in net income for Q1 2024, attributed mainly to a sizeable write-off related to junior subordinated debt payoff. While such a write-off is a one-time expense, investors should note the underlying shift in interest expenses and the possible implications for future quarters. The return on average equity (ROAE) significantly dropped from 12.57% to 5.14% year-over-year, which could suggest a decreased efficiency in generating shareholder value. However, the increase in total assets driven by a rise in loans receivable and deposit growth provides a contrasting sign of solid operational footing.Investors typically look at the net interest margin (NIM) as a key indicator of a bank's profitability. The compression of BV Financial's NIM from 4.34% to 3.91% reflects the interest rate environment's challenges, compounded by the increased cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The shift in deposit strategy, replacing retail certificates with lower-cost brokered deposits, demonstrates an adaptive measure to control interest expenses. This strategic agility can be both a strength and a risk, depending on execution and market dynamics. Credit Analyst An essential element for evaluating a financial institution's health is its asset quality. BV Financial's non-performing assets have remained relatively stable, which is reassuring. However, the coverage ratio has slightly dipped from 82.9% to 79.2%, which may be something to monitor over subsequent quarters. The provision for credit losses remains low, indicating management's confidence in asset quality but warrants attention as economic conditions fluctuate.On the liability side, the pay-off of higher-rate subordinated debt is a proactive measure in managing cost of capital. Considering the current financial landscape, this could be advantageous in the long term, although it has led to a short-term increase in interest expense. An informed investor should balance these present costs with future benefits of reduced interest payments and potentially improved net interest margin. 04/22/2024 - 04:45 PM BALTIMORE, MD / ACCESSWIRE / April 22, 2024 / BV Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ:BVFL), (the ""Company"") the holding company for BayVanguard Bank (the ""Bank""), reported net income of $2.6 million or $0.24 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 compared to net income of $3.1 million or $0.39 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2023.Financial HighlightsDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Company paid off $3.0 million in junior subordinated debt assumed via previous acquisition that had an interest rate in the most recent quarter of 8.49%. This resulted in the write-off (increase in interest expense) of the remaining purchase accounting fair market value adjustment of $566,000. This write-off was the primary contributor to the decrease in net income in the quarter ended March 31, 2024 when compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2023.Return on average assets and return on average equity for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 were 1.16% and 5.14%, respectively.

In the quarter ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $435,000 consisting of $354,000 in the provision for credit losses - loans and $81,000 in the provision for credit losses for unfunded commitments.Financial ConditionTotal Assets. Total assets were $892.5 million at March 31, 2024, an increase of $7.2 million, or 0.82%, from $885.3 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was due primarily to a $5.1 million increase in cash and a $3.9 million increase in loans receivable funded by an increase in deposits and quarterly net income. The increase in deposits included the issuance of $10 million in brokered deposits during the period.Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents increased $5.1 million, or 6.9%, to $78.8 million at March 31, 2024 from $73. 7million at December 31, 2023 primarily due to the increase in deposits.Net Loans Receivable. Loans receivable increased $3.9 million, or 0.56%, to $708.7 million at March 31, 2024 from $704.8 million at December 31, 2023. Increases in commercial and industrial loans of $7.0 million and investor commercial real estate loans of $4.9 million offset decreases in owner and non-owner occupied one- to four-family loans and owner occupied commercial real estate loans.Securities. Securities available for sale (""AFS"") decreased $1.0 million, or 3.0%, to $33.8 million at March 31, 2024 from $34.8 million at December 31, 2023.

Total liabilities increased $4.6 million or 0.7%, to $690.8 million at March 31, 2024 from $686.2 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in total deposits of $5.4 million, and an increase in escrow accounts and other accrued balances offsetting the pay-off of the junior subordinated debt.Deposits. Total deposits increased $5.4 million, or 0.85%, to $639.5 million at March 31, 2024 from $634.1 million at December 31, 2023.

At March 31 2024, the allowance for credit losses on loans was $8.5 million, which represented 1.20% of total loans and 79.2% of non-performing loans compared to $8.6 million at December 31, 2023, which represented 1.21% of total loans and 82.9% of non-performing loans.Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Ended March 31, 2024 and 2023Net Interest Income. Net interest income was $8.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to $8.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023. The net interest margin for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was 3.91% compared to 4.34% for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The 125 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities offset the higher average balances and rates earned on loans and short-term investments. Included in interest expense is the above-mentioned write-off of the $566,000 remaining fair market value adjustment on the pay-off the $3.0 million junior subordinated debt. Additionally, the cost of interest-bearing deposits increased by 109 basis points to 1.62% in the quarter ended March 31, 2024 compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2023.Noninterest Income. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, noninterest income totaled $578,000 compared to $807,000 in the quarter ended March 31, 2023.

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, noninterest expense totaled $4.9 million compared to $4.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Compensation and benefits expenses increased by 8.7% due to increases in staffing and salary levels. Other expenses increased $116,000 or 22.7% primarily due to higher fraud losses. Professional fees decreased by $88,000 or 44.0% due to the recovery of previously expensed legal fees of $109,000 on the disposition of a problem loan. Foreclosed real estate expenses decreased by $122,000 or 96.1% due to the sale of large foreclosed real estate properties in 2023.Income taxes. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, income tax expense was $1.0 million for an effective tax rate of 28.5%. In the quarter ended March 31, 2023, income tax expense was $1.2 million for an effective tax rate of 27.65%. The lower tax rate in the quarter ended March 31, 2023 was due to a higher level of income from life insurance in that quarter.Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release may contain certain forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations regarding economic, legislative and regulatory issues that may impact the Company's earnings in future periods.

(Nasdaq: NGNE), a clinical-stage company founded to bring life-changing genetic medicines to patients and families affected by rare neurological diseases, today announced that initial safety and tolerability data from its ongoing Phase 1/2 gene therapy clinical trial for Rett syndrome will be presented at the American Society for Gene and Cell Therapy (ASGCT) Annual Meeting. The data show that the NGN-401 gene therapy candidate has been generally well-tolerated, and there have been no treatment-emergent or procedure-related serious adverse events or signs of MeCP2 overexpression-related toxicity observed in any patient, including a patient with a mild variant predicted to result in residual MeCP2 function. “We look forward to sharing the initial, favorable safety data of NGN-401, which is designed to use our differentiated EXACT transgene regulation technology and deliver a full-length MECP2 gene to key areas of the brain underlying the pathophysiology of Rett syndrome,” said Rachel McMinn, Ph.D., Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Neurogene. “Rett syndrome is a complex neurological disorder with a narrow therapeutic window, and conventional gene therapy approaches have been unable to provide therapeutic protein levels without detrimental overexpression. Therefore, we believe it is important to share this safety update at the ASGCT Meeting, in advance of our expected fourth quarter 2024 interim efficacy read-out, as we have multiple months of data from three patients showing NGN-401 has been generally well-tolerated.” Neurogene’s ASGCT Meeting Poster Presentation Details Title: Preliminary Safety Results from the Ph1/2 study of NGN-401, a Novel Regulated Gene Therapy for Rett Syndrome Date: May 9, 2024 Time: 12:00 p.m. ET Location: Exhibit Hall The abstract can be accessed at this link.

Such risks, uncertainties and assumptions include, among other things: risks related to the timing and success of enrolling patients in the expanded cohort of Neurogene’s Phase 1/2 clinical trial of NGN-401 for the treatment of Rett syndrome; the expected timing and results of dosing of patients in the Company’s clinical trials, including NGN-401; the potential that Neurogene may not be able to expand its Phase 1/2 clinical trial of NGN-401 for the treatment of Rett syndrome into the UK based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to any decisions of regulatory authorities, costs of expanding the trial in the UK, the availability of suitable clinical test sites, and the ability to enroll patients in the UK or other reasons; the potential for negative impacts to patients resulting from using a higher dose of NGN-401 in Cohort 2 of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial for the treatment of Rett syndrome; the risk that the Company may not be able to report its data on the predicted timeline; our limited operating history; the risk that Neurogene may not be able to raise adequate additional capital to finance its operations, complete its clinical trials and commercialize its products; risks related to Neurogene’s ability to obtain regulatory approval for, and ultimately commercialize, its product candidates, including NGN-401; risks related to the outcome of non-clinical testing and early clinical trials for the Company’s product candidates, including the ability of those trials to satisfy relevant governmental or regulatory requirements; risks related to Neurogene’s limited experience in designing clinical trials and lack of experience in conducting clinical trials; and other risks and uncertainties identified under the heading ""Risk Factors"" included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 18, 2024, and other filings that the Company has made and may make with the SEC in the future.

Dieser Schritt zeigt Equity's Engagement, die Gemeinden im gesamten Staat zu bedienen und langfristige Beziehungen mit Familien und Unternehmen aufzubauen. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Equity's merger with KansasLand Bancshares reflects a strategic move to bolster its presence in the regional market. The addition of $55 million in assets and $43 million in deposits from KansasLand is a moderate, yet noteworthy boon to Equity's balance sheet. Particularly, this acquisition aligns with the company's methodical expansion strategy, evidenced by their history of 23 preceding transactions. We must, however, scrutinize the terms of the deal, the implied valuation multiples and the anticipated synergies. The long-term success hinges on seamless integration and realization of cost efficiencies, without eroding KansasLand's established customer relationships. From a financial perspective, investors should monitor the impact on Equity's earnings per share and the transaction's effect on the bank's capital ratios. Additionally, the potential for cross-selling opportunities and the expansion of product offerings can provide a pathway for revenue growth. Investors should also consider regional economic factors, such as agricultural or manufacturing activity that may affect loan portfolios and deposit growth in the newly acquired regions. Market Research Analyst Equity's expansion within Kansas is indicative of the bank's commitment to strengthening its footprint in familiar territories. It's worth noting the strategic placement of the new branches, as they fill geographical gaps in Equity's network, potentially drawing a new customer base. Moreover, the reaffirmation of local commitment is important in retail banking to retain the trust of the customer base, which KansasLand has evidently nurtured since 1902. As a Market Research Analyst, I'd emphasize the importance of analyzing the competitive landscape in Western and Central Kansas post-merger. The consolidation of banks within the region could alter the competitive dynamics, potentially giving Equity a stronger bargaining position. Probing consumer sentiment and loyalty will be vital, as mergers often trigger concerns about changes in service quality or fee structures among customers. 04/22/2024 - 04:53 PM Company will acquire KansasLand Bank, add Western and Central Kansas locations WICHITA, Kan.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Equity Bancshares, Inc.

These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about Equity’s industry, management’s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond Equity’s control. Accordingly, Equity cautions you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although Equity believes that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.

The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. In addition, the following factors, among others, related to the proposed transaction between Equity and KansasLand, could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from forward-looking statements or historical performance: the possibility that the proposed transaction will not close when expected or at all because required regulatory or other approvals are not received or other conditions to the closing are not satisfied on a timely basis or at all, or are obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted in connection with the proposed transaction; the possibility that the anticipated benefits of the transaction will not be realized when expected or at all, including as a result of the impact of, or problems arising from, the integration of the two companies or as a result of the strength of the economy and competitive factors in the areas where companies do business; the possibility that the transaction may be more expensive to complete than anticipated, including as a result of unexpected factors or events; diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business operations and opportunities; potential adverse reactions or changes to business or employee relationships, including those resulting from the announcement or completion of the transaction; the business, economic and political conditions in the markets in which the parties operate; the risk that the proposed combination and its announcement could have an adverse effect the parties’ ability to retain customers and retain or hire key personnel and maintain relationships with customers; the risk that the proposed combination may be more difficult, time-consuming or expensive than anticipated; and other factors that may affect future results of Equity. For discussion of these and other risks that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, please refer to “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in Equity’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 7, 2024, and any updates to those risk factors set forth in Equity’s subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K.

These data support the potential synergy of VCN-01 and first-line pancreatic cancer chemotherapy regimens, and will be featured in a poster presentation at the American Society for Cell and Gene Therapy (ASGCT) 27th Annual Meeting, being held both virtually and in Baltimore from May 7-11, 2024. “The data featured at the upcoming ASGCT meeting build on recent findings that suggest the combination of VCN-01 and topoisomerase I inhibitors, such as liposomal irinotecan, may provide a synergistic antitumor effect to improve therapeutic outcomes across indications,” said Steven A. Shallcross, Chief Executive Officer of Theriva Biologics. “We look forward to leveraging these findings and evaluating the combination of VCN-01 with additional first-line pancreatic cancer chemotherapy regimens, including NALIRIFOX and FOLFIRINOX. In parallel, we continue to progress our on-going VIRAGE Phase 2b trial evaluating VCN-01 in combination with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel to treat metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Together, these important steps bring us one step closer to building a portfolio of potentially improved therapeutic combinations for PDAC patients with high unmet medical needs.” Key takeaways include: Overview: The combination of VCN-01 + topoisomerase I (topo1) inhibitors, such as liposomal irinotecan, has a tolerable toxicity profile and may improve efficacy in the treatment of human pancreatic cancer. In vitro: Viral protein expression was increased in human pancreatic cancer cell lines when they were exposed to topo1 inhibiting chemotherapeutics, irinotecan, its active metabolite, SN-38, and topotecan.In vivo: Synergy of VCN-01 plus liposomal irinotecan was observed in animals bearing subcutaneous human pancreatic tumors. In human pancreatic mouse xenograft models, treatment with VCN-01 at a dose of 4x1010 vp or liposomal irinotecan alone (at both the 10 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg doses) resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition compared to saline.Combination therapy with VCN-01 + liposomal irinotecan at either dose displayed significantly reduced tumor growth compared to each treatment alone.qPCR analyses performed on tumors collected at end of study confirmed the presence of viral genomes, indicating ongoing transcriptional activity of VCN-01, which is consistent with viral replication for several days after administration.

Theriva™ Biologics (NYSE American: TOVX), is a diversified clinical-stage company developing therapeutics designed to treat cancer and related diseases in areas of high unmet need. The Company is advancing a new oncolytic adenovirus platform designed for intravenous (IV), intravitreal and antitumoral delivery to trigger tumor cell death, improve access of co-administered cancer therapies to the tumor, and promote a robust and sustained anti-tumor response by the patient’s immune system. The Company’s lead candidates are: (1) VCN-01, an oncolytic adenovirus designed to replicate selectively and aggressively within tumor cells, and to degrade the tumor stroma barrier that serves as a significant physical and immunosuppressive barrier to cancer treatment; (2) SYN-004 (ribaxamase) which is designed to degrade certain commonly used IV beta-lactam antibiotics within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to prevent microbiome damage, thereby limiting overgrowth of pathogenic organisms such as VRE (vancomycin resistant Enterococci) and reducing the incidence and severity of acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGVHD) in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients; and (3) SYN-020, a recombinant oral formulation of the enzyme intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) produced under cGMP conditions and intended to treat both local GI and systemic diseases.

Positive Stable total assets at $1.1 billion Loan portfolio growth of $107.8 million Net interest income decrease of 1.94% Increase in provision for credit losses Decline in non-interest income by 7.10% Negative 15.45% decrease in net income compared to Q1 2023 Decrease in deposit balances by $4.8 million Unrealized losses in the investment portfolio due to changing bond rates 04/22/2024 - 04:30 PM DERBY, VT / ACCESSWIRE / April 22, 2024 / Community Bancorp., (OTCQX:CMTV) Community National Bank reported earnings for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024, of $2.8 million or $0.51 per share, a decrease of $515,860 or 15.45% compared to $3.3 million or $0.61 per share for the first quarter of 2023.Total assets for the Company on March 31, 2024, were $1.1 billion, unchanged from year end 2023, and up slightly from $1.03 billion as of March 31, 2023. Contributing to the bank's healthy asset levels was continued growth in the first quarter of 2024 in the Company's loan portfolio of $107.8 million, or 14.21%, compared to the 2023 period. Deposit balances decreased $4.8 million, or 0.54%, compared to the same period in 2023. The year-over-year loan growth was funded by an increase in borrowed funds of $83.9 million as well as a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $21.7 million.The Company's securities portfolio totaled $180.6 million as of March 31, 2024, a 6.28% decrease compared to $192.7 million as of March 31, 2023. The portfolio is classified as available-for-sale and is required to be reported at fair market value with the unrealized loss, net of a deferred tax adjustment, reported as an adjustment to total equity. Such unrealized losses reflect the interest rate environment, as current rates remain above the coupon rates on the securities, resulting in a fair market value lower than current book values. As of March 31, 2024, the adjustment to equity was $17.4 million, which has remained consistent in recent quarters, including $15.9 million on December 31, 2023, and $18.0 million as of March 31, 2023.Total net interest income for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024, decreased $165,720, or 1.94%, to $8.4 million, compared to $8.5 million for the same quarter in 2023. The slight year-over-year decrease reflects an increase of $2,302,192, or 24.55%, in interest and fees on loans due to loan growth and higher interest rates, offset by higher interest on deposits expense of $1,235,425, or 66.97%, as well as higher interest on borrowed funds of $921,296.The provision for credit losses for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024, was $313,579, compared to $286,526 for the same period in 2023. The provision for credit losses for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024, was determined under Accounting Standard No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, commonly referenced as the Current Expected Credit Losses, or CECL, which the Company adopted effective January 1, 2023.Total non-interest income for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024, of $1.6 million decreased $124,870, or 7.10%, compared to $1.8 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease is partially due to lower commercial loan documentation fees and commercial rate lock fees associated with transaction timing.Equity capital increased to $89.4 million, with a book value per share of $15.88, as of March 31, 2024, compared to equity capital of $89.0 million and a book value of $15.87 as of December 31, 2023. This change includes an increase of $1.5 million in unrealized losses in the investment portfolio, due to changing bond rates, which decreased the fair market value of the investment portfolio, offset by an increase of $1.52 million in retained earnings. The unrealized loss position is considered temporary and does not impact the Company's regulatory capital ratios.President and CEO Kathryn Austin commented on the Company's results: ""Our solid financial performance in the first quarter of 2024 demonstrates the strength of our customer relationships. Continued year-over-year growth in loans during a period of higher interest rates is a testament to the success of our team who helped customers navigate economic challenges. We believe these results also reflect our strategic decision to focus on organic loan and deposit growth, within our well-established risk management framework, and the continued resilience of our local economy in the communities we serve throughout Vermont and New Hampshire. As always, we are grateful for our dedicated employees who support their communities and our growing customer base every day.""As previously announced, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share payable May 1, 2024, to shareholders of record as of April 15, 2024.About Community National BankCommunity National Bank is an independent bank that has been serving its communities since 1851, with retail banking offices located in Derby, Derby Line, Island Pond, Barton, Newport, Troy, St. Johnsbury, Montpelier, Barre, Lyndonville, Morrisville and Enosburg Falls as well as loan offices located in Burlington, Vermont and Lebanon, New HampshireForward Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements about the Company's financial condition, capital status, dividend payment practices, business outlook and affairs.

About Axiomer™ ProQR is pioneering a next-generation RNA base editing technology called Axiomer™, which could potentially yield a new class of medicines for diverse types of diseases. Axiomer “Editing Oligonucleotides”, or EONs, mediate single nucleotide changes to RNA in a highly specific and targeted way using molecular machinery that is present in human cells called ADAR (Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA). Axiomer EONs are designed to recruit and direct endogenously expressed ADARs to change an Adenosine (A) to an Inosine (I) in the RNA – an Inosine is translated as a Guanosine (G) – correcting an RNA with a disease-causing mutation back to a normal (wild type) RNA, modulating protein expression, or altering a protein so that it will have a new function that helps prevent or treat disease. About ProQR ProQR Therapeutics is dedicated to changing lives through the creation of transformative RNA therapies. ProQR is pioneering a next-generation RNA technology called Axiomer™, which uses a cell’s own editing machinery called ADAR to make specific single nucleotide edits in RNA to reverse a mutation or modulate protein expression and could potentially yield a new class of medicines for both rare and prevalent diseases with unmet need. Based on our unique proprietary RNA repair platform technologies we are growing our pipeline with patients and loved ones in mind. Learn more about ProQR at www.proqr.com.

Nucor는 2024년 첫 분기에 강력한 재무 결과를 보고했습니다. 순이익은 8억 4,480만 달러, 순매출은 81억 4,000만 달러, EBITDA는 15억 달러였습니다. 팬데믹 이후의 최고치에서 철강 시장 조건이 완화되었음에도 불구하고 Nucor의 성과는 견고했습니다. 회사는 데이터 센터 시장으로의 확장, 저탄소 강재 공급을 위한 새로운 파트너십 구축, 열연 코일 제품에 대한 Nucor 소비자 현장 가격 출시를 통해 성장, 지속 가능성 및 상업 전략에서 중요한 진전을 이루었습니다. Nucor a annoncé des résultats financiers solides pour le premier trimestre de 2024, avec un bénéfice net de 844,8 millions de dollars, un chiffre d'affaires net de 8,14 milliards de dollars et un EBITDA de 1,50 milliard de dollars. Malgré un assouplissement des conditions du marché de l'acier après les pics post-pandémiques, la performance de Nucor est restée robuste. L'entreprise a réalisé des avancées significatives en matière de croissance, de durabilité et de stratégies commerciales, en se développant dans le marché des centres de données, en formant de nouveaux partenariats pour la fourniture d'acier à faible teneur en carbone et en lançant le Nucor Consumer Spot Price pour les produits en bobines laminées à chaud. Nucor berichtete über starke finanzielle Ergebnisse für das erste Quartal 2024 mit einem Nettogewinn von 844,8 Millionen Dollar, einem Nettoumsatz von 8,14 Milliarden Dollar und einem EBITDA von 1,50 Milliarden Dollar. Trotz einer Beruhigung der Stahlmarktkonditionen nach pandemiebedingten Höchstständen blieb Nucors Leistung robust. Das Unternehmen machte bedeutende Fortschritte in Wachstum, Nachhaltigkeit und Handelsstrategien, erweiterte sich in den Markt für Datenzentren, bildete neue Partnerschaften für die Versorgung mit kohlenstoffarmem Stahl und führte den Nucor Consumer Spot Price für Warmbandprodukte ein. Positive Net earnings of $844.8 million, or $3.46 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2024. Net sales of $8.14 billion and EBITDA of $1.50 billion. Nucor reported consolidated net earnings of $785.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $1.14 billion for the first quarter of 2023. Company's operating rates at steel mills increased to 82% in the first quarter of 2024. Nucor had $5.54 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of the first quarter of 2024. Repurchased approximately 5.5 million shares of common stock during the first quarter of 2024. Declared a cash dividend of $0.54 per share payable on May 10, 2024, marking the 204th consecutive quarterly cash dividend. Negative Decrease in net sales by 7% compared to the first quarter of 2023. Decrease in total steel mill shipments to outside customers in the first quarter of 2024. Pre-operating and start-up costs related to growth projects increased in the first quarter of 2024. Expected decrease in earnings for the second quarter of 2024. Financial Analyst Examining Nucor's performance in the first quarter of 2024 reveals a robust financial state, characterized by notable net earnings of $844.8 million. This figure, juxtaposed with the $785.4 million from the previous quarter, indicates a sustained profitability despite a minor slackening from the year-ago quarter's $1.14 billion. The nuance here is the steel market's retreat from peak conditions which, understandably, exerts pressure on the top line, as evidenced by net sales dipping 7% year-over-year to $8.14 billion. An investor should note the operational efficiency manifested in increased steel mill shipments, up 7% from the prior quarter, yet net sales have not climbed proportionately. This could suggest a competitive pricing environment or a mix shift in products sold. The higher scrap cost, up 6% sequentially, underscores inflationary pressures that could squeeze margins if not offset by pricing power or cost management strategies. Their commitment to shareholder returns is clear with sizeable share repurchases and an unbroken streak of cash dividends. Notably, the stock buyback at an average price of $180.79 underscores management's confidence in intrinsic value, a signal often well-regarded by investors. Market Research Analyst Nucor's strategic undertakings, particularly their foray into the data center market and partnerships for low-carbon steel, are forward-thinking initiatives. These moves address burgeoning market demands and regulatory trends favoring sustainability. While the immediate financial impact may be limited, the long-term implications for market share and regulatory compliance could be significant. Additionally, the new pricing strategy for hot-rolled coil products, aiming for transparency, may alter customer purchasing behaviors and potentially smooth out the volatility in order flows, an aspect that savvy investors would appreciate for its potential to stabilize revenues. Industrial Analyst The operational rate uptick to 82% is a strong indicator of Nucor's operational agility to meet market demand. Yet, with an outlook projecting decrease in earnings for the upcoming quarter due to anticipated lower average selling prices, the market could see this as a potential red flag. However, increased profitability in the raw materials segment, likely a result of improved operational efficiencies in direct reduced iron facilities and scrap processing operations, paints a picture of a well-diversified operational base that could mitigate segment-specific downturns. Understanding that these segments operate within a cyclical industry, investors should consider these dynamics as part of the larger economic cycle affecting commodities like steel. The robust financial strength, underlined by a strong balance sheet with $5.54 billion in liquidity and an excellent credit rating, provides a cushion against market volatility and secures strategic investment capabilities for Nucor. 04/22/2024 - 04:30 PM First Quarter of 2024 Highlights Net earnings attributable to Nucor stockholders of $844.8 million, or $3.46 per diluted share.Net sales of $8.14 billion.Net earnings before noncontrolling interests of $959.0 million; EBITDA of $1.50 billion.CHARLOTTE, N.C., April 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) today announced consolidated net earnings attributable to Nucor stockholders of $844.8 million, or $3.46 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2024.

First Quarter of 2024 AnalysisSteel mills segment earnings in the first quarter of 2024 increased from the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher average selling prices and increased volumes, particularly at our sheet mills. Earnings in the steel products segment decreased in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 due to lower average selling prices and decreased volumes. Earnings in the raw materials segment increased in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Second Quarter of 2024 OutlookWe expect earnings in the second quarter of 2024 to decrease compared to the first quarter of 2024. The largest driver for the expected decrease in earnings in the second quarter of 2024 is the decreased earnings of the steel mills segment, primarily due to lower average selling prices partially offset by modestly increased volumes. The steel products segment is expected to have moderately decreased earnings in the second quarter of 2024 as compared to the first quarter of 2024 due to lower average selling prices, partially offset by increased volumes. Earnings in the raw materials segment are expected to be higher in the second quarter of 2024 as compared to the first quarter of 2024 due to the increased profitability of our direct reduced iron facilities and scrap processing operations.

Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe Company uses certain non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) financial measures in this news release, including EBITDA. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance or financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We define EBITDA as net earnings before noncontrolling interests, adding back the following items: interest (income) expense, net; provision for income taxes; depreciation; and amortization. Please note that other companies might define their non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do. Management presents the non-GAAP financial measure of EBITDA in this news release because it considers it to be an important supplemental measure of performance. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides additional insight for analysts and investors evaluating the Company's financial and operational performance by providing a consistent basis of comparison across periods. Forward-Looking StatementsCertain statements contained in this news release are ""forward-looking statements"" that involve risks and uncertainties which we expect will or may occur in the future and may impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. The words ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""expect,"" ""intend,"" ""project,"" ""may,"" ""will,"" ""should,"" ""could"" and similar expressions are intended to identify those forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect the Company's best judgment based on current information, and, although we base these statements on circumstances that we believe to be reasonable when made, there can be no assurance that future events will not affect the accuracy of such forward-looking information. As such, the forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results may vary materially from the projected results and expectations discussed in this news release. Factors that might cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: (1) competitive pressure on sales and pricing, including pressure from imports and substitute materials; (2) U.S. and foreign trade policies affecting steel imports or exports; (3) the sensitivity of the results of our operations to general market conditions, and in particular, prevailing market steel prices and changes in the supply and cost of raw materials, including pig iron, iron ore and scrap steel; (4) the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas, which could negatively affect our cost of steel production or result in a delay or cancellation of existing or future drilling within our natural gas drilling programs; (5) critical equipment failures and business interruptions; (6) market demand for steel products, which, in the case of many of our products, is driven by the level of nonresidential construction activity in the United States; (7) impairment in the recorded value of inventory, equity investments, fixed assets, goodwill or other long-lived assets; (8) uncertainties and volatility surrounding the global economy, including excess world capacity for steel production, inflation and interest rate changes; (9) fluctuations in currency conversion rates; (10) significant changes in laws or government regulations affecting environmental compliance, including legislation and regulations that result in greater regulation of greenhouse gas emissions that could increase our energy costs, capital expenditures and operating costs or cause one or more of our permits to be revoked or make it more difficult to obtain permit modifications; (11) the cyclical nature of the steel industry; (12) capital investments and their impact on our performance; (13) our safety performance; (14) our ability to integrate businesses we acquire; and (15) any pandemic or public health situation.

(NASDAQ: REGN) today announced that new and updated data across its genetic medicines portfolio will be presented at the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ASGCT) annual conference in Baltimore, Maryland, from May 7 to 11, 2024. Data from 10 abstracts, including six oral presentations, provide insight on Regeneron’s approach to overcoming obstacles to clinical implementation of genetic medicines, from pre-dosing to delivery to long-term sustained expression. The company will also present updated data from the Phase 1/2 CHORD trial investigating DB-OTO in children with profound genetic hearing loss due to mutations of the otoferlin gene. “Genetic medicine approaches including gene therapy, gene editing and gene silencing hold incredible promise for people with serious, genetically driven diseases, but some common barriers to practical implementation remain, such as delivery to tissues beyond the liver and waning efficacy over time,” said Christos Kyratsous, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Co-Head of Regeneron Genetic Medicines. “Regeneron continues to advance methods to overcome these obstacles through our proprietary delivery approaches utilizing next-generation viral vectors, particularly specific retargeting antibodies and innovative payloads. Our data at ASGCT also details efforts to sustain expression of treatment over time and better modulate immune response via adeno-associated virus delivery.” “We are continuing to dose patients in our clinical trial of DB-OTO gene therapy for profound hearing loss due to otoferlin deficiency and are advancing additional gene therapy programs toward the clinic. The ASGCT presentation will build on promising early results in the first patient,” said Aris Baras, M.D., Senior Vice President, Co-Head of Regeneron Genetic Medicines and Head, Regeneron Genetics Center®. “These results raise hope and enthusiasm for the field, and we believe that findings from the program will help us unlock paths forward for gene therapies and genetic medicines for more patients and diseases.” Regeneron presentations at ASGCT: Abstract title Abstract Presenting/LeadAuthor Presentationdate/time(ET) Oral PresentationsIntracochlear Administration of DB-OTO Gene Therapy in Pediatric Patients with Profound Hearing Loss Due to Otoferlin Mutations: The CHORD Phase 1/2 Open-Label Trial 10 Lawrence Lustig, Columbia University Wednesday, May 8, 9:30-9:45AM ET Antibody-Based AAV Retargeting to Transferrin Receptor Mediates Efficient Blood Brain Barrier Crossing and In Vivo Gene Delivery to the CNS in Mice and Non-Human Primates 118 Kalyani Nambiar Wednesday, May 8, 4:15-4:30PM ET Targeted Gene Insertion of Vectorized Monoclonal Antibodies in Non-Human Primates Overcomes AAV Genome Silencing in the Liver and Supports High, Sustained In Vivo Expression of Functional Antibodies 197 Rachel Sattler Thursday, May 9, 5:15-5:30pm ET Retargeting of AAV Using Bispecific Antibodies 218 Sven Moller-Tank Thursday, May 9, 5:15-5:30PM ET Tissue De-Targeting Abrogates Hepatotoxicity and Complement-Related Thrombotic Complications Associated with High-Dose AAV Gene Therapies 298 Andrew Baik Friday, May 10, 4:15-4:30PM ET Orthogonal B Cell and Plasma Cell Immunosuppression Strategies Prevent and Suppress High-Titer Antibody Immunity to Enable AAV Vector Re-Dosing 353 Nicholas Giovannone Saturday, May 11, 8:15-8:30AM ET Poster PresentationsAAV Conjugated to Antibodies Against p75NTR: A New Platform to Deliver Pain Therapeutics to Nociceptive Sensory Neurons 638 Adina Buxbaum Wednesday, May 8, 12:00-7:00PM ET A Process for Identifying AAV and Transgene Integrations in Mouse and Human Genomes Using Long Read Oxford Nanopore Sequencing 897 Terrence Turner Wednesday, May 8, 12:00-7:00PM ET DNA Leakage of rAAV Under Freeze/Thaw Stress and Analytical Method Development for Free DNA Characterization 898 Shuai Li Wednesday, May 8, 12:00-7:00PM ET Identification of Degradation Pathways of rAAV8 to Aid Stable Drug Product Formulation Development 899 Ariel Chen Wednesday, May 8, 12:00-7:00PM ET LecturesEngineering CAR-T Cells with Novel Receptor Architectures N/A Philip Gregory Thursday, May 9, 10:55-11:25AM ET Pressing Challenges in Gene Therapy N/A Jim Wang Saturday, May 11, 8:00-9:45AM ET About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents, develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

The global competition inspires graduate students to address critical social and environmental issues through innovative financial vehicles. The winning team was one of 12 finalists selected from a competitive field, which included 84 teams comprised of 290 students from 44 countries. The graduate students from the University of Utah's David Eccles School of Business were awarded the top prize of $10,000 for their proposal to help protect the Great Salt Lake, a keystone ecosystem and economic engine at significant risk of drying up in the next five years. The Resilient Waters Fund would catalyze federal, state and investment funds through a creative land trust mechanism to spur irrigation efficiency, responsible cropping and water savings. The winning team consisted of Cody Clifford, Hunter Conrad, Michael Hall and Alex Parlogean. “Through the Sustainable Investing Challenge, students develop financial solutions to real-world issues, providing them with invaluable experience and insights into sustainable finance,” says Jessica Alsford, Morgan Stanley’s Chief Sustainability Officer and CEO of the Institute for Sustainable Investing. “As the demand for sustainability talent grows across industries, we’re excited to help cultivate a pipeline of emerging leaders committed to driving the transition to a more sustainable future.” The finalists pitched a wide variety of ideas, addressing social and environmental issues including decentralized microgrid development in the US, wealth transfer in Mexico's manufacturing sector, the sustainability transition of Indonesia’s shrimp industry and grazing land restoration in Kenya. The second- and third-place prizes of $5,000 and $2,500 were awarded to the Caatinga Bank team from the University of Navarra’s IESE Business School and the Renewable Back Security team from Columbia Business School, respectively. The Caatinga Bank proposal aims to provide farmers in the Caatinga region of Brazil with working capital loans in the form of seeds, resources, technical knowledge and cash. The team consisted of Gabriela Ferreira Galera, Luana Gomes Nogueira, Carolina Pascotto and Danielle van Drunen. The Renewable Back Security team, including Ignacio Aguirre, Nadim Dabbous, Dion Koreman and Diego Rehder, developed a solution to reduce the cost of capital necessary for emerging and developing economies (EMDEs) to scale up renewable energy adoption in southern and central Africa and the US. “Every year, these teams of graduate students demonstrate incredible creativity and drive with their solutions to global problems,” says Dave Chen, Professor of Finance at Kellogg Management School, CEO of Equilibrium Capital and the founder of the Sustainable Investing Challenge. “This year’s winner and runners-up are no different, and we are excited to support them in helping make their ideas a reality.” The three prize-winning teams were selected by a panel of sustainable finance experts and senior practitioners across the industry to advance to the final round, pitching to judges at Morgan Stanley in New York on Friday, April 19.

References to third parties contained herein should not be considered a solicitation on behalf of or an endorsement of those entities by Morgan Stanley. Certain portfolios may include investment holdings deemed Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) investments. For reference, environmental (""E"") factors can include, but are not limited to, climate change, pollution, waste, and how an issuer protects and/or conserves natural resources. Social (""S"") factors can include, but not are not limited to, how an issuer manages its relationships with individuals, such as its employees, shareholders, and customers as well as its community. Governance (""G"") factors can include, but are not limited to, how an issuer operates, such as its leadership composition, pay and incentive structures, internal controls, and the rights of equity and debt holders. You should carefully review an investment product's prospectus or other offering documents, disclosures and/or marketing material to learn more about how it incorporates ESG factors into its investment strategy. ESG investments may also be referred to as sustainable investments, impact aware investments, socially responsible investments or diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) investments. It is important to understand there are inconsistent ESG definitions and criteria within the industry, as well as multiple ESG ratings providers that provide ESG ratings of the same subject companies and/or securities that vary among the providers. This is due to a current lack of consistent global reporting and auditing standards as well as differences in definitions, methodologies, processes, data sources and subjectivity among ESG rating providers when determining a rating. Certain issuers of investments including, but not limited to, separately managed accounts (SMAs), mutual funds and exchange traded-funds (ETFs) may have differing and inconsistent views concerning ESG criteria where the ESG claims made in offering documents or other literature may overstate ESG impact. Further, socially responsible norms vary by region, and an issuer’s ESG practices or Morgan Stanley’s assessment of an issuer’s ESG practices can change over time. Portfolios that include investment holdings deemed ESG investments or that employ ESG screening criteria as part of an overall strategy may experience performance that is lower or higher than a portfolio not employing such practices. Portfolios with ESG restrictions and strategies as well as ESG investments may not be able to take advantage of the same opportunities or market trends as portfolios where ESG criteria is not applied. There is no assurance that an ESG investing strategy or techniques employed will be successful. Past performance is not a guarantee or a dependable measure of future results. For risks related to a specific fund, please refer to the fund's prospectus or summary prospectus. Investment managers can have different approaches to ESG and can offer strategies that differ from the strategies offered by other investment managers with respect to the same theme or topic. Additionally, when evaluating investments, an investment manager is dependent upon information and data that may be incomplete, inaccurate or unavailable, which could cause the manager to incorrectly assess an investment’s ESG characteristics or performance. Such data or information may be obtained through voluntary or third-party reporting. Morgan Stanley does not verify that such information and data is accurate and makes no representation or warranty as to its accuracy, timeliness, or completeness when evaluating an issuer. This can cause Morgan Stanley to incorrectly assess an issuer’s business practices with respect to its ESG practices. As a result, it is difficult to compare ESG investment products. The appropriateness of a particular ESG investment or strategy will depend on an investor’s individual circumstances and objectives. Principal value and return of an investment will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Diversification does not guarantee a profit or protect against loss in a declining financial market.

Morgan Stanley makes every effort to use reliable, comprehensive information, but we make no guarantee that it is accurate or complete. We have no obligation to tell you when opinions or information in this report change. Historical data shown represents past performance and does not guarantee comparable future results. Investing in the markets entails the risk of market volatility. The value of all types of investments, including stocks, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), closed-end funds, and unit investment trusts, may increase or decrease over varying time periods. An investment in an exchange-traded fund involves risks similar to those of investing in a broadly based portfolio of equity securities traded on exchange in the relevant securities market, such as market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic and political developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in stock prices. The investment return and principal value of ETF investments will fluctuate, so that an investor’s ETF shares, if or when sold, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Because of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies. Equity securities may fluctuate in response to news on companies, industries, market conditions and general economic environment. Companies paying dividends can reduce or stop pay-outs at any time. Growth investing does not guarantee a profit or eliminate risk. The stocks of these companies can have relatively high valuations. Because of these high valuations, an investment in a growth stock can be more risky than an investment in a company with more modest growth expectations. Bonds are subject to interest rate risk. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall; generally, the longer a bond’s maturity, the more sensitive it is to this risk. Bonds may also be subject to call risk, which is the risk that the issuer will redeem the debt at its option, fully or partially, before the scheduled maturity date. The market value of debt instruments may fluctuate, and proceeds from sales prior to maturity may be more or less than the amount originally invested or the maturity value due to changes in market conditions or changes in the credit quality of the issuer. Debt instruments issued by U.S. corporate and municipal issuers that provide a return in the form of fixed periodic payments and eventual return of principal at maturity. Fixed income investments are advantageous in a time of low inflation, but do not protect investors in a time of rising inflation. Interest income on government securities is subject to federal income taxes, but exempt from taxes at the state and local level. Bond funds and bond holdings have the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks that are associated with the underlying bonds owned by the funds. The return of principal in bond funds, and in funds with significant bond holdings, is not guaranteed. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates and Morgan Stanley Financial Advisors do not provide tax, accounting or legal advice. Individuals should consult their tax advisor for matters involving taxation and tax planning, and their attorney for matters involving legal matters.

Energy Sector Analyst The announcement from Overseas Shipholding Group (OSG) regarding the receipt of a federal grant marks a strategic advancement in the company's venture into the emerging market of carbon capture and storage (CCS). OSG's move to design a new vessel for liquefied carbon dioxide transport aligns with the broader industry trend towards decarbonization and could position the company as a forerunner in this niche sector. The grant can be viewed as a vote of confidence in OSG's capability to innovate within its core domain of energy transportation, potentially creating new revenue streams and diversifying its service offerings. The focus on CCS systems, which are projected to account for up to a 30% reduction in the nation's carbon emissions, indicates a clear trajectory towards clean energy solutions. For investors, this could signal long-term growth potential as OSG taps into a market driven by environmental regulatory frameworks and the global push for net-zero emissions. However, the capital-intensive nature of shipbuilding and the nascent stage of the CCS market suggest that investors should be cognizant of the risks associated with pioneering technologies and potential cost overruns during the development phase. Environmental Policy Expert From an environmental policy standpoint, the involvement of the Department of Energy in funding OSG's initiative underscores the federal commitment to reducing carbon emissions, reflecting the priorities set forth in the United States' climate goals. This project not only aligns with national interests but also addresses Florida's specific environmental challenges. With no existing infrastructure for CO2 transport, the state faces unique hurdles in managing its emissions. The proposed ATB and T-RICH hub represents a targeted solution that could potentially serve as a model for other regions lacking in CO2 pipeline infrastructure. The CO2 transportation logistics support the overarching policy goals of carbon reduction by enabling the sequestration of emissions from key industrial sources. The environmental benefits mentioned, such as the improved health of communities and the protection of sensitive ecosystems, may resonate with socially responsible investors and could enhance OSG's corporate image. These factors tend to positively influence investor perception and can, in the long term, translate into a more stable and favorable investment climate for the company. Maritime Transport Analyst The deployment of an articulated tug and barge (ATB) unit for transporting liquefied CO2 is indicative of the maritime industry's adaptive approach to evolving environmental imperatives. The transition from traditional energy cargoes to green alternatives represents a critical pivot point for the sector. OSG's proactive strategy to develop a marine transportation solution tailored to CCS requirements demonstrates foresight in capitalizing on emerging opportunities. The design of such a vessel, specific to the transport of CO2, requires technical prowess and an understanding of the regulatory landscape governing marine emissions and safety standards. The successful operation of this fleet could establish a new benchmark in the maritime transportation of hazardous materials, which is likely to become more stringent as international environmental standards tighten. For investors, this suggests that OSG is not only expanding its operational capabilities but is also potentially setting industry standards that could lead to a competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving market space. 04/22/2024 - 05:40 PM TAMPA, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. (NYSE: OSG) (the “Company” or “OSG”), a leading provider of energy transportation services, announced today that the Company has been awarded a $3,000,000 grant from the United States Department of Energy for the engineering and design of a new vessel that will transport liquified carbon dioxide (LCO2). The award will be used to develop the design of an articulated tug and barge unit (ATB) to be used to transport CO2 captured by emitters in the Greater Tampa Bay region and across the State of Florida to sequestration sites in the Gulf of Mexico. The new vessel grant provides further resources towards the development of a complete CO2 storage and transport solution for industrial emitters in Florida. This grant follows the Company’s announcement in December 2023 of an award by the Department of Energy of another grant for the development of OSG’s proposed Tampa Regional Intermodal Carbon Hub (T-RICH). The T-RICH grant funds a study led by OSG to develop an intermediate storage hub at Port Tampa Bay for captured CO2. T-RICH would initially receive, store, and process two million metric tons of CO2 per year and could be scaled in the future to meet expanded volumes of captured CO2. The ATB which is the focus of the current grant would provide a marine transport solution for captured CO2 aggregated at the T-RICH hub terminal in Tampa, to be shipped in liquified form to developed, approved sequestration sites in the northern Gulf of Mexico region. “The Department of Energy has encouraged the development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems as part of the United States’ goal to reduce CO2 emissions to achieve net zero carbon by 2050,” said Sam Norton, OSG’s President, and CEO. “CCS systems are expected to provide up to 30% of that total carbon emission reduction. OSG has an extensive track record as a leading provider of energy transportation of adopting new technologies and developing innovative solutions to meet our country’s energy needs,” Mr. Norton explained. “Transporting liquified CO2 is a natural next step into an exciting emerging market, consistent with OSG’s expertise with liquid cargoes.” Jeff Williams, OSG’s Director of CO2 Transport Solutions, added, “The development of a CO2 transport ATB, along with the previously awarded hub storage terminal grant at Port Tampa Bay, provides a comprehensive solution for Florida’s largest emitting industrial facilities to be part of the nation’s response to the impacts of climate change to which Florida’s residents and sensitive ecosystems are most vulnerable. OSG’s solution will help accelerate the adoption of carbon emission reduction plans in Florida, result in improved health of affected communities, create hundreds of new jobs, and bring innovative and transformative technologies to Florida.” “The State of Florida presents a unique opportunity for the transportation of liquified CO2. Florida has the country’s fourth largest CO2 emissions from power generation and industrial facilities but has no pipeline system capable of transporting captured CO2 out of state,” Williams continued. “OSG’s proposed T-RICH hub site at Port Tampa Bay would aggregate and store CO2 captured for loading into the LCO2 ATBs operated by OSG. The cargoes would then be delivered to the northern Gulf of Mexico, which has the largest confirmed capacity for safe, deep, permanent underground sequestration of captured CO2.” About Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. is a publicly traded company providing liquid bulk transportation services for crude oil and petroleum products in the U.S. Flag markets.

Positive Total revenues for Brown & Brown, Inc. in the first quarter of 2024 were $1,258 million, marking a significant increase of 12.7% from the previous year. Organic Revenue growth stood at 8.6%, showcasing the company's ability to generate growth from existing operations. Net income for the quarter was $293 million, showing a notable increase of 24.2% compared to the same period in the prior year. Diluted net income per share rose to $1.02, a 22.9% increase, while Diluted Net Income Per Share - Adjusted reached $1.14, an 18.8% increase from the first quarter of the prior year. The Company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share, demonstrating a commitment to rewarding shareholders. Income before income taxes saw a substantial increase of 23.8% to $364 million, with Income Before Income Taxes Margin rising to 28.9% from 26.3% in the prior year. EBITDAC - Adjusted increased by 17.1% to $466 million, with EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted reaching 37.0%, up from 35.7% in the first quarter of the prior year. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported revenue increase of 12.7% for Brown & Brown is a robust indicator of their growth, particularly when dissected to reveal an organic growth of 8.6%. This figure is pivotal as it strips out the effects of acquisitions and currency fluctuations, thereby reflecting the company's core operational performance. Investors should note that the organic growth surpasses typical industry benchmarks, which tend to hover around the low single digits. The emphasis on EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted, which stands at 37.0%, up from 35.7%, suggests an enhanced operational efficiency, potentially leading to higher profitability. This metric is important as it factors out items like amortization and acquisition costs, giving a clearer view of the underlying business performance. However, the increase in net income by 24.2% and diluted net income per share (EPS) by 22.9% should be weighed against the backdrop of the industry and macroeconomic conditions to gauge sustainability. Investors should also consider the company's strategy of growth through acquisition in light of the reported increase in commissions and fees. The dividend announcement, while relatively small at $0.13 per share, signals confidence in cash flow stability, a positive sign for income-focused shareholders. Market Research Analyst The performance of Brown & Brown, especially their income before income taxes margin improvement from 26.3% to 28.9%, indicates a growing effectiveness in their business operations and cost management. When considering the market landscape, it’s clear that Brown & Brown is outpacing many of its peers in terms of both top-line and bottom-line growth. A key takeaway for investors is the company's ability to enhance its core business amidst what can often be turbulent market conditions for the sector. Their strategy appears to be paying off, with a growing bottom line reflected in the adjusted net income per share increase of 18.8%. The reported figures suggest that the company's risk management and brokerage services continue to scale effectively. The declared dividend, albeit modest, may be seen as a testament to their commitment to providing shareholder value. It's essential for investors to appraise how these results compare with the broader industry trends and economic environment to make informed decisions. 04/22/2024 - 05:01 PM DAYTONA BEACH, Fla., April 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Brown & Brown, Inc.

Forward-looking statements This press release may contain certain statements relating to future results which are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created by those laws. You can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “intend,” “estimate,” “plan” and “continue” or similar words. We have based these statements on our current expectations about potential future events. Although we believe the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this press release are based upon reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements, whether oral or written, made by us or on our behalf. Many of these factors have previously been identified in filings or statements made by us or on our behalf. Important factors which could cause our actual results to differ, possibly materially from the forward-looking statements in this press release include but are not limited to the following items: the inability to hire, retain and develop qualified employees, as well as the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees; a cybersecurity attack or any other interruption in information technology and/or data security that may impact our operations or the operations of third parties that support us; acquisition-related risks that could negatively affect the success of our growth strategy, including the possibility that we may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses into our operations and expand into new markets; risks related to our international operations, which may result in additional risks or require more management time and expense than our domestic operations to achieve or maintain profitability; the requirement for additional resources and time to adequately respond to dynamics resulting from rapid technological change; the loss of or significant change to any of our insurance company relationships, which could result in loss of capacity to write business, additional expense, loss of market share or material decrease in our commissions; the effect of natural disasters on our profit-sharing contingent commissions, insurer capacity or claims expenses within our capitalized captive insurance facilities; adverse economic conditions, political conditions, outbreaks of war, disasters, or regulatory changes in states or countries where we have a concentration of our business; the inability to maintain our culture or a significant change in management, management philosophy or our business strategy; fluctuations in our commission revenue as a result of factors outside of our control; the effects of sustained inflation or higher interest rates; claims expense resulting from the limited underwriting risk associated with our participation in capitalized captive insurance facilities; risks associated with our automobile and recreational vehicle dealer services (“F&I”) businesses; changes in, or the termination of, certain programs administered by the U.S. federal government from which we derive revenues; the limitations of our system of disclosure and internal controls and procedures in preventing errors or fraud, or in informing management of all material information in a timely manner; the significant control certain shareholders have over the Company; changes in data privacy and protection laws and regulations or any failure to comply with such laws and regulations; improper disclosure of confidential information; our ability to comply with non-U.S. laws, regulations and policies; the potential adverse effect of certain actual or potential claims, regulatory actions or proceedings on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity; uncertainty in our business practices and compensation arrangements with insurance carriers due to potential changes in regulations; regulatory changes that could reduce our profitability or growth by increasing compliance costs, technology compliance, restricting the products or services we may sell, the markets we may enter, the methods by which we may sell our products and services, or the prices we may charge for our services and the form of compensation we may accept from our customers, carriers and third-parties; increasing scrutiny and changing laws and expectations from regulators, investors and customers with respect to our environmental, social and governance practices and disclosure; a decrease in demand for liability insurance as a result of tort reform legislation; our failure to comply with any covenants contained in our debt agreements; the possibility that covenants in our debt agreements could prevent us from engaging in certain potentially beneficial activities; changes in the U.S.-based credit markets that might adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition; changes in current U.S. or global economic conditions, including an extended slowdown in the markets in which we operate; disintermediation within the insurance industry, including increased competition from insurance companies, technology companies and the financial services industry, as well as the shift away from traditional insurance markets; conditions that result in reduced insurer capacity; quarterly and annual variations in our commissions that result from the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production; intangible asset risk, including the possibility that our goodwill may become impaired in the future; future pandemics, epidemics or outbreaks of infectious diseases, and the resulting governmental and societal responses; other risks and uncertainties as may be detailed from time to time in our public announcements and Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings; and other factors that the Company may not have currently identified or quantified. Assumptions as to any of the foregoing, and all statements, are not based upon historical fact, but rather reflect our current expectations concerning future results and events. Forward-looking statements that we make or that are made by others on our behalf are based upon a knowledge of our business and the environment in which we operate, but because of the factors listed above, among others, actual results may differ from those in the forward-looking statements. Consequently, these cautionary statements qualify all of the forward-looking statements we make herein. We cannot assure you that the results or developments anticipated by us will be realized, or even if substantially realized, that those results or developments will result in the expected consequences for us or affect us, our business or our operations in the way we expect. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements made herein are made only as of the date of this release, and the Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or correct any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that subsequently occur or of which the Company hereafter becomes aware. Non-GAAP supplemental financial information This press release contains references to ""non-GAAP financial measures"" as defined in SEC Regulation G, consisting of Organic Revenue, EBITDAC, EBITDAC Margin, EBITDAC - Adjusted, EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted and Diluted Net Income Per Share - Adjusted. We present these measures because we believe such information is of interest to the investment community and because we believe it provides additional meaningful methods to evaluate the Company’s operating performance from period to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent on a GAAP basis due to the impact of certain items that have a high degree of variability, that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance and that are not easily comparable from period to period. This non-GAAP financial information should be considered in addition to, not in lieu of, the Company’s consolidated income statements and balance sheets as of the relevant date. Consistent with Regulation G, a description of such information is provided below and a reconciliation of such items to GAAP information can be found within this press release as well as in our periodic filings with the SEC. We view Organic Revenue and Organic Revenue growth as important indicators when assessing and evaluating our performance on a consolidated basis and for each of our three segments, because it allows us to determine a comparable, but non-GAAP, measurement of revenue growth that is associated with the revenue sources that were a part of our business in both the current and prior year and that are expected to continue in the future. In addition, we believe Diluted Net Income Per Share - Adjusted provides a meaningful representation of our operating performance and improves the comparability of our results between periods by excluding the impact of the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables, the impact of amortization of intangible assets and certain other non-recurring or infrequently occurring items. We also view EBITDAC, EBITDAC - Adjusted, EBITDAC Margin and EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted as important indicators when assessing and evaluating our performance, as they present more comparable measurements of our operating margins in a meaningful and consistent manner. As disclosed in our most recent proxy statement, we use Organic Revenue growth, Diluted Net Income Per Share - Adjusted and EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted as key performance metrics for our short-term and long-term incentive compensation plans for executive officers and other key employees. Beginning January 1, 2024, we no longer exclude Foreign Currency Translation from the calculation of EBITDAC - Adjusted, EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted and Diluted Net Income Per Share - Adjusted. Prior periods are presented accordingly on the same basis so that the calculations of EBITDAC - Adjusted, EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted and Diluted Net Income Per Share - Adjusted are comparable for both periods. We no longer exclude Foreign Currency Translation from the calculation of these earnings measures because fluctuations in Foreign Currency Translation affect both our revenues and expenses, largely offsetting each other. Therefore, excluding Foreign Currency Translation from these earnings measures provides no meaningful incremental value in evaluating our financial performance. Beginning January 1, 2024, amortization of intangible assets is excluded from the calculation of Diluted Net Income Per Share - Adjusted. Prior periods are presented accordingly on the same basis so that the calculation of Diluted Net Income Per Share - Adjusted is comparable for both periods. We exclude the impact of amortization of intangible assets from the calculation of Diluted Net Income Per Share - Adjusted because amortization of intangible assets is a non-cash expense that is not indicative of the performance of our business and provides no meaningful incremental value in evaluating our financial performance. Non-GAAP Revenue Measures Organic Revenue is our core commissions and fees less: (i) the core commissions and fees earned for the first 12 months by newly acquired operations; (ii) divested business (core commissions and fees generated from offices, books of business or niches sold or terminated during the comparable period); and (iii) Foreign Currency Translation (as defined below).

The company's securities began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market on April 18, 2024, under the ticker symbol MTEN. Negative None. Financial Analyst Mingteng International's initial public offering appears to be a modest one, with the sale of 1,050,000 shares at $4.00 each, totaling $4.2 million in gross proceeds. While the amount raised may seem limited for an automotive mold developer and supplier, it's important to recognize that the funds are earmarked for vital areas such as increasing production capacity, investing in high-end production equipment and boosting R&D, specifically for turbochargers and NEV parts. The intended use of net proceeds suggests a strategic push into markets that are tied to environmentally friendly technologies, which are increasingly in demand. The firm commitment basis indicates the underwriters' confidence in the offering and the option for underwriters to purchase additional shares could lead to an additional influx of capital. However, the stock's performance and the company's growth trajectory need to be monitored closely to see if the investment in capacity and R&D generates the expected returns. Market Research Analyst The automotive industry is witnessing a shift towards new energy vehicles and Mingteng International is positioning itself to capitalize on this trend by focusing R&D on turbochargers and NEV parts. The turbocharger market has been growing due to the need for fuel-efficient engines and the NEV market expansion aligns with global efforts to reduce carbon emissions. As a newly publicly traded entity on the Nasdaq, Mingteng International could attract investors who are interested in environmentally conscious investments, as well as those looking to invest in China's burgeoning automotive parts industry. As with all investments, particularly in industries subject to rapid technological change, investors should be aware of potential risks associated with market competition, regulatory shifts and the execution of the company's growth strategies. Manufacturing Industry Analyst The investment in new production facilities and high-end production equipment is a significant move for Mingteng International. Enhanced production capacity and state-of-the-art equipment can lead to improved efficiencies, higher quality products and the ability to meet increased demand, especially in the competitive automotive parts industry. Furthermore, the emphasis on strengthening research and development capabilities indicates that Mingteng is not only aiming to increase quantity but also to innovate, which is essential for staying competitive. For potential investors, it's noteworthy that the company's strategic planning seems to align with broader industry trends, such as the push for innovation in turbochargers and parts for new energy vehicles. How effectively Mingteng can implement these plans and translate them into marketable products that drive revenue will be critical to their success post-IPO. 04/22/2024 - 06:30 PM Wuxi, China, April 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mingteng International Corporation Inc.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Oportun Financial Corporation has released preliminary financial metrics for Q1 2024, indicating a narrowing net loss compared to the same period last year. While the net loss is projected to be between $(30) to $(26) million, this is a significant improvement from the $(102.1) million net loss in Q1 2023. It's indicative of cost optimization efforts and possibly improved operational efficiency.Another key indicator, Adjusted EBITDA, which stands for Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization, adjusted for certain non-recurring items, is expected to break even or slightly positive, ranging from $0 to $4 million. This is a metric often used to assess a company's operating performance and the positive swing from last year's $(20.2) million highlights Oportun's potential turnaround in operational performance.The financial community pays close attention to the Annualized Net Charge-Off Rate, as it provides insight into the credit quality of a lending institution. Oportun's rate is anticipated at 12.0%, relatively stable compared to the previous year's 12.1%. A stable charge-off rate, despite economic fluctuations, can reflect well on risk management practices. Credit Analyst The 30+ Day Delinquency Rate is another critical measure for lenders like Oportun, detailing the percentage of loans where payments are overdue by 30 days or more. The reported preliminary rate of 5.2%, down from 5.5% last year, suggests a slight improvement in loan performance and potentially, a more robust credit portfolio.Investors should note the revision in Oportun's methodology for calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income. Such changes can affect the comparability with past performance and thus, they should review these revisions carefully to understand the modified metrics' implications on the company's financial health. 04/22/2024 - 04:15 PM Schedules First Quarter 2024 Earnings Release and Conference Call for Thursday, May 9, 2024SAN CARLOS, Calif., April 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Oportun Financial Corporation (“Oportun” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: OPRT), a mission-driven fintech, today announced certain preliminary unaudited financial and operating metrics for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024.

See About Non-GAAP Financial Measures — Adjusted EBITDA and — Adjusted Net Income (Loss) for more detail.2 As indicated on page 11 of the Company's 4Q 2023 Earnings Presentation. “We are pleased to report preliminary indications of a strong first quarter,” said Raul Vazquez, CEO of Oportun. “We expect to deliver a resilient top-line performance with Total Revenue exceeding the top end of our guidance range by $10 to $12 million. Our tightened credit posture contributed to delivering annualized net charge-offs in the bottom half of our guidance range and below the net charge-off rate from last year. Additionally, our 30+ Day Delinquency Rate is 21 basis points lower than last year. On a GAAP basis, we expect Net Loss for the quarter to have improved by $72 to $76 million compared to last year. Given strong Total Revenue, improved credit performance and continued expense discipline, we also expect to be break-even to profitable on an Adjusted Net Income basis, an increase of $58 to $62 million over last year. We expect Adjusted EBITDA to be positive and $12 to $16 million above the top end of our guidance range, a $20 to $24 million increase compared to last year. As these results demonstrate, we continue to make significant progress towards driving sustainable, profitable earnings growth, and shareholder value.” Improving Credit Trends In addition, following the Company's July 2022 credit tightening, quarterly vintages continue to outperform prior vintages in net lifetime loss rate by month on book as set forth below. Post-July 2022 credit tightening quarterly vintages are outperforming prior vintages in net lifetime loss rate by month on book. Note: 3Q22 vintage only includes August and September 2022.

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release presents information about the Company’s Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income, which are non-GAAP financial measures provided as a supplement to the results provided in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The Company believes non-GAAP measures can be useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of its core business and provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, and are not superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the non-GAAP measures the Company uses, as presented, may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found below. As previously announced on March 12, 2024, beginning with the quarter ended March 31, 2024 the Company has updated it's calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income for all periods. Comparable prior period Non-GAAP financial measures are included in addition to the previously reported metrics. Adjusted EBITDA The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income, adjusted to eliminate the effect of certain items as described below. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure because it allows management, investors and its board of directors to evaluate and compare operating results, including return on capital and operating efficiencies, from period to period by making the adjustments described below. In addition, it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of Oportun's business, as it removes the effect of income taxes, certain non-cash items, variable charges and timing differences. The Company believes it is useful to exclude the impact of income tax expense, as reported, because historically it has included irregular income tax items that do not reflect ongoing business operations.The Company believes it is useful to exclude depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expense because they are non-cash charges.The Company believes it is useful to exclude the impact of interest expense associated with the Company's corporate financing facilities, including the senior secured term loan and the residual financing facility, as it views this expense as related to its capital structure rather than its funding.The Company excludes the impact of certain non-recurring charges, such as expenses associated with our workforce optimization, and other non-recurring charges because it does not believe that these items reflect ongoing business operations. Other non-recurring charges include litigation reserve, impairment charges, debt amendment and warrant amortization costs related to our corporate financing facilities.The Company also excludes fair value mark-to-market adjustments on its loans receivable portfolio and asset-backed notes carried at fair value because these adjustments do not impact cash. Adjusted Net Income The Company defines Adjusted Net Income as net income adjusted to eliminate the effect of certain items as described below. The Company believes that Adjusted Net Income is an important measure of operating performance because it allows management, investors, and the Company's board of directors to evaluate and compare its operating results, including return on capital and operating efficiencies, from period to period, excluding the after-tax impact of non-cash, stock-based compensation expense and certain non-recurring charges. The Company believes it is useful to exclude the impact of income tax expense (benefit), as reported, because historically it has included irregular income tax items that do not reflect ongoing business operations. The Company also includes the impact of normalized income tax expense by applying a normalized statutory tax rate.The Company believes it is useful to exclude the impact of certain non-recurring charges, such as expenses associated with our workforce optimization, and other non-recurring charges because it does not believe that these items reflect its ongoing business operations. Other non-recurring charges include litigation reserve, impairment charges, debt amendment and warrant amortization costs related to our corporate financing facilities.The Company believes it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation expense because it is a non-cash charge.The Company also excludes the fair value mark-to-market adjustment on its asset-backed notes carried at fair value to align with the 2023 accounting policy decision to account for new debt financings at amortized cost.

The ex-dividend date is expected to be May 1, 2024. The monthly distribution information for the Fund appears below. First Trust Intermediate Duration Preferred & Income Fund (FPF): Distribution per share: $0.1375 Distribution Rate based on the April 19, 2024 NAV of $18.57: 8.89% Distribution Rate based on the April 19, 2024 closing market price of $17.06: 9.67% The majority, and possibly all, of this distribution will be paid out of net investment income earned by the Fund.

The final determination of the source and tax status of all 2024 distributions will be made after the end of 2024 and will be provided on Form 1099-DIV. The Fund has a practice of seeking to maintain a relatively stable monthly distribution which may be changed periodically. First Trust Advisors L.P. (""FTA"") believes the practice may benefit the Fund's market price and premium/discount to the Fund's NAV. The practice has no impact on the Fund's investment strategy and may reduce the Fund's NAV. The Fund is a diversified, closed-end management investment company that seeks to provide a high level of current income. The Fund has a secondary objective of capital appreciation. The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objectives by investing in preferred and other income-producing securities. Under normal market conditions, the Fund will invest at least 80% of its Managed Assets in a portfolio of preferred and other income-producing securities issued by U.S. and non-U.S. companies, including traditional preferred securities, hybrid preferred securities that have investment and economic characteristics of both preferred securities and debt securities, floating-rate and fixed-to-floating rate preferred securities, debt securities, convertible securities and contingent convertible securities.

Principal Risk Factors: Risks are inherent in all investing. Certain risks applicable to the Fund are identified below, which includes the risk that you could lose some or all of your investment in the Fund. The principal risks of investing in the Fund are spelled out in the Fund's annual shareholder reports. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor. The Fund also files reports, proxy statements and other information that is available for review. Past performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return and market value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. There can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. The Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. Market risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of a fund in general may fall in value. Investments held by the Fund are subject to market fluctuations caused by real or perceived adverse economic conditions, political events, regulatory factors or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, market manipulation, government defaults, government shutdowns, regulatory actions, political changes, diplomatic developments, the imposition of sanctions and other similar measures, spread of infectious disease or other public health issues, recessions, natural disasters or other events could have significant negative impact on a fund and its investments. Current market conditions risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of the fund in general, may fall in value due to current market conditions. As a means to fight inflation, the Federal Reserve and certain foreign central banks have raised interest rates and expect to continue to do so, and the Federal Reserve has announced that it intends to reverse previously implemented quantitative easing. Recent and potential future bank failures could result in disruption to the broader banking industry or markets generally and reduce confidence in financial institutions and the economy as a whole, which may also heighten market volatility and reduce liquidity. Ongoing armed conflicts between Russia and Ukraine in Europe and among Israel, Hamas and other militant groups in the Middle East, have caused and could continue to cause significant market disruptions and volatility within the markets in Russia, Europe, the Middle East and the United States. The hostilities and sanctions resulting from those hostilities have and could continue to have a significant impact on certain fund investments as well as fund performance and liquidity. The COVID-19 global pandemic, or any future public health crisis, and the ensuing policies enacted by governments and central banks have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets, negatively impacting global growth prospects. Preferred/hybrid and debt securities in which the Fund invests are subject to various risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and call risk. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend, interest and/or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result. Credit risk may be heightened for the Fund because it invests in below investment grade securities, which involve greater risks than investment grade securities, including the possibility of dividend or interest deferral, default or bankruptcy. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of fixed-rate securities in the Fund will decline because of rising market interest rates. Call risk is the risk that performance could be adversely impacted if an issuer calls higher-yielding debt instruments held by the Fund. These securities are also subject to issuer risk, floating rate and fixed-to-floating rate risk, prepayment risk, reinvestment risk, subordination risk and liquidity risk. The risks associated with trust preferred securities typically include the financial condition of the financial institution that creates the trust, as the trust typically has no business operations other than holding the subordinated debt issued by the financial institution and issuing the trust preferred securities and common stock backed by the subordinated debt Interest rate risk is the risk that securities will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates. The duration of a security will be expected to change over time with changes in market factors and time to maturity. Although the Fund seeks to maintain a duration, under normal market circumstances, excluding the effects of leverage, of between three and eight years, if the effect of the Fund's use of leverage was included in calculating duration, it could result in a longer duration for the Fund. Because the Fund is concentrated in the financials sector, it will be more susceptible to adverse economic or regulatory occurrences affecting this sector, such as changes in interest rates, loan concentration and competition. Investment in non-U.S. securities is subject to the risk of currency fluctuations and to economic and political risks associated with such foreign countries. Investments in securities of issuers located in emerging market countries are considered speculative and there is a heightened risk of investing in emerging markets securities. Financial and other reporting by companies and government entities also may be less reliable in emerging market countries. Shareholder claims that are available in the U.S., as well as regulatory oversight and authority that is common in the U.S., including for claims based on fraud, may be difficult or impossible for shareholders of securities in emerging market countries or for U.S. authorities to pursue. To the extent a fund invests in floating or variable rate obligations that use the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") as a reference interest rate, it is subject to LIBOR Risk. LIBOR has ceased to be made available as a reference rate and there is no assurance that any alternative reference rate, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR""), will be similar to or produce the same value or economic equivalence as LIBOR. The unavailability or replacement of LIBOR may affect the value, liquidity or return on certain fund investments and may result in costs incurred in connection with closing out positions and entering into new trades. Any potential effects of the transition away from LIBOR on a fund or on certain instruments in which a fund invests is difficult to predict and could result in losses to the fund. Contingent Capital Securities provide for mandatory conversion into common stock of the issuer under certain circumstances, which may limit the potential for income and capital appreciation and, under certain circumstances, may result in complete loss of the value of the investment. Reverse repurchase agreements involve leverage risk, the risk that the purchaser fails to return the securities as agreed upon, files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent. The Fund may be restricted from taking normal portfolio actions during such time, could be subject to loss to the extent that the proceeds of the agreement are less than the value of securities subject to the agreement and may experience adverse tax consequences. Use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify the effect of any losses. The risks of investing in the Fund are spelled out in the shareholder reports and other regulatory filings.

The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor. The Fund also files reports, proxy statements and other information that is available for review. Past performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return and market value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. There can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. The Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. Market risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of a fund in general may fall in value. Investments held by the Fund are subject to market fluctuations caused by real or perceived adverse economic conditions, political events, regulatory factors or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, market manipulation, government defaults, government shutdowns, regulatory actions, political changes, diplomatic developments, the imposition of sanctions and other similar measures, spread of infectious disease or other public health issues, recessions, natural disasters or other events could have significant negative impact on a fund and its investments. Current market conditions risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of the fund in general, may fall in value due to current market conditions. As a means to fight inflation, the Federal Reserve and certain foreign central banks have raised interest rates and expect to continue to do so, and the Federal Reserve has announced that it intends to reverse previously implemented quantitative easing. Recent and potential future bank failures could result in disruption to the broader banking industry or markets generally and reduce confidence in financial institutions and the economy as a whole, which may also heighten market volatility and reduce liquidity. Ongoing armed conflicts between Russia and Ukraine in Europe and among Israel, Hamas and other militant groups in the Middle East, have caused and could continue to cause significant market disruptions and volatility within the markets in Russia, Europe, the Middle East and the United States. The hostilities and sanctions resulting from those hostilities have and could continue to have a significant impact on certain fund investments as well as fund performance and liquidity. The COVID-19 global pandemic, or any future public health crisis, and the ensuing policies enacted by governments and central banks have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets, negatively impacting global growth prospects. The Fund will typically invest in senior loans rated below investment grade, which are commonly referred to as ""junk"" or ""high-yield"" securities and considered speculative because of the credit risk of their issuers. Such issuers are more likely than investment grade issuers to default on their payments of interest and principal owed to the Fund, and such defaults could reduce the Fund's NAV and income distributions. An economic downturn would generally lead to a higher non-payment rate, and a senior loan may lose significant market value before a default occurs. Moreover, any specific collateral used to secure a senior loan may decline in value or become illiquid, which would adversely affect the senior loan's value. The senior loan market has seen an increase in loans with weaker lender protections which may impact recovery values and/or trading levels in the future. The absence of financial maintenance covenants in a loan agreement generally means that the lender may not be able to declare a default if financial performance deteriorates. This may hinder the Fund's ability to reprice credit risk associated with a particular borrower and reduce the Fund's ability to restructure a problematic loan and mitigate potential loss. As a result, the Fund's exposure to losses on investments in senior loans may be increased, especially during a downturn in the credit cycle or changes in market or economic conditions. To the extent a fund invests in floating or variable rate obligations that use the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") as a reference interest rate, it is subject to LIBOR Risk. LIBOR has ceased to be made available as a reference rate and there is no assurance that any alternative reference rate, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR""), will be similar to or produce the same value or economic equivalence as LIBOR. The unavailability or replacement of LIBOR may affect the value, liquidity or return on certain fund investments and may result in costs incurred in connection with closing out positions and entering into new trades. Any potential effects of the transition away from LIBOR on a fund or on certain instruments in which a fund invests is difficult to predict and could result in losses to the fund. A second lien loan may have a claim on the same collateral pool as the first lien or it may be secured by a separate set of assets. Second lien loans are typically secured by a second priority security interest or lien on specified collateral securing the Borrower's obligation under the interest. Because second lien loans are second to first lien loans, they present a greater degree of investment risk. Specifically, these loans are subject to the additional risk that the cash flow of the Borrower and property securing the loan may be insufficient to meet scheduled payments after giving effect to those loans with a higher priority. In addition, loans that have a lower than first lien priority on collateral of the Borrower generally have greater price volatility than those loans with a higher priority and may be less liquid. In the event a borrower fails to pay scheduled interest or principal payments on a senior loan held by the Fund, the Fund will experience a reduction in its income and a decline in the value of the senior loan, which will likely reduce dividends and lead to a decline in the net asset value of the Fund's common shares. If the Fund acquires a senior loan from another lender, for example, by acquiring a participation, the Fund may also be subject to credit risks with respect to that lender. Although senior loans may be secured by specific collateral, the value of the collateral may not equal the Fund's investment when the senior loan is acquired or may decline below the principal amount of the senior loan subsequent to the Fund's investment. Also, to the extent that collateral consists of stock of the borrower or its subsidiaries or affiliates, the Fund bears the risk that the stock may decline in value, be relatively illiquid, and/or may lose all or substantially all of its value, causing the senior loan to be under collateralized. Therefore, the liquidation of the collateral underlying a senior loan may not satisfy the issuer's obligation to the Fund in the event of non-payment of scheduled interest or principal, and the collateral may not be readily liquidated. Distressed securities frequently do not produce income while they are outstanding. The Fund may be required to incur certain extraordinary expenses in order to protect and recover its investment. The Fund also will be subject to significant uncertainty as to when and in what manner and for what value the obligations evidenced by the distressed securities will eventually be satisfied. Use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify the effect of any losses. The Fund's portfolio is also subject to credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, prepayment risk and reinvestment risk. Interest rate risk is the risk that fixed-income securities will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend, interest and/or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result. Credit risk may be heightened for the Fund because it invests in below investment grade securities. Liquidity risk is the risk that the fund may have difficulty disposing of senior loans if it seeks to repay debt, pay dividends or expenses, or take advantage of a new investment opportunity.

The beginning of construction was celebrated on location, where Royal Caribbean Group President and CEO Jason Liberty and Royal Caribbean International President and CEO Michael Bayley were joined by The Bahamas' Prime Minister Philip Davis and Deputy Prime Minister I. Chester Cooper to commemorate the major milestone. The first of the Royal Beach Club Collection will take shape in the coming months ahead of its opening in 2025, and at the heart of the experience will be the island nation of The Bahamas. From the location – one of the island's most idyllic beaches – to the Bahamian food, culture and staff, to a unique public-private partnership in which Bahamians will own up to 49% equity, the all-new beach club combines the beauty and spirit of The Bahamas with signature Royal Caribbean touches across the experience, service and design. ""With the signing of this Heads of Agreement for the development of Royal Beach Club Paradise Island, we embark on this project to further enhance the vitality of our tourism product. Signing today's agreement, we add another world-class experience to our tourism offerings. And even more importantly, we take a bold step toward greater Bahamian empowerment in the tourism industry,"" said Honorable Philip Davis, Prime Minister of The Bahamas. Vacationers will be welcomed to their ultimate beach day at Royal Beach Club Paradise Island, starting with the vibrant and charming local architecture crafted by a local Bahamian architectural firm and the exceptional views of The Bahamas' renowned turquoise waters and white sand beaches. With more details to be revealed in the coming months, what's in store ranges from three stunning pools with swim-up bars to private cabanas, four island-style spots for quick bites and local fare, and experiences that feature local artisans and live music. ""Marking more than the beginning of the construction process, today's groundbreaking event symbolizes partnership, momentum and continued economic development for so many Bahamian entrepreneurs and the entire community,"" said Jason Liberty, president and CEO, Royal Caribbean Group. ""We are grateful to our partners for their support, especially the Bahamian government, who stand with us here today in celebration of what is to come."" Local businesses and entrepreneurs will also manage parts of the construction and experience, which will generate hundreds of jobs in the short and long term. To date, Bahamians have participated in workshops to develop authentic local dishes, music, entertainment, sports and activities as well as design ideas that reflect the true Bahamian spirit and style. ""As we break ground on Royal Beach Club Paradise Island, together with the government and the people of The Bahamas, we are celebrating what partnership and innovation can achieve. This will be yet one more reason, in Nassau's bright future, to experience a destination we have visited since the very beginning of Royal Caribbean more than 50 years ago,"" said Michael Bayley, president and CEO, Royal Caribbean International. ""The beauty and charm of the island are why we chose to debut the Royal Beach Club Collection in Nassau, and with the collaboration and support of local entrepreneurs and the wider community, we know that what we create will far exceed everything we imagined."" The construction plans, created in close collaboration with the Bahamian government, also include the cruise line's restoration of the native habitat that will help protect wildlife during the build and for many years to come. Guiding the overall development of the beach club experience are Royal Caribbean Group's sustainability vision and proven practices as well as The Bahamas' stringent environmental protection and planning process. Once complete, Royal Beach Club Paradise Island is expected to host an average of 2,000 guests. Vacationers will access the beach club via a ferry ride from the Nassau Cruise Port and return through historic downtown Nassau near the world-famous Straw Market.

Company remains well-positioned for value creation despite industry headwinds. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent financial results from Capital Bancorp, Inc. provide a nuanced picture for investors. While the net income of $6.6 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, represents a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year decrease, these figures should be considered in the context of ongoing investments and merger-related expenses. It's important to note the robust loan growth of $61.2 million and deposit growth of $109.7 million, indicating operational expansion and likely market confidence. The declared cash dividend of $0.08 per share is also a positive sign for investor returns, hinting at management's confidence in sustaining profitability. However, investors should remain cognizant of the operational cost increases, including higher interest expenses and salaries, which could pressure margins if not offset by revenue growth. Furthermore, the reported efficiency ratio increase suggests a need for vigilance over cost control measures. Market Research Analyst The company's loan portfolio growth and deposit accumulation are particularly telling. A 12.9% annualized increase in loan growth signals robust demand for Capital Bancorp's lending services, which could be indicative of either a strong local economy or effective business development strategies. The acquisition of Integrated Financial Holdings, Inc. demonstrates a strategic move to diversify their business, potentially opening up new revenue streams and customer bases. Nonetheless, investors should assess whether the projected synergies and strategic benefits outweigh the integration risks and costs. The deposit growth, with a notable 7.8% increase in noninterest bearing deposits, boosts the bank's liquidity without proportionate cost increases, providing a cushion for future investment or lending opportunities. This financial agility could offer a competitive edge in swiftly adapting market conditions. Legal and Regulatory Affairs Analyst Investors should carefully monitor the pending regulatory approval for the acquisition of Integrated Financial Holdings, Inc. Regulatory outcomes can significantly influence the finalization of the merger and the subsequent realization of its intended benefits. Given the current regulatory landscape, which remains quite stringent on bank mergers, it's prudent for stakeholders to stay informed on progress and potential roadblocks.

Nonperforming assets, which were comprised solely of nonperforming loans as of March 31, 2024, were $14.4 million, or 0.62% of total assets, down from $16.0 million, or 0.72% of total assets at December 31, 2023, and down from $16.3 million, or 0.73% of total assets at March 31, 2023. The near complete resolution of a single nonperforming asset from $7.6 million to $0.6 million was offset by a $5.8 million increase in nonperforming assets comprised of $2.4 million of residential real estate secured loans and $3.0 million of non owner-occupied commercial real estate loans to various borrowers that the Company is proactively managing toward resolution. Deposits were $2.0 billion at March 31, 2024, an increase of $109.7 million, or 5.8%, from the balance at December 31, 2023 and an increase of $61.3 million, or 3.2%, from the balance at March 31, 2023. Average deposits of $2.0 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased $72.5 million, or 3.8%, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2023. Rising interest rates have resulted in some customers moving balances from noninterest-bearing deposit accounts to interest-bearing deposit accounts. As a result of the migration, average noninterest-bearing deposit balances decreased $16.9 million to $637.1 million as of March 31, 2024, as compared to March 31, 2023. Noninterest-bearing deposits represented 33.2% of total deposits at March 31, 2024 compared to 36.3% at March 31, 2023. Uninsured deposits were approximately $855.7 million as of March 31, 2024, representing 42.7% of the Company's deposit portfolio, compared to $789.4 million, or 41.6%, at December 31, 2023, and $888.9 million, or 45.7%, at March 31, 2023. Stockholders’ equity increased to $259.5 million as of March 31, 2024, compared to $254.9 million at December 31, 2023 and $234.5 million at March 31, 2023. Shares repurchased and retired for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as part of the Company's stock repurchase program totaled 67,869 shares at an average price of $20.62, for a total cost of $1.4 million including commissions. As of March 31, 2024, the Bank's capital ratios continued to exceed the regulatory requirements for a “well-capitalized” institution.

The Company’s reportable segments represent business units with discrete financial information whose results are regularly reviewed by management. The four segments include Commercial Banking, Capital Bank Home Loans (the Company’s mortgage loan division), OpenSky™ (the Company’s credit card division) and the Corporate Office. Effective January 1, 2024, the Company allocated certain expenses previously recorded directly to the Commercial Bank segment to the other segments. These expenses are for shared services also consumed by OpenSkyTM, CBHL, and Corporate. The Company performs an allocation process based on several metrics the Company believes more accurately ascribe shared service overhead to each segment. The Company believes this reflects the cost of support for each segment that should be considered in assessing segment performance.

Appendix Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures The Company has presented the following non-GAAP (U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) financial measures because it believes that these measures provide useful and comparative information to assess trends in the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. Presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is consistent with how the Company evaluates its performance internally and these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in the Company’s industry. Investors should recognize that the Company’s presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures might not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP basis measures and the Company strongly encourages a review of its condensed consolidated financial statements in their entirety.

Conference call scheduled for April 23, 2024, to review financial results. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported net income and diluted earnings per share signify a plateau in growth for NBT Bancorp Inc., with only a slight increase from the previous year's figures. The earnings of $0.71 per diluted share, despite being higher than the preceding quarter, reflect a decrease when adjusted for share dilution year-over-year. This indicates a potential concern for investors regarding scalability and profit maximization in the current economic climate.Operating net income, a non-GAAP measure, decreased compared to the first quarter of 2023, which may be attributed to acquisition expenses and other specified items. Investors might see this as a sign of increased costs affecting the bottom line, despite revenue streams from fee-based businesses. The strategic emphasis on diversification into fee-based services is noteworthy as it contributes to over a third of total revenues, demonstrating an attempt to mitigate risks from interest rate fluctuations.The increase in net interest margin, albeit small, in a challenging interest rate environment could be seen as an indicator of effective asset-liability management. However, the minimal growth in net interest income year-over-year combined with an overall dip in net interest margin from the previous year could be a warning for potential margin compression. Market Research Analyst NBT Bancorp's deposit growth reflects robust liquidity trends, which is a positive signal to investors. The granular composition of over half a million accounts and an average account balance under $20,000 suggests a strong retail banking base, which can be seen as a positive indicator of stability and potential for cross-selling opportunities.However, the migration from noninterest-bearing to higher-cost deposits could squeeze margins if not met with proportional yield increases on the asset side. Investors would do well to monitor the loan to deposit ratio, which has seen a slight improvement, for insights into the bank's liquidity management and interest rate risk exposure. Credit Analyst Asset quality, as measured by net charge-offs and nonperforming loans, remains stable, a reassuring sign of credit risk management. The slight uptick in nonperforming loans year-over-year will be an area to watch, particularly as it may indicate potential weaknesses in the loan portfolio's health. The maintained allowance for loan losses signifies a prudent approach to potential future credit losses.From a credit perspective, the consistency in the allowance for loan losses ratio can be interpreted as a cautious stance by the bank, reflecting a measured response to current and anticipated loan performance. 04/22/2024 - 04:15 PM NORWICH, N.Y., April 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NBT Bancorp Inc.

TopBuild sieht einen adressierbaren Gesamtmarkt von über 18 Milliarden Dollar, mit Plänen, das Wachstum durch Akquisitionen zu fördern. Positive None. Negative The termination of the acquisition deal with Specialty Products and Insulation may impact TopBuild's growth strategy and expansion plans negatively in the short term. Legal Expert The mutual termination of an acquisition deal can hold significant legal implications, especially when considering the Hart-Scott Rodino Act compliance and regulatory approval processes. In this instance, TopBuild's decision to part ways with Specialty Products and Insulation (SPI) after failing to negotiate terms aligning with both parties and regulatory expectations reveals a prudent adherence to antitrust considerations. Regulatory bodies, such as the Department of Justice, define markets like the metal building insulation (MBI) business with precision and any misalignment can trigger antitrust concerns.Investors should be aware of the legal frameworks that govern such transactions. The Hart-Scott Rodino Act requires parties to file pre-merger notifications and undergo a waiting period, allowing regulators to examine the potential anti-competitive effects. The decision to withdraw these filings speaks to a larger strategic mindfulness that can prevent protracted legal battles and financial risks associated with potential regulatory rejections.The 23 million termination fee paid by TopBuild, although a significant outlay, also articulates the company's calculated approach to deal-making and its preparedness for such eventualities. For stakeholders, this transparency in the financial consequences of acquisition strategies is important for evaluating the company's fiscal responsibility. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the termination of this acquisition has tangible implications for TopBuild's investment strategy. The payment of a 23 million termination fee reduces immediate cash reserves, but it also frees up capital that had been earmarked for the acquisition. This presents a dual-edged sword; on one hand, it signals a potential loss of growth through consolidation, yet on the other, it reveals fiscal prudence and liquidity that might be directed to more fruitful opportunities.The mention of a robust pipeline of acquisition targets suggests that TopBuild is actively seeking to expand its market share within its total addressable market of over 18 billion. For investors, the reallocation of resources from a failed acquisition to other ventures could represent an agile business strategy, particularly in the highly fragmented insulation market. The company's history of successful mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and integration of businesses bodes well for future growth prospects.It is also important to consider the impact of such news on investor sentiment. While some might view the termination of a deal as a setback, others may interpret it as a sign of strong governance and risk management. The company’s commitment to reinvestment and shareholder value is a narrative likely to resonate with long-term investors. Market Research Analyst Analyzing the market dynamics in the context of this termination, it is apparent that TopBuild operates in a highly specialized yet fragmented sector. The insulation industry is undergoing consolidation and the cancellation of this deal highlights the competitive and regulatory challenges faced by firms attempting to scale through acquisitions.TopBuild's intention to remain active in the M&A arena shows an understanding of the importance of scale and service diversification in the residential, commercial and industrial end markets. The reference to a total addressable market of more than 18 billion indicates substantial growth opportunities that exist within the industry. Investors should note that the company’s strategy to reinvest free cash flow into acquisitions has the potential to yield considerable expansions in market reach and service offerings, provided future deals are successfully executed.This broader market understanding is pivotal for investors gauging the future direction of TopBuild and the insulation market as a whole. While the termination of this specific deal may appear as a near-term hurdle, the ongoing search for acquisition targets suggests that TopBuild is determined to capitalize on the broader market potential, which signals a positive outlook for growth-driven investment. 04/22/2024 - 04:15 PM TopBuild’s Total Addressable Market is >$18 Billion; Significant Opportunity to Continue Driving Growth Organically and through Acquisitions DAYTONA BEACH, Fla., April 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TopBuild Corp. (NYSE:BLD), a leading installer and specialty distributor of insulation and building material products to the construction industry in the United States and Canada, today announced the mutual termination of its agreement to acquire Specialty Products and Insulation (“SPI”), originally announced on July 27, 2023. Robert Buck, President and Chief Executive Officer of TopBuild, stated, “We are highly disciplined around our approach to M&A and driving shareholder value. “Over the last several months, we worked cooperatively to explore alternatives in a manner consistent with the Department of Justice’s view of the metal building insulation (“MBI”) business, which they defined narrowly. Because the parties were not able to agree to terms at a value that worked for both parties and that would be likely to obtain regulatory approval within the DOJ’s view of the MBI business, we have agreed to terminate the transaction. “We intend to stay active on the acquisition front. We have a robust pipeline of opportunities, a core competency in integrating businesses and a proven M&A track record. Our total addressable market is more than $18 billion across the highly fragmented residential, commercial, and industrial and mechanical insulation end markets, and we continue to believe that reinvesting our strong free cash flow to make acquisitions will drive increased shareholder value.” The parties agreed to terminate the transaction and withdrew their Hart-Scott Rodino filings effective April 22, 2024. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, TopBuild paid a termination fee of $23 million. About TopBuildTopBuild Corp., headquartered in Daytona Beach, Florida, is a leading installer and specialty distributor of insulation and related building material products to the construction industry in the United States and Canada. We provide insulation installation services nationwide through our Installation segment which has approximately 240 branches located across the United States.

Why did TopBuild terminate the agreement to acquire Specialty Products and Insulation?

What is TopBuild's total addressable market? TopBuild's total addressable market is over $18 billion across the residential, commercial, and industrial and mechanical insulation end markets. When was the termination of the agreement effective? The termination of the agreement was effective on April 22, 2024. How much was the termination fee paid by TopBuild? TopBuild paid a termination fee of $23 million following the withdrawal of filings related to the termination of the agreement."

Financial Analyst The closing of Centuri's IPO, facilitated by heavyweights like UBS Investment Bank, BofA Securities and J.P. Morgan, signifies a momentous step for Southwest Gas, opening new avenues for capital allocation and investment strategies. The oversubscription, indicated by the full exercise of the underwriters' option for over-allotments, reflects robust investor interest, potentially foreshadowing a positive market trajectory for Centuri. The parallel private placement by entities affiliated with Carl C. Icahn is noteworthy, as it points to strategic investor confidence at the IPO valuation, which could serve as a market stabilizer during the post-IPO period. Market Research Analyst This IPO is emblematic of the energy sector's dynamics, where infrastructure and utilities companies like Centuri are scaling operations to meet the evolving demands. Centuri's entry into public markets may attract sector-specific investors and diversify the shareholder base, which in turn can lead to increased scrutiny and expectations of corporate governance and performance benchmarking. This could result in a more disciplined capital deployment and potentially unlock shareholder value. Legal Expert The legal aspect of this transaction, specifically the adherence to SEC regulations and the private placement to Icahn-affiliated entities, underscores the complexity of capital market operations. It's important for investors to understand that such private placements, while common, exclude retail investors and could give preferential access to industry insiders. Furthermore, the rigorous registration process with the SEC serves as a quality check for potential investors, reinforcing the credibility of the offering. 04/22/2024 - 04:10 PM LAS VEGAS, April 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc.

Certain risks applicable to the Fund are identified below, which includes the risk that you could lose some or all of your investment in the Fund. The principal risks of investing in the Fund are spelled out in the Fund's annual shareholder reports. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor. The Fund also files reports, proxy statements and other information that is available for review. Past performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return and market value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. There can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. The Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. Market risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of a fund in general may fall in value. Investments held by the Fund are subject to market fluctuations caused by real or perceived adverse economic conditions, political events, regulatory factors or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, market manipulation, government defaults, government shutdowns, regulatory actions, political changes, diplomatic developments, the imposition of sanctions and other similar measures, spread of infectious disease or other public health issues, recessions, natural disasters or other events could have significant negative impact on a fund and its investments. Current market conditions risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of the fund in general, may fall in value due to current market conditions. As a means to fight inflation, the Federal Reserve and certain foreign central banks have raised interest rates and expect to continue to do so, and the Federal Reserve has announced that it intends to reverse previously implemented quantitative easing. Recent and potential future bank failures could result in disruption to the broader banking industry or markets generally and reduce confidence in financial institutions and the economy as a whole, which may also heighten market volatility and reduce liquidity. Ongoing armed conflicts between Russia and Ukraine in Europe and among Israel, Hamas and other militant groups in the Middle East, have caused and could continue to cause significant market disruptions and volatility within the markets in Russia, Europe, the Middle East and the United States. The hostilities and sanctions resulting from those hostilities have and could continue to have a significant impact on certain fund investments as well as fund performance and liquidity. The COVID-19 global pandemic, or any future public health crisis, and the ensuing policies enacted by governments and central banks have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets, negatively impacting global growth prospects. The Fund invests in non-investment grade debt instruments, commonly referred to as ""high-yield securities"". High-yield securities are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher ratings. Lower-quality debt tends to be less liquid than higher-quality debt. The debt securities in which the Fund invests are subject to certain risks, including issuer risk, reinvestment risk, prepayment risk, credit risk, and interest rate risk. Issuer risk is the risk that the value of fixed-income securities may decline for a number of reasons which directly relate to the issuer. Reinvestment risk is the risk that income from the Fund's portfolio will decline if the Fund invests the proceeds from matured, traded or called bonds at market interest rates that are below the Fund portfolio's current earnings rate. Prepayment risk is the risk that, upon a prepayment, the actual outstanding debt on which the Fund derives interest income will be reduced. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend, interest and/or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result. Interest rate risk is the risk that fixed-income securities will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates. In times of unusual or adverse market, economic, regulatory or political conditions, the Fund may not be able, fully or partially, to implement its short selling strategy. Short selling creates special risks which could result in increased volatility of returns and may result in greater gains or greater losses. The Fund invests in securities of non-U.S. issuers which are subject to higher volatility than securities of U.S. issuers. Because the Fund invests in non-U.S. securities, you may lose money if the local currency of a non-U.S. market depreciates against the U.S. dollar. Investments in securities of issuers located in emerging market countries are considered speculative and there is a heightened risk of investing in emerging markets securities. Financial and other reporting by companies and government entities also may be less reliable in emerging market countries. Shareholder claims that are available in the U.S., as well as regulatory oversight and authority that is common in the U.S., including for claims based on fraud, may be difficult or impossible for shareholders of securities in emerging market countries or for U.S. authorities to pursue. To the extent a fund invests in floating or variable rate obligations that use the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") as a reference interest rate, it is subject to LIBOR Risk. LIBOR has ceased to be made available as a reference rate and there is no assurance that any alternative reference rate, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR""), will be similar to or produce the same value or economic equivalence as LIBOR. The unavailability or replacement of LIBOR may affect the value, liquidity or return on certain fund investments and may result in costs incurred in connection with closing out positions and entering into new trades. Any potential effects of the transition away from LIBOR on a fund or on certain instruments in which a fund invests is difficult to predict and could result in losses to the fund. Forward foreign currency exchange contracts involve certain risks, including the risk of failure of the counterparty to perform its obligations under the contract and the risk that the use of forward contracts may not serve as a complete hedge because of an imperfect correlation between movements in the prices of the contracts and the prices of the currencies hedged. Distressed securities frequently do not produce income while they are outstanding. The Fund may be required to incur certain extraordinary expenses in order to protect and recover its investment. The Fund also will be subject to significant uncertainty as to when and in what manner and for what value the obligations evidenced by the distressed securities will eventually be satisfied. Illiquid and restricted securities may be difficult to dispose of at a fair price at the times when the Fund believes it is desirable to do so. Use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify the effect of any losses. The risks of investing in the Fund are spelled out in the shareholder reports and other regulatory filings. The information presented is not intended to constitute an investment recommendation for, or advice to, any specific person. By providing this information, First Trust is not undertaking to give advice in any fiduciary capacity within the meaning of ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code or any other regulatory framework.

Financial Analyst Ameriprise Financial's recent earnings release indicating a significant increase in GAAP net income per diluted share from $3.79 to $9.46 suggests a robust fiscal quarter, likely driven by favorable market conditions impacting derivatives and market risk benefits. The adjusted operating earnings per diluted share also saw a healthy year-over-year increase of 16%. Moreover, the company's decision to raise its quarterly dividend by 10% is a testament to its strong free cash flow and commitment to shareholder returns, a factor that can appeal to dividend-focused investors. It's also essential to note the reported assets under management and administration growth to $1.4 trillion, a 15% bump, likely reflecting both client net inflows and market appreciation. Such financial soundness and growth indicators are typically influential on investment decisions as they reflect a company's potential for sustained profitability. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the diversified business contributions mentioned, particularly Wealth Management as a growth driver, suggest that Ameriprise Financial is successfully capitalizing on broader market trends. The consistency in the capital position and the strategic allocation of capital towards growth and shareholder returns imply a forward-looking management approach. This can be particularly attractive for long-term investors who look for stability and growth potential. However, the noted mid-single-digit growth expectation in general and administrative expenses could mean the company anticipates ongoing investments in operational efficiency, which could marginally impact profit margins short-term but may be positive for long-term operational leverage. Investment Advisor Looking at Ameriprise Financial's results through the lens of an advisor, the company's improved GAAP Return on Equity and the increased dividend suggest management's confidence in the company's financial health and outlook. For retail investors, this portrays a picture of a potentially stable investment with prospects for income through dividends, as well as capital appreciation. However, it's important for investors to also consider the overall market conditions, as the results were, in part, buoyed by positive market impacts — a factor that can quickly shift with market volatility. Balancing this earnings report would involve considering both the company's individual performance metrics and external market forces. 04/22/2024 - 04:08 PM MINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE: AMP): Earnings Per Diluted Share Return on Equity, ex AOCI (1) Q1 2024 Q1 2024 GAAP $9.46 GAAP 48.1% Adjusted Operating $8.39 Adjusted Operating 49.0% First quarter adjusted operating earnings per diluted share was $8.39, up 16 percent from strong growth across the company.

Wealth Management continues to be our primary growth driver with firm-wide assets under management and administration increasing to a new high of $1.4 trillion aided by positive markets. The combination of our businesses and capabilities provides important strength, allowing us to serve clients’ needs well in a dynamic operating environment. Our capital position is a consistent differentiator. Ameriprise generates significant free cash flow that we invest for growth and return to shareholders, including today’s announcement of another increase in our dividend, up 10 percent.” First quarter GAAP net income per diluted share was $9.46 compared to $3.79 a year ago, primarily from market impacts on the valuation of derivatives and market risk benefits. Adjusted operating net revenues increased 11 percent from organic growth, strong equity markets and higher spread revenues. Assets under management and administration reached $1.4 trillion, up 15 percent from strong client net inflows and market appreciation.

Pretax adjusted operating margin was 26.3 percent and adjusted operating return on equity was 49.0 percent. The company returned $650 million of capital to shareholders in the quarter, demonstrating its balance sheet strength and strong free cash flow generation.

Adjusted operating net revenues increased 13 percent to $2.6 billion from growth in client assets in both wrap and brokerage accounts, increased transactional activity and a 30 percent increase in bank net investment income. Adjusted operating expenses increased 14 percent to $1.8 billion compared to a year ago. Distribution expenses increased 17 percent. General and administrative expense was $420 million, up 7 percent. The company expects mid-single digit growth in general and administrative expenses for the full year. The Wealth Management business continued to deliver profitable organic growth. Clients and advisors remained engaged and focused on positioning portfolios to meet financial planning goals through the market cycle. Total client assets grew 19 percent to $954 billion, with wrap assets up 20 percent to $522 billion. In the quarter, total client net flows were $8.5 billion, including wrap flows of $6.5 billion. Transactional activity increased 17 percent with strong growth in structured annuities and brokerage, an initial sign that clients are leveraging the company’s planning model to put money back to work. Cash balances were fairly stable at $43.3 billion, with cash sweep down only $1.0 billion in the quarter reflecting normal seasonal patterns. Total client cash including third-party money market funds and brokered CDs increased $0.9 billion sequentially to $82.4 billion, as clients remain heavily concentrated in yield-oriented products. The advisor network and advisor productivity grew from a year ago.

NM Not Meaningful - variance equal to or greater than 100% Asset Management adjusted operating net revenues grew 7 percent to $855 million and pretax adjusted operating earnings increased 25 percent to $206 million. Financial results reflected equity market appreciation and disciplined expense management, which more than offset the cumulative impact of net outflows. Net pretax adjusted operating margin was 35 percent, consistent with the company’s targeted range of 31 to 35 percent. Adjusted operating expenses increased 2 percent, with general and administrative expenses flat from a year ago. Adjusted for foreign exchange and higher performance fee compensation, general and administrative expense was 3 percent lower than last year reflecting the benefits from comprehensive expense management initiatives taken since 2023. Total assets under management increased 7 percent to $652 billion as equity market appreciation more than offset net outflows. The underlying fee rate remained stable at 46 basis points. In the quarter, net outflows were $5.7 billion. Flows included $0.8 billion of outflows related to legacy insurance partners. Retail net outflows were $2.7 billion, consistent with other active managers. Gross sales improved in North America and EMEA year-over-year and sequentially, while redemptions remained stable. Global institutional outflows were $2.2 billion, primarily from a slowdown in the funding of new mandates, as well as redemptions in lower fee mandates and $0.4 billion of outflows from the previously announced proactive portfolio manager actions related to expense management initiatives.

Peer groupings of Columbia funds are defined by Lipper category and are based on the Primary Share Class (i.e., Institutional if available, otherwise Advisor or Institutional 3 share class), net of fees. Peer groupings of Threadneedle funds are defined by either IA or Morningstar index and are based on Primary Share Class. Comparisons to Index are measured Gross of Fees. To calculate asset weighted performance, the sum of the total assets of the funds with above median ranking are divided by total assets of all funds. Funds with more assets will receive a greater share of the total percentage above or below median. Aggregated Asset Allocation Funds may include funds that invest in other Columbia or Threadneedle branded mutual funds included in both equity and fixed income. Morningstar as of 03/31/24. Columbia funds are available for purchase by U.S. customers. Out of 89 Columbia funds rated (based on primary share class), 3 received a 5-star Overall Rating and 38 received a 4-star Overall Rating. Out of 145 Threadneedle funds rated (based on highest-rated share class), 22 received a 5-star Overall Rating and 54 received a 4-star Overall Rating.
