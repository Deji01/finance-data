Motley Fool,Nvidia Just Dropped Great News for Super Micro Computer Stock,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-just-dropped-great-news-195000502.html,The server manufacturer's growth could get a nice shot in the arm thanks to Nvidia's next-generation chips.,"Share prices of Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) took off in the past year, gaining 1,180% as of this writing, and a big reason behind the stock's red-hot surge is the booming demand for Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) artificial intelligence (AI) graphics cards.Supermicro's modular server rack-scale systems are being used to mount AI-related graphics cards from Nvidia, as well as other chipmakers. As the demand for Nvidia's cards has increased, Supermicro has also witnessed a terrific jump in demand for its server solutions, leading to rapid growth in the company's top and bottom lines.SMCI Revenue (Quarterly) ChartAnd now, a recent revelation from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang suggests that Supermicro's eye-popping growth will continue.Nvidia's adoption of liquid-cooled systems should give Super Micro Computer a boostNvidia's current flagship AI graphics card, the H100, reportedly performs well under air cooling. What's more, the upcoming H200 processor is also anticipated to perform optimally while being air-cooled, according to Tom's Hardware. But at an economic summit at Stanford this week, Huang said that one of Nvidia's next-generation computers is going to be liquid-cooled.Nvidia's next-generation AI graphics processing units (GPUs) based on the Blackwell architecture are expected to consume 40% more power than the existing offerings based on the Hopper architecture. According to some other claims, Nvidia's next-generation AI chips could even consume double the power of the current lineup. This is where liquid-cooled server systems are going to come into the picture.When launching what Supermicro claimed to be the first liquid-cooled server systems for Nvidia's H100 processors last year, the company said:Savings for a data center are estimated to be 40% for power when using Supermicro liquid cooling solutions compared to an air-cooled data center. In addition, up to 86% reduction in direct cooling costs compared to existing data centers may be realized.Story continuesA look at third-party studies suggests something similar. Liquid cooling reportedly consumes just 20% of the energy required for air cooling. In other words, liquid cooling is known to reduce energy consumption in data centers significantly, while also helping reduce operating expenses by using less water than air-cooled data centers.Supermicro seems to have been ahead of the curve, as it took the initiative to launch liquid-cooling solutions for Nvidia's AI chips last year. The company is now working to boost the manufacturing capacity of liquid-cooled server racks. On its January earnings conference call, Supermicro management remarked: ""By this June quarter, we will have high-volume, dedicated capacity for manufacturing 100-kilowatt to 120-kilowatt racks with liquid-cooling capabilities, providing DLC, direct liquid cooling racks capacity, up to 1,500 racks per month, and our total rack production capacity will be up to 5,000 racks per month by then.""The company's focus on expanding its capacity of liquid-cooled servers will not only let it take advantage of Nvidia's power-hungry AI chips but also allow it to make a dent in the fast-growing market for liquid-cooled data centers as a whole. The liquid-cooled data center market is expected to generate annual revenue of $40 billion in 2033, compared with just $4.5 billion last year, clocking an annual growth rate of 24% over the next decade.As such, it won't be surprising to see Supermicro maintaining its healthy pace of growth for a long time to come.The stock's valuation makes buying it a no-brainerThough Supermicro has been on a tear on the stock market over the past year, its sales multiple stands at just 6.7. That's cheaper than the technology sector's price-to-sales ratio of 7.1. Moreover, Supermicro's forward earnings multiple of 36 points toward a big jump in its bottom line, considering its trailing earnings multiple of 84.As the following chart suggests, Supermicro's earnings are set to take off big time from the previous fiscal year's reading of $11.81 per share.SMCI EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year ChartIt's also worth noting that analysts have raised their earnings growth expectations from the company, and there's a good chance that they may keep raising those estimates considering added catalysts such as the growing demand for liquid-cooled systems. That's why now would be a good time for investors to buy this AI stock, as it seems capable of sustaining its stunning rally in the long run.Should you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?Before you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,These 2 Dow Stocks Are Set to Soar in 2024 and Beyond,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-dow-stocks-set-soar-191000261.html,The Dow has attracted some dynamic consumer companies in recent years.,"When investors think of stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, some might think the index has more than its share of stodgy industrial companies unlikely to produce more than nominal returns and ignore its component parts. But in recent years, Dow parent S&P Global has replaced old-economy companies such as Alcoa and General Electric in the index with more dynamic stocks that better represent the new economy.This still-relevant index still has some stocks that hold the potential for significant gains. Two Dow components that remain relevant are Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Nike (NYSE: NKE). Let's find out a bit more about these two stocks and why they are set to soar in 2024 and beyond.1. AmazonMost people know Amazon best for its e-commerce site and its various Prime subscription services. But its potential as a growth stock primarily lies in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) segment. As a cloud provider, AWS plays a crucial role in supporting third-party applications and services of all sorts, including those driven by artificial intelligence (AI).AWS has long been the largest cloud provider, and it wants to leverage that leadership into a ""full stack"" approach to AI. This means building customized chips, writing software layers, training its models, and providing simple front ends that allow convenient connections to various AI services.Image source: Synergy Research Group.In 2023, just 16% of the company's revenue came from AWS. At the same time, though, it supplied two-thirds of Amazon's operating income that year.The company's other segments include fast-growing businesses such as advertising, subscriptions, and third-party seller services. The largest segment is online sales. It's also the segment with the slowest growth at the moment and the narrowest margins.Still, because of Amazon's segment diversity, it can grow fast even though it already has a mammoth $1.8 trillion market cap. Analysts forecast 44% net income growth this year and 26% in 2025. Also, at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 42 for the company, investors can benefit from Amazon's AI-driven growth without paying a massive premium.Story continues2. NikeNike accomplished something seemingly impossible in the consumer space: It built competitive advantages in the sports apparel and equipment businesses. Aside from owning one of the world's most recognized brands, its well-managed global supply chain allows it to reduce production costs while building a worldwide following. Moreover, Nike has spent heavily on research and development to innovate in its respective specialties, and it invests a lot in marketing and maintaining a considerable social media presence.A big marketing investment is celebrity endorsements from popular athletes in multiple sports. And for all the focus on active athletes, the strategy works with retired athletes as well (perhaps the best example of this strategy is the enduring popularity of the Jordan brand more than two decades after Michael Jordan's NBA retirement).Unfortunately for Nike, the company's performance has suffered in recent quarters amid a sluggish economy. For the first six months of fiscal 2024 (ended Nov. 30, 2023), net income of just over $3 billion rose 8% versus the same period last year.The stock has struggled to gain traction since reaching its pandemic-driven highs in late 2021. Currently, it sells at a 45% discount from that high.However, it could be poised for a comeback. A refresh of its more popular brands in the spring and the upcoming Summer Olympics could be a marketing win for the company.Also, by next year, analysts expect profits to rise by 18%. Such growth could take the sting out of the forward P/E ratio of 28 and spark a long-awaited comeback for Nike stock.Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,"Can Nvidia Rally 21% and Surpass Apple to Become the Second Most Valuable ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-rally-21-surpass-apple-190500283.html,"Nvidia has the momentum, but don't count Apple out just yet.","March 8 was a wild day in the stock market. Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) surged to an all-time high of $974 only to fall over 10% from that high to end the day at $875.28. At the peak, Nvidia was less than 9% away from surpassing Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) in market cap. By close, it was a little over 20% away.Given Nvidia's big swings, it seems like the stock could very well surpass Apple to become the second most valuable ""Magnificent Seven"" stock behind Microsoft. Here's why Nvidia could keep outperforming Apple in the short term, but why Apple is the better long-term buy.Image source: Getty Images.Earnings are driving the Nvidia storyNvidia is not an unprofitable growth stock that is rallying based on optimism and greed alone (although those are contributing factors). The business is doing phenomenally well, achieving a level of sales and earnings growth paired with margin expansion.NVDA Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsThe only concern with Nvidia is its valuation. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio based on its trailing 12-month (TTM) earnings is 73.6. But consensus analyst estimates expect Nvidia's earnings per share (EPS) to more than double from the $11.90 it earned in fiscal 2024 to $24.50 in fiscal 2025. That gives Nvidia a forward P/E of 35.7 -- which is far more reasonable.The easiest way for Nvidia to pass Apple in market cap is for investors to keep bidding up the stock. But the more realistic way is if Nvidia's earnings live up to expectations.Nvidia will report its full-year fiscal 2025 results some time in late February or early March next year. If it reports $24.50 in earnings, the stock would likely be far higher, especially if there is optimism for even more growth ahead. A business that is more than doubling earnings with high margins and leading the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution deserves a premium valuation, probably something like double the P/E of the S&P 500.Nvidia deserves the highest P/E of all the Magnificent Seven companies, but the company is nearing a point where it is running up too far, too fast.Story continuesNvidia benefited from earnings growth and a valuation expansion. It's hard to assume the valuation will continue to expand, but the stock could still go up if the first half of fiscal 2025 goes as analysts expect. Each new quarter of high earnings will increase the trailing-12-month number and lower the P/E, leaving room for the stock to rise to fill the gap. There is nothing better in the stock market than earnings growth, and right now Nvidia has it, and Apple doesn't.Buying Apple when it is out of favor has historically been a genius moveSo why is Apple the better buy if Nvidia has such an easy path forward? Simply put, I think the setup for Apple makes it a much better investment. Nvidia may be the better trade, but a more surefire way of building wealth is by compounding over the long term.Market sentiment is negative toward Apple. So negative, in fact, that Apple trades at a discount to the S&P 500. The only reason that should ever happen is if something serious was going wrong with Apple. The company has its challenges, but none of them warrant an underperformance like we have been seeing for the last six months or so.The abridged version of why Apple stock is under pressure is because it hasn't captured the spotlight with some major AI monetization announcement (Nvidia, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms have). iPhone sales are down in China, and growth is sluggish in general. But Apple has endured these periods before and overcome competition.Piper Sandler's fall 2023 survey found that 87% of Gen Z had an iPhone, 88% expected their next phone to be an iPhone, and 34% owned an Apple Watch. The iPhone is essentially a consumer staple in the U.S. and is growing well across international markets outside of China.Investors should focus less on the competition and more on Apple's ability to further monetize its existing devices through services and AI. The key for Apple has always been to increase the depth (services) and breadth (more products like phones, computers, tablets, wearables, ear buds, and more) of its ecosystem. Having lifetime customers consistently increase their spending relies on product improvements.The pressure is on Apple to make a splash this summer to drive iPhone demand and upgrades. If Apple delivers the improvements that drive growth, the stock could soar. But even if it doesn't, it generates plenty of extra cash to make an acquisition and grow that way, or return cash to shareholders while maintaining a rock-solid balance sheet.Apple's brand, market position, and financial health give it the time and the wiggle room needed to make mistakes. The company is known for not leading investors on and only makes announcements when it feels the product or service is ready.Apple has a better risk/reward profile than NvidiaNvidia has to hit sky-high earnings forecasts to keep going up. The semiconductor industry is also highly cyclical, and a downturn in customer spending could stall its growth trajectory. Nvidia may keep growing at a breakneck pace in the near term, but eventually, it will slow down. When that time comes, investors may be less willing to give Nvidia a multiple that is triple the market average.Meanwhile, Apple is already a good value and has a clear path toward regaining Wall Street's favor.I don't have a crystal ball, but if I had to guess, I would say Nvidia will briefly become more valuable than Apple. But three to five years from now, I think Apple will be worth more than Nvidia while also being a safer and less volatile investment.Nvidia stands out as a high-risk/high-potential-reward play, while Apple is more like a low-risk/medium-potential-reward investment. Investors who are confident about sustained high demand for Nvidia's products will want to watch each quarterly earnings report, understanding the importance earnings play in the story. The big gains have already been made in Nvidia, and investors should expect more reasonable returns going forward.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: Palantir vs. Nvidia,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-183500910.html,Two top AI stocks are fighting for your investment dollars.,"Software company Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) and chip company Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) are two of the hottest stocks on Wall Street. Both stocks are up over 240% over the past year and have fierce loyalty among investors.Is one artificial intelligence (AI) stock better than the other? To find out, I compared them head-to-head to see why they're thriving and whether they can continue. It was a very close race, but one stood out just ahead of the other.Here is what you need to know.Meeting these two very different companiesBoth stocks soared due to the fantastic performance of their underlying businesses. However, these two AI companies are very different. Nvidia spent years specializing in high-performance GPUs, which became ideal for data centers and AI. Nvidia's high-quality products and CUDA software, which helps customers efficiently use their GPUs power, have led to Nvidia grabbing an early stranglehold on the AI chip market -- an estimated 80% to 90%.On the other hand, Palantir builds custom software applications for both government and commercial applications. It runs three software platforms: Gotham, Foundry, and AIP for AI applications. You can think of Palantir as an operating system that helps organizations use their data. The company's intent is that it augments human intelligence; it doesn't replace it.A closer look at each company's growthFrom a pure numbers standpoint, Nvidia is growing leaps and bounds faster than Palantir. You can see below how both companies began accelerating revenue growth in mid-2023, but Nvidia soared on massive data center spending from big technology customers, mainly in the ""Magnificent Seven."" It could be fair to wonder how long this enormous boost in data center spending from big tech will continue.One possibility is that these companies start producing custom chips in-house, weaning themselves off of Nvidia's. That could hurt long-term growth for a company currently getting most of its revenue from a small handful of customers.Story continuesNVDA Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) ChartSpeaking of Palantir, the company is not as explosive as Nvidia. But what impresses me is the company's expanding customer base. Palantir's U.S. customer count grew 55% year over year in the fourth quarter and 22% quarter over quarter. Customers come in all shapes and sizes, so it's not a precise translation. Such customer growth bodes well for long-term revenue growth.Maybe Nvidia's customer concentration won't matter, and Nvidia's chips will maintain their market share. Still, I'd like to see customer expansion like Palantir's.What's the better bang for your buck?Analysts expect significant earnings growth from both companies moving forward. On a forward basis, that makes both stocks cheaper than you would guess after both of their 200% runs. I like using the PEG ratio to compare how much I pay for a company's earnings growth. The lower the PEG ratio, the better, and I would like to spend under 1.5 if I can.Nvidia fits that criteria with a PEG ratio of just over 1. Palantir doesn't quite fit, with its PEG ratio of 1.6.NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) ChartNvidia is handily the better value today, based on each company's expected long-term earnings growth. Of course, the caveat is whether each company will perform up to expectations.The verdict is...Both companies are excellent AI stocks and leaders in their respective areas. Both are accelerating their revenue growth. Naturally, analysts are very optimistic about each company's earnings growth moving forward. Whichever company you believe is more likely to meet growth expectations over the next three to five years is probably your winner.This Fool is giving Palantir a slight edge. Why?Palantir gets roughly half its revenue from government contracts. The company's long history with the government could put a bit of a floor into Palantir's business, plus the upside from expanding its customer base. Meanwhile, Nvidia's customer concentration could be problematic if a significant customer opts for another chip.While the numbers say Nvidia is the better buy, there's an argument that investors can trust Palantir's long-term growth slightly more, especially when looking at the long term.Should you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?Before you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

Money managers are using credit derivatives indexes like the Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index to gain the exposure they want.“CDX is a liquid way to get credit risk when cash bonds are harder to find,” said Scott Kimball, chief investment officer at Loop Capital Asset Management. “A significant amount of the recent tightening is institutions looking to put more money to work than there are bonds available.”A “roll” of credit default swap contracts at the end of March should be a short-term boost for the credit derivatives index market and lead to outperformance, according to Fraser Lundie, head of fixed income at Federated Hermes. The roll, a release of new indexes tracking a refreshed basket of companies, effectively resets the maturity for so-called on-the-run contracts every six months and typically leads to an increase in the volume of trades.“On the long side, it’s an opportunity to extend by six months and pick up extra spread,” Lundie said. “On the short side, the opposite is true and this extra cost may psychologically weigh on some investors, reconsidering the rationale to continue holding the negative view or adjusting its size.”Story continuesMohammed Kazmi is among the investors using the synthetic indexes to express his bullish view on the junk bond market. Instead of buying individual bonds, the portfolio manager and chief strategist at Union Bancaire Privee uses contracts on the likes of CDX.HY and iTraxx Crossover indexes.“We like them because of their liquidity but also from a valuation perspective. You’re currently paid to be in CDS versus cash,” he said in an interview, referring to the relatively wide level of the derivatives’ spreads compared with that of an equivalent cash bond.CDS indexes are the most liquid instruments in the entire credit market, with hundreds of billions of dollars worth of contracts changing hands every month. Wagers on tighter spreads for high-grade contracts have sent the CDX IG and iTraxx Europe indexes to almost the lowest levels since the global financial crisis.“If you’re a fund manager and you said, ‘I thought there was going to be a recession, now it doesn’t appear there’s going to be’, you’re just a forced buyer. Maybe it’s CDX, maybe it’s individual companies,” Jeffrey Klingelhofer, co-head of investments at Thornburg Investment Management, said of the market. “You feel like you can’t miss out on it any more.” Thornburg doesn’t currently trade CDX.Click here to listen to a podcast on asset-based lending with Bruce Richards of Marathon Asset Management.To be sure, the broader tightening masks some fragmentation in parts of the market. Euro-denominated bonds issued from firms rated CCC and below, which are at high risk of going bust, have missed out on the general rally. In addition, an S&P Global Ratings worldwide tracker of corporate failures in 2024 reached the highest year-to-date level since 2009, the ratings company said in a recent release.Bank of America Corp. strategists Ioannis Angelakis and Barnaby Martin this week recommended using the CDS options “as a way to insulate from the notable market euphoria,” especially in high-grade credit.Still, calls for wider default swap spreads in recent weeks have proven misplaced as credit kept rallying regardless. And with traders having already moderated their expectations of rate cuts this year, there is no obvious bogeyman left.“The question for me is how much widening can you get while waiting to be invested?” Kazmi said. “What are the triggers for very large widening? I don’t see them on the horizon.”Week in ReviewLess than a year ago, investors were gaming out what would happen when billions of dollars of bonds reached maturity dates, leaving borrowers potentially crushed by costly refinancings.

These 2 Stocks Could Be Bargain Buys for 2024 and Beyond",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-000-2-stocks-could-160000157.html,"Nvidia and Twilio are likely to climb higher thanks to the lucrative industries they serve, but investors can buy them at at reasonable levels now.","The stock market has gotten off to a solid start in 2024 with the S&P 500 index already up by close to 8% and setting new highs, and the good part is that the market could keep rising thanks to a strong U.S. economy and receding inflation.Technology stocks, in particular, could have another solid year on the back of catalysts such as artificial intelligence (AI). It is worth noting that the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index has jumped by more than 62% in the past year, so it may be difficult to find bargains in this sector. But if you have $1,000 to spare after paying your bills, saving enough for a rainy day, and paying off high-interest debt, you may want to use that investible cash to buy one share of each of these two tech companies that look like solid buys right now based on their long-term prospects.1. TwilioCloud communications specialist Twilio (NYSE: TWLO) may look like a surprising buy recommendation considering that it has underperformed the stock market in the past year, losing 18% of its value. There was more bad news for Twilio investors when the company released its fourth-quarter results last month.Though it beat expectations for the quarter and its revenue for the year rose 9% to $4.15 billion, management failed to provide full-year guidance for 2024. The company is carrying out an operational review of its customer data platform business, known as Segment, and says it plans to issue the 2024 guidance this month once that review is complete.However, a closer look at Twilio's guidance for the current quarter indicates that this is going to be a difficult year for the company. It expects just 2% to 3% revenue growth in the quarter to $1.03 billion. Twilio has also guided for adjusted earnings of $0.58 per share at the midpoint, which would be a 23% jump from the prior-year period. For comparison, Twilio's full-year earnings increased to $2.45 per share in 2023 from just $0.15 per share in 2022, driven mainly by its cost-cutting moves.Story continuesThe relatively slower growth forecast for 2024 explains why some investors have been selling Twilio stock. As a result, it can now be bought for just 2.7 times sales, which is well below its five-year average sales multiple of 6.5. Additionally, Twilio is trading at 24 times forward earnings right now, which makes it cheaper than the Nasdaq-100's forward earnings multiple of 30 (using the index as a proxy for the tech sector).Buying Twilio at these multiples could turn out to be a smart long-term move. That's because the company's slowdown is likely to be temporary considering the communications-platform-as-a-service (CPaaS) industry that it operates in. Twilio's application programming interfaces (APIs) allow companies to build voice, messaging, and video applications to remain connected with their customers. This allows organizations to do without old-school physical call centers, which require a lot of initial investment.As of October 2023, Synergy Research Group describes Twilio as the leading player in CPaaS with a 37% market share. Meanwhile, as of June 2023, market research firm IDC estimates that Twilio controls nearly a quarter of this market. IDC further adds that ""despite the setbacks of slowing sales cycles, restructuring, and downsizing, the industry is still one of the strongest IT sectors with attainable double-digit and profitable growth in reach of many companies.""This explains why the CPaaS market is predicted to generate almost $30 billion in revenue in 2026 compared to $14 billion in 2022. As such, it won't be surprising to see Twilio's growth pick up once again in the next couple of years. And, if the company continues to control a quarter of the CPaaS market in 2026, its revenue could increase to $7.5 billion based on IDC's forecast.That would translate into a three-year revenue compound annual growth rate of nearly 22% based on Twilio's 2023 revenue. If Twilio maintains its current price-to-sales ratio of 2.7, its market cap could increase to $20 billion in the next three years. That would be a nice jump from the current level of almost $11 billion.2. NvidiaNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) may seem like another surprising pick for investors on the hunt for bargain stocks. It trades at 33 times sales and 69 times trailing earnings following its 244% stock surge in the past year. By those measures, it looks pricey. However, Nvidia's forward multiples tell a different story.NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) ChartAs the chart above indicates, Nvidia's forward earnings and sales multiples have come down rapidly of late. That's not surprising, as the company's top and bottom lines are predicted to rise sharply this year. Analysts expect Nvidia's earnings to jump to $24.43 per share in fiscal 2025 from $12.96 per share in fiscal 2024, which ended Jan. 28. Its top line is forecast to increase almost 80% to $109.5 billion.More importantly, Nvidia seems capable of sustaining these impressive growth rates beyond 2024. Analyst Vijay Rakesh of Japanese investment bank Mizuho estimates that Nvidia could generate $300 billion in revenue from AI chips by 2027. That would be a massive increase over the $47.5 billion revenue that it generated from its data center business last year by selling AI chips, which was a handsome 217% increase from the prior year.There are a few reasons why it wouldn't be absurd to see Nvidia's revenue grow at such a breathtaking pace over the next three years. First, Nvidia's peer AMD has forecast that the global AI chip market will generate $400 billion in annual revenue by 2027. Second, Nvidia is in a nice position to make the most of this opportunity as it reportedly commands a whopping 90% of this market.Also, Nvidia's efforts to move into additional niches of the AI chip market could eventually help it get close to the ambitious revenue target that Mizuho has set for it. All this indicates that Nvidia could turn out to be a top growth stock in 2024 and beyond, and its low forward multiples mean that investors are getting a good deal on it right now.Another thing worth noting here is that Nvidia has justified its valuation in the past year by clocking stunning earnings growth that has outpaced the growth in its price-to-earnings ratio.NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) ChartAs such, Nvidia stock looks like a bargain considering the potential growth on offer, which is why savvy investors should consider buying it before it moves higher.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Nvidia Trades Near All-Time Highs: Is the Stock Still a Buy?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-trades-near-time-highs-151700923.html,Nvidia stock keeps moving higher as investors' enthusiasm for the AI story grows.,"Euphoria surrounding the possibilities of artificial intelligence (AI) technology is pushing the stock market to record levels. While there are many companies shaping the AI narrative, I would argue that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is cast in the lead role.The company's breakthroughs in compute networking are impacting a multitude of AI applications, including machine learning, generative AI, and large language models (LLMs). Nvidia is currently the nucleus of most systems powering modern AI tools, and investors have been cheering on the stock. Over the last year, shares have surged by 265%.With Nvidia stock hovering in the vicinity of the all-time high it set earlier this month, some investors may be wondering if they've missed out on the chance to profit. My stance? Given all the moves Nvidia is making and the ways it's setting itself up for long-term growth, now is as lucrative a time as ever to scoop up some shares.A meteoric riseThe chart below illustrates Nvidia's quarterly revenues, gross profits, and free cash flows over the last decade.NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) ChartNot only are sales skyrocketing, but Nvidia's commanding position in the graphics processing unit (GPU) and data center business has provided the company with unparalleled pricing power. This has helped it expand its margins materially -- improvements that flow directly to the bottom line.In 2023, Nvidia increased its free cash flow sixfold. Unsurprisingly, this level of growth has brought Nvidia onto the radar of more investors. Ultimately, this has resulted in more buying activity -- leading to an eye-popping addition of $1 trillion to Nvidia's market cap in less than two months.Image source: Getty Images.Nvidia has loads of cash, and it's not afraid to spend itPowered by its record performance in 2023, Nvidia has doubled the cash position on its balance sheet to $26 billion. While this is impressive, what I find more encouraging is how Nvidia is allocating its capital.The company is showing a keen interest in AI software applications. Namely, the company has investments in voice-recognition company SoundHound AI as well as data analytics start-up Databricks.Story continuesThough it primarily develops hardware, Nvidia is quietly making inroads into enterprise software. Its software services business reached an annual revenue run rate of $1 billion last year -- a great milestone, but still much smaller than its $47 billion compute networking business.Nvidia also joined Microsoft, OpenAI, Intel, and Jeff Bezos in a recent funding round for a start-up called Figure AI, which is developing humanoid robots that it plans to commercialize in manufacturing, warehousing, and even retail settings.Nvidia stands to benefit from this relationship in several ways. Specifically, it is uniquely positioned to help further the development of Figure AI's bots from both a hardware and software standpoint.The stock is expensive, but worth the premiumIn the wake of the surge in Nvidia's stock, the company's valuation multiples have become a bit extended. Shares trade at 77 times trailing-12-month earnings. Moreover, Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 37 is nearly double that of the S&P 500.Despite its ultra-premium valuation, I see Nvidia's stock as a solid opportunity for long-term investors. At a macro level, heavy secular tailwinds fuel AI budgets, and I don't expect those to abate anytime soon.Based on Nvidia's ability to market itself as both a hardware and software solution, as well as the potential of its savvy investments, I see its journey as just starting. Using dollar-cost averaging to gradually build a position in the stock would be a prudent strategy, helping to mitigate risk while providing you with exposure to the long-term upside of Nvidia and the AI realm.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,"Beyond the ""Magnificent Seven"": 3 Brilliant Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks With Explosive Upside Potential",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/beyond-magnificent-seven-3-brilliant-150500808.html,"These market leaders are a solid way to play the AI boom, but they're not the only game in town.","Last year was something of a coming-out party for artificial intelligence (AI), as Wall Street and Main Street alike were introduced to the capabilities of AI's next-generation algorithms. It didn't take investors long to realize that a number of the stock market's best-performing stocks had something in common -- they had AI in their DNA.Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett coined the term ""Magnificent Seven,"" from the 1960 film of the same name, to describe this group of high-growth stocks, listed in alphabetical order:AlphabetAmazonAppleMeta PlatformsMicrosoftNvidiaTeslaIt's easy to see how these market leaders were lumped together, but the intense focus on these stocks can be myopic, particularly if done to the exclusion of all others. Don't get me wrong: I own shares of all of the Magnificent Seven stocks and don't have plans to sell any of them. That said, I believe there are compelling opportunities outside this septet.Let's look at three AI stocks that have the potential to deliver explosive upside -- that are not part of the Magnificent Seven.Image source: Getty Images.1. Arm HoldingsArm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) is best known for creating the blueprints for many of the world's most widely used central processing units (CPUs). The company's designs are ubiquitous, reaching into every area of technology, most notably cloud computing, hyperscale computing, and data centers.This positioning gave the company the inside track when generative AI emerged last year, as a great deal of AI processing will be done in the cloud and data centers. Arm's most recent (read: most lucrative) designs are all the rage as data center operators scramble to upgrade to more robust processors necessary to handle the rigors of AI. Take Nvidia's GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, for example. It combines accelerated CPU and GPU technology to meet that need,employing 144 of Arm's top-of-the-line version 9 (V9) CPU cores.Story continuesFor its fiscal 2024 third quarter, ended Dec. 31, Arm generated record revenue of $824 million, up 14% year over year. That performance was fueled by license revenue that grew 18% and record royalty revenue that jumped 11%. It also drove adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to $0.29, a 32% increase. However, the company's remaining performance obligation (RPO), which provides a glimpse into sales trends, illustrates Arm's future potential. RPO climbed 38% year over year to $2.43 billion, suggesting its accelerating growth has just begun.Arm stock might seem expensive using the most popular valuation metrics, which fail to factor in its growth trajectory. However, its forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio clocks in at less than 1, the standard for an undervalued stock.2. Super Micro ComputerWhile Arm handles the CPU part of the AI equation, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), also known as Supermicro, provides the specialty servers designed to handle the rigors of AI. Supermicro offers a variety of high-end servers that sport cutting-edge AI processors from the likes of Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Intel, among others.Furthermore, the company's focus on energy efficiency is the stuff of legend. Since AI systems require a deal of juice to process, Supermicro systems have enjoyed a commensurate spike in demand, which is evident in its recent financial results.For the company's fiscal 2024 second quarter, ended Dec. 31, Supermicro generated record revenue that surged 103% year over year to $3.66 billion, while diluted EPS soared 85% to $5.10.If that weren't enough, management's forecast calls for its growth to accelerate, guiding for third-quarter revenue of $3.9 billion at the midpoint, representing 205% year-over-year growth.Like Arm, Supermicro's valuation looks stretched when using the price-to-earnings or price-to-sales ratio, the two most commonly employed valuation metrics. Yet its forward PEG ratio, which factors in its accelerating growth, comes in at less than 1, suggesting it's a bargain.3. Palantir TechnologiesPalantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) is no stranger to AI. The company hung out its shingle more than two decades ago, with the initial goal of helping the U.S. government stop terrorists in their tracks. The company has since expanded its mandate, providing enterprise-level businesses with data mining and business analytics services fueled by AI.That expertise in AI made Palantir the first stop for many companies looking to adopt generative AI, and the company pivoted to meet that need. The fruit of its efforts was the Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), a system designed to help businesses identify their most mission-critical needs and automate the solutions. By working side by side with Palantir's engineers, users build customized AI-powered tools to suit their needs. Furthermore, Palantir's intensive boot camp helps companies develop solutions in as little as one to five days.The company's success was evident in its most recent results. In the fourth quarter, revenue of $608 million marked a 20% year-over-year jump, while its EPS of $0.04 quadrupled. However, U.S. commercial revenue, which includes AIP, grew 70% year over year, while the company's total contract value soared 107%. As a result, Palantir's forecast calls for U.S. commercial revenue to grow by at least 40% in 2024, though management's guidance tends to be conservative.Like Arm and Supermicro, Palantir sports a forward PEG ratio of less than 1, suggesting the stock is undervalued.Should you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?Before you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,What's the Best Way to Invest in Stocks Without Any Experience? Start With This ETF.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-best-way-invest-stocks-150000359.html,"Despite the mountain of advice available on how to pick individual stocks, that's probably the worst way to start your investing journey.","Are you looking to make your foray into the stock market but don't know where to start? Maybe you're nervous or even a little intimidated by its apparent complexity?Don't sweat it. Seriously. It's not nearly as complicated as it seems at first. Making your very first stock pick doesn't have to be a nerve-racking ordeal, either. In fact, the best first pick for any first-time investor is an exceedingly simple one -- just plug into the overall market by stepping into the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEMKT: SPY).Instant diversification It might not be a stock you've heard of before, mostly because it's not a stock at all. Rather, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust is an exchange-traded fund (or ETF), which are just baskets of different securities. In this case, the basket holds all the stocks found within the S&P 500 index. You likely know the S&P 500 as a market barometer, but the S&P 500 fills that role specifically because it reflects the value of the market's biggest and most important stocks.It's a simple, easy option -- when you buy and sell an ETF, you're buying and selling the basket as a whole rather than trading every single ticker within it. There are several advantages to launching your portfolio with such a simple approach, although two stand out the most.The first of these advantages is instant diversification.Every investor should understand the importance of diversification. While some stocks do well, others will lag. The prospects for an individual business or entire sector are always changing. As a result, your best bet is to have a well-diversified portfolio with exposure to stocks of varying sizes, sectors, and geographies.A well-diversified portfolio will never dramatically outperform the broad market, but it won't severely underperform it either. And merely matching the broad market's long-term performance will still leave you with solid, inflation-beating returns.Story continuesAnd the second major advantage of owning index-based ETFs when you have no investing experience is the ability to sidestep the dangerous temptation of trading the popular, hyped up stocks everyone seems to be talking about. Indeed, this advantage is so important it deserves its own stand-alone discussion.A first-time investor's biggest riskThe financial media industry is an interesting one. It devotes a great deal of time and energy to discussing companies' results and curious corporate developments. Not all of this reporting, however, is necessarily done with investors' best interests in mind. It's largely for infotainment purposes. As Warren Buffett explains it, ""most news is noise, not news.""But that doesn't prevent investors from acting on news as it develops, and who can blame them? After all, these headlines can at times be downright intoxicating.But in the same sense that intoxication leads to hangovers, chasing stocks of companies heavily -- and often bullishly -- discussed by the media has its own risks, and it can often do more harm than good.In other words, picking individual stocks is difficult enough even if you have experience and know exactly how and where to find ideas for new holdings. Without any experience, it can be downright dangerous. The fact that even professional mutual fund managers struggle to consistently beat the market should tell you everything you need to know about your chances of doing so.For instance, last year, 60% of large-cap mutual funds offered to U.S. investors underperformed the S&P 500 index they were hoping to beat, according to Standard & Poor's. For the past five years, nearly 79% of these funds didn't keep up with the S&P 500. Over the course of the past 10 years, more than 87% of domestic mutual funds lagged the S&P 500's performance.If these industry professionals struggle to outperform this benchmark, it's similarly unlikely a new investor without any experience will either -- at least not for very long.Just be patientNone of this is to suggest you'll never be able to outperform the broad market by picking individual stocks. It is possible to do so. Indeed, smaller investors have something of an advantage over mutual fund managers, in that your portfolio isn't so big that your buying and selling can push stock prices around. With massive amounts of capital to steer, fund managers can do that.Amassing enough wisdom -- from real-world experience -- to beat the market takes time. You don't want the practice of ""learning from my mistakes"" to be too costly an affair. You also don't want to wait to put your money to work either, since time in the market does far more heavy lifting for your portfolio than savvy stock-picking for the vast majority of people.The smartest choice is starting with something simple that doesn't require regular monitoring but can still offer attractive returns. That's the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust. You can always add individual stocks to your portfolio in addition to this ETF as you gain more experience.Just remember to be patient with all of your holdings. Nobody becomes an investing millionaire overnight, no matter how good they are.Should you invest $1,000 in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust right now?Before you buy stock in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,"Forget Amazon: I Think This Stock Should Replace It in the ""Magnificent Seven""",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-amazon-think-stock-replace-143500299.html,Amazon's best growth days may be behind it. This stock is a better choice.,"There's no question that Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been a tech dynamo for much of its history, and it has delivered monster returns to its long-term investors.However, more recently, the company's results have been mixed. Yes, Amazon stock has nearly doubled over the past year, but that's only because it fell so far in the bear market of 2022. In fact, Amazon still hasn't eclipsed its peak from 2021, even as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are back to setting new all-time highs.While Amazon's recent results have been solid, there are also signs that the company is losing its edge. Revenue growth at its cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, has slowed substantially, down to 13% in the fourth quarter, well behind its two biggest rivals, Microsoft Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud. Growth in its e-commerce business has slowed to a similar pace, and it's even been outpaced by Walmart.Amazon also seems like it's gotten off to a slow start in the artificial intelligence (AI) race. It followed Alphabet in making a multibillion-dollar investment in Anthropic AI in September, though that move seemed designed to make up for its earlier lack of strategy.Amazon is a member of the ""Magnificent Seven,"" the group of the world's most valuable tech companies. Those seven contributed the largest portion of the overall market's share price growth last year. However, Amazon's greatest innovations could be behind it. CEO Andy Jassy seems to have pivoted from experimentation toward a focus on profitability, which could leave the company weaker over the long term. For example, its marketplace sellers are up in arms over a new set of fees that has prompted a Federal Trade Commission investigation.One company on the cutting edge of technology that in my view would be a good candidate to replace Amazon in the Magnificent Seven is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM).Story continuesImage source: Getty Images.Possibly the world's most important companyIt's no exaggeration to call Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing -- aka TSMC -- the world's most important company. It's the world's largest chip manufacturer. It handles approximately 55% of contract chip manufacturing and 90% of the most advanced chips, and that share could go even higher.TSMC is the company that tech giants like Apple, Nvidia, Broadcom, Advanced Micro Devices, and even Amazon turn to in order to manufacture their chips, giving it tremendous market power. Arguably, no other company would affect the world more if it ceased operations today.TSMC's market power is also visible in its results. In the fourth quarter, the company generated $8.2 billion in operating income on $19.6 billion in revenue, giving it an operating margin of 42%, a clear demonstration of its pricing power.TSMC is also vital for generative AI technology, as companies like Nvidia rely on it to produce the cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs) and other chips capable of powering and training generative AI applications like ChatGPT. Demand for those chips is vastly outstripping supply, which should drive profits even higher at TSMC.There's a clear need to expand chip production, and TSMC has new foundries planned in the U.S. and other parts of the world. However, expansion in the U.S. is running into challenges for several companies, showing that it won't be easy to ramp up the production of chips, especially the most advanced ones.Why TSMC should join the Magnificent SevenTSMC isn't a U.S.-based company like the rest of the Magnificent Seven. Still, it is listed in the U.S. on the New York Stock Exchange. With a market cap of $721 billion as of March 11, it's now more valuable than Tesla, which means that it would qualify for a spot in the group based on its size.However, the best reason to include TSMC in the Magnificent Seven is that it represents the future of technology. It's the dominant supplier of AI chips and other advanced processors and will almost certainly remain so.The company has returned to revenue growth after the last cyclical downturn in the chip industry, and investors are recognizing its crucial position in the AI supply chain -- the stock is up 34% year to date.TSMC looks like a good bet to outperform Amazon and other members of the Magnificent Seven over the rest of the year. It deserves a spot in the elite group of tech stocks.Should you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?Before you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.
