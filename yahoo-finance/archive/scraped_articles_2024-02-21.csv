Motley Fool,"Why Fortinet, SentinelOne, CrowdStrike, and Other Cybersecurity Stocks Plunged Wednesday Morning",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-fortinet-sentinelone-crowdstrike-other-195047321.html,Dismal guidance from Palo Alto Networks dragged down the share prices of peers across the cybersecurity industry.,"A number of cybersecurity companies slumped out of the gate Wednesday morning and never looked back. As of 1:35 p.m. ET, shares of Zscaler (NASDAQ: ZS) had plunged by 13.9%, SentinelOne (NYSE: S) was down 10.8%, CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ: CRWD) had tumbled by 9.4%, Fortinet (NASDAQ: FTNT) was off by 4.2%, and Cloudflare (NYSE: NET) had lost 4.2%.A check of all the usual sources -- regulatory filings, analyst commentary, and financial reports -- found no company-specific news fueling these declines, suggesting the stock price moves were driven by the dismal outlook and strategy shift by a rival in the space.Image source: Getty Images.Solid results with a dose of uncertaintyAfter the close Tuesday, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: PANW) reported results for its fiscal 2024 second quarter, and investors were taken aback. For the period, which ended Jan. 31, revenue grew 19% year over year to $2 billion, driven higher by expanding relationships with existing customers. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.46, up 39%.Those results exceeded analysts' consensus estimates, which had called for revenue of $1.97 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.30.However, it was a dramatic shift in the company's strategy that surprised investors, and which led management to slash Palo Alto's full-year guidance.Palo Alto Networks offers three platforms, which include network security, cloud security, and security operations. CEO Nikesh Arora announced Palo Alto was seeking to accelerate its multiplatform strategy. He noted that the customer lifetime value of a client that adopted two of its three platforms was five times the value of a single-platform customer. For those that adopt three platforms, the number is more than 40 times larger -- so it's understandable that the company would seek to accelerate multiplatform adoption.To support this shift in strategy, management noted that beginning Thursday, it will be ""launching a significant number of platform offers to our customers"" in the form of incentives, free trials, and discounts. Over the next 12 to 18 months as this program ramps up, Arora expects Palo Alto to take a hit to revenue growth.Story continuesBecause of that, management has reduced its guidance. For the company's fiscal third quarter, management is guiding for revenue in a range of $1.95 billion and $1.98 billion, which would amount to year-over-year growth of 14% at the midpoint. Perhaps most telling is its outlook for billings to grow by just 3% to $2.33 billion, which illustrates the consequences of the company's decision -- at least over the short term.Arora also noted the company was beginning to see ""spending fatigue in cybersecurity."" Investors took that as a bad sign for the whole industry, and many stocks in the space sold off in unison.Making a mountain out of a company-specific molehillSo what does all this mean for Palo Alto's rivals?In a word -- nothing.Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci questioned the company's need to offer incentives ""when other companies embark on similar paths of consolidation without having to give away product for a time.""Jefferies analyst Joseph Gallo addressed spending fatigue, writing, ""While it's logical for cyber fatigue in Palo Alto's mega deals, we haven't heard this from anywhere else,"" suggesting this was a company-specific issue.It seems like a stretch to suggest that competitors will suffer due to Palo Alto's shift in strategy.On Tuesday, Zscaler scored two price target hikes from analysts. The first came courtesy of Truist, which maintained a buy rating on the stock and increased its price target to $260, which would equate to roughly 20% upside after Wednesday's plunge. The analyst noted that after discussions within the industry, demand seems to have stabilized ""despite the challenging macro environment."" UBS was even more bullish, keeping a buy rating and boosting its price target to $300, or upside potential of roughly 40%. That analyst suggested the environment was more positive than the company's conservative guidance suggests.In the wake of Palo Alto's results, Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci maintained a buy rating on SentinelOne shares while boosting its price target to $32, proposing potential upside of about 23%. The analyst said he expects another ""top-line beat and raise"" when the company reports early next month.Guggenheim was also bullish on CrowdStrike, with a buy rating and price target of $358, which would result in potential gains for investors of 23% from current levels. DiFucci believes CrowdStrike will ""grow faster and attain greater scale"" in the coming years, benefiting shareholders.This is all a long way of suggesting that the fate of an industry doesn't rest on one company.To be clear, none of these stocks is cheap by traditional valuation metrics. Cloudflare, CrowdStrike, and Zscaler currently trade at forward price-to-sales ratios of 15, 14, and 14, respectively, while Fortinet and SentinelOne each have forward price-to-sales ratios of 7.Of this quintet of stocks, CrowdStrike is the surest bet for my money. The company is still generating robust growth and has achieved the scale necessary to thrive.Should you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?Before you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and CrowdStrike wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Why MediaAlpha Stock Is Soaring Today,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-mediaalpha-stock-soaring-today-195015754.html,Check out how MediaAlpha outpaced analysts' forecasts and what's next for the insurance-sector specialist in digital marketing.,"Shares of programmatic advertising expert MediaAlpha (NYSE: MAX) surged as much as 22.7% higher on Wednesday morning, lifted by a Street-stumping earnings report. The stock is reaching fresh multiyear highs today, notching prices not seen since October 2021.How MediaAlpha beat Wall Street forecastsMediaAlpha's fourth-quarter sales fell 6% year over year to $117 million, while the transaction value under management decreased by a milder 2% to $165 million. On the bottom line, the adjusted net loss shrank from $0.63 to $0.05 per share. Your average Wall Street analyst would have settled for sales near $112 million and a more damaging loss of roughly $0.18 per share.The results also outpaced MediaAlpha's own projections, chiefly powered by an extensive marketing campaign for an unnamed customer in the property and casualty (P&C) insurance sector. Management expects this segment to deliver robust results in the first quarter as well, inspiring guidance for a smaller revenue decline and approximately 45% stronger profits in the first quarter.A brighter futureMediaAlpha's management finally sees the light at the end of a long, dark tunnel. The company mainly provides digital marketing solutions for insurance carriers, and that industry is making an ad-spending comeback right now.""Following a historic downturn, we believe the P&C underwriting cycle has finally turned,"" CEO Steve Yi said in a prepared statement. ""While most carriers have yet to reach rate adequacy and fully resume their marketing investments, we are seeing clear signs of a market recovery and believe we are entering a period of sustained growth in P&C carrier marketing investments.""In other words, the inflation-based limits on advertising budgets are starting to lift, one specific subsector of the insurance market at a time.So the company is getting back on its feet after a few difficult years. At the same time, this is not my best investment idea in the adtech market today, whether you're looking for deep value or impressive growth prospects. I suggest betting on the digital advertising rebound elsewhere while keeping a curious eye on MediaAlpha in the long run.Story continuesShould you invest $1,000 in MediaAlpha right now?Before you buy stock in MediaAlpha, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and MediaAlpha wasn’t one of them.

Bloomberg,Stocks Stay Lower After Fed Minutes; Nvidia Sinks: Markets Wrap,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asia-stocks-track-us-decline-225131752.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street traders kept a lid on stocks ahead of results from Nvidia Corp. — the chipmaker at the heart of the artificial-intelligence frenzy that has powered the bull market.

Given its massive influence on broader indexes, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s trading desk has called Nvidia “the most important stock on planet earth.” With eye-popping gains, the chipmaker has been responsible for one-third of the Nasdaq 100’s advance this year.“Nvidia has been the ‘poster child’ of AI enthusiasm because NVDA makes the type of semiconductor chips that power generative AI and demand for those chips has gone through the roof,” said Tom Essaye, founder of The Sevens Report. “The AI-driven rally in the ‘Mag Seven’ is largely justified by the fact that they’re making a lot more money than they were previously.”The S&P 500 dropped to around 4,960, and trading was lighter than usual — with volume sitting 12% below the 30-day average. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 underperformed — with Nvidia down 2%. The chipmaker is still the best performer in the US equity benchmark this year, up almost 40%.Stakes are so high for Nvidia’s earnings that even strategists who wouldn’t normally comment on individual securities had something to say ahead of the numbers.“We do not usually talk about individual stocks as asset allocation traditionally is the largest driver of portfolio risk and return,” said Emily Roland and Matt Miskin at John Hancock Investment Management. “While Nvidia is high quality for sure, to us the AI hype has gone beyond the ‘reasonable price’ stage.”Story continuesA host of similarities between tech stocks now and previous bubbles suggest the “Magnificent Seven” is only nearing — but not yet at — levels that may lead it to pop, Bank of America Corp. strategist Michael Hartnett said last week.While Nvidia is the proverbial “picks and shovels” of the AI gold rush, other large-cap tech companies such as Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. have also seen large stock rallies as investors expect these companies to harness the power of generative AI to boost profits, Essaye noted.“Has the AI mania gone too far and are we looking at a bubble situation?” Essaye said. “Based on what most of us think about typical bubbles, the answer is ‘no’ they are not in a bubble.”Nvidia has really acted as a “sentiment gauge” in the market, and will either confirm or potentially put a ding in the lofty AI expectations, according to Ken Mahoney, chief executive officer at Mahoney Asset Management.Now one thing to keep in mind, Mahoney says, is that it’s not always about the earnings report — but the market’s reaction to it.Prices for short-term calls and puts imply a roughly 11% move in the chipmaker’s shares on Thursday — the session after its earnings report, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That would sway Nvidia’s market capitalization by some $180 billion, one of the largest single-session moves on record.“The market is expecting a pretty large swing in terms of implied volatility,” said Mahoney. “There are also times with this implied volatility, that the stock doesn’t have a major reaction at all and stays in a relatively similar spot to where it closed before the report — and we can’t take that off the table as a possibility.”Traders will also sift through the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s January meeting for clues on the outlook for the central bank’s next steps. Fed Bank of Richmond President Thomas Barkin said recent economic data highlighted how price pressures in some sectors are still too high, despite improvement in the overall inflation picture.Corporate Highlights:Luxury homebuilder Toll Brothers Inc. rose to a record Wednesday as the company said it’s optimistic about its prospects for a key selling season.HSBC Holdings Plc reported fourth-quarter profit fell 80% after taking unexpected charges on holdings in a Chinese bank and from selling its French retail operations.

He illustrated this with a comparison: $100,000 invested in the stock market could grow to $2.9 million over time, whereas the same amount in private equity could reach $13.9 million, showcasing the profound impact of choosing the right investment vehicle.The discussion also touched on the barriers to entry for average investors in these lucrative markets. Traditionally, the most successful funds and investment opportunities in private equity were available only to the wealthiest investors or institutional funds. However, Robbins highlighted recent regulatory changes and initiatives, like a group in Houston, Texas, that allows individuals to buy in as partners in private equity funds, democratizing access to these high-return investments.Robbins expanded on the concept of investing in monopolies, such as sports teams, which offer unique investment opportunities with compounded returns of 18%. He emphasized the monopolylike status of these investments, where ownership in a specific area can lead to significant financial benefits, not just from ticket sales but also from broadcasting rights and other revenue streams.Fractional real estate platforms have opened up new paths for everyday investors to step into the real estate market with an entry point as low as $100. This crowdfunding approach not only simplifies the investment process but also offers a way to generate regular income through dividends and enjoy the growth in property value over time. Arrived Homes stands out as a prime example of the innovative investment solutions Robbins advocates for, making previously out-of-reach markets more accessible to the general public.Story continuesRead Next:Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler.

Yahoo Finance,Stock market today: US stocks slip in countdown to Nvidia earnings,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-today-us-stocks-slip-in-countdown-to-nvidia-earnings-143459632.html,"Expectations are running high for Nvidia's earnings, seen both as a barometer for the AI trade and as a potential turning point for stocks.","US stocks slipped on Wednesday as investors counted down to high-stakes earnings from AI darling Nvidia (NVDA) and the release of Federal Reserve minutes that could set hopes for interest rates.The S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped roughly 0.3%, while those on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) shed 0.4%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the way lower, down 0.5% on the heels of Tuesday's declines.Stocks are lagging with the focus fixed on looming results from Nvidia, whose shares fell 4% on Tuesday for their worst day since Oct. 17 as investors positioned for the release. Expectations are running high for the chipmaker's fourth quarter results, seen both as a barometer for the AI trade and a potential turning point for stocks more broadly.The market is on edge for any disappointment in the report, expected after the bell. Nvidia is one of a small group of megacaps behind a big chunk of recent gains for stock indexes. Mixed prospects for growth among those ""Magnificent 7"" stocks have prompted hedge funds to cut holdings, according to Goldman Sachs.In corporates, shares of Palo Alto Networks (PANW) tumbled over 25% after the cybersecurity provider cut its annual revenue forecast, igniting concerns about a potential pullback in tech spending. Meanwhile, Walgreens shares (WBA) slid 3% after the pharmacy giant lost its spot on the blue-chip Dow index to Amazon (AMZN).The wait is also on for minutes from the Fed's January meeting, scrutinized for insight into whether policymakers are anywhere near likely to ease up on interest rates. Recent discouraging data has prompted a wavering in conviction the central bank will cut rates in June, seen as the most probable timing.Read more: What the Fed rate decision means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cardsLive2 updatesWed, February 21, 2024 at 5:42 AM PSTBrian SozziTrendWatch: Here Comes Talk of DeflationFrom inflation to the opposite of inflation.Deflation is starting to creep up into the conference calls and presentations of consumer companies. It’s also starting to impact top line sales trends as prices well, deflate.Where we have heard deflation used already this week:Tuesday's Home Depot Earnings Call: Deflation was mentioned six times on the conference call. “Deflation from core commodity categories negatively impacted our average ticket by 35 basis points during the fourth quarter, driven by deflation in lumber and copper wire. During the fourth quarter, we continued to see, on average, a decline in lumber prices relative to a year ago.” -Billy Bastek, EVP Merchandising at Home Depot (HD)Tuesday's Walmart Earnings Call: Deflation mentioned two times on the conference call: “During our Q3 call, I mentioned that we might find ourselves in a deflationary position early in calendar 2024. In Walmart U.S., we're there in general merchandise, but the slope of the decline softened during Q4, meaning the prices are lower than a year ago, but not as much as the trend line would have suggested at the end of Q3. We saw the trend line for food and consumables in Walmart U.S. soften too, resulting in our retail prices in food and consumables being slightly higher than a year ago.” Doug McMillon, Walmart (WMT) CEOThis is a topic I plan to dive into at 10:40 a.m. ET on Yahoo Finance Live in a chat with the CEO of Mondelez (MDLZ), Dirk Van de Put. The Oreo-maker's sales outlook at the CAGNY conference (where Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma has been stationed this week, firing off these interesting insights) yesterday suggests it's poised to overcome deflation in 2024, but more to come from our interview soon.Wed, February 21, 2024 at 4:49 AM PSTBrian SozziPalo Alto Networks gets pummeledIf you could only hear the chatter very early in the morning in the Yahoo Finance newsroom on one of the more favorite tickers on our platform: lightning-hot tech play Palo Alto Networks (PANW)…The a.m. team seems to be of the view that Palo Alto Networks is unstoppable (which is in line probably with a lot of you that have traded this name in the past two years). I get it: The stock gained 377% in the past five years before the 22% premarket, post-earnings drubbing today. Palo Alto’s meteoric stock price has been supported by strong rates of growth amid demand for cybersecurity products.But I reminded the team that several things appeared to change fundamentally around Palo Alto Networks last night. And if you put them together, the steep sell-off looks warranted, and the stock may stay capped in the near-term until investors get more comfortable.For one, the company’s billings outlook was 10% below consensus expectations. Palo Alto Networks said it’s seeing some federal demand softness. I fancy there is more here, though — specifically demand softness from big companies — akin to what we heard from Cisco (CSCO) last week (it’s also in the cybersecurity business).And two, Palo Alto Networks surprised the Street via a new pricing strategy. It’s one that could impact profit margins this year and perhaps into 2025.The strategy shift reflects Palo Alto Networks more aggressively trying to gain market share by giving customers short-term access to solutions for ""free.""""This pricing/bundling/consolidation strategy can weigh on results over the next 12-18 months,"" warned Stifel analyst Adam Borg in a client note this morning.Welcome to the show-me story zone, PANW."
Motley Fool,Why Photronics Stock Fell Hard on Wednesday,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-photronics-stock-fell-hard-191647957.html,Were Photronics' earnings a significant setback or a buying opportunity?,"Shares of Photronics (NASDAQ: PLAB) took a steep dive on Wednesday morning after a mildly disappointing earnings report. The stock fell as much as 18.9% in the morning session, recovering to a still-painful 15% price drop by noon ET.Photronics' first-quarter financialsThe maker of ultra-precise photo masks used in the manufacturing of semiconductor chips and digital display panels reported adjusted first-quarter earnings of $0.48 per share on sales of $216 million. The bottom-line result was in line with management's guidance and a rounding error away from meeting the Street's consensus target at $0.49 per share. But revenue fell below the bottom end of the official guidance range and $4 million short of the average analyst projection.Looking ahead to the second quarter of fiscal 2024, Photronics set the midpoint of its earnings target just below the current analyst view with a revenue projection $1 million ahead of Wall Street's expectations.Investors brushed off the positive surprises to focus on the downsides and rather conservative market analysis in management's comments.Beyond the gloom: Photronics sees a brighter near-term future""Demand was weaker and sales were softer than we expected during the first month of the quarter for both [integrated circuits] and [flat-panel displays],"" CEO KangJyh Lee said in the earnings call. But it wasn't all doom and gloom. Lee added, ""Demand improved during the quarter, increasing our revenue run rate and giving us confidence that revenue will improve in the second quarter.""All things considered, Lee expects customers to continue the current trend of adopting more-advanced and profitable technology generations this year, driven by higher demand for smartphones and high-end TV screens. Hence, order volumes should climb in the second and third quarters, setting Photronics up for robust results in the just-started fiscal year.Photronics approached this report with high expectations, since the stock had gained 73% in the 52 weeks before today's price drop. But this is no high-flying market darling; it trades at the modest valuation of 13 times earnings and 10 times free cash flows right now. In other words, this looks like a tempting opportunity to invest in this direct play on the semiconductor and flat-panel display markets.Story continuesShould you invest $1,000 in Photronics right now?Before you buy stock in Photronics, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Photronics wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Super Micro Computer Stock Is Falling Ahead of Nvidia's Big Earnings Report Today -- Is This a Buying Opportunity?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/super-micro-computer-stock-falling-185557045.html,"Nvidia will release its fourth-quarter results after the closing bell, and its report could have a huge impact on Super Micro Computer stock.","Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) stock headed lower Wednesday, trading down by 7.5% as of 1:38 p.m. ET, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.As macroeconomic concerns ticked up, artificial intelligence (AI) stocks broadly pulled back in Wednesday's trading. Adding another source of uncertainty into the mix, Nvidia is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter results after the market closes.Nvidia's share price soared by 212% over the last year as the company's sales and earnings were buoyed by a rising tide of AI-driven demand, but investors appear worried that the stock may now be priced for perfection. The graphics processing unit (GPU) leader's Q4 results will likely have a significant near-term impact on Supermicro and other AI stocks, and investors are backing off the category a bit in order to minimize their risk.Is it time to buy Super Micro Computer stock?On the heels of recent sell-offs, Supermicro stock is now down roughly 29% from the peak it reached earlier this month. But no doubt about it, this is still a high-risk, high-reward play even after the recent valuation pullback.Notably, the server and data storage company's share price was losing ground Wednesday despite very bullish analyst coverage that was published Tuesday. Rosenblatt's analyst team increased its one-year price target from $700 per share to $1,300 per share. From Supermicro's current stock price, that would amount to an upside of roughly 82.5% over the next year.In their write-up, Rosenblatt's analysts pointed to the continued expansion of the AI-focused server market and the expectation of more market share gains for Supermicro as catalysts that would push its share price higher. The analysts also pointed to Supermicro's strengths in liquid-cooling technologies for servers as a potentially major performance catalyst.AI investors are understandably a bit jumpy ahead of Nvidia's Q4 report. Whether bullish or bearish, the company's results and guidance will almost certainly have ripple effects for other companies in the space. Supermicro remains a risky stock, and it's likely that its share price will see big moves in the near future, but that volatility could present buying opportunities for long-term investors.Story continuesShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?Before you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Why Icahn Enterprises Stock Is Falling Today,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-icahn-enterprises-stock-falling-185422319.html,The value of the company's assets declined in the fourth quarter.,"Icahn Enterprises (NASDAQ: IEP) announced in a financial update Wednesday the net asset value of its holdings dropped significantly in the fourth quarter, though it did keep its quarterly dividend intact. Investors are viewing the glass as half-empty, sending shares of IEP down as much as 14% on Wednesday and off 8% as of 1 p.m. ET.Overhaul in the C-suite and falling valuesCarl Icahn is a legendary activist investor, but of late the focus has mostly been on activists questioning the investor's business setup. Last spring, Hindenburg Research released a report calling Icahn Enterprises ""substantially overvalued"" and arguing that IEP relied on a ""Ponzi-like"" structure to fund its dividend.The stock lost about half of its value following the Hindenburg report and has never recovered.On Wednesday, IEP said it expects the net asset value of its holdings to fall about 8% sequentially as of the end of the quarter that ended in December, to $4.76 billion. The company is primarily a holding vehicle for various investments. IEP, which slashed its dividend by 50% last summer, also said it was keeping its quarterly payout at $1 per unit.IEP also named portfolio manager Andrew Teno as CEO. He replaces David Willetts, who will move on to run portfolio company Pep Boys.Icahn, who is chairman of the company, said Teno ""has had an impressive record of stock picking and position stewardship within our investment segment.""Is Icahn Enterprises a buy ahead of its CEO swap?Icahn shows no sign of slowing down, just this week installing two representatives to the board of JetBlue Airways. The chairman sees other opportunities up ahead.""The reason activism works so well is that, somewhat unfortunately, many public companies are not well run,"" Icahn said in a letter to investors. ""Given our track record, our stable capital base, and our willingness to launch proxy contests (which are extremely arduous and expensive to conduct and even more so to win), we are frequently invited into the tent without ever having to take aggressive actions.""Story continuesThis is a complicated investment even in the best of times. IEP currently holds 25 board seats at various public companies in addition to private holdings including Pep Boys. The questions raised by Hindenburg only add to the fog surrounding IEP.For those who believe in Icahn, IEP still trades well below where it did just a few quarters ago. And the dividend yield is about 20%. But be warned that even after the declines Hindenburg has continued to argue IEP is overvalued.As Carl Icahn surely knows from his own activism, stocks don't always go up.Should you invest $1,000 in Icahn Enterprises right now?Before you buy stock in Icahn Enterprises, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Icahn Enterprises wasn’t one of them.
