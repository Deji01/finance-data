The solution optimized post-production activities, increased distribution hub efficiency, minimized delivery times, and reduced carbon footprint. Positive None. Negative None. Supply Chain Management Expert Optimizing the post-production activity in vehicle distribution hubs is a significant advancement in supply chain management. The reduction from three hours to 20 minutes in manual scheduling per hub represents an approximate 90% decrease in time spent on this task. This efficiency gain is likely to translate into cost savings and increased throughput for Toyota Motor Europe, which could have a positive impact on their operational expenses and profitability. The ability to add options to vehicles and still maintain reduced delivery times is a competitive advantage, enhancing customer satisfaction and potentially increasing sales.Moreover, the reduction in carbon footprint aligns with the growing trend of environmentally responsible business practices. This not only benefits the company's corporate social responsibility profile but could also lead to savings through reduced energy consumption and potential tax benefits associated with environmental initiatives. The combination of efficiency, customer satisfaction and environmental responsibility contributes to a strengthened brand image and can be a deciding factor for environmentally conscious consumers. Environmental Sustainability Analyst The integration of FICO optimization technology in reducing the carbon footprint of Toyota's vehicle logistics operations is a noteworthy example of how advanced analytics can contribute to environmental sustainability. The ability to optimize numerous operations daily while minimizing delivery time and reducing emissions is a testament to the potential of data-driven decision-making in achieving sustainability goals.By addressing the environmental impact of logistics, Toyota Motor Europe is not only complying with increasingly stringent regulations but also appealing to the growing market segment that values eco-friendly business practices. This strategic move could lead to a stronger market position and potentially unlock new customer segments that prioritize sustainability. The emphasis on user acceptance of the optimization solution is crucial, as it ensures that the improvements are sustainable over the long term by fostering a positive reception among the workforce. Automotive Industry Analyst The use of FICO's Xpress Optimization technology in Toyota Motor Europe's distribution hubs is a clear indicator of the automotive industry's shift towards digital transformation. The implementation of such advanced optimization solutions is a strategic investment that can provide Toyota with a significant edge over competitors in terms of operational efficiency and agility.The automotive sector is characterized by complex supply chains and the need for just-in-time delivery, making the ability to re-optimize on the fly a critical feature. This adaptability can help Toyota respond more effectively to market changes and unexpected disruptions, thereby maintaining a smooth supply chain operation. The partnership with FICO and the utilization of Artelys' expertise in mathematical optimization for supply chain applications may encourage other industry players to follow suit, potentially leading to a broader adoption of similar technologies across the sector. 04/03/2024 - 04:10 AM Optimization solution improved efficiency, reduced delivery times and reduced carbon footprint LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- FICO (NYSE: FICO): Artelys, an independent company specializing in numerical optimization, modeling, and decision support, has used FICO optimization technology to build a solution that optimizes post-production activity in Toyota Motor Europe’s vehicle distribution hubs, organizing tens of thousands of operations on thousands of vehicles a day. The manual scheduling that used to take three hours per day for each hub is now done in 20 minutes. A customer buying a vehicle from a Toyota retailer can add numerous options to a Toyota vehicle such as a navigation system, a towing bar or a parking assist system. To minimize delivery time, the solution has increased the efficiency of the distribution hubs of Toyota Motor Europe, ensured satisfactory delivery time to customers, and reduced the carbon footprint of vehicle logistics operations. “The flexibility of FICO® Xpress and Artelys Kalis was key to address the very specific scheduling needs of Toyota’s workshops,” said Nicolas Omont, VP Operations at Artelys. More information: https://www.fico.com/en/products/fico-xpress-optimization and https://www.artelys.com/solvers/xpress/. At the heart of Toyota Motor Europe’s supply chain are seven strategically located vehicle distribution hubs that handle both the European-built models and those shipped to Europe from overseas. These hubs ensure all vehicles get to their customers on time, performing final installations on the vehicles and a final inspection before shipping the vehicles to their retailer. Achieving on-time delivery while reducing lead times and CO2 emissions is critical. The Artelys solution optimizes the work plan at each hub, maximizing the number of tasks that can be performed considering many technical and operational constraints. These constraints vary widely, from restricting vehicle movements within the facility to ensuring compliance with legal working hours for the team. “It is particularly hard to design applications able to efficiently manage such heterogeneous constraints and objectives and prioritize them,” said Omont. “In addition, the software is able to manage optional flexibility by enabling potential overtime to finish highly prioritized tasks or diversify crews working on difficult tasks.” User acceptance was also essential. Artelys developed the solution to show planners that they wouldn’t lose flexibility in their way of working, and they wouldn’t have a black box providing plans without being able to understand them. Planners can analyse the application output and understand differences with their current way of working. The Toyota Motor Europe solution must solve the planning every day in a few minutes to allow sufficient time for the planners to validate it. In addition, it can re-optimize on the fly, based on end-user manual amendments. “Thanks to Constraint Programming, the complex optimization problems are solved with the reliability and consistency with no room for failure,” concluded Omont. “We use advanced features of FICO Xpress to implement several heuristics. They provide distinct solutions among which the best one is selected.” Strong Partnership with FICO “Artelys has a strong partnership with FICO, having worked together for more than 15 years,” said Omont. “The solution we created for Toyota relies on FICO® Xpress Optimization, as the problem is modelled with Xpress Mosel language and solved with Artelys Kalis, which is fully integrated into FICO® Xpress. Artelys’ expertise in mathematical optimization applied to supply chain has enabled FICO to consolidate its position as one of the leading optimization solvers for supply chain applications in Europe.” “This kind of optimization will only gain in importance as manufacturers worldwide look to reduce their carbon footprint while maximizing performance,” said Alexandre Graff, vice president of Global Partners & Alliances at FICO. “Artelys has demonstrated with this project and others the massive potential of using FICO optimization to solve incredibly challenging supply chain problems.” About Artelys Founded in 2000 in Paris, Artelys is an independent company specializing in numerical optimization, modelling and decision support.

Adjusted net income surged by 248.3% to RMB903 million. The company aims to operate 2,000 premier hotels by 2025 and establish the 'Chinese Experience' as an industry benchmark. Positive Net revenues for full year 2023 surged by 106.2% to RMB4,666 million compared to RMB2,263 million in 2022. Adjusted net income (non-GAAP) for full year 2023 soared by 248.3% to RMB903 million from RMB259 million in 2022. Atour focuses on delivering tailored, high-quality experiences for diverse consumers and partners, aiming to operate 2,000 premier hotels by 2025. In 2023, Atour saw an increase in key business metrics like average RevPAR, ADR, and occupancy rate compared to 2019 levels. Atour logged 576 new hotel signings in 2023 and had 1,210 hotels in operation by December 31, 2023, with a year-on-year growth of 29.8%. The domestic tourism market in China showed strong growth in 2023, with a surge in traveler trips and spending. Atour introduced Atour Light 3.0 and Atour 4.0 'With Nature' to cater to different consumer segments and enhance its multi-brand approach. The A-CARD membership system was expanded to attract younger demographics, with registered members surpassing 63 million by the end of 2023. Atour's retail business, focusing on deep-sleep-inspired amenities, generated RMB1.14 billion in GMV for full year 2023. Atour's digital capabilities support an integrated online-to-offline shopping experience, driving long-term business growth. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported growth figures for Atour Lifestyle Holdings Limited are impressive, particularly in the context of the post-pandemic recovery of China's domestic tourism sector. The double-digit increases in key performance indicators such as RevPAR and ADR, coupled with a robust occupancy rate that surpasses 2019 levels, indicate a strong consumer demand and operational efficiency. The expansion strategy, marked by the addition of 576 new hotel signings, aligns with the surge in domestic travel and spending, suggesting that Atour is effectively capturing market share. Moreover, the company's emphasis on experience-led offerings and product innovation, such as the Atour Light 3.0 and Atour 4.0 ""With Nature"" brands, reflects a strategic response to the growing consumer appetite for personalized and high-quality travel experiences.From a market perspective, Atour's differentiation strategy and multi-brand approach could help diversify its revenue streams and reduce risks associated with market fluctuations. The increase in registered A-CARD members also points to a successful loyalty program that could drive repeat business. However, the company's foray into the retail sector, particularly with the scenario-based retail business, is an area that requires careful scrutiny. While the initial success is notable, it remains to be seen how this diversification will contribute to long-term profitability and whether it will continue to resonate with consumers as the market evolves. Financial Analyst Atour's financial performance, featuring a 106.2% year-over-year revenue increase and a 248.3% rise in adjusted net income, speaks to a strong recovery trajectory and operational leverage. The financials reflect not only a recovery from pandemic lows but also the successful execution of a growth strategy that has likely been well-received by investors. The company's focus on digitalization and the integration of its hotel and retail businesses could offer synergies that enhance the customer experience and create additional revenue channels.Investors will be interested in the sustainability of these growth rates and the company's ability to maintain profitability as it scales. The aggressive expansion towards the goal of 2,000 premier hotels by 2025 will require significant capital investment and effective management of the growing network. Additionally, the reported Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) from the retail segment indicates a successful cross-selling strategy, which can provide a buffer against the cyclical nature of the hospitality industry. However, investors should monitor the capital expenditures associated with expansion and the cost structure to ensure that the growth in top-line revenue translates to bottom-line profitability. Hospitality Industry Expert Atour's strategic positioning within the 'lifestyle hotel' category is a reflection of the broader industry trend towards offering unique and tailored experiences. The company's success in this area, particularly with the introduction of new brands like Atour Light 3.0 and Atour 4.0 ""With Nature"", demonstrates an understanding of consumer trends and a commitment to innovation. The focus on experience-centric offerings is likely to resonate well with the younger demographic, which is increasingly seeking more than just a place to stay.The expansion into second-tier cities and the development of a nationwide network of hotels is a smart move, tapping into less saturated markets with potential for growth. Furthermore, the enhancement of the A-CARD membership system with high-value benefits is a strategic effort to build customer loyalty and encourage repeat stays. The company's adoption of a scenario-based approach to retail, leveraging guest feedback to develop products like the Deep Sleep Pillow PRO, shows a keen sense of market demand and the ability to extend the brand beyond traditional hotel services. 04/03/2024 - 03:43 AM SHANGHAI, April 3, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Atour Lifestyle Holdings Limited (NASDAQ: ATAT), a leading hospitality and lifestyle company in China, reported robust growth in 2023 fueled by a rebound in domestic travel and its focus on experience-led offerings.

Amid the post-pandemic recovery, the tourism market is reverting to pre-pandemic levels, fueling a surge in demand for personalized experiences as well as an upgrade within the hospitality sector. Atour has led this transformation, capitalizing on its advantages in product innovation, operations, and digitalization. In line with its differentiation strategy , Atour introduced Atour Light 3.0 in February 2023, a midscale offering that not only meets consumers' desire for quality accommodations and unique experiences, but also demonstrates its exceptional value proposition compared to similar brands in the industry. Since its launch, Atour Light 3.0 has garnered 27 new hotel signings in the fourth quarter of 2023, with 25 already in operation. Strategically located in central business districts of second-tier cities and above, these hotels enhance Atour's accessibility to China's young business travelers and vacationers. Additionally, the introduction of Atour 4.0 ""With Nature"", a flagship upper midscale hotel brand, underscores the company's multi-brand, experience-centric approach. Atour 4.0 caters to both travelers and leisure vacationers, offering combined leisure and business facilities. Since its debut in November 2023, the first batch of hotel signings have been completed in major domestic cities and business districts, with the first establishment scheduled to open in the first half of 2024. To attract and retain members, Atour has enhanced its A-CARD membership system with additional high-value benefits, appealing particularly to younger demographics. These benefits span retail, dining, culture, arts, and sports, complementing the existing loyalty program. As of December 31, 2023, the number of registered members has surpassed 63 million, up 78% year-over-year. In broadening its product and market scope, Atour intents on exploring new opportunities in the retail sector. Drawing insights from guest feedback, it has introduced a line of deep-sleep-inspired amenities. This scenario-based retail business generated RMB1.14 billion in GMV for full year 2023, marking a 298.3% year-over-year increase. Among the merchandise, cumulative sales of Atour's best-selling Deep Sleep Pillow PRO hit 1.2 million units, while consumers snapped up more than 100,000 Deep Sleep Temperature Control Quilts. The spike in sales underscores Atour's ability to meet real user needs, enabling it to expand its competitive edge in the mid- to high-end price segments. From sleep-related products to other categories, its innovative approach has supplied the hospitality industry with a recipe for success. Atour's digital capabilities underpin a seamless online-to-offline shopping experience, enhancing user satisfaction and unlocking greater potential for business growth.

These projects aim to enhance grid flexibility, support renewable energy growth, and strengthen the electricity system's resilience. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst TotalEnergies' announcement of a second battery storage project in Belgium signifies a strategic move within the energy sector, particularly in the context of Europe's broader transition to renewable energy sources. The investment of €70 million into battery storage infrastructure is a substantial financial commitment that reflects the growing importance of energy storage solutions in managing the intermittency of renewable energy sources like wind and solar. With a combined storage capacity of 50 MW / 150 MWh upon completion, these projects will enhance grid stability and provide necessary backup to accommodate fluctuations in energy generation.From an industry perspective, the increasing demand for large-scale battery storage systems is indicative of a shift towards more sustainable and resilient energy networks. This move by TotalEnergies aligns with the broader industry trends where major energy players are diversifying their portfolios to include renewable and low-carbon energy solutions. Investors may view this development as a positive indicator of TotalEnergies' commitment to long-term sustainability and its ability to adapt to the evolving energy landscape, potentially impacting the company's valuation and stock performance positively. Renewable Energy Technology Expert The technical aspects of TotalEnergies' battery storage projects, particularly the use of Saft's Intensium Max High Energy lithium-ion containers, are noteworthy for their potential to advance energy storage technology. Saft, a subsidiary of TotalEnergies, is a leader in high-performance battery solutions and their involvement suggests that TotalEnergies is not only investing in storage capacity but also in the development of cutting-edge technology.For stakeholders in the renewable energy technology sector, this project represents a validation of lithium-ion as a viable solution for large-scale energy storage. The performance and reliability of these systems will be closely watched, as they could set a benchmark for future projects. The success of such storage solutions is critical for enabling the broader adoption of renewable energy, as they address the challenge of providing a stable power supply despite the variable nature of renewable sources. Market Research Analyst The expansion of TotalEnergies' battery storage capabilities in Belgium is a strategic decision that is likely to influence the competitive landscape of the energy market in the region. By increasing its storage capacity, TotalEnergies is positioning itself as a key player in the energy transition movement within Europe. The company's integrated approach, combining electricity production from various renewable sources with advanced storage systems, could serve as a model for other energy companies.Market research indicates that the demand for renewable energy is on the rise, driven by consumer preferences, regulatory requirements and technological advancements. TotalEnergies' investment in energy storage and production aligns with these market trends and could potentially increase the company's market share in the electricity sector. For investors, the long-term benefits may include a stronger presence in a growing market segment and the potential for increased revenue from the company's diversified energy solutions. 04/03/2024 - 03:35 AM ANTWERP, Belgium--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News: On the occasion of Belgian Energy Minister Tinne Van der Straeten's visit to TotalEnergies' (Paris:TTE) (LSE:TTE) (NYSE:TTE) Antwerp refinery battery storage project, the Company announced the development in Belgium of a second similar project. The new project will be developed on the site of TotalEnergies’ depot in Feluy. It will have a power rating of 25 MW and capacity of 75 MWh, thanks to the forty Intensium Max High Energy lithium-ion containers supplied by Saft. Start-up is expected at the end of 2025. These two projects, which represent a global investment of nearly €70 million, will bring TotalEnergies' storage capacity in Belgium to 50 MW / 150 MWh. These battery storage sites play a key role in the resilience of the electricity system, providing flexibility and helping solve grid congestion problems. They also encourage the growth of renewable energies in the country, which require solutions like these to compensate for their intermittency. ""We are pleased to announce this new storage project in Feluy, just a year after we began our Antwerp project, which should be operational by the end of the year. These projects are fully in line with our integrated development strategy for electricity, not just in Belgium, but globally,"" said Olivier Jouny, Senior Vice President, Integrated Power at TotalEnergies. ""These technical systems also confirm the European leadership of our affiliate specialized in battery production, Saft, and its industrial-scale stationary storage know-how.""

The acquisition will expand Genmab's pipeline and enhance its cancer treatment capabilities, with Rina-S as a potential best-in-class ADC targeting ovarian cancer and solid tumors. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The acquisition of ProfoundBio by Genmab represents a strategic consolidation within the biotechnology sector, particularly in the oncology segment. The transaction size of USD 1.8 billion in cash is a significant outlay, reflecting the high value Genmab places on ProfoundBio's pipeline and technology. This move is expected to enhance Genmab's mid- to late-stage clinical pipeline, which could lead to a potential increase in the company's market value if the clinical candidates succeed in their trials and obtain regulatory approval.Investors should note the financial implications of this acquisition, as Genmab's operating expenses are projected to rise to the upper end of their guidance range. This increase is primarily due to the additional R&D investment in ProfoundBio's clinical programs. However, Genmab's revenue guidance remains unchanged, which indicates management's confidence in the company's current revenue-generating assets and the expected contribution from ProfoundBio's pipeline in the long term.The strategic nature of this acquisition could create synergies between Genmab's existing antibody platforms and ProfoundBio's novel ADC technology, potentially leading to the development of new cancer treatments. From a financial perspective, the transaction could be accretive to Genmab's earnings in the future, provided that the clinical development of the acquired assets progresses favorably and leads to successful commercialization. Medical Research Analyst Genmab's acquisition of ProfoundBio is particularly noteworthy for its inclusion of rinatabart sesutecan (Rina-S), a next-generation Topo1 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting folate receptor alpha (FRα). Topo1 inhibitors interfere with DNA replication in cancer cells, leading to cell death, while FRα is a promising target due to its overexpression in certain solid tumors, including ovarian cancer.The Fast Track designation granted by the FDA to Rina-S underscores its potential to address an unmet medical need. This designation facilitates the development and expedites the review of drugs intended to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need, which can be a decisive factor in the drug's time-to-market and its potential market share upon approval.For stakeholders, the acquisition's impact hinges on the successful integration of ProfoundBio's ADC technology and the progression of their clinical candidates. The potential for Rina-S to be a best-in-class therapy offers a promising avenue for growth in the gynecologic oncology space, but this comes with the inherent risks of clinical development in oncology, where promising candidates can still fail due to efficacy or safety concerns. Market Research Analyst The strategic acquisition of ProfoundBio by Genmab could potentially reshape the competitive landscape in the ADC market. By obtaining worldwide rights to three clinical-stage candidates, Genmab positions itself to potentially capture a significant share of the ovarian cancer treatment market and other FRα-expressing solid tumors.ADCs are a rapidly growing segment in oncology, combining the specificity of antibodies with the potency of cytotoxic drugs. The market for ADCs is expected to grow significantly, driven by the increasing prevalence of cancer and the need for targeted therapies. Genmab's acquisition could provide it with a competitive edge, especially if Rina-S proves to be a best-in-class treatment option.It is important for investors to monitor the integration of ProfoundBio's novel ADC technology platforms with Genmab's proprietary antibody platforms. If successful, this could lead to a robust pipeline of innovative treatments, potentially generating significant long-term value. However, the market will also be looking closely at how Genmab manages the increased R&D costs and the execution of its expanded clinical programs. 04/03/2024 - 01:35 AM Company Announcement Genmab to acquire ProfoundBio for USD 1.8 billion in cash Acquisition will give Genmab worldwide rights to three candidates in clinical development, including rinatabart sesutecan (Rina-S), plus ProfoundBio’s novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) technology platforms Rina-S is a novel, next-generation, potential best-in-class Topo1 ADC targeting folate receptor alpha (FRα) in development for the treatment of ovarian cancer and other solid tumors Genmab to host conference call today at 1:00 PM CEST / 12:00 PM BST / 7:00 AM EDT COPENHAGEN, Denmark & SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Genmab A/S (Nasdaq: GMAB) and ProfoundBio, Inc. announced today that the companies have entered into a definitive agreement for Genmab to acquire ProfoundBio in an all-cash transaction. ProfoundBio is a privately-owned clinical-stage biotechnology company developing next-generation ADCs and ADC technologies for the treatment of certain cancers, including ovarian cancer and other FRα-expressing solid tumors. Genmab will acquire ProfoundBio for USD 1.8 billion in cash, payable at closing (subject to adjustment for ProfoundBio’s closing net debt and transaction expenses). The transaction will further broaden Genmab’s mid- to late-stage clinical pipeline and strengthen and complement Genmab’s already validated suite of proprietary technology platforms. The acquisition will give Genmab worldwide rights to ProfoundBio’s portfolio of next-generation ADCs, which consists of three clinical and multiple preclinical programs including Rina-S, a potential best-in-class, clinical-stage, FRα-targeted, Topo1 ADC, currently in Phase 2 of a Phase 1/2 clinical trial, for the treatment of ovarian cancer and other FRα-expressing solid tumors. In addition, the combination of ProfoundBio’s novel ADC technology platforms with Genmab’s proprietary antibody platforms will potentially create new opportunities to generate and develop new medicines with the potential to transform the treatment of cancer and improve the lives of patients. The addition of Rina-S to Genmab’s portfolio will enable Genmab to deepen its presence in the gynecologic oncology space and establish a firm foundation in solid tumors. As a potential best-in-class ADC, Rina-S aims to address a broader patient population than first-generation FRα-targeted ADCs. Based on the data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial Genmab intends to broaden the development plans for Rina-S within ovarian cancer and other FRα-expressing solid tumors. In January 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) granted Fast Track designation to Rina-S for the treatment of patients with FRα-expressing high-grade serous or endometrioid platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. “The proposed acquisition of ProfoundBio firmly aligns with our long-term strategy and our ambitious 2030 vision, to impact the lives of patients through innovative antibody medicines,” said Jan van de Winkel, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Genmab. “We believe that ProfoundBio’s ADC candidates, proprietary technology platforms and talented team will be a great addition to Genmab and that, together, we will be able to accelerate the development of innovative, differentiated antibody therapies for cancer patients.” “Genmab shares our team’s mission of developing novel therapies to improve outcomes for cancer patients. Genmab’s deep expertise in antibody drug development and commercialization makes this a compelling union that will allow us to rapidly develop and realize the full potential of our ADC therapies to benefit patients,” said Baiteng Zhao, Ph.D., ProfoundBio’s co-founder, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. Details of the Transaction The proposed transaction, which has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies, is expected to close in the first half of 2024. The closing of the proposed transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Following today’s announcement, Genmab’s operating expenses before expenses incurred by it in connection with the proposed transaction are now anticipated to be at or moderately above the upper end of the previously disclosed guidance range of DKK 12.4 -13.4 billion.

(TSXV: FHYD) (OTC Pink: FHYDF) (FSE: FIT) (""FIRST HYDROGEN"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to provide an update on corporate developments for the 1st quarter of 2024. The Company's hydrogen-powered fuel cell light commercial vehicle (FCEV) recently completed a successful trial with Wales & West Utilities (WWU), the trial also established a hydrogen ecosystem partnership for mobile refueling. First Hydrogen is now working with multiple fleet operators to help achieve their zero emission objectives by increasing the number of FCEVs and/or converting existing vehicles to FCEV. A summary of ongoing developments as follows:North AmericaQuebecSignificant and positive interest has been shown from fleet operators in Quebec. The Quebec operators note the need for Hydrogen vehicles as an alternative to battery electric vehicles during cold weather which limits the battery life in a battery-only vehicle. The Company is expanding and developing additional demonstrator FCEVs to showcase the hydrogen potential to North American fleets, as well, the Company proposes to build a vehicle assembly facility and green hydrogen production plant in Shawinigan, Quebec. The assembly facility target will be for annual production of up to 25,000 vehicles for distribution throughout North America and will represent a major boost to green technology jobs in the region.TrialsThree FCEV trials have been completed during which the FCEV was subject to various real-world conditions. During the initial vehicle testing and the Rivus trial, the Company's FCEV was driven in and around London. For the SSE plc (SSE) trial, the FCEV was driven in and around Aberdeen, Scotland. The most recent trial with gas distribution network Wales & West Utilities, the Company's FCEV completed more than 2,000 km (>1,200 miles) over the four-weeks, travelling up to 189 km (117 miles) per day in some of South Wales' coldest conditions. The FCEV demonstrated its' capability for demanding duties, such as carrying heavier payloads, towing and powering auxiliary equipment (onboard power). There was no decrease in vehicle performance or range when operating in colder temperatures. Drivers from all three trials noted the FCEV's drivability ease, quick refueling, and range (630 km / 390 mi, on a single refueling).Discussions with various fleet operators to add FCEVs to fleets and/or converting existing fleet vehicles to hydrogen-powered fuel cells utilizing the Company's powertrain.First Hydrogen is planning details for the next batch of trials which will include some of the largest companies in Europe and the world.Hydrogen ecosystemFor the WWU trial, the Company partnered with Protium Energy Solutions (Protium) and Hyppo Hydrogen Solutions (Hyppo), for the WWU trials using a re-deployable refueller and delivered green hydrogen. This ""ready-to-go"" hydrogen ecosystem, utilizing Hyppo's Fuel Cell Systems HyQube, will be able to demonstrate hydrogen mobility is possible for fleet operators. First Hydrogen intends to collaborate with Fuel Cell Systems for North American trials.Balraj Mann, Group CEO, First Hydrogen comments: ""We are building strong relationships with governments, potential customers and suppliers aligning the need to reduce emissions and First Hydrogen's product offering. Francois Morin, VP of Corporate Development, has quickly expanded our presence in North America. The green hydrogen market in North America is gaining considerable strength, for instance, the U.S. Department of Energy announced a $7- billion program to launch seven clean hydrogen hubs across U.S as part of U.S. National Clean Hydrogen Strategy and Roadmap. In Mexico, investment funds are starting to flow in the country developing its vast green hydrogen potential. Finally, in Quebec, green hydrogen is one solution for the province to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.""First Hydrogen: The Future with Zero EmissionsTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8330/204111_e3ddd347f4e4182e_001full.jpgAbout First Hydrogen Corp.

CEO Erik Fyrwald emphasizes innovation and growth investments. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The completion of IFF's divestiture of its Cosmetic Ingredients business to Clariant is a strategic move that aligns with the company's focus on optimizing its portfolio. This transaction is expected to have a positive impact on IFF's financial health by reducing debt and interest costs, which can improve the company's balance sheet and potentially increase its attractiveness to investors. The divestiture may also enhance IFF's ability to make strategic growth investments in its core businesses, which include food, beverage, health, biosciences and scent experiences.From a financial perspective, the sale could lead to a more streamlined operation with potentially higher profit margins, as non-core businesses can sometimes dilute a company's profitability. Investors should monitor how the proceeds from the sale are allocated, as strategic reinvestment in high-growth areas can lead to long-term value creation. However, it is also important to consider the immediate loss of revenue from the divested business and how that might affect short-term financial performance. Market Research Analyst The divestiture reflects a broader industry trend where companies are focusing on their core competencies and shedding non-core units. This trend is driven by the desire to enhance operational efficiencies and concentrate on areas with the highest growth potential. For IFF, this means a deeper focus on its primary sectors, which could lead to innovation and better market positioning.It's important to consider the competitive dynamics of the cosmetic ingredients market and how Clariant's acquisition might strengthen its position relative to IFF. The transaction could also signal a consolidation trend within the specialty chemicals industry, which may affect market competition and pricing power. Stakeholders should thus keep an eye on Clariant's integration process and any market shifts resulting from this divestiture. 04/03/2024 - 12:00 AM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- IFF (NYSE: IFF) today announced that it has completed the previously announced divestiture of its Cosmetic Ingredients business to Clariant, a sustainably focused specialty chemicals company.

The company's gross margin decreased to 13%, and operating margin was negative 94%. Cash and cash equivalents stood at $1.6 million. SemiLEDs expects third-quarter revenue to be around $1.0 million. Despite facing a potential delisting threat from Nasdaq due to stockholders' equity issues, the company believes it is currently compliant. Positive None. Negative Decrease in revenue and net loss for the second quarter Decrease in gross margin and negative operating margin Cash and cash equivalents decreased to $1.6 million Potential delisting threat from Nasdaq due to stockholders' equity issues Financial Analyst The reported financial results by SemiLEDs Corporation reflect a significant sequential revenue decline from $1.6 million to $886 thousand, which is indicative of a potential downward trend in the company's sales performance. This contraction could be attributed to operational halts such as the shutdown during the Chinese New Year holiday, which may have impacted production and sales. Moreover, the decrease in gross margin from 15% to 13% and the substantial drop in operating margin to negative 94% suggest escalating cost pressures or inefficiencies that could be concerning to investors. The reduction in cash reserves from $2.3 million to $1.6 million further underscores a tight liquidity position, potentially limiting the company's ability to invest in growth or weather financial setbacks.While the net loss has marginally improved, the persistent losses are a red flag for the company's financial health and could impact investor sentiment. The projection of third-quarter revenue at approximately $1.0 million indicates a possible stabilization; however, the broad range of +/- 10% introduces uncertainty. The compliance with Nasdaq's minimum stockholders’ equity requirement is a positive note, alleviating immediate concerns of delisting. Yet, the caveat of maintaining compliance in subsequent reports hints at ongoing risks associated with the company's market listing status. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, SemiLEDs' performance must be contextualized within the broader LED industry trends, which are influenced by factors such as technological advancements, competition and global demand. The decline in revenue and profitability metrics might reflect not only company-specific issues but also macroeconomic conditions affecting the sector, such as pricing pressures from competitors or shifts in consumer demand. The company's ability to regain and sustain compliance with Nasdaq's Listing Rule is a critical factor that could influence investor confidence and the stock's attractiveness to institutional investors.Furthermore, the strategic implications of the production shutdown, while culturally understandable due to the Chinese New Year, raise questions about the company's planning and inventory management practices. Investors might seek reassurance that SemiLEDs has contingency plans to mitigate such disruptions in the future. The guidance for the third quarter suggests cautious optimism, but it will be essential for the company to demonstrate a clear path to profitability and operational efficiency to regain market trust. Legal Expert Regarding the Nasdaq Listing Rule compliance, SemiLEDs' ability to meet the minimum stockholders’ equity requirement is a legal and regulatory matter that has direct implications for its continued listing and public trading. The notice from Nasdaq and the subsequent acceptance of SemiLEDs' compliance plan are procedural steps that provide a temporary reprieve from delisting. However, the conditional nature of this compliance underscores the importance of monitoring the company's adherence to regulatory standards.The potential for delisting upon failure to demonstrate continued compliance in future periodic reports is a legal risk that shareholders must be aware of. The company's disclosure of this information is a legal obligation and it provides transparency to the market. Investors should be cognizant of the legal processes and criteria for Nasdaq listing to fully understand the ramifications of SemiLEDs' financial position and regulatory standing. 04/03/2024 - 04:00 AM HSINCHU, Taiwan--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- SemiLEDs Corporation (NASDAQ: LEDS), “SemiLEDs” or the “Company,” a developer and manufacturer of LED chips and LED components, today announced its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, ended February 29, 2024.

The scheduled execution date of the definitive agreement is May 31, 2024, with a closing date of June 30, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The proposed acquisition of Japan Gene Medicine Corporation by MEDIROM Healthcare Technologies Inc. indicates a strategic move to diversify and strengthen their portfolio in the healthtech and genetic testing sectors. The financial terms, particularly the pricing mechanism based on a multiple of adjusted EBITDA, are in line with common valuation practices for acquisitions. The price of 2.4 billion yen, subject to due diligence adjustments, suggests a significant investment that MEDIROM is willing to make, reflecting confidence in the synergy and potential growth opportunities. However, the reliance on loans for financing raises questions about the impact on the company's debt profile and future cash flows. Investors should monitor the due diligence outcomes and the final terms of the acquisition, as these will provide more insights into the financial health of the target and the expected return on investment. Healthcare Industry Analyst MEDIROM's interest in Japan Gene Medicine Corporation aligns with industry trends of incorporating genetic testing into broader healthcare services. The acquisition could provide MEDIROM with a competitive edge by offering comprehensive health management solutions, from fitness tracking to prenatal diagnostics. This move also caters to the growing demand for personalized healthcare, as genetic testing enables tailored medical interventions. However, the integration of such services poses operational challenges and requires regulatory compliance, particularly in handling sensitive genetic data. The success of this acquisition will depend on MEDIROM's ability to effectively integrate and leverage the genetic testing capabilities to enhance the customer experience and expand its market share in the healthtech industry. Legal Expert The acquisition process outlined by MEDIROM includes several standard legal provisions and conditions, such as the requirement for a commitment letter from a financial institution and the completion of due diligence. The mention of ensuring no connections with anti-social forces highlights the company's due diligence in adhering to legal and ethical standards. The transaction is also contingent on compliance with the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act, indicating cross-border regulatory considerations. Additionally, the need to meet U.S. securities law disclosure requirements suggests that the deal has significant implications for MEDIROM's regulatory compliance posture. Stakeholders should note that any legal hurdles encountered during this process could delay or impact the transaction's finalization. 04/02/2024 - 11:23 PM NEW YORK, April 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MEDIROM Healthcare Technologies Inc.

Negative None. 04/02/2024 - 11:11 PM YANTAI, China, April 2, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- RemeGen Co. Ltd. (""RemeGen"" or ""the Company"") (9995.HK, 688331.SH), a commercial-stage biotechnology company, obtained Fast Track Designation (FTD) by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently for its innovative BLyS/APRIL dual-target fusion protein drug, Telitacicept (RC18), independently developed by RemeGen for the treatment of patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). The FDA grants FTD to accelerate the development and review of new drugs that have the potential to treat life-threatening conditions and address unmet medical needs. Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is a common rheumatic disease characterized by autoimmune exocrinopathy that clinically manifests as dry eyes and mouth caused by glandular dysfunction as a result of autoimmune damage with multiple organ systems also at risk of being affected. Studies have shown that B-cells are key immune cells involved in the pathogenesis of pSS, and excessive activation of B-cells is a pathogenic indicator of pSS that has long been regarded as a key target for intervention. Independently developed by RemeGen, Telitacicept is an innovative BLyS/APRIL dual-target fusion protein drug that simultaneously inhibits the overexpression of two cytokines, B-cell lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL). Telitacicept prevents abnormal differentiation and maturation of B-cells through a two-pronged approach, thereby treating various autoimmune diseases mediated by B-cells. In December 2023, Telitacicept was granted Investigational New Drug (IND) by the FDA for the treatment of active pSS in adults. A phase III clinical trial for this indication is currently underway in China. Dr. Jianmin Fang, CEO of RemeGen, commented, ""As the first fusion protein drug of its kind independently developed by RemeGen, we are delighted the FDA has recognized Telitacicept for fast track designation. It has performed well in clinical studies for multiple indications that have been marketed in China, including primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with rheumatoid arthritis, igA nephritis, and myasthenia gravis (MG) in the pipeline. Multiple Phase III clinical trials are progressing smoothly both domestically and abroad and we are accelerating global development of multiple indications of Telitacicept, and we are confident of cementing a leadership position in B-cell-mediated autoimmunity drugs."" About Telitacicept (RC18) Telitacicept (RC18) is RemeGen's proprietary novel fusion protein for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. It is constructed with the extracellular domain of the human transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI) receptor and the fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain of human immunoglobulin G(IgG). Telitacicept targets two cell-signaling molecules critical for B-lymphocyte development: B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), which allows it to effectively reduce B-cell mediated autoimmune responses that are implicated in several autoimmune diseases. It was granted completed marketing approval by China's National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) to treat systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in November 2023. About RemeGen Co. Ltd. Founded in 2008, RemeGen (9995.HK, SHA: 688331) is a leading biopharmaceutical company in China committed to providing solutions to the unmet clinical needs of patients suffering from life-threatening illnesses.

The Company further announced that it will release its fourth quarter and year end 2023 financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023 before or by May 31, 2024.Based on unaudited financial statements prepared by the management of the Company, StageZero expects Q4 2023 revenue to be in line with previous quarters during 2023.

If an MCTO is issued, StageZero intends to satisfy the provisions of the ""alternative information guidelines"" set out in NP 12-203, including the requirement to file bi-weekly status reports in the form of news releases containing prescribed updating information, until the Filings are made.

Aristotle® uses mRNA technology to identify the molecular signatures of multiple cancer types and is built on the Company's patented technology platform, the Sentinel Principle. The Sentinel Principle has been validated in more than 9,000 patients and used by more than 100,000 patients in North America.The Care Oncology Clinic offers a supervised treatment regimen (the COC Protocol) for people diagnosed with cancer of any type or stage. Developed by scientists and oncologists, the COC Protocol is intended for adjunctive administration alongside standard-of-care cancer therapy. It is an individualized therapeutic approach which seeks to simultaneously target multiple metabolic cancer pathways. The aim is to restrict cancer cell energy supply and use, which may make it more difficult overall for cancer cells to survive, grow and adapt to changing conditions in the body. As a result, such cells can potentially become more vulnerable to attack from cell-killing therapies such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Its patented COC Protocol incorporates a multifaceted approach, supported by peer-reviewed scientific studies, which highlight the potential of certain treatments to target the specific energy requirements of cancer cells, impacting their ability to grow and multiply.AVRT is a Physician-Led, telehealth program for identifying and managing the early warning signs of cancer and chronic disease. Our program includes: a comprehensive online health evaluation; blood tests to measure markers of inflammation and metabolism; an in-depth initial physician consultation; regular physician follow-up appointments and interval screening.Aristotle®, as well as additional cancer diagnostics are processed at the Company's clinical laboratory, StageZero Life Sciences, Inc., a CAP accredited and CLIA certified high-complexity reference laboratory in Richmond, Virginia.StageZero Life Sciences trades on the Toronto Stock exchange under the symbol SZLS and on the OTCQB under the symbol SZLSF.Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements identified by words such as ""expects"", ""will"" and similar expressions, which reflect the Company's current expectations regarding future events.

NOVONIX and LEL to retain up to 28.57% ownership each in Axon. Focus on large-scale natural flake graphite projects. Proposed IPO to raise $15-25 million with a share price of $0.20. Priority offer to eligible NOVONIX and LEL shareholders. Creation of a vertically integrated Spherical Purified Graphite Battery Anode Material manufacturing facility in Queensland. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The formation of Axon Graphite Limited and its subsequent IPO is a strategic move that reflects the growing demand for battery materials in line with the expansion of the electric vehicle (EV) and energy storage systems (ESS) markets. The consolidation of NOVONIX's and LEL's natural graphite exploration interests into Axon aims to create a larger, more competitive entity in the battery materials sector, specifically in the production of anode materials.From a market perspective, this merger could potentially lead to operational synergies, cost savings and increased production capabilities. The focus on developing a vertically integrated Spherical Purified Graphite Battery Anode Material manufacturing facility indicates a strategic intent to control the supply chain, which can be a significant competitive advantage. The ability to offer high-grade graphite products that are essential for high-performance batteries is likely to position Axon favorably in the market.However, the success of the IPO and the long-term performance of Axon will depend on several factors, including the actual market demand for natural graphite, the company's ability to scale operations efficiently and the competitive landscape, which includes synthetic graphite producers and other natural graphite mining companies. Financial Analyst Analyzing the financial implications of the Axon IPO, the proposed capital structure indicates a planned raise of between $15 million and $25 million, which suggests a moderate scale of operations initially. The indicative market capitalization post-IPO, ranging from $35 million to $45 million based on the $0.20 issue price, will be a key metric for investors to gauge the valuation of Axon relative to its peers and the broader market.Investors will also need to consider the implications of the 24-month escrow period for NOVONIX's and LEL's shares, which could affect liquidity and share price volatility post-IPO. The priority offer to eligible shareholders of NOVONIX and LEL is a strategic move to maintain investor loyalty and could potentially stabilize the stock post-listing.It's important for investors to scrutinize the use of IPO proceeds, as the successful deployment of capital towards the development of the graphite projects and the manufacturing facility will be important for Axon's growth trajectory. In addition, the ability of Axon to navigate the regulatory landscape, manage exploration risks and respond to market dynamics will be critical determinants of its financial health. Energy Sector Analyst The creation of Axon Graphite Limited is a direct response to the burgeoning energy sector's need for critical raw materials, such as natural flake graphite, which is used in lithium-ion batteries. The vertical integration strategy that Axon intends to pursue is reflective of a broader industry trend where companies are seeking to control their supply chains to mitigate risks associated with raw material availability and price volatility.Considering the strategic location of the Mt. Dromedary and Burke graphite projects in a well-established mining region with access to export facilities, Axon is well-positioned to capitalize on both domestic and international demand. However, the long-term success of Axon will hinge on its ability to produce battery-grade graphite at competitive costs while maintaining high environmental and ethical standards, which are increasingly important to consumers and investors alike.Additionally, Axon's exploration and development activities in the Corella graphite project will need to be monitored closely, as they represent potential for future growth but also carry exploration risk. The company's ability to convert these resources into economically viable reserves will be a key factor in its ability to meet the projected demand surge for battery anode materials. 04/02/2024 - 06:59 PM NOVONIX Limited (“NOVONIX”) and Lithium Energy Limited (“LEL”) to contribute their natural graphite exploration interests into a new company, Axon Graphite Limited (“Axon”)Shares of Axon to be offered through an initial public offering (“IPO”) and listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (“ASX”)NOVONIX and LEL each will retain up to 28.57% ownership of Axon following the planned IPOCreates world class, large-scale natural flake graphite projectRealises value for the shareholders of both NOVONIX and LELEligible NOVONIX and LEL shareholders to be given priority in the IPO BRISBANE, Australia, April 03, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NOVONIX Limited (NASDAQ: NVX, ASX: NVX) (“NOVONIX” or “the Company”), a leading battery materials and technology company, today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement under which its wholly owned subsidiary, MD South Tenements Pty Ltd, which holds the Mount Dromedary natural graphite exploration interests, will be divested to Axon Graphite Limited (“Axon”), a subsidiary of Lithium Energy Limited (ASX: LEL). LEL will contribute its interest in its Burke and Corella graphite projects to Axon pursuant to the agreement. As consideration for the transaction, NOVONIX will receive shares in Axon, which the parties intend to list on the Australian Securities Exchange (“ASX”). The transaction is subject to the completion of the parties' due diligence enquiries, completion of the proposed initial public offering (“IPO”) of Axon, and receipt of approval for the admission of Axon to the ASX. NOVONIX’s Mt. Dromedary project is a high-grade natural flake graphite deposit (refer Annexure A) and is adjacent to LEL’s Burke interests located 125km north of Cloncurry in northwest Queensland in a well-established mining region with access to an export hub. LEL’s Corella interests are located 40km west of Cloncurry. Axon’s principal activities will include: Advancing the development of the Burke/Mt. Dromedary graphite projects;Advancing the exploration, evaluation and development of the Corella graphite project;Progressing the development of a vertically integrated Spherical Purified Graphite Battery Anode Material manufacturing facility in Queensland; andInvestigating and potentially pursuing other prospective projects in the battery minerals sector both in Australia and abroad.

We believe the newly formed company of Axon to focus on the development of these assets provides the opportunity to attract new capital to enable the development of the resource and advance the production of highly refined grade natural graphite for EVs and ESS. It will also highlight the value of these assets for NOVONIX shareholders.” William Johnson, Executive Chairman of LEL, commented, “This transaction involving the Mt Dromedary and the Burke Graphite Projects will allow the consolidation of two adjacent high quality natural graphite deposits, creating a world-class inventory of high-grade natural graphite to support plans to develop an Australian-based, vertically integrated battery anode material (BAM) business. We expect significant operational synergies and economies of scale will be gained from the consolidation of these adjacent graphite deposits. We are delighted also to have NOVONIX as a partner in Axon Graphite. NOVONIX has established an enviable position within the global battery industry and their experience and industry contacts will be of great value for Axon Graphite moving forward.” This announcement has been authorized for release by NOVONIX Chairman, Admiral Robert J.

The approval is based on the Phase 3 COMMANDS study, showing Reblozyl's superior efficacy over epoetin alfa in achieving transfusion independence and hemoglobin increase. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recent approval of Reblozyl for treating transfusion-dependent anemia in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) by the European Commission marks a significant advance in the management of this condition. The Phase 3 COMMANDS study, which served as the basis for this approval, provides compelling evidence that Reblozyl can nearly double the rate of transfusion independence and increase hemoglobin levels compared to the traditional treatment, epoetin alfa.From a medical research perspective, the introduction of Reblozyl as a first-line treatment is noteworthy because it addresses a substantial unmet need in the patient population with lower-risk MDS. The durability of the response, as indicated by the study, suggests that patients may experience a sustained quality of life improvement without the frequent need for transfusions, which are associated with significant healthcare costs and patient burden.Moreover, the safety profile of Reblozyl aligning with previous studies is reassuring for both patients and healthcare providers. It is important to monitor post-marketing data to confirm these findings in a real-world setting, which could further solidify the drug's position in the treatment protocol for MDS. Healthcare Economist Expanding the indication of Reblozyl within the European Union presents a notable development from a health economics standpoint. The potential for patients to achieve transfusion independence has profound implications for healthcare systems. Transfusions not only incur direct costs but also indirect costs due to associated complications and hospitalizations.By reducing the dependency on transfusions, Reblozyl could lead to significant cost savings for national health services across the EU. However, the cost-effectiveness of Reblozyl will depend on its pricing compared to epoetin alfa and the long-term outcomes it enables. If Reblozyl can maintain its efficacy over time and prevent or delay progression to higher-risk MDS, the economic benefits could be substantial.It is also important to consider the budget impact for healthcare payers, as the initial cost of novel treatments can be high. Future studies and real-world evidence will be critical in determining the full economic value of Reblozyl in the treatment landscape of MDS. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The expansion of Reblozyl's approval in the EU is a strategic milestone for Bristol Myers Squibb, potentially bolstering its market position in the hematology space. This approval could translate into increased market share and revenue growth for the company within the EU, given the drug's status as a first-in-class treatment for disease-related anemia in lower-risk MDS patients.The competitive advantage gained by demonstrating superior efficacy over epoetin alfa, a well-established treatment, cannot be understated. It is likely to influence prescribing habits, especially in light of the growing emphasis on personalized medicine and the need for therapies with improved patient outcomes. The pharmaceutical market for MDS treatments is niche but growing and Reblozyl's approval may prompt competitors to accelerate the development of their own novel treatments.However, the exclusion of Great Britain from the centralized marketing authorization could impact the overall market potential for Reblozyl in Europe. Companies in the biopharmaceutical sector often rely on such approvals to streamline the drug launch process across multiple countries. Bristol Myers Squibb will need to navigate the separate regulatory environment in Great Britain to access this market. 04/02/2024 - 08:08 PM Approval of Reblozyl is based on head-to-head, pivotal Phase 3 COMMANDS study, in which Reblozyl nearly doubled the percentage of patients achieving transfusion independence and hemoglobin increase, along with increased durability compared to epoetin alfa This is the fourth authorized indication in Europe for Reblozyl, a first-in-class treatment for patients with disease-related anemia and the first therapy to demonstrate superior efficacy vs. epoetin alfa in LR-MDS PRINCETON N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) today announced that the European Commission (EC) has expanded approval of Reblozyl® (luspatercept) to include the first-line treatment of adult patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to very low, low and intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). This approval of Reblozyl covers all EU member states.* “With this approval for Reblozyl as a first-line treatment for anemia in adults with lower-risk MDS, more patients in the EU will have the potential to become transfusion independent for longer periods of time compared to current options available,” said Monica Shaw, M.D., senior vice president and head of European Markets, Bristol Myers Squibb. “This milestone underscores our ongoing commitment to developing new options for patients with disease-related anemia.” The approval is based on the pivotal Phase 3 COMMANDS study, in which Reblozyl demonstrated superior efficacy compared to epoetin alfa, an erythropoiesis stimulating agent, in the study’s primary endpoint of concurrent red blood cell transfusion independence and hemoglobin increase. Safety results were consistent with previous MDS studies and were in line with expected symptoms in this patient population. Reblozyl is also approved in the United States and Japan for the first-line treatment of anemia associated with lower-risk MDS. “In the treatment of lower-risk MDS, few patients experience a lasting response to erythroid stimulating agents, leaving a critical need for more effective treatment options to address the burden of their anemia,” said Matteo Giovanni Della Porta, M.D., study investigator and head of Leukemia Unit at Humanitas Cancer Center in Milan, Italy. “Results from the COMMANDS study underscore the clinical value of Reblozyl as an initial treatment for anemia in patients with low- to intermediate-risk MDS, and this approval represents a significant milestone towards improving treatment practice and offering better outcomes for patients.” *Centralized Marketing Authorization does not include approval in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales). About COMMANDS COMMANDS (NCT03682536) is a Phase 3, open-label, randomized study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Reblozyl versus epoetin alfa for the treatment of anemia due to very low-, low- or intermediate-risk (IPSS-R) myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in patients who are red blood cell (RBC) transfusion dependent and were erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA)-naïve. The primary endpoint evaluated in this study is RBC transfusion independence (RBC-TI) for 12 weeks with a mean hemoglobin (Hb) increase ≥1.5 g/dL. Key secondary endpoints include erythroid response (HI-E) of at least 8 weeks during weeks 1-24 of the study, RBC-TI ≥12 weeks and RBC-TI for 24 weeks. Eligible patients were ≥18 years old with lower-risk MDS who require transfusions. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive subcutaneous Reblozyl (starting dose 1.0 mg/kg, titration up to 1.75 mg/kg) once every 3 weeks or epoetin alfa (starting dose 450 IU/kg, titration up to 1050 IU/kg) weekly for ≥24 weeks. At the time of the primary analysis (March 31, 2023), 363 patients were randomized 1:1 to Reblozyl and epoetin alfa. Results from the primary analysis of the intent to treat (ITT) population showed: 60.4% (n=110) of patients receiving Reblozyl vs. 34.8% (n=63) of patients receiving epoetin alfa achieved the primary endpoint of RBC-TI of at least 12 weeks with concurrent mean Hb increase of at least 1.5 g/dL within the first 24 weeks (p<0.0001). HI-E increase of at least 8 weeks was achieved by 74.2% (n=135) of Reblozyl patients vs. 53% (n=96) of epoetin alfa patients (p<0.0001). RBC-TI of at least 12 weeks was achieved by 68.1% (n=124) of Reblozyl patients vs. 48.6% (n=88) of epoetin alfa patients (p<0.0001). Duration of response was 128.1 weeks (108.3-NE) for Reblozyl in patients who achieved TI for at least 12 weeks (achieved weeks 1-24) compared to 89.7 weeks (55.9-157.3) for epoetin alfa (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 0.534; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.330-0.864, p=0.0096). Safety results were consistent with previous MDS studies, and progression to acute myeloid leukemia and total deaths were similar between both arms of the study. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events in at least 10% of patients were diarrhea, fatigue, COVID-19, hypertension, dyspnea, nausea, peripheral edema, asthenia, dizziness, anemia, back pain and headache. Rates of reported fatigue and asthenia were shown to decrease over time. About MDS Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of closely related blood cancers characterized by ineffective production of healthy red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells and platelets, which can lead to anemia and frequent or severe infections. People with MDS who develop anemia often require blood transfusions to increase the number of healthy RBCs in circulation. Frequent transfusions are associated with an increased risk of iron overload, transfusion reactions and infections. Patients who become RBC transfusion-dependent have a significantly shorter overall survival than those who are not dependent on transfusions, partially due to iron overload or to more severe bone marrow disease than in non-transfusion dependent patients. About Reblozyl® (luspatercept) REBLOZYL, a first-in-class therapeutic option, promotes expansion and maturation of late-stage red blood cells in animal models. Reblozyl is being developed and commercialized through a global collaboration and North American co-promotion with Merck following Merck’s acquisition of Acceleron Pharma, Inc. in November 2021. E.U. Indications: REBLOZYL is indicated in the E.U. for the treatment of: adult patients with transfusion-dependent anaemia due to very low, low and intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). adult patients with anaemia associated with transfusion-dependent and non-transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia. A European Summary of Product Characteristics for REBLOZYL is available from the European Medicines Agency website at www.ema.europa.eu. U.S. Indications: REBLOZYL is indicated in the U.S. for the treatment of: anemia in adult patients with beta thalassemia who require regular red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. anemia without previous erythropoiesis stimulating agent use (ESA-naïve) in adult patients with very low- to intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) who may require regular red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. anemia failing an erythropoiesis stimulating agent and requiring 2 or more red blood cell (RBC) units over 8 weeks in adult patients with very low- to intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndrome with ring sideroblasts (MDS-RS) or with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis (MDS/MPN-RS-T). REBLOZYL is not indicated for use as a substitute for RBC transfusions in patients who require immediate correction of anemia. In the U.S., REBLOZYL is not indicated for use in patients with non-transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia. U.S. Important Safety Information: WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thrombosis/Thromboembolism In adult patients with beta thalassemia, thromboembolic events (TEE) were reported in 8/223 (3.6%) of REBLOZYL-treated patients. TEEs included deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, portal vein thrombosis, and ischemic stroke. Patients with known risk factors for thromboembolism (splenectomy or concomitant use of hormone replacement therapy) may be at further increased risk of thromboembolic conditions. Consider thromboprophylaxis in patients at increased risk of TEE. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of thromboembolic events and institute treatment promptly. Hypertension Hypertension was reported in 11.4% (63/554) of REBLOZYL-treated patients. Across clinical studies, the incidence of Grade 3 to 4 hypertension ranged from 2% to 9.6%. In patients with beta thalassemia with normal baseline blood pressure, 13 (6.2%) patients developed systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥130 mm Hg and 33 (16.6%) patients developed diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥80 mm Hg. In ESA-refractory or -intolerant adult patients with MDS with normal baseline blood pressure, 26 (30%) patients developed SBP ≥130 mm Hg and 23 (16%) patients developed DBP ≥80 mm Hg. In ESA-naïve adult patients with MDS with normal baseline blood pressure, 23 (36%) patients developed SBP ≥140 mm Hg and 11 (6%) patients developed DBP ≥80 mm Hg. Monitor blood pressure prior to each administration. Manage new or exacerbations of preexisting hypertension using anti-hypertensive agents. Extramedullary Hematopoietic (EMH) Masses In adult patients with transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia, EMH masses were observed in 3.2% of REBLOZYL-treated patients, with spinal cord compression symptoms due to EMH masses occurring in 1.9% of patients (BELIEVE and REBLOZYL long-term follow-up study). In a study of adult patients with non-transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia, a higher incidence of EMH masses was observed in 6.3% of REBLOZYL-treated patients vs. 2% of placebo-treated patients in the double-blind phase of the study, with spinal cord compression due to EMH masses occurring in 1 patient with a prior history of EMH. REBLOZYL is not indicated for use in patients with non-transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia. Possible risk factors for the development of EMH masses in patients with beta thalassemia include history of EMH masses, splenectomy, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, or low baseline hemoglobin (<8.5 g/dL). Signs and symptoms may vary depending on the anatomical location. Monitor patients with beta thalassemia at initiation and during treatment for symptoms and signs or complications resulting from the EMH masses and treat according to clinical guidelines. Discontinue treatment with REBLOZYL in case of serious complications due to EMH masses. Avoid use of REBLOZYL in patients requiring treatment to control the growth of EMH masses. Embryo-Fetal Toxicity REBLOZYL may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. REBLOZYL caused increased post-implantation loss, decreased litter size, and an increased incidence of skeletal variations in pregnant rat and rabbit studies. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 3 months after the final dose. ADVERSE REACTIONS Beta-Thalassemia Serious adverse reactions occurred in 3.6% of patients on REBLOZYL. Serious adverse reactions occurring in 1% of patients included cerebrovascular accident and deep vein thrombosis. A fatal adverse reaction occurred in 1 patient treated with REBLOZYL who died due to an unconfirmed case of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Most common adverse reactions (at least 10% for REBLOZYL and 1% more than placebo) were headache (26% vs 24%), bone pain (20% vs 8%), arthralgia (19% vs 12%), fatigue (14% vs 13%), cough (14% vs 11%), abdominal pain (14% vs 12%), diarrhea (12% vs 10%) and dizziness (11% vs 5%). ESA-naïve adult patients with Myelodysplastic Syndromes Grade ≥3 (≥2%) adverse reactions included hypertension and dyspnea. The most common (≥10%) all-grade adverse reactions included diarrhea, fatigue, hypertension, peripheral edema, nausea, and dyspnea. ESA-refractory or -intolerant adult patients with Myelodysplastic Syndromes Grade ≥3 (≥2%) adverse reactions included fatigue, hypertension, syncope and musculoskeletal pain. A fatal adverse reaction occurred in 5 (2.1%) patients. The most common (≥10%) adverse reactions included fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, dizziness, diarrhea, nausea, hypersensitivity reactions, hypertension, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, and urinary tract infection. LACTATION It is not known whether REBLOZYL is excreted into human milk or absorbed systemically after ingestion by a nursing infant. REBLOZYL was detected in milk of lactating rats. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the unknown effects of REBLOZYL in infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue treatment. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose. DRUG ABUSE POTENTIAL Abuse: Abuse of REBLOZYL may be seen in athletes for the effects on erythropoiesis. Misuse of drugs that increase erythropoiesis, such as REBLOZYL, by healthy persons may lead to polycythemia, which may be associated with life-threatening cardiovascular complications.

(Nasdaq:UGRO) reported fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results, with revenue of $71.5 million, net loss of $(18.7) million, and Adjusted EBITDA of $(9.7) million. The company expects revenue growth of at least 17.4% in 2024, with a backlog of $110 million as of December 31, 2023. Despite project delays impacting Q4, the company implemented cost reductions to drive positive Adjusted EBITDA in 2024. Positive None. Negative Net loss increased from the prior year Decrease in revenue and gross profit in Q4 2023 Lower margin construction revenue impacting gross profit Negative Adjusted EBITDA in Q4 2023 Soft equipment revenues and expense related to European entity affecting Adjusted EBITDA Financial Analyst The reported backlog increase for urban-gro, Inc. is a positive indicator for future revenue, reflecting a healthy pipeline of orders. The sequential rise from $84 million to $110 million suggests a robust demand for the company's services, potentially translating into stable cash flows. Investors should note the backlog composition, with a significant portion in construction Design-Build, which typically carries longer lead times and may affect revenue recognition timing.Despite the optimism around backlog growth, the reported net loss widening from $(15.3) million to $(18.7) million year-over-year raises concerns. The decline in equipment systems revenue is particularly noteworthy, highlighting sector-specific challenges. The company's strategic pivot towards diversification away from the Cannabis segment appears to be a response to regulatory uncertainties. This realignment could mitigate risks associated with the volatile CEA market. However, investors should monitor if these changes in strategy and the cost reduction efforts can indeed reverse the negative Adjusted EBITDA trend and deliver on the 2024 positive EBITDA guidance. Market Research Analyst The Controlled Environment Agriculture industry is facing regulatory headwinds, notably impacting urban-gro's equipment systems revenue. The company's shift towards a more diversified revenue stream, with 70% now tied to commercial sectors, reveals a strategic adaptation to industry dynamics. This adaptation is important for urban-gro's resilience in a fluctuating market.urban-gro's focus on professional services could be a leading indicator of future construction and equipment demand, as these services often precede larger capital projects. The company's anticipation of robust professional services revenue in Q1 2024 suggests confidence in sustained demand. However, the softness in equipment revenues and the dependency on project delays resolution require close monitoring by stakeholders. Legal Expert The reported increase in legal expenses as part of operating costs is an area of interest. Legal complexities can be symptomatic of underlying issues within a company or industry. It's important to understand the nature of these expenses—whether they are related to intellectual property, compliance, or litigation—as they can have a material impact on the company's financial health.Additionally, urban-gro's mention of potential industry-specific regulatory changes, such as cannabis rescheduling or the passing of the SAFER Banking Act, implies a regulatory environment that could significantly influence the company's operations. Stakeholders should evaluate the company's ability to navigate and capitalize on these changes, as they can offer both opportunities and risks. 04/02/2024 - 04:13 PM Backlog of $110 million as of December 31, 2023, a sequential increase of $26 million2024 outlook calls for strengthening revenues and positive Adjusted EBITDACompany to host conference call and webcast today, March 27, 2024 at 4:30 PM ETLAFAYETTE, CO / ACCESSWIRE / March 27, 2024 / urban-gro, Inc. (Nasdaq:UGRO) (""urban-gro"" or the ""Company""), an integrated professional services and Design-Build firm offering solutions to the Controlled Environment Agriculture (""CEA"") and other commercial sectors, today reported fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results, and provided preliminary results for first quarter 2024 as well as full year 2024 guidance. Full Year 2023 Results vs Prior Year Period:Revenue of $71.5 million, a 6.7% increase from $67.0 millionNet income (loss) of $(18.7) million, as compared to $(15.3) millionAdjusted EBITDA 1 of $(9.7) million, as compared to $(3.9) millionFull Year 2024 Guidance:Revenue of more than $84.0 million, representing growth of at least 17.4%Positive Adjusted EBITDA 1First Quarter 2024 Preliminary Guidance vs Prior Year Period:Revenue at or better than $15.0 million, as compared to $16.8 millionAdjusted EBITDA 1 at or better than ($0.5) million, as compared to $(3.4) million""2023 was a transitional year for the Company as our diversified end market exposure provided a hedge against prolonged softness in the Cannabis segment. In fact, 70% of our revenues were tied to these commercial sectors, with the remaining 30% in CEA, demonstrating a reversal from the trends we experienced in 2022 and highlighting the value of our diversification strategy,"" commented Bradley Nattrass, Chairman and CEO. That said, our fourth quarter was adversely impacted by project delays to several projects that pushed into fiscal year 2024. While these delays are disappointing, these projects remain active in the first quarter, and our $110 million project backlog at the end of 2023 bodes well for growth prospects in 2024. To better align our cost structure with the current environment, we implemented cost reductions of more than $8 million dollars on an annualized basis over the course of the past twelve months, which we believe will serve as the foundation to generate sustained positive Adjusted EBITDA in 2024.""Mr. Nattrass added, ""Looking ahead to 2024, our sector-diversified professional services and Design-Build model is in place and our optimized team of architects, interior designers, engineers, construction management personnel, and horticulturists is focused on servicing the demand we have in our backlog. We continue to see strong momentum across multiple sectors, and with the increased productivity in our services delivery to start the year, we expect to realize margin improvement as well. Our guidance implies a strong year of organic growth based on the latest estimates of project timing and the impact of our streamlined operating structure. We also remain well positioned to capture any momentum from industry-specific regulatory changes, should they arise. We believe that the potential rescheduling of cannabis, the passing of the SAFER Banking Act, and the approval from new states, like Florida, to legalize cannabis for adult use, are catalysts for Design-Build projects and ancillary equipment systems sales. We remain committed to operating as efficiently as possible and staying focused on the development of our project pipeline across our diverse client base so that we can achieve our near-term goal of returning to positive Adjusted EBITDA generation and drive long-term profitable growth.""Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial ResultsRevenue was $15.0 million, as compared to $17.3 million in the prior year period. This decrease from the prior year period was driven by lower construction Design-Build revenue of $1.3 million, and lower professional services revenue of $0.8 million.Gross profit was $1.7 million, or 11% of revenue as compared to $3.2 million, or 19% of revenue in the prior year period. The decrease in gross profit correlates to the decrease in revenue as well as a shift in mix toward lower margin construction Design-Build revenue. This was further impacted by a project cost revision in the fourth quarter that negatively impacted project profitability.Operating expenses were $6.4 million as compared to $6.2 million in the prior year period, representing an increase of $0.1 million. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increased legal expenses. On an annualized basis, the Company expects a year-over-year reduction of more than $8.0 million in operating expenses in 2024 primarily as a result of a cost optimization across the entire organization.Non-operating expenses were $0.1 million as compared to $1.3 million in the prior year period.Net loss was $4.7 million, or $(0.40) per share as compared to a net loss of $4.2 million, or $(0.39) per share in the prior year period.Adjusted EBITDA 1 was negative $3.0 million as compared to negative $1.7 million in the prior year period. The decrease was driven by lower margin construction Design-Build revenue, a decrease in profit margins on professional services revenue, and the Company's commitment to keep the equipment integration team and European entities in place to drive future growth.As of December 31 2023 , , the Company had $1.1 million in cash and $2.5 million drawn on its $10 million revolving credit facility. The Company put this revolving line of credit in place primarily to be able to handle the significant anticipated growth in construction Design-Build revenues and to better manage cash flow needs related to that overall business.Summary Full Year 2023 Financial ResultsRevenue was $71.5 million as compared to $67.0 million in the prior year, representing an increase of $4.5 million, or 6.7%. The increase was primarily driven by a significant increase in construction revenue of $26.4 million, offset by a significant decrease of $20.7 million in equipment systems revenue reflecting a continuation of significantly reduced demand in the CEA market as a result of ongoing state-level regulatory delays in the license-awarding process, as well as the lack of movement on passing key legislation impacting the industry.Gross profit was $10.3 million, or 14.4% of revenue, as compared to $14.2 million, or 21% of revenue in the prior year. The decrease in gross profit was primarily driven by the change in overall revenue contribution for the Company, with 65% composed of lower margin construction Design-Build revenue. In addition, the profit margin for the professional services revenue decreased to 39%, from 52% in the prior year, due to temporary inefficiencies during the integration of all acquired companies onto the same enterprise resource planning system.Operating expenses were $27.0 million as compared to $26.8 million in the prior year, due primarily to the net effects of a $3.8 million increase in general and administrative expenses and a $3.3 million reduction in a one-time business development expense. The increase in general and administrative expenses was the result of increased professional fees associated with legal defense costs and increased personnel costs associated with an increase in the average number of employees.Non-operating expenses were $2.2 million as compared to $3.0 million in the prior year, and included $1.5 million for the settlement of a litigation, and an additional contingent consideration expense of $0.3 million related to the impairment of the XS Financial investment.Net loss was $18.7 million, or $(1.66) per share as compared to a net loss of $15.3 million, or $(1.44) per share, in the prior year.Adjusted EBITDA 1 was negative $9.7 million as compared to negative $3.9 million in the prior year. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA 1 is predominantly attributed to the significant decrease in equipment system revenues, and expenses related to our European entity.1 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please see the information under ""Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information"" below for a description of Adjusted EBITDA and the table at the end of this press release for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial information to GAAP results.Backlog as of December 31, 2023Consolidated backlog is unrealized revenue represented by contractually committed construction Design-Build, equipment systems, and service orders. As of December 31, 2023, total backlog was approximately $110 million in contracts, comprised of $102 million in construction Design-Build, $7 million of professional services, and $1 million of equipment systems.The following table summarizes the year over year change in backlog from the year ended December 31, 2022 to the year ended December 31, 2023: Equipment Systems Services Construction Design-Build Total Backlog (in millions) Beginning backlog as of December 31, 2022 $5 $6 $82 $93 Revenue recognized (13) (12) (46) (71)Backlog additions 9 13 66 88 Ending backlog as of December 31, 2023 $1 $7 $102 $110 Geographic FootprintThe Company currently operates out of offices in Colorado, Texas and Georgia in the United States and an office in Dordrecht, Netherlands in Europe.Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA 1 Guidance - Full Year 2024 and First Quarter 2024For the 2024 full year, the Company anticipates consolidated revenues to grow by at least 17% to more than $84 million and that it will generate positive Adjusted EBITDA 1 . For the first quarter 2024, the Company expects revenue to be more than $15 million with Adjusted EBITDA 1 to be better than negative $0.5 million. While equipment revenues remain soft and construction is expected to be slightly better than the fourth quarter of 2023, revenues from professional services are expected to be robust, which is a strong leading indicator of future construction and equipment demand. Further, as a result of the expense reductions we implemented in 2023, gross margins are expected to improve year-over-year.Conference Call Detailsurban-gro will host a conference call and live audio webcast to discuss the operational and financial results today, March 27 , 2024 at 4:30 PM ET.

We use Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of our operating performance. Our board of directors and management team focus on Adjusted EBITDA as a key performance and compensation measure. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA assists us in comparing our performance over various reporting periods because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that our management believes do not reflect our core operating performance.We present a net loss (GAAP) reconciliation to adjusted net loss (Non-GAAP) and EPS in order to show the impacts on net income (loss) and EPS of non-recurring items, net of tax, so that our stakeholders can easily see what our results would have been had these items been excluded from those calculations. Our board of directors and management team believe this reconciliation allows our stakeholders to review our adjusted results to those presented by other companies in our industry.Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net loss are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, and they are not a substitute for net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure prescribed by GAAP.There are limitations to using non-GAAP measures such as Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net-loss. Although we believe that Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net-loss can make an evaluation of our operating performance more consistent because it removes items that do not reflect our core operations, other companies in our industry may define Adjusted EBITDA or adjusted net-loss differently than we do. As a result, it may be difficult to use Adjusted EBITDA or adjusted net-loss to compare the performance of those companies to our performance. Adjusted EBITDA or adjusted net-loss should not be considered as a measure of the income generated by our business or discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business.About urban-gro, Inc.urban-gro, Inc.® (Nasdaq:UGRO) is an integrated professional services and Design-Build firm.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst OneMedNet's recent capital raise through a private placement of senior convertible notes is a strategic move to enhance liquidity and support operational expansion. The $4.54 million in funding is significant for a company of OneMedNet's scale, potentially extending its cash runway and providing resources for working capital. Convertible notes are a debt instrument that can be converted into equity, often at a discount to the future equity pricing round. This mechanism can be attractive to investors seeking both the security of debt and the upside potential of equity.The choice of this financial instrument may reflect the company's confidence in its future valuation, as well as a willingness to manage dilution in a way that aligns with growth prospects. For stakeholders, the immediate benefit is the infusion of cash without immediate dilution, while the long-term impact hinges on the company's performance and the terms of conversion, which could affect share price and ownership structure. Market Research Analyst The investment into OneMedNet's iRWD™ platform indicates a growing market interest in Real World Data solutions, particularly in high-stakes areas such as oncology and cardiology. Real World Data is becoming increasingly valuable for pharmaceutical companies, regulatory bodies and healthcare providers, as it can inform clinical trial designs, support regulatory submissions and guide personalized treatment decisions.OneMedNet's positioning in this market, coupled with the fresh capital, suggests potential for increased market share and competitive advantage. However, the company's ability to capitalize on this investment will depend on its execution capabilities and the effectiveness of its AI-driven solutions in delivering meaningful insights. As healthcare continues to evolve towards data-driven decision-making, OneMedNet's role could become more central, impacting patient outcomes and healthcare innovation. Legal Expert The involvement of multiple advisors and legal counsels in the transaction underscores the complexity and importance of compliance in securities offerings. The distinction made in the press release regarding the sale of securities only in jurisdictions where it is lawful reflects the intricate regulatory landscape governing private placements. It is imperative for investors to understand that such financial instruments are subject to regulatory scrutiny and may carry risks associated with the legal framework.For OneMedNet, adherence to securities laws and regulations is important in maintaining investor confidence and avoiding potential legal challenges. The collaboration with seasoned legal advisors indicates the company's commitment to due diligence and may instill a sense of trust among potential investors. Nevertheless, the actual terms of the notes, including conversion rates and triggers, will be pivotal in determining the legal and financial implications for both the company and the note holders. 04/02/2024 - 04:08 PM Cash Infusion Provides Significant Cash Runway of Up to $4.54 MillionMINNEAPOLIS, April 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OneMedNet Corporation (Nasdaq: ONMD) (“OneMedNet” or the “Company”), the leading curator of regulatory-grade Real World Data (“iRWD™”), through its proven OneMedNet iRWD™ solution, today announced that it has entered into a definitive securities purchase agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement“) dated as of March 28, 2024 with an institutional investor (the “Investor“) providing up to $4.54 million in funding through a private placement for the issuance of senior convertible notes (the “Notes”).

Positive Ongoing cost reduction initiatives led to a $3.6 million year-over-year decrease in operating expenses for Locafy Partnerships with diDNA and Localista, as well as the launch of Hotfrog Proximity Page application, signal Locafy's shift towards a global publisher and media organization strategy. Total operating revenue decreased by 28.3%, with subscription revenue down by 34.4% in the fiscal first half of 2024. Operating expenses decreased by 51.6%, including reductions in technology expenses and employee benefits. Net loss for the period was $1.4 million, compared to $4.0 million in the comparable year-ago period. Negative Subscription revenue decreased by 34.4% due to billing relief provided to customers and higher customer churn. Advertising revenue decreased by 28.0% compared to the previous quarter. Services revenue decreased by 74.3% due to lower custom website builds. Net loss was $1.4 million, indicating a financial loss for the company. Market Research Analyst The announcement from Locafy Limited indicates a strategic pivot towards becoming a global publisher and media organization, a move that is underscored by their recent partnerships and product launches. This shift is noteworthy as it reflects the company's response to the challenges posed by search engine algorithm updates, which have significantly impacted the online search ecosystem, particularly for content-based sites. The partnerships with diDNA and Localista, as well as the launch of Hotfrog Proximity Page, are strategic efforts to diversify revenue streams and enhance the company's service offerings.From a market perspective, the emphasis on Locafy's Article Accelerator technology suggests a focus on value-added services that can help media brands improve their search engine visibility. This technology could potentially create a competitive edge for Locafy if it successfully mitigates the adverse effects of algorithmic changes on web traffic and advertising income. However, the reported decrease in operating revenue and subscription revenue raises concerns about the company's current market position and the effectiveness of its cost reduction initiatives in driving profitability. Financial Analyst Locafy's financial results for the 2024 fiscal first half show a significant year-over-year decrease in operating expenses by $3.6 million, which is a positive indicator of the company's cost management efforts. However, this must be weighed against the 28.3% decline in total operating revenue and a 34.4% decrease in subscription revenue. The steady advertising revenue amidst these declines could be a sign of resilience in that income stream, although the overall revenue contraction is concerning.The increase in gross margin to 81.4% is a strong point, reflecting improved cost efficiency. Nonetheless, the net loss of $1.4 million, although smaller than the previous year's $4.0 million, suggests that Locafy still faces challenges in achieving profitability. Investors should closely monitor the company's ability to convert its cost reduction and strategic shifts into sustainable revenue growth, especially given the decline in key performance indicators like monthly recurring revenue and total active reseller count. SEO and Digital Marketing Expert Locafy's strategic partnerships and product developments are directly responding to the evolving landscape of search engine optimization (SEO). The company's Article Accelerator is designed to help publishers increase the visibility of advertorials, which is increasingly important as search algorithms continue to change. The partnership with diDNA, in particular, could expand Locafy's reach within the ad tech space, potentially driving more business to its SEO services.The Hotfrog Proximity Page application, leveraging Yext's business listing database, represents an innovative approach to local SEO. By providing an easy-to-use platform for local businesses to create SEO-optimized landing pages, Locafy is tapping into the growing need for localized digital marketing solutions. However, the real test will be the application's adoption rate and its impact on driving traffic and revenue for Locafy's clients. 04/02/2024 - 04:10 PM Fiscal First Half 2024 Highlighted by Ongoing Cost Reduction Initiatives Resulting in $3.6 Million Year-Over-Year Decrease in Operating Expenses Partnerships with diDNA and Localista, Hotfrog Proximity Page Application Launch Underscore Locafy’s Shift Towards Global Publisher and Media Organization Strategy PERTH, Australia, April 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Locafy Limited (Nasdaq: LCFY, LCFYW) (“Locafy” or the “Company”), a globally recognized software-as-a-service technology company specializing in local search engine marketing, today reported financial results for the 2024 fiscal first half ended December 31, 2023. All financial results are reported in Australian Dollars (AUD). Recent Operational Highlights Announced a partnership agreement with diDNA, a leading ad tech provider for the publisher ecosystem. With this partnership, diDNA will implement Locafy’s Article Accelerator alongside diDNA’s existing advertising software to allow diDNA’s publishers to increase the prominence of advertorials within online search results for competitive keywords. The agreement will begin with a paid trial for 10-15 publishers in diDNA’s network and, if successful, will be expanded to their broader set of publishers.Signed a series of commercial agreements with Localista, the largest lifestyle and travel directory in Australia and New Zealand. Through these agreements, Locafy acquired Scoop’s digital assets, agreed to provide SEO consulting services to Localista’s retained asset, and added Localista’s sales team as a reseller of Locafy’s Article Accelerator.Launched Hotfrog Proximity Page, an application built in partnership with Yext. Hotfrog Proximity Page is a unique application that combines Yext’s extensive business listing database network with Locafy’s SEO technology to empower local businesses to effortlessly create for themselves one or more dynamic landing pages that are optimized for SEO performance. Hotfrog Proximity Page is expected to allow users to enhance their online presences and drive traffic to their main websites. Management Commentary“Our 2024 fiscal first half presented several promising opportunities for our business that inform our optimism for the rest of the fiscal year,” said Locafy CEO Gavin Burnett. “Recent search engine algorithm updates created persistent headwinds for both the existing online search ecosystem and our traditional business. Content-based sites drive revenue from advertising and affiliate commissions, and dramatic website traffic losses caused by these algorithm updates, sometimes in excess of 90% in the past 18 months, materially impacted our partners’ advertising income and budgets. These challenges reached our top resellers, dampening the expected upside from recent reseller partnerships.” “Our Article Accelerator technology has proven very successful for media brands hoping to rapidly combat the effects of these algorithmic changes,” continued Burnett. “As we move into the second half of the year, we’ve effectively reduced our expenses and managed our lean cost structure to give us the flexibility to shift our strategy. By deploying our proprietary SEO technology and expertise, we are confident that we can reverse the fortunes of struggling content-based websites under our control. We have already started diversifying our go-to-market strategy to acquire additional digital properties and expand our publishing reach, as highlighted by our partnerships with diDNA and Localista. We believe we are on a path to becoming a global publisher and media organization that specializes in content-rich websites in high-value advertising categories. We look forward to providing updates in the coming quarters.” 2024 Fiscal First Half Financial ResultsResults compare the 2024 fiscal first half end (December 31, 2023) to the 2023 fiscal first half end (December 31, 2022) unless otherwise indicated. All financial results are reported in Australian Dollars (AUD). Total operating revenue decreased 28.3% to $2.0 million from $2.8 million in the comparable year-ago period. Subscription revenue decreased 34.4% to $1.4 million from $2.1 million in the comparable year-ago period. Compared to the 2024 fiscal first quarter, subscription revenue decreased 19.0%. The decrease in subscription revenue was attributable to the Company continuing to extend billing relief to customers whose campaigns on our Proximity product were affected by the transition onto Locafy’s upgraded technology platform (the “Platform”), together with a higher rate of customer churn compared to previous periods.Advertising revenue remained steady at $167,000 in both the current and comparable year-ago period. Compared to the 2024 fiscal first quarter, advertising revenue decreased 28.0%.Data revenue decreased 4.6% to $430,000 from $451,000 in the comparable year-ago period. Compared to the 2024 fiscal first quarter, data revenue increased 1.4%.Services revenue decreased 74.3% to $12,000 from $49,000 in the comparable year-ago period. Compared to the 2024 fiscal first quarter, services revenue decreased 56.9%. These decreases are due to comparatively lower custom website builds in each respective period. Other income decreased 96.0% to $7,000 from $165,000 in the comparable year-ago period. The variance is attributed to the Company’s assessment (as at the respective reporting period) of the extent and likelihood of its ability to claim a Research & Development tax incentive.Cost of sales decreased 64.1% to $318,000 from $888,000 in the comparable year-ago period.Gross margin for the 2024 fiscal second quarter increased to 81.4% from 68.7% for the comparable year-ago period.Operating expenses decreased 51.6% to $3.3 million from $7.0 million in the comparable year-ago period. This included a 56.5% decrease in technology expenses to $450,000 from $1.0 million in the comparable year ago period as a result of the Company’s ongoing efforts to upgrade its Platform, including changes to its technology stack and the reduction of third-party product subscriptions. Employee benefits expense decreased 63.6% to $1.6 million from $4.3 million in the comparable year ago period. The Company has in the intervening period significantly reduced headcount, particularly in underperforming sales regions and across all business units. New hires have predominantly been made in more “cost efficient” regions. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 45.4% to $719,000 from $494,000 in the comparable year ago period. This increase is mainly due to the higher starting cost base of capitalized development cost for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023.Net loss was $1.4 million, or $1.12 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $4.0 million, or $3.93 per diluted share, in the comparable year-ago period.

Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Clinical Research Analyst The establishment of a recommended Phase 2 dose for NBTXR3 in the treatment of inoperable, recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents a potential advancement in oncology therapeutics. The focus on patients who have exhausted conventional radiation therapy and are eligible for re-irradiation underscores the need for innovative treatments in this hard-to-treat population. The favorable safety profile observed in the Phase 1 dose escalation study is encouraging, considering that toxicity is a significant concern in re-irradiation scenarios. As the study progresses, efficacy signals will be important in determining NBTXR3's potential impact on patient outcomes. The continued collaboration with a reputable institution like MD Anderson could lend credibility to the study's findings and, if positive, may accelerate the path to regulatory approval and market adoption. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst From a market perspective, the development of NBTXR3 by Nanobiotix holds promise for addressing an unmet need in the treatment of NSCLC. NSCLC accounts for a significant portion of lung cancer cases and recurrent, inoperable cases present a substantial challenge. A successful radioenhancer like NBTXR3 could capture a niche market segment, potentially translating to a strong revenue stream for Nanobiotix. The stock market often responds favorably to positive clinical trial milestones, especially when they involve innovative cancer therapies. However, the long-term financial impact will depend on the outcomes of subsequent trials, regulatory hurdles and the ability of Nanobiotix to scale production and secure distribution channels. Investors will be watching closely as the dose expansion part of the study unfolds, seeking indicators of efficacy that could bolster confidence in the product's market potential. Biotechnology Legal Expert In the biotechnology sector, regulatory compliance and intellectual property rights are paramount. The progression of NBTXR3 into later-stage clinical development could have implications for Nanobiotix's patent strategy and regulatory interactions. Ensuring that the intellectual property around NBTXR3 is robust will be critical as the company moves closer to commercialization. Moreover, the legal landscape concerning biotech innovation is often complex, with companies needing to navigate both domestic and international regulations. For Nanobiotix, a favorable legal assessment of the trial's conduct and the protection of its intellectual property could significantly influence its market positioning and partnership opportunities, further impacting its business trajectory. 04/02/2024 - 04:15 PM Established recommended Phase 2 dose of NBTXR3 for the treatment of patients with inoperable, recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) who have previously received definitive radiation therapyConfirmation of injection feasibility and favorable safety profile in completed Phase 1 dose escalation part of the study support potential for later stage development of NBTXR3 for the treatment of patients with inoperable, recurrent NSCLC who are amenable to re-irradiationThe dose expansion part of the Phase 1 study designed to further assess safety and evaluate early signals of efficacy is ongoing PARIS and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., April 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext : NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the ‘‘Company’’), a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer, today announced completion of the dose escalation part of a Phase 1 study evaluating potential first-in-class radioenhancer NBTXR3 for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) that cannot be treated by surgery (“inoperable”), and has come back (“recurrent”), whom have previously been treated with definitive radiation therapy and are amenable to re-irradiation. The Phase 1 study (“Study 2020-0123”) is being conducted by The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (“MD Anderson”) as part of an ongoing strategic collaboration with Nanobiotix. “NBTXR3 is designed as a product candidate with the potential to improve treatment outcomes for patients with cancer in any setting where radiotherapy is a part of the treatment regimen. While these patients experience different cancer types and are each faced with unique challenges, what they share is an urgent need for therapeutic innovation with the chance to make a difference,” said Louis Kayitalire, MD, Chief Medical Officer at Nanobiotix. “We believe the injection feasibility and favorable safety profile we have observed from the completed dose escalation part of this Phase 1 lung cancer study could pave the way for additional clinical development of NBTXR3 for patients with inoperable, recurrent lung cancer and patients amenable to re-irradiation.” The completed dose escalation part of Study 2020-0123 established the recommended Phase 2 dose after determination of injection feasibility and observation of a favorable safety profile. The expansion part of the study, further evaluating safety and early signals of efficacy, is ongoing. About MD ANDERSON STUDY 2020-0123MD Anderson Study 2020-0123 (NCT04505267) is a Phase 1 study evaluating the best dose and observing the adverse effects of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy (“RT”) for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) that cannot be treated with surgery (“inoperable”), and has come back (“recurrent”), in patients who have previously been treated with definitive RT. The primary objectives of the study include a safety assessment of re-irradiation in these patients and determination of the recommended Phase 2 dose of NBTXR3 activated by RT. The re-irradiation safety assessment part and the dose-finding part of the study have completed. An expansion part evaluating additional signals of safety, feasibility, anti-tumor response, and time-to-event outcomes is ongoing. About NBTXR3NBTXR3 is a novel, potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas for which the product received a European CE mark in 2019. The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy, subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA, Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors. Radiotherapy-activated NBTXR3 is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors, including in NANORAY-312—a global, randomized phase III study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020, the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy, with or without cetuximab, for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the phase III study. Given the Company’s focus areas, and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3, Nanobiotix has engaged in a collaboration strategy to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy, in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad, comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several phase I and phase II studies evaluating NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2023 Nanobiotix announced a license agreement for the global co-development and commercialization of NBTXR3 with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, a Johnson & Johnson company.

About Vaxcyte Vaxcyte is a vaccine innovation company engineering high-fidelity vaccines to protect humankind from the consequences of bacterial diseases. The Company is developing broad-spectrum conjugate and novel protein vaccines to prevent or treat bacterial infectious diseases. Vaxcyte’s lead candidate, VAX-24, is a Phase 3-ready 24-valent, broad-spectrum, carrier-sparing pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) being developed for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). VAX-31, the Company’s next-generation 31-valent PCV, is the broadest-spectrum PCV candidate in the clinic today. Both VAX-24 and VAX-31 are designed to improve upon the standard-of-care PCVs for both children and adults by covering the serotypes that are responsible for a significant portion of IPD in circulation and are associated with high case-fatality rates, antibiotic resistance and meningitis, while maintaining coverage of previously circulating strains that are currently contained through continued vaccination practice. Vaxcyte is re-engineering the way highly complex vaccines are made through modern synthetic techniques, including advanced chemistry and the XpressCF™ cell-free protein synthesis platform, exclusively licensed from Sutro Biopharma, Inc. Unlike conventional cell-based approaches, the Company’s system for producing difficult-to-make proteins and antigens is intended to accelerate its ability to efficiently create and deliver high-fidelity vaccines with enhanced immunological benefits.

CENTOGENE Receives Nasdaq Non-Compliance Notice,2024-04-02T20:30:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,Centogene N.V. (CNTG) received a notification from Nasdaq regarding non-compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.

Centogene has 180 days to regain compliance by maintaining a bid price of at least US$1.00 per share for 10 consecutive business days.,"CENTOGENE Receives Nasdaq Non-Compliance Notice Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Centogene N.V. (CNTG) received a notification from Nasdaq regarding non-compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. The company's common shares listed on Nasdaq fell below US$1.00 for 30 consecutive business days. Centogene has 180 days to regain compliance by maintaining a bid price of at least US$1.00 per share for 10 consecutive business days. Positive None. Negative Centogene N.V. (CNTG) faces non-compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement, which could impact investor confidence and stock performance if not resolved within the specified timeframe. Market Research Analyst The recent notification received by Centogene from Nasdaq regarding non-compliance with the minimum bid price requirement is a signal to the market about potential volatility in the company's stock. Historically, when a company's share price falls below the $1 threshold, it can be perceived as a lack of investor confidence or underlying financial issues. This perception could lead to increased selling pressure, further depressing the share price.From a market research perspective, the situation presents a critical juncture for Centogene. The company's plan to regain compliance will be closely scrutinized by investors and analysts alike. Possible measures could include a reverse stock split or operational strategies to improve financial performance, both of which carry inherent risks and opportunities. A reverse stock split, for instance, could temporarily boost the share price but may not address the fundamental reasons for the stock's decline and could be viewed negatively by the market if seen as a cosmetic fix. Financial Analyst Centogene's current challenge with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement could have implications for its financial health, particularly in terms of access to capital. Companies listed on major exchanges like Nasdaq typically benefit from greater visibility and liquidity, which can be advantageous for raising capital through equity offerings. Should Centogene fail to regain compliance within the 180-day grace period, it may face delisting, which often leads to reduced liquidity and investor interest, potentially making it more difficult and expensive to raise funds.Investors should monitor Centogene's financial statements in subsequent quarters for any strategic moves aimed at cost reduction or revenue enhancement. The company's ability to present a credible plan to improve its financial position will be key to maintaining investor confidence and securing its listing status. Biotech Industry Expert In the biotech industry, where Centogene operates, stock prices can be particularly sensitive to regulatory news, clinical trial results and partnership announcements. The notification from Nasdaq may overshadow positive developments within the company, such as advancements in their research on rare and neurodegenerative diseases, which could have otherwise acted as catalysts for the stock price. The company's future announcements will need to be significant enough to shift investor focus away from the compliance issue and back onto the company's core scientific and business progress.It is also important to note that while the bid price is a concern, it does not directly reflect the company's operational capabilities or the potential of its product pipeline. Investors with a long-term perspective may look beyond the current stock price challenges, focusing instead on the company's research outcomes, market potential and strategic partnerships that can drive future growth. 04/02/2024 - 04:30 PM CAMBRIDGE, Mass. and ROSTOCK, Germany and BERLIN, April 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Centogene N.V. (Nasdaq: CNTG) (“Centogene”, “we”, or the “Company”), the essential life science partner for data-driven answers in rare and neurodegenerative diseases, today announced that it received a notification letter dated March 27, 2024, from the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Listing Qualifications Department, indicating that the Company was not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement set forth in Rule 5450(a)(1) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules since the closing bid price for the Company's common shares listed on Nasdaq was below US$1.00 for 30 consecutive business days (from February 12 through March 26, 2024). Nasdaq Rule 5450(a)(1) requires the shares to maintain a minimum bid price of US$1.00 per share, and Nasdaq Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that failure to meet such a requirement exists when the bid price of the shares is below US$1.00 for a period of 30 consecutive business days. In accordance with Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Company has a period of 180 calendar days from the date of notification to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. If at any time during the 180-calendar day period, the bid price of the shares closes at or above US$1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide written notification that the Company has achieved compliance with the minimum bid price requirement and will consider such deficiency matter closed. The Company intends to actively monitor the bid price for its common shares and will evaluate all available options to resolve the deficiency and regain compliance with Nasdaq Rule 5450(a)(1).

The company plans a prepackaged Chapter 11 process to emerge as a privately held entity with support from key stakeholders.","View, Inc. Reaches Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald and RXR to Become a Private Company Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary View, Inc. announces a financial restructuring agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald and RXR Realty to strengthen its balance sheet. The company plans a prepackaged Chapter 11 process to emerge as a privately held entity with support from key stakeholders. Positive View reaches a financial restructuring agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald and RXR Realty. The Proposed Transaction aims to enhance View's financial stability and future prospects. View expects to continue operations as usual during the prepackaged Chapter 11 process. The Company anticipates court approval for the restructuring within 45 days. Howard Lutnick and Scott Rechler will support View's operational structure post-restructuring. The transaction involves canceling existing loans and notes with equity interests being exchanged. 90.3% of noteholders and 100% of term lenders support the Restructuring Support Agreement. Debtor-in-possession financing will fund the Chapter 11 cases and emergence process. Additional details are available in View's Form 8-K filed with the SEC. Negative None. Financial Analyst The restructuring of View's balance sheet, involving prepackaged Chapter 11 filings, represents a critical juncture in the company's trajectory. The agreement with key stakeholders to convert debt into equity implies a significant dilution for current shareholders, as their holdings will be canceled. This is a common practice in such restructurings to alleviate debt burdens and provide a company with a fresh start financially.From an investor's perspective, the commitment of Cantor Fitzgerald and RXR to provide debtor-in-possession financing is indicative of confidence in View's core business and future prospects. This financing is essential for maintaining operations during the restructuring process. However, the delisting from Nasdaq signals a loss of liquidity for shareholders and could be seen as a red flag for potential investors.The long-term implications hinge on the company's ability to capitalize on its 'smart building technologies' niche. If successful, the restructuring could facilitate a turnaround. However, investors should be wary of the risks associated with a company emerging from Chapter 11, including the execution risks of the new business strategy and market adoption of the technology. Legal Expert The initiation of prepackaged Chapter 11 cases is a strategic move that allows View to expedite the restructuring process with minimal disruption to its operations. The Restructuring Support Agreement with a majority of noteholders and term lenders indicates a consensual approach, which is likely to result in fewer legal obstacles and a smoother reorganization.It is noteworthy that the Proposed Transaction is subject to court approval, which adds a layer of oversight and can potentially protect the interests of all parties involved. The decision to withdraw from the Nasdaq Hearings Panel and accept delisting is a calculated sacrifice to streamline the restructuring efforts. Legal advisors play a important role in navigating these complex proceedings and ensuring compliance with all regulatory requirements.The involvement of experienced legal advisors like Cole Schotz, P.C., Sidley Austin LLP and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP provides an additional layer of credibility to the process. Stakeholders should monitor court filings and the progress of the Chapter 11 cases closely to understand the evolving legal landscape and its implications for their interests. Market Research Analyst View's focus on smart building technologies places it within a growing market segment that is increasingly relevant in the context of sustainable and intelligent infrastructure development. The restructuring could provide View with the opportunity to streamline its operations and focus on core competencies, potentially increasing its competitive edge in this sector.However, market adoption of View's products and the scalability of its business model will be critical factors in determining the success of the restructuring. The involvement of industry players like Cantor Fitzgerald and RXR suggests that there may be strategic synergies that could be leveraged post-restructuring. The real estate ecosystem is ripe for innovation and View's offerings, if properly capitalized and managed, could meet the rising demand for sustainable building solutions.Continuous monitoring of market trends and customer adoption rates will be essential in assessing View's recovery post-restructuring. It will also be important to evaluate how View's competitors respond to these changes and whether View can maintain a technological advantage in the smart building space. 04/02/2024 - 04:07 PM Balance sheet restructuring designed to strengthen View’s financial position Approvals received from key stakeholders across capital structure MILPITAS, Calif., April 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- View, Inc.

(“Cantor Fitzgerald”), RXR Realty (“RXR”), and certain of the Company’s stakeholders on the terms of a financial restructuring that is designed to strengthen the firm’s balance sheet and better position View for the future (the “Proposed Transaction”). To ensure a timely process, View and certain of its subsidiaries will commence prepackaged Chapter 11 cases in the District of Delaware. During this time, View expects its operations to continue as normal. View also expects that trade claims will be unaffected, orders will continue to be fulfilled, and customers will continue to be supported. The Company expects to obtain court approval for the Proposed Transaction within 45 days of April 2, 2024. Shortly thereafter, View expects to emerge as a privately held company with a reorganized board of directors, whereby Howard Lutnick, Chairman & CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, and Scott Rechler, Chairman & CEO of RXR, will provide support and guidance to View on its operational structure and corporate strategy. “Today’s announcement marks the culmination of a thorough strategic review of our business operations to help ensure we have the proper capital structure going forward,” said Dr. Rao Mulpuri, CEO of View. “With the support of Cantor Fitzgerald and RXR, we intend to maximize our business potential with increased financial stability and be better positioned to increase our presence across the real estate ecosystem.” Dr. Mulpuri continued, “Over the years, we made significant progress in building our business and, today, have well-established products, operations, and customers. We remain committed to our mission of creating smart, healthy and sustainable buildings.” “We continue to be impressed with View’s products and software services,” said Howard W. Lutnick, Chairman & CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald. “Our financing is intended to allow View to continue to develop their innovative offerings for the real estate industry.” “View’s smart windows make buildings more sustainable, experiential, healthier, and smarter,” said Scott Rechler, Chairman and CEO of RXR. “We look forward to working closely with Howard Lutnick and Cantor Fitzgerald to help View restructure its balance sheet and emerge with a Company that is fit for the future.” Transaction Details The Proposed Transaction would result in View’s existing senior secured term loans and unsecured convertible notes being cancelled and the holders receiving 100% of the equity interests in the reorganized Company and existing equity interests being cancelled. To facilitate the Proposed Transaction, View, Cantor Fitzgerald, RXR, and certain other investors have executed a Restructuring Support Agreement, dated April 2, 2024 (the “Restructuring Support Agreement”). The parties to the Restructuring Support Agreement represent 90.3% of the Company’s noteholders and 100% of the Company’s term lenders. The Proposed Transaction would be implemented through a court-supervised process and, as such, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries will commence prepackaged Chapter 11 cases in the District of Delaware. Cantor Fitzgerald, RXR, and other investors have committed to provide debtor-in-possession financing to fund the Chapter 11 cases and the Proposed Transaction contemplates additional new money contributions in connection with emergence. Additional Information Additional details regarding the Proposed Transaction can be found in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on April 2, 2024. As previously announced, by letter dated January 26, 2024, the Listing Qualifications Department (the “Staff”) of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) determined to delist View’s securities from Nasdaq. View previously requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel, which request stayed the Staff’s delist determination at least pending completion of the hearing and the expiration of any extension that may be granted. On April 2, 2024, View withdrew from its hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel in connection with the commencement of the Chapter 11 cases. Additional information on the Chapter 11 cases, including court filings and other information related to the proceedings, will be available on a website administrated by the Company’s claims agent, Kroll Restructuring Administration LLC, at https://cases.ra.kroll.com/View.

The distribution is expected to be paid from taxable net investment income, with specific tax characteristics to be reported later. The Company, a regulated investment company, generates qualified interest income and short-term capital gains, potentially exempt from U.S. withholding tax for non-U.S. stockholders. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd.'s monthly distribution is a key indicator for evaluating the company's current cash flow and dividend policy. The distribution amount of $0.1025 per share is a tangible return on investment for shareholders and influences the stock's attractiveness, especially for income-focused investors. The consistency of such distributions can signal financial stability and a reliable income stream, which may impact the company's stock valuation.From a tax perspective, the classification of distributions as taxable net investment income and the potential exemption from U.S. withholding tax for non-U.S. stockholders is significant. It enhances the appeal of the stock to international investors, potentially broadening the investor base and positively impacting stock liquidity. However, investors must consider the final tax characteristics reported on Form 1099, as these can affect the net income received.Overall, the declaration of monthly distributions can be seen as a positive gesture by management, reflecting confidence in the company's earnings and cash flow management. However, investors should also assess the sustainability of these distributions by reviewing the company's earnings reports and financial statements for a comprehensive understanding of its financial health. Tax Expert For investors, understanding the tax implications of distributions from a Regulated Investment Company (RIC) like PennantPark is crucial. The ability of the company to classify portions of its distribution as interest-related dividends and short-term capital gains, which may be exempt from U.S. withholding tax, can offer tax efficiency for non-U.S. shareholders. This tax efficiency is an important consideration for the after-tax return on investment.It is important for shareholders, especially those who are non-U.S. residents, to ensure they have the proper documentation to benefit from the tax-exempt status of certain distributions. The company's commitment to providing specific tax characteristics on their website and through Form 1099 communications reflects transparency and aids investors in tax planning.The impact of these tax considerations on the company's stock can be indirect but meaningful. By potentially reducing the tax burden for certain investors, the company's shares become more attractive to a wider pool of international investors. This can lead to increased demand for the stock, potentially supporting its market price. 04/02/2024 - 04:05 PM MIAMI, April 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd.

Positive None. Negative None. Tax Advisor The announcement of PennantPark Investment Corporation's monthly distribution is a point of interest for shareholders, primarily from a tax perspective. The statement that the distribution is expected to be paid from taxable net investment income has implications for stockholders' individual tax situations. It's important for investors to understand that these distributions are often treated as ordinary income and therefore, are subject to tax at the individual's marginal tax rate. The fact that the company will provide specific tax characteristics on Form 1099 is significant, as it will allow shareholders to accurately report this income on their tax returns.From a broader view, the consistency of such distributions can be appealing to income-focused investors, particularly those seeking regular income streams, such as retirees. However, investors should also be cognizant of the company's ability to sustain these payments over the long term, which depends on its operational performance and cash flow generation capabilities. Dividend Analyst Dividends or distributions, such as the one declared by PennantPark, are a direct way for companies to return value to shareholders and they can often reflect the company's current financial health and future outlook. A stable or increasing dividend payout can signal confidence in the company's earnings and cash flow stability. However, it's also essential to evaluate the payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends to shareholders. An excessively high payout ratio can be unsustainable in the long term and may lead to future dividend cuts if earnings decrease.Investors should also consider the yield, which is the annual dividend payment divided by the stock's price. This metric can help compare the attractiveness of PennantPark's dividend with other investment opportunities. Nevertheless, a high yield should not be the sole reason for investment, as it may also indicate potential risk if the stock price is declining due to underlying company issues. Financial Analyst When a company like PennantPark declares a dividend, it's an indicator of its capital allocation strategy. The decision to pay a monthly distribution suggests a commitment to providing regular income to its shareholders. For investors, the predictability of these payments can be factored into their portfolio strategy, particularly for those who rely on dividends as a steady income stream.It's important for investors to look beyond the distribution amount and assess the company's financial statements for profitability, debt levels and cash flow. These factors will determine the sustainability of the dividend. Additionally, the market's reaction to the dividend announcement could provide insights into investor sentiment regarding the company's financial health and the perceived sustainability of its dividend policy. 04/02/2024 - 04:05 PM MIAMI, April 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PennantPark Investment Corporation (the ""Company"") (NYSE: PNNT) declares its monthly distribution for April 2024 of $0.07 per share, payable on May 1, 2024 to stockholders of record as of April 15, 2024.

NEW REPORT SUPPORTS USE OF CALDOLOR® AS A STANDARD OF CARE ACROSS PATIENT POPULATIONS,2024-04-02T20:05:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc. releases a Special Report showcasing the safety and efficacy of intravenous ibuprofen (IVIB) for pain and fever treatment in adults, children, and infants. The report emphasizes the need for non-opioid options in pain management.","NEW REPORT SUPPORTS USE OF CALDOLOR® AS A STANDARD OF CARE ACROSS PATIENT POPULATIONS Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc. releases a Special Report showcasing the safety and efficacy of intravenous ibuprofen (IVIB) for pain and fever treatment in adults, children, and infants. The report emphasizes the need for non-opioid options in pain management. Positive None. Negative None. Pharmaceutical Industry Analyst The recent findings concerning intravenous ibuprofen (IVIB) as detailed by Cumberland Pharmaceuticals signify a potential shift in the standard pain and fever management protocols. The emphasis on IVIB's efficacy and safety in a broad age range, from infants to adults, indicates a widening market for the product. From an industry perspective, the ability to market a non-opioid pain management solution is timely, given the current opioid crisis. This positions Cumberland Pharmaceuticals advantageously within the specialty pharmaceutical sector, potentially increasing its market share and investor interest.Moreover, the reported benefits of IVIB, such as reducing the need for opioids and providing effective pain management, could lead to cost savings for healthcare providers by curtailing the economic burden associated with opioid addiction and its related healthcare costs. The market is increasingly receptive to pharmaceutical innovations that offer safer alternatives to opioids and the positive data could enhance the company's reputation and credibility within the medical community. Healthcare Policy Expert The implications of Cumberland Pharmaceuticals' findings on healthcare policy are significant. As healthcare systems grapple with the opioid epidemic, evidence-based alternatives such as IVIB can influence treatment guidelines and insurance coverage decisions. The emphasis on multimodal pain management reflects a broader trend in healthcare policy towards comprehensive and preventative care strategies. If IVIB becomes a recommended standard of care, it could lead to regulatory endorsements and a shift in prescribing behaviors, which would have a profound impact on public health outcomes and pharmaceutical business strategies alike.However, the widespread adoption of IVIB hinges on continued positive outcomes and cost-effectiveness analysis. Payers and policymakers will scrutinize the long-term benefits and potential risks associated with IVIB's use in various populations. The company's engagement with regulatory bodies and advocacy for inclusion in treatment protocols could be a pivotal factor in its commercial success. Clinical Pharmacist As a clinical pharmacist, it's essential to evaluate the therapeutic benefits and practical applications of IVIB in real-world settings. The reported reduction in opioid use and effective pain control in postoperative and emergency department scenarios is promising. These outcomes suggest that IVIB could be integrated into hospital formularies and become a standard preoperative medication to manage pain, which would enhance patient recovery and experience.Additionally, the unique approval of IVIB for use in young pediatric patients addresses a significant unmet need in pain management for this vulnerable population. It is incumbent upon pharmacy and therapeutics committees to consider these findings and weigh the benefits against any potential adverse effects associated with NSAIDs. The role of IVIB in multimodal regimens could redefine hospital protocols, potentially leading to an increase in demand for the product and an associated uptick in the company's stock performance. 04/02/2024 - 04:05 PM Growing data shows intravenous ibuprofen is safe and effective for the treatment of pain and fever in adults, children and infants NASHVILLE, Tenn., April 2, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq: CPIX), a specialty pharmaceutical company, today announced the release of a Special Report evaluating the growing amount of current data supporting the use of its Caldolor® product (intravenous ibuprofen, or IVIB) as a standard of care for the treatment of pain and fever in adults, children and infants. The report, published in Anesthesiology News, General Surgery News and Pharmacy Practice News, highlights the need for the prudent and careful management of pain, particularly as the prescription of opioids for pain treatment has become commonplace, often leading to dependence and misuse. ""My hope is that this Special Report will emphasize the use of Caldolor as a foundation for multimodal pain management, while also helping to address the opioid epidemic,"" said Michael W. Lew, M.D., Clinical Professor and Past Chair for the Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine at the City of Hope Cancer Center. As part of a comprehensive safety and efficacy developmental plan, IVIB was studied in various treatment areas, including surgical pain, fever and nonsurgical acute pain. The results, which are highlighted in the report, show it's a safe and effective treatment for pain and fever in adults, children and infants as young as 3 months of age. Takeaways from the report note that: IVIB results in significant reduction in temperature compared with placebo (in adults) and with acetaminophen (in pediatric patients).Administration of the product prior to surgery leads to patients waking up in significantly less postsurgical pain, while also lessening or even eliminating the need for opioids.IVIB use in the hospital ED for acute pain can minimize opioid requirements, while achieving pain control.IVIB is the only non-opioid injectable analgesic approved for use in children as young as 3 months of age.IVIB should be considered a foundation for any multimodal pain regimen.""Pain management has become one of the most common health care problems,"" said A.J. Kazimi, CEO of Cumberland Pharmaceuticals. ""As this new report states, comprehensive multimodal pain regimens have become key in preventing pain and optimizing pain control, while minimizing the need for opioids. A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID, such as Caldolor has become a cornerstone for many treatment paradigms, and we are continually encouraged by the growing database from our studies of the product in patients of all ages.""

Vanda Pharmaceuticals' Fanapt® (iloperidone) Receives U.S. FDA Approval for the Acute Treatment of Bipolar I Disorder,2024-04-02T22:10:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,"Vanda Pharmaceuticals' Fanapt® Receives FDA Approval for Bipolar I Disorder Treatment, Expanding Commercial Opportunities","Vanda Pharmaceuticals' Fanapt® (iloperidone) Receives U.S. FDA Approval for the Acute Treatment of Bipolar I Disorder Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags fda approval Rhea-AI Summary Vanda Pharmaceuticals' Fanapt® Receives FDA Approval for Bipolar I Disorder Treatment, Expanding Commercial Opportunities Positive None. Negative None. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The FDA approval of Fanapt for bipolar I disorder marks a strategic expansion for Vanda Pharmaceuticals, potentially widening its market share within the psychiatric medication sector. The approval leverages Fanapt's existing schizophrenia treatment reputation to address a significant portion of the 2.8% U.S. adult population diagnosed with bipolar disorder. This could lead to increased revenue streams and bolster market confidence in Vanda's commitment to addressing unmet medical needs.Investors should note the potential for market growth, given the high prevalence of severe bipolar cases. However, the competitive landscape includes numerous established treatments, so Fanapt's uptake rate and market penetration will be critical to monitor. Vanda's financial health and diverse pipeline are positive indicators, but actual sales performance post-launch will be the true test of this strategy's efficacy. Clinical Psychiatrist The introduction of Fanapt as a treatment for bipolar I disorder could represent a significant clinical advancement. The drug's well-known safety profile, stemming from its use in schizophrenia, may ease concerns among healthcare providers when considering this new option for their patients. The statistically significant results from the pivotal study, particularly the improvements observed as early as Week 2, suggest that Fanapt may offer a faster therapeutic benefit compared to some existing treatments.From a clinical perspective, the ability to tailor treatments to individual patient needs is paramount and Fanapt's flexible dosing could be a deciding factor for its adoption in psychiatric practice. However, long-term real-world effectiveness and adherence will be the ultimate measures of its impact on patient outcomes. Healthcare Economist The approval of Fanapt for bipolar I disorder has implications for healthcare spending, especially within the mental health segment. The cost-effectiveness of Fanapt, relative to other treatments, will be an important consideration for both insurers and healthcare providers. Given the chronic nature of bipolar disorder and the severity of symptoms, treatments that can reduce hospitalization rates and improve quality of life may offer economic benefits beyond the direct cost of medication.It is essential to analyze how Fanapt's pricing strategy aligns with healthcare payers' willingness to reimburse and its impact on patients' out-of-pocket expenses. While the drug's approval may improve patient care, its economic success will hinge on a careful balance between pricing, insurance coverage and the value it provides relative to other treatment options. 04/02/2024 - 06:10 PM Fanapt® Treatment is Now Available to Adult Patients for the Acute Treatment of Manic or Mixed Episodes Associated with Bipolar I Disorder Approval Represents Significant Novel Indication for Vanda's Fanapt® Franchise WASHINGTON, April 2, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Vanda) (Nasdaq: VNDA) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Fanapt® (iloperidone) tablets for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in adults. Fanapt® is an atypical antipsychotic agent that has been used for the acute treatment of patients with schizophrenia since its FDA approval in 2009. ""Manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder are highly complex conditions, which require a host of trusted options to meet individual patient needs. With over 100,000 patient years of experience, Fanapt is a familiar therapeutic agent that offers flexible dosing with a well-known safety profile. This FDA approval gives patients and service providers a new treatment option for managing bipolar I disorder,"" said Mihael H. Polymeropoulos M.D., Vanda's President, CEO and Chairman of the Board. Bipolar disorder is a serious, highly prevalent psychiatric chronic condition affecting approximately 2.8% of the U.S. adult population, with 83% of them classified as severe1. Bipolar disorder is a group of disorders that are characterized by periods of elevated mood alternating with periods of depressed mood. For the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, people must have experienced one or more episodes of mania and most would have episodes of both mania and depression. Patients with bipolar I disorder with manic or mixed episodes are a subset of those approximately 10 million Americans with bipolar disorder1. The marketing approval of Fanapt® in bipolar I disorder with manic and mixed episodes significantly increases the commercial opportunity for Fanapt®. Stephen Stahl, MD, PhD, Professor of Psychiatry at the University of California San Diego, said, ""Many patients today are still unable to find suitable treatment options for effectively managing bipolar disorder. Tailoring the right treatment for the right patient is critical for effective care, and the approval of Fanapt represents an important milestone. Fanapt possesses a well-studied safety profile, and its approval will provide patients with a new and effective option for treating a highly complex disorder."" The approval of Fanapt® for the acute treatment of adults with manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder was based on a pivotal study randomizing approximately 400 patients. The primary endpoint measured in Week 4 of treatment was assessed by the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), a rating scale of clinical severity in the core symptoms of mania. At the end of the study (Week 4), Fanapt® treated patients showed a larger improvement than placebo treated patients, and this difference was highly statistically significant (p=0.000008). YMRS was assessed at the end of Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4. Statistically significant benefit in the Fanapt® treated group over placebo was observed as early as the Week 2 assessment. The safety profile of Fanapt® in this study was similar to that seen in Fanapt® studies previously conducted for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. Dr. Polymeropoulos continued, ""Today's announcement marks a significant step forward for one of Vanda's leading franchises and underscores the effectiveness of our strategy in pursuing innovative therapies that address high unmet medical needs to improve the lives of patients. With this as our foundation, we have established a resilient business, with a diverse product pipeline, a history of revenue growth and strong financial position. We remain focused on providing critical medicines to patients across the world while creating sustainable, long-term value."" References: Harvard Medical School, 2007.

Tiger Aesthetics Medical, to acquire breast business assets for $42.5 million. Nuance Intermediary, to acquire BIOCORNEUM assets for $8 million. Transactions subject to court approval. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The transaction involving Tiger Aesthetics Medical, LLC and Sientra represents a significant event in the medical aesthetics market. The $42.5 million cash consideration, along with the assumption of liabilities, indicates a strategic acquisition that could potentially enhance Tiger's market position in the breast reconstruction and augmentation business. The assumed liabilities, including up to $7 million in cure costs and warranty obligations, suggest that Tiger is prepared to invest not only in the assets but also in the ongoing customer relationships and product support, which could be a positive signal to investors about the company's commitment to long-term value creation.Furthermore, the acquisition by Nuance Intermediary, LLC of Sientra’s BIOCORNEUM business for $8 million cash consideration and associated liabilities is a smaller but still relevant transaction. This deal could allow Nuance to expand its portfolio in the scar treatment market, which is a niche but important segment in dermatology and cosmetic surgery. Both transactions are subject to court approval, which adds a layer of uncertainty until the final decision on April 10, 2024. Investors should monitor the outcome as it will have implications for the financial health and strategic direction of the involved entities. Legal Expert The use of Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code for the sale of assets is a critical legal maneuver that allows companies like Sientra to sell assets quickly and cleanly to bidders like Tiger Aesthetics Medical and Nuance Intermediary. This process is designed to maximize the value of the debtor's assets for the benefit of creditors and to ensure an orderly transition of business operations. The assumption of specific liabilities, including warranties and customer contracts, is a key aspect of such transactions, as it influences the purchaser's risk profile and the overall valuation of the deal.Investors should note that the approval from the United States Bankruptcy Court is a important step and any delays or complications in this process could affect the expected benefits of the transactions. The involvement of reputable legal counsel and financial advisors in the process may provide some reassurance regarding the procedural integrity and strategic soundness of the deals. Market Research Analyst In the context of the medical aesthetics industry, the sale of Sientra’s assets represents a reshuffling of market capacities. From a market research perspective, the acquisition could signal consolidation in the industry, which is often characterized by high competition and rapid innovation. The cash considerations of the deals reflect the value attributed to Sientra's established products and customer base. The breast reconstruction and augmentation business, in particular, has a significant customer base and brand recognition, which Tiger Aesthetics Medical could leverage to strengthen its position in the market.For Nuance Intermediary, tapping into the BIOCORNEUM scar treatment business could provide access to a specialized market segment that complements its existing offerings. The long-term impact on the market dynamics, including competitive pricing and innovation, will depend on how effectively the acquiring companies integrate the new assets and manage the transition. Stakeholders should consider the potential for increased market share and revenue streams against the integration risks and the costs of assumed liabilities. 04/02/2024 - 06:30 PM Tiger Aesthetics Medical, LLC is the successful bidder for certain assets used in Sientra’s breast reconstruction and augmentation business Nuance Intermediary, LLC is the successful bidder for substantially all of the assets used in Sientra’s BIOCORNEUM scar treatment business IRVINE, Calif., April 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sientra, Inc.

The 5E Boron Americas Complex is fully operational, with successful well-field injection and independent analysis confirming high-quality boric acid resource. The Company plans to scale up production, increase lithium output, secure offtake contracts, and explore funding opportunities for further research and development. CEO Susan Brennan expresses pride in the milestone achievement and anticipates continued success and growth. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The initiation of commercial production at 5E Advanced Materials' Boron Americas Complex is a pivotal event that necessitates a market analysis to understand its implications. The transition from commissioning to full-scale operations indicates the company is moving beyond the capital-intensive setup phase into revenue generation. This operational shift is likely to be viewed positively by investors, as it suggests the potential for improved cash flows and reduced risk profile associated with early-stage projects.The mention of securing offtake contracts is particularly noteworthy. These contracts are agreements between producers and purchasers to buy or sell portions of the producer's future production. They are critical in providing revenue certainty and can greatly enhance the company's ability to secure financing for further expansion, as they often serve as collateral. The successful production of boric acid and the company's plans to scale up and introduce lithium carbonate production could attract significant interest from industries reliant on these materials, such as the glass, ceramics and battery sectors.Furthermore, the company's submission for a Department of Energy grant and involvement with federal agencies concerning boron supply chains underscores the strategic importance of its products. If successful, such grants could bolster the company's financial position and support its technological advancements in lithium extraction, which may lead to improved project economics and a competitive edge in the market. Financial Analyst The commencement of commercial boric acid production by 5E Advanced Materials marks a material development that could have significant financial implications. The initial production capacity and targets for scaling up operations provide a tangible measure for projecting revenue growth. Since the company has already accumulated a substantial volume of PLS (pregnant leach solution) since mining began, this suggests a rapid ramp-up, which could translate into earlier-than-expected revenue.Investors will likely scrutinize the independent third-party ICP (inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry) analysis confirming the run-of-mine head grade. A head grade of 5.5% is a critical metric, as it relates to the concentration of boron in the mined ore and is a determinant of the potential profitability of the mining operation. The company's ability to maintain or improve this grade will be important for its cost structure and margin profile.The strategic significance of the Lithium Skid Unit's near-term integration should not be overlooked. Lithium is in high demand for its use in batteries, particularly for electric vehicles and an increase in lithium production capacity could significantly enhance the company's valuation, given the current market's appetite for lithium producers. The company's operational and strategic milestones may thus lead to a re-rating by analysts and a re-assessment of the company's growth prospects. Energy Sector Analyst 5E Advanced Materials' designation as a provider of Critical Infrastructure for its boron and lithium operations aligns with broader national interests in securing domestic supply chains for critical minerals. The National Defense Authorization Act's call for a study into boron supply chains, coupled with the company's engagement with federal agencies, places it at a nexus of strategic resource policy and commercial operations. The potential for government grants and enhanced collaboration with federal agencies could provide a substantial tailwind for the company's R&D efforts in lithium extraction technology.The energy sector's transition towards renewable sources and electric mobility is driving demand for both boron and lithium. Boron is used in various applications including fiberglass insulation and wind turbine blades, while lithium is a key component in batteries. The company's dual focus on these elements may position it favorably within the sector, especially as the U.S. government emphasizes domestic production of critical materials. The ability to increase lithium yields would be a strong competitive advantage, potentially impacting the company's stock as the market assesses the strategic value of its resources and technology. 04/02/2024 - 06:51 PM Full plant commissioning and initiation of commercial boric acid production marks the achievement of significant operational and strategic milestoneHESPERIA, Calif., April 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 5E Advanced Materials, Inc. (Nasdaq: FEAM) (ASX: 5EA) (“5E” or the “Company”), a boron and lithium company with U.S. government Critical Infrastructure designation for its 5E Boron Americas Complex, today announced the Company’s operations team has successfully commissioned the facility and has launched full commercial operations. The Company began well-field injection on January 1st, 2024. Key Highlights: 5E Boron Americas Complex is fully commissioned and has now transitioned to operational status.Final electrical work was completed by external engineering contractors as of March 15th.Over 50,000 gallons of PLS has been accumulated since mining commencement.Independent 3rd party analysis conducted inductively couple plasma mass spectrometry analysis (“ICP”) and confirms run-of-mine head grade of 5.5%. The small-scale facility will: Initially produce 2,000 short tons of boric acid and targeting initial production of lithium carbonate, with plans to scale up to a run rate of 9,000 short tons and increase lithium production.Is now being run 24/7 as shift operators are trained and staffed.Provide high-quality commercial product for customer qualification to secure offtake contracts and funding for phase one operations.The Company’s Lithium Skid Unit was delivered to site with expectation of integrating into facility in the near-term. Susan Brennan, Chief Executive Officer at 5E Advanced Materials, stated, “I am proud to announce that 5E has achieved the most significant milestone in our Company’s history, as we have recently commenced commercial production of boric acid at the 5E Boron America’s Complex. This is a significant strategic step forward in the company’s evolution, and the initial results affirm the high-quality boric acid resource and further validate our initial operational assumptions, representing the foundation of our project economics. We expect our operational progress and success to build throughout the year, facilitating discussions with stakeholders around funding options for the Phase 1 commercial facility and executing commercial contracts.” Funding Opportunities 5E recently submitted a request for proposal response to the Department of Energy for a grant to fund research to enhance 5E’s lithium extraction work. Should the Company receive an award from this submission, funding is aimed towards increasing the amount of lithium carbonate that the Company’s facility can extract, potentially increasing lithium yields to improve project economics. Additionally, the Company continues to progress boron awareness with multiple federal agencies on the back of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2024 requesting a study into boron supply chains. Company Updates 5E Advanced Materials will continue to keep its various stakeholders informed as commercial production progresses in April and as operations advance.

Alta Global Group Limited Announces Closing of Initial Public Offering,2024-04-02T21:50:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Alta Global Group  (MMA) successfully closes its initial public offering, raising $6.5 million through the sale of 1,300,000 ordinary shares at $5.00 per share. The company plans to utilize the net proceeds for marketing, product development, research, and general corporate purposes.","Alta Global Group Limited Announces Closing of Initial Public Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags IPO offering Rhea-AI Summary Alta Global Group (MMA) successfully closes its initial public offering, raising $6.5 million through the sale of 1,300,000 ordinary shares at $5.00 per share. The company plans to utilize the net proceeds for marketing, product development, research, and general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The closing of Alta Global Group Limited's initial public offering (IPO) represents a significant milestone for the company and a potential bellwether for the niche market of martial arts and combat sports technology. The successful raise of $6.5 million, albeit modest by some industry standards, underscores investor confidence in the sector's growth potential. The decision to offer additional shares to cover over-allotments suggests that the underwriters anticipate a positive market reception.For industry stakeholders, this capital infusion could lead to enhanced product offerings and increased market penetration. However, given the specialized nature of Alta's market, the effectiveness of their marketing and sales strategies will be critical in determining the ROI. The long-term success will largely hinge on the company's ability to innovate and maintain relevance in a sector that is still establishing its digital footprint. Financial Analyst The pricing of Alta's shares at $5.00 in the IPO provides a valuation benchmark for the company and sets investor expectations for growth. With a relatively small offering size, the stock's liquidity and volatility will be areas of interest for market participants. The use of net proceeds for R&D and general corporate purposes is typical, yet investors will scrutinize the allocation of funds towards marketing and sales, as the ability to generate revenue will be a key driver of future valuations.Furthermore, the involvement of ThinkEquity as the sole book-running manager could be indicative of the offering's scale and targeted investor base. The market will be observing Alta's post-IPO performance closely, particularly in the context of their operational execution and financial management, to gauge the long-term viability of the investment. Legal Expert The mention of a registration statement on Form F-1 indicates Alta's compliance with SEC regulations, which is essential for investor confidence. The legal stipulations surrounding the offering, such as the prohibition of sales in jurisdictions where it would be unlawful without proper registration, are standard and protect both the company and investors. The 45-day option for underwriters to purchase additional shares is a common hedge against market fluctuations post-IPO and provides a safety net for both the underwriters and the company.Investors will be interested in the company's adherence to securities laws and its governance structure post-IPO, as these factors can significantly impact stock performance and corporate stability. 04/02/2024 - 05:50 PM MANLY, AUSTRALIA / ACCESSWIRE / April 2, 2024 / Alta Global Group Limited (""Alta"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE American:MMA), a technology company that is enabling the global martial arts and combat sports industry to maximize the monetization opportunities available to the sector by increasing consumer participation in the sport and building upon existing community offerings within the sector, today announced the closing of its initial public offering of 1,300,000 ordinary shares at a public offering price of $5.00 per share (the ""Offering""), for gross proceeds of $6,500,000, before deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses.

The proceeds will be used for the acquisition of Carlisle Interconnect Technologies business, fees, expenses, and general corporate purposes. The offering is subject to special mandatory redemption conditions if the acquisition does not occur. BofA Securities, Citigroup Global Markets, J.P. Morgan Securities, and TD Securities are the joint book-running managers for the offering. Positive None. Negative None. Debt Capital Markets Analyst The announcement by Amphenol Corporation regarding the pricing of their senior notes offering is a strategic move for financing its acquisition of Carlisle Interconnect Technologies. The interest rates set for the 2027 and 2029 Notes at 5.050% and for the 2034 Notes at 5.250% reflect the current market conditions and the company's creditworthiness. These rates are slightly higher than what might be seen in a low-interest environment, indicating a market expectation of rising rates or a premium for the specific credit risk of Amphenol. Investors should note the inclusion of a special mandatory redemption clause, which adds a layer of protection in case the acquisition does not proceed as planned. This clause could potentially affect the yield to maturity calculations for investors, as the notes might be redeemed earlier than their stated maturities at 101% of the principal amount. Overall, the offering is a significant financial event for Amphenol, as it ties directly to their strategic expansion via the CIT Acquisition. The outcome of this offering will likely influence Amphenol's leverage ratios and interest coverage metrics, which are important indicators of financial health watched closely by investors and rating agencies. M&A (Mergers & Acquisitions) Analyst The use of proceeds from the notes offering to fund the CIT Acquisition suggests a leverage buyout component to the deal structure. The acquisition of Carlisle Interconnect Technologies is expected to enhance Amphenol's offerings in the aerospace and military sectors, potentially leading to synergies and increased market share. However, the actual realization of these benefits will depend on the successful integration of the businesses. For stakeholders, the key concerns would revolve around the execution risk associated with the acquisition and the subsequent integration process. While the acquisition could provide growth and diversification benefits in the long term, there is always a risk of overpaying or failing to achieve the expected synergies, which could negatively impact Amphenol's profitability and stock performance. Furthermore, the acquisition's timing and execution will be under scrutiny, as delays or complications could trigger the special mandatory redemption of the notes, impacting the company's financial strategy. Corporate Finance Advisor Amphenol's financing strategy, combining the issuance of senior notes with cash and other debt, demonstrates a balanced approach to capital structure management. It is important to note that the seniority of the notes implies that these debt holders would have a higher claim on assets in the event of a liquidation, which can be attractive to risk-averse investors. From a corporate finance perspective, the decision to raise funds through the debt market rather than issuing equity helps avoid shareholder dilution. This can be seen as a positive signal to existing shareholders, as the company is opting to finance growth while preserving shareholder value. However, the increase in debt levels will also result in higher interest expenses, which could impact net income and cash flows. The management's ability to service this debt through operational cash flows and the expected benefits from the CIT Acquisition will be critical for maintaining financial stability and investor confidence. 04/02/2024 - 05:29 PM WALLINGFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Amphenol Corporation (NYSE: APH) announced today the pricing of its offering of $450 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2027 (the “2027 Notes”), $450 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes”) and $600 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2034 (the “2034 Notes”, and together with the 2027 Notes and 2029 Notes, the “Notes”). The 2027 Notes will have an interest rate of 5.050% per annum, the 2029 Notes will have an interest rate of 5.050% per annum, and the 2034 Notes will have an interest rate of 5.250% per annum. The closing of the offering is expected to occur on April 5, 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering, together with a combination of cash on hand and other debt financing, to pay the cash consideration for the Company’s pending acquisition of the Carlisle Interconnect Technologies business of Carlisle Companies Incorporated (the “CIT Acquisition”), the payment of fees and expenses related thereto and, to the extent that the net proceeds from this offering are not used for such purposes, for general corporate purposes. Each series of the Notes are expected to be subject to a special mandatory redemption (at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of such series of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest from the date of initial issuance, or the most recent date to which interest has been paid or provided for, whichever is later, to, but not including, the special mandatory redemption date) under certain circumstances if the CIT Acquisition is not consummated or is not consummated by an agreed upon date. BofA Securities, Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and TD Securities (USA) LLC are serving as the joint book-running managers for the offering of each series of the Notes.

(FLNT) reported Q4 2023 revenue of $72.8 million, with a net loss of $1.9 million. Full-year 2023 revenue was $298.4 million, with a net loss of $63.2 million. The company emphasized strategic growth in new performance marketplaces and investments in consumer engagements. Despite revenue declines, Fluent aims to strengthen its market position in 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported revenue decline of 17.4% for FY 2023 compared to the previous year, alongside the net loss of $63.2 million, paints a concerning picture for Fluent, Inc. from a financial performance standpoint. The decrease in gross profit and media margin as a percentage of revenue indicates challenges in maintaining profitability and cost efficiency. Investors should consider the company's ability to reverse this trend in the context of the broader economic environment and the competitive landscape of the performance marketing industry.Notably, the adjusted EBITDA decrease suggests operational challenges but must be viewed in conjunction with the company's strategic investments aimed at long-term growth. The focus on expanding new syndicated performance marketplaces and leveraging owned assets could be a strategic move to diversify revenue streams and increase market share, which may benefit the company in the long run if executed effectively. Market Research Analyst Fluent's emphasis on higher quality consumer engagements and expansion into new syndicated performance marketplaces is a strategic response to the evolving digital marketing landscape. The shift towards performance-based marketing models, driven by increasing demand for measurable ROI, positions Fluent to potentially capitalize on this trend. However, the current macro-economic realities mentioned by the CEO could imply headwinds such as reduced advertising budgets and consumer spending, which may impact the company's growth trajectory and market position.Investors should monitor Fluent's ability to increase user participation rates, conversion rates and monetization, as these are critical metrics for the success of performance marketing platforms. Additionally, the company's commitment to compliance standards and competitive differentiation could enhance its reputation and client trust, potentially leading to increased market share. Legal Expert Fluent's proactive approach towards setting new compliance standards in the industry is a strategic move that could mitigate legal and regulatory risks, especially in a data-driven business where privacy concerns are paramount. By leading in compliance, Fluent may create a competitive differentiation that not only attracts clients looking for reputable partners but also prepares the company for potential future regulations. Investors should consider the long-term benefits of such positioning, despite the lack of immediate financial impact, as it could protect against future liabilities and enhance brand equity. 04/02/2024 - 05:32 PM Revenue of $72.8 million for Q4 2023 and $298.4 million for FY 2023Net loss of $1.9 million for Q4 2023 and $63.2 million for FY 2023Gross profit (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) of $20.8 million for Q4 2023 and $78.5 million for FY 2023Media margin of $24.1 million for Q4 2023 and $91.3 million for FY 2023Adjusted EBITDA of $2.5 million for Q4 2023 and $6.8 million for FY 2023Adjusted net loss of $0.4 million for Q4 2023 and $7.2 million for FY 2023 NEW YORK, April 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fluent, Inc.

The earn-out expense was $434 and $121 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We present media margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss), and adjusted net income (loss) per share as supplemental measures of our financial and operating performance because we believe they provide useful information to investors. More specifically: Media margin, as defined above, is a measure of the efficiency of the Company’s operating model. We use media margin and the related measure of media margin as a percentage of revenue as primary metrics to measure the financial return on our media and related costs, specifically to measure the degree by which the revenue generated from our digital marketing services exceeds the cost to attract the consumers to whom offers are made through our services. Media margin is used extensively by our management to manage our operating performance, including evaluating operational performance against budgeted media margin and understanding the efficiency of our media and related expenditures. We also use media margin for performance evaluations and compensation decisions regarding certain personnel. Adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, is another primary metric by which we evaluate the operating performance of our business, on which certain operating expenditures and internal budgets are based and by which, in addition to media margin and other factors, our senior management is compensated. The first three adjustments represent the conventional definition of EBITDA, and the remaining adjustments are items recognized and recorded under GAAP in particular periods but might be viewed as not necessarily coinciding with the underlying business operations for the periods in which they are so recognized and recorded. These adjustments include certain litigation and other related costs associated with legal matters outside the ordinary course of business. We consider items one-time in nature if they are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual and have not occurred in the past two years or are not expected to recur in the next two years, in accordance with SEC rules. There were no adjustments for one-time items in the periods presented. Adjusted net income (loss), as defined above, and the related measure of adjusted net income (loss) per share excludes certain items that are recognized and recorded under GAAP in particular periods but might be viewed as not necessarily coinciding with the underlying business operations for the periods in which they are so recognized and recorded. We believe adjusted net income (loss) affords investors a different view of the overall financial performance of the Company than adjusted EBITDA and the GAAP measure of net income (loss). Media margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss), and adjusted net income (loss) per share are non-GAAP financial measures with certain limitations regarding their usefulness. They do not reflect our financial results in accordance with GAAP, as they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, these metrics are not indicative of our overall results or indicators of past or future financial performance. Further, they are not financial measures of profitability and are neither intended to be used as a proxy for the profitability of our business nor to imply profitability. The way we measure media margin, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted net income (loss) may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies and may not be identical to corresponding measures used in our various agreements.

(NASDAQ: FGEN) announces positive topline data from the Phase 1 study of FG-3246, an anti-CD46 antibody drug conjugate, in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients. Key findings include a median radiographic progression free survival of 8.7 months, PSA50 response in 36% of patients, and a radiographic objective response rate of 20%. The company plans to initiate Phase 2 trials in the second half of 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The recent findings from the Phase 1 study of FG-3246, an anti-CD46 antibody drug conjugate, are notable within the oncology community. The median radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) of 8.7 months in a heavily pre-treated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) cohort is a significant clinical endpoint. rPFS is a measure of the time during and after medication treatment that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse. In the context of mCRPC, where treatment options are often limited and the disease is aggressive, an rPFS of this duration could suggest a meaningful extension of quality life for patients. Furthermore, the PSA50 response rate of 36% is indicative of antitumor activity, given that prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a biomarker for prostate cancer progression. A reduction by 50% or more is often associated with a positive clinical response. The safety profile, which aligns with other MMAE-based therapies, is also a important aspect of the drug's development, as it suggests a manageable side effect profile for patients who often have limited tolerance for additional toxicity due to their extensive pretreatment histories. Medical Research Analyst From a research perspective, the advancement of FG-3246 is significant due to its targeting mechanism involving CD46, which is often overexpressed in cancer cells but not in normal cells. This selectivity could lead to fewer off-target effects, a common challenge in cancer therapy. The use of monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) as a payload in the antibody drug conjugate (ADC) harnesses a potent anti-mitotic agent that, when delivered directly to cancer cells, can provide a strong therapeutic effect while potentially minimizing systemic toxicity. The plan to discuss the development pathway with the FDA is a critical step towards Phase 2 trials, which will further elucidate the drug's efficacy and safety in a larger patient population. The data so far, with a 20% confirmed radiographic objective response rate, suggests that FG-3246 could be a valuable addition to the mCRPC treatment landscape. The median duration of response of 7.5 months also provides a glimpse into the potential for durable responses with this therapy, an important factor in chronic conditions like mCRPC. Financial Analyst The announcement by FibroGen regarding the promising results of FG-3246 in treating mCRPC has potential implications for the company's financials and stock market performance. As a potential first-in-class therapy, FG-3246 could capture a significant market share in the prostate cancer treatment market, especially given the limited options for heavily pre-treated mCRPC patients. The progression to a Phase 2 trial, anticipated in the second half of 2024, is likely to be a catalyst for investor interest as it represents a step closer to commercialization. Investors will be closely monitoring the upcoming FDA discussions and any strategic partnerships or funding opportunities that may arise from this positive data. The company's ability to navigate the regulatory pathway and manage the clinical development costs will be key factors in determining the long-term financial impact of FG-3246. The stock market often reacts favorably to positive clinical trial results, particularly for oncology drugs with high unmet medical needs, suggesting potential upward movement for FibroGen's stock in response to these developments. 04/02/2024 - 05:46 PM FG-3246 demonstrated efficacy in adenocarcinoma selected cohorts receiving biologically active doses of FG-3246 at ≥ 1.2 mg/kg in heavily pre-treated, biomarker unselected patients: Median radiographic progression free survival of 8.7 months PSA50 response in 36% of patients Confirmed radiographic objective response rate of 20%, with a median duration of response of 7.5 months FG-3246 demonstrated an acceptable safety profile; adverse events consistent with those observed in other antibody drug conjugate therapies with a MMAE payload Company plans to meet with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to discuss development pathway; Phase 2 initiation is anticipated in 2H 2024 SAN FRANCISCO, April 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FibroGen, Inc. (NASDAQ: FGEN) today announced topline data from the Fortis Therapeutics-sponsored Phase 1 study of FG-3246 (also known as FOR46), a potential first-in-class anti-CD46 antibody drug conjugate (ADC) with an MMAE-containing payload, in a dose-escalation and dose-expansion trial enrolling patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) whose tumors have progressed on at least one androgen receptor-signaling inhibitor (ARSI). “We are delighted to showcase the latest encouraging clinical data from the FOR46-001 Phase 1 ADC trial,” said Deyaa Adib, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of FibroGen. “We observed a median radiographic progression free survival of 8.7 months in heavily pre-treated patients, who received biologically active doses of FG-3246 in the second line or later setting prior to chemotherapy. These Phase 1 data provide evidence of a favorable safety profile and promising clinical activity as further evidenced by prostate-specific antigen reduction of ≥ 50% and shrinking of measurable disease. We look forward to publishing the totality of the Phase 1 data as we advance the program further in the clinic.” In the Phase 1 dose-escalation portion of the study, ascending dose levels of FG-3246 were administered every 3 weeks. In the dose-expansion arm of the trial, patients were treated at the 2.7 mg/kg adjusted body weight dosing (AjBW) until disease progression. The endpoints were safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity as measured by the decline of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) from baseline, objective tumor response rate in patients with measurable disease, and radiographic progression free survival (rPFS). The completed Phase 1 trial includes a total of 56 patients from the dose-escalation and dose-expansion cohorts. The efficacy analysis includes patients who received a starting dose of FG-3246 of ≥ 1.2 mg/kg in the dose-escalation cohort, and patients who received 2.7 mg/kg AjBW with a histologic diagnosis of adenocarcinoma in the dose-expansion cohort. Patients were heavily pre-treated, having received a median of 5 lines of therapy prior to receiving FG-3246. In the efficacy analysis, PSA reductions of ≥ 50% were observed in 36% of PSA evaluable patients. For RECIST evaluable patients, 20% met the criteria of a partial response, or tumor reduction in size of ≥ 30%, with a median duration of response of 7.5 months. The median rPFS in this heavily pre-treated patient population was 8.7 months. The most frequent adverse events were consistent with other MMAE-based ADCs and included infusion related reactions, fatigue, weight loss, neutropenia, and peripheral neuropathy. “The results from the FOR46-001 Phase 1 study are promising, demonstrating a manageable safety profile and continued robust signals of clinical activity,” stated Dr. Rahul Aggarwal, Professor of Medicine at University of California San Francisco and Lead Investigator of the study. “The observed median radiographic progression free survival of 8.7 months in patients treated with a starting FG-3246 dose of 1.2 mg/kg and higher is quite favorable and highlights the therapeutic potential of FG-3246 as a new ADC aimed at a novel target. These findings warrant further investigation and hold promise for addressing the therapeutic needs of patients with CD46 positive prostate cancer. We are also excited about potential combinations with FG-3246 and will be presenting investigator sponsored trial data of FG-3246 in combination with enzalutamide at the upcoming ASCO 2024 annual meeting.” Earlier data from the FOR46-001 trial had been presented at the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2022 annual meeting1, and complete results from the study are being submitted to a medical journal for publication in 2024. About the Phase 1 StudyFOR46-001 (NCT03575819) is a Phase 1, dose-escalation study to evaluate multiple doses of IV-administered FG-3246 (also known as FOR46) in patients with mCRPC who have progressive disease on at least one ARSI, followed by a dose-expansion cohort, to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, biological activity, and preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity of FG-3246 in this patient population. Thirty-three (33) patients were enrolled in the dose-escalation phase of the study at doses between 0.1 mg/kg and 3.0 mg/kg every three weeks (Q3W), with adjusted body weight dosing (AjBW) used at most dose levels above 2.1 mg/kg. Safety and tolerability of FG-3246 were evaluated in the dose-escalation period of the study. Twenty-three (23) patients were enrolled in the dose-expansion period of the study; 18 patients with adenocarcinoma mCRPC (Cohort 1) and five patients with neuroendocrine prostate cancer (Cohort 2). All patients in the expansion cohorts were treated at 2.7 mg/kg AjBW to a maximum of 270 mg every three weeks. The safety profile of FG-3246 was characterized, and anti-tumor activity of FG-3246 in adenocarcinoma patients dosed at ≥ 1.2 mg/kg was evaluated. About Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate CancerProstate cancer develops when malignant cells form and grow in the prostate gland. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the United States, who currently have a 1 in 8 lifetime risk of developing the disease.2 Approximately 290,000 new diagnoses of prostate cancer and nearly 35,000 deaths were estimated in the U.S. in 2023.2 Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is a form of advanced prostate cancer that shows signs of growth, even with low levels of testosterone.2 With mCRPC, the cancer stops responding to hormone therapies and can be life-threatening if it spreads to other parts of the body such as nearby lymph nodes, bones, the bladder, rectum, liver, lungs, and the brain. Death from prostate cancer is typically the result of mCRPC, with a 5-year survival rate of 34%3, and the unfortunate reality remains that mCRPC is an incurable disease.4 About FG-3246FG-3246 (also known as FOR46) is a potential first-in-class fully human antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), exclusively in-licensed from Fortis Therapeutics, and is being developed by FibroGen for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and other tumor types. FG-3246 binds to an epitope of CD46, a cell receptor target, that induces internalization upon antibody binding, is present at high levels in prostate cancer and other tumor types, and demonstrates very limited expression in most normal tissues. FG-3246 is comprised of an anti-CD46 antibody, YS5, linked to the anti-mitotic agent, MMAE, which is a clinically and commercially validated ADC payload. FG-3246 has demonstrated anti-tumor activity in both preclinical and clinical studies. FG-3246 is currently in an ongoing Phase 1/2 study being conducted at UCSF to evaluate it in combination with enzalutamide with initial data expected in mid-2024, and a biomarker trial using a PET biomarker for CD46 using the same antibody backbone. We anticipate the initiation of the Phase 2 trial in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in the second half of 2024. FG-3246 is an investigational drug and not approved for marketing by any regulatory authority. About FibroGen FibroGen, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on accelerating the development of novel therapies at the frontiers of cancer biology. Pamrevlumab, a fully human anti-CTGF monoclonal antibody, is in clinical development for the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer and locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer (LAPC).

The investment ensures financial strength for future development and commercialization.","Movano Health Secures Strategic Investment from Tier-One Multi-Billion Dollar Medical Device Company Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Movano Health secures strategic investment and agreement with a tier-one medical device company, emphasizing the potential of its mmWave technology in delivering medical-grade data. The investment ensures financial strength for future development and commercialization. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The strategic investment received by Movano Health from a major medical device company signifies a robust vote of confidence in Movano's technology and market potential. Such investments are often pivotal, as they not only infuse necessary capital but also often come with strategic partnerships that can accelerate technology development and market penetration. The collaboration aspect of the agreement could be particularly beneficial, as it may provide Movano Health with access to the partner's distribution networks, manufacturing capabilities, or additional R&D resources.From a financial perspective, this partnership could be a lever for Movano Health to enhance its balance sheet and reduce the cash burn rate, which is a common concern for growth-stage companies in the health tech sector. Investors should monitor the deployment of these funds and any updates on the progress of the collaboration, as these will be critical indicators of the company's ability to execute on its business plan and achieve commercial success with its Evie Ring and B2B solution, Evie Med. Market Research Analyst The health technology sector is experiencing rapid growth, driven by consumer demand for wearable health devices and enterprise solutions that provide medical-grade data. Movano Health's emphasis on multi-analyte mmWave RF technology positions the company at the forefront of innovation in this space. The Evie Ring and the upcoming Evie Med represent products that align with current market trends towards non-invasive, continuous health monitoring.The investment and collaboration could enhance Movano Health's competitive edge by accelerating product development and commercialization timelines. However, it is essential to consider the market's crowded landscape, with several established players and numerous startups vying for market share. Movano Health will need to differentiate its offerings with superior accuracy, ease of use and integration into health ecosystems to capture and retain users. Medical Technology Analyst The proprietary mmWave RF technology that Movano Health is developing has the potential to disrupt the medical device industry, particularly in the wearable technology space. The reference to clinical accuracy in a cuffless blood pressure study indicates that Movano is addressing one of the significant challenges in wearable health tech: providing accurate, medical-grade data without the invasiveness of traditional methods.Investors should consider the regulatory pathway for Movano's products, including the Evie Med, which will require FDA clearance. The partnership with a tier-one medical device company could provide valuable support in navigating the complex regulatory environment and achieving the necessary clearances. This support could significantly de-risk the investment, as regulatory approval is a major hurdle for health technology companies. The 'greenfield opportunity' mentioned suggests that Movano Health is targeting an underserved market segment, which could be ripe for innovation and growth. 04/02/2024 - 05:00 PM The seed investment and agreement underscores Movano Health's multi-analyte and proprietary mmWave radio frequency technology PLEASANTON, Calif., April 2, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Movano Health (Nasdaq: MOVE), a pioneer in health technology, secured a strategic investment from a tier-one multi-billion dollar medical device company and signed an agreement to explore future collaborations relating to development and commercialization. ""Attracting strategic investment underscores the vast potential of Movano Health's innovative approach to delivering medical-grade data to both consumers and enterprises. This is a significant endorsement of our technological expertise and our vision to set new standards in the possibilities of what wearable health technology can do,"" said John Mastrototaro, CEO of Movano Health. ""Our prestigious partner is keenly interested in the potential of our proprietary mmWave radio frequency (RF) technology, which demonstrated strong clinical accuracy in a cuffless blood pressure study late last year."" ""This investment, in conjunction with a larger capital raise announced today, ensures we have the financial strength to push forward with our proprietary technologies and commercial offerings, including the Evie Ring, as well as the planned introduction of Evie Med, our business-to-business solution which will leverage future FDA clearances and serve a greenfield opportunity across healthcare,"" concluded Mastrototaro. Message from CEO The Company posted a video from CEO John Mastrototaro announcing the news, which can be viewed here. Capital RaiseThe Company issued a separate release today about a private equity placement. A tier-one multi-billion dollar medical device company, requesting confidentiality for competitive reasons, invested $3 million as part of a larger $24 million capital raise. The PIPE included a select cohort of institutional and accredited investors, and $3.6 million in commitments by members of the Company's management team and board of directors. The proceeds are expected to fund general corporate purposes and working capital. About Movano HealthFounded in 2018, Movano Inc. (Nasdaq: MOVE) dba Movano Health is developing a suite of purpose-driven healthcare solutions to bring medical-grade data to the forefront of wearables. Featuring modern and flexible form factors, Movano Health's devices offer an innovative approach to delivering trusted data to both customers and enterprises, capturing a comprehensive picture of an individual's health data and uniquely translating it into personalized and intelligent insights.

West Fraser and Mercer Announce Dissolution of Cariboo Pulp and Paper Joint Venture,2024-04-02T21:00:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"West Fraser Timber Co.  and Mercer International Inc. have agreed to dissolve their 50/50 joint venture in Cariboo Pulp and Paper. West Fraser will become the sole owner/operator of the mill, ensuring continuity for the workforce and business operations.","West Fraser and Mercer Announce Dissolution of Cariboo Pulp and Paper Joint Venture Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary West Fraser Timber Co. and Mercer International Inc. have agreed to dissolve their 50/50 joint venture in Cariboo Pulp and Paper. West Fraser will become the sole owner/operator of the mill, ensuring continuity for the workforce and business operations. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The dissolution of the joint venture between West Fraser Timber Co. Ltd. and Mercer International Inc. signals a strategic realignment for both companies, with West Fraser consolidating its operations and Mercer focusing on core interests. From a market perspective, this move could be interpreted as West Fraser's commitment to strengthen its position in the Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft (NBSK) pulp market. The NBSK pulp is a premium product and the demand for high-quality pulp could be a driver for West Fraser's revenue, especially considering the mill's significant production capacity and the number of employees it supports.For Mercer, the decision to exit the joint venture and focus on strategic priorities may streamline operations and improve capital allocation. The mention of redeploying resources suggests a potential for future growth initiatives or investments in core areas. Investors should monitor Mercer's upcoming financial statements for the non-cash impairment and how it affects their balance sheet, as well as any strategic moves that could enhance shareholder value in the long term. Financial Analyst The termination of the joint venture without any payable termination fees is a relatively clean break for both West Fraser and Mercer, which could be favorable for their financial health. For West Fraser, being the sole owner of Cariboo Pulp and Paper may lead to greater operational efficiency and potential cost savings. It's important to consider how this increased control over production and supply chain could impact West Fraser's margins and profitability.On Mercer's side, the lack of termination fees means there's no immediate cash outflow, but the non-cash impairment they expect to recognize could impact their earnings in the short term. Investors should assess the magnitude of this impairment and its effect on Mercer's financial ratios. This event could also prompt a reevaluation of Mercer's stock by investors, depending on the perceived impact of the dissolution on the company's future performance. Industry Analyst The pulp and paper industry is subject to global demand fluctuations and companies within the sector are constantly adapting to market conditions. The operational change for Cariboo Pulp and Paper could be seen as a strategic move to adapt to these conditions. The industry is also facing increasing environmental scrutiny and companies like West Fraser may benefit from streamlined operations that allow for better implementation of sustainable practices. With nearly 300 employees, the mill is a significant employer in Quesnel and West Fraser's commitment might be seen as a stabilizing factor for the local economy.For industry stakeholders, this development could indicate a potential shift in the competitive landscape. With West Fraser taking full control, it might be able to respond more agilely to market demands. This could lead to an increased market share or enable the company to set a benchmark for product quality within the industry, potentially affecting pricing and competitive dynamics. 04/02/2024 - 05:00 PM VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- West Fraser Timber Co. Ltd. (""West Fraser"") (TSX and NYSE: WFG) and Mercer International Inc. (""Mercer"") (NASDAQ: MERC) announced today an agreement to dissolve their 50/50 joint venture in Cariboo Pulp and Paper. West Fraser will continue as the sole owner/operator of the mill, doing business as Cariboo Pulp and Paper Company. Located in Quesnel, British Columbia, Cariboo Pulp and Paper has the capacity to produce up to 340,000 tonnes of high-quality Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft (NBSK) pulp annually, employing nearly 300 people. “Cariboo Pulp is an important member of the West Fraser family of mills,"" said Sean McLaren, West Fraser's President & CEO. ""This agreement better positions West Fraser to support the mill and provides ongoing certainty to our talented workforce."" Commenting on the agreement, Juan Carlos Bueno, Mercer CEO, said: ""We acquired our non-core interest in Cariboo Pulp as a result of our acquisition of the Mercer Peace River mill in 2018. After reviewing this asset in light of our strategic priorities, we determined that this dissolution will allow us to redeploy and direct resources to areas that are better aligned with our long-term focus."" No termination or other amounts are payable by either company in connection with the termination of the joint venture. Mercer will retain certain finished product inventory in connection with the transaction. Mercer expects to recognize a non-cash impairment in the first quarter in connection with the dissolution of the joint venture, based on the net carrying value of such interest. Cariboo Pulp and Paper is a pillar of the Quesnel forestry community and has been in operation since 1972.

CN files Shelf Prospectus Qualifying the Issuance of Debt Securities,2024-04-02T21:00:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"CN (NYSE: CNI) files shelf prospectus for potential debt securities issuance in Canadian and U.S. markets, aiming to raise funds for various corporate purposes.","CN files Shelf Prospectus Qualifying the Issuance of Debt Securities Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary CN (NYSE: CNI) files shelf prospectus for potential debt securities issuance in Canadian and U.S. markets, aiming to raise funds for various corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by CN of filing a shelf prospectus and a registration statement signifies the company's strategic move to ensure flexibility in capital raising over the next 25 months. This approach allows CN to issue debt securities swiftly in response to favorable market conditions without the need for a separate filing for each issuance. The potential use of proceeds for general corporate purposes, including debt refinancing, share repurchases and acquisitions, suggests a proactive capital management strategy aimed at optimizing the company's balance sheet and enhancing shareholder value.Investors should note that the timing and the size of any debt issuances will be contingent on market conditions. The availability of this financing channel may be viewed positively as it provides CN with the means to act quickly on various business opportunities or to manage its debt profile more effectively. However, the impact on the company's leverage and interest expenses will depend on the terms of the debt issued and the use of proceeds. This move is relatively common among large corporations seeking financial agility, although it is essential to monitor the company's debt levels and the purposes for which the debt is deployed. Market Research Analyst In the context of the broader market, CN's decision to file a shelf prospectus could be indicative of an anticipation of favorable borrowing conditions or an upcoming need for substantial capital. Given CN's position within the transportation sector, the ability to raise capital efficiently could be particularly important in an industry that is capital-intensive and may be facing competitive pressures or opportunities for consolidation.Market participants might interpret this move as a signal of CN's confidence in its future prospects and its commitment to maintaining or enhancing its competitive position. The potential for share repurchases can be appealing to investors as it often leads to an increase in earnings per share and can be a sign of management's belief in the company's undervaluation. Conversely, the market may also scrutinize the company's acquisition strategy to ensure that any potential acquisitions are accretive to earnings and strategically sound. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the filing of a shelf prospectus and registration statement is a routine regulatory requirement for companies like CN that intend to offer securities to the public. It is important for investors to understand that the registration statement must become effective before any securities can be sold. Additionally, the legal stipulation that securities may not be sold in jurisdictions where it would be unlawful without proper registration or qualification is a standard investor protection mechanism.Investors should be aware that the details included in the prospectus, such as the terms of the securities, associated risks and the company's financial statements, will provide valuable information for evaluating the potential investment. It is also noteworthy that CN has made the prospectus available on both Canadian and U.S. regulatory websites, reflecting the dual-listed nature of the company and its compliance with cross-border securities regulations. 04/02/2024 - 05:00 PM MONTREAL, April 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CN (TSX: CNR) (NYSE: CNI) announced today that it has filed a shelf prospectus with Canadian securities regulators and a registration statement with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), pursuant to which CN may issue debt securities in Canadian and U.S. markets over the next 25 months. CN expects to use net proceeds from the sale of debt securities under the shelf prospectus for general corporate purposes, which may include the redemption and refinancing of outstanding indebtedness, share repurchases, acquisitions and other business opportunities. A registration statement relating to these securities has been filed with the SEC but has not yet become effective. These securities may not be sold nor may offers to buy be accepted prior to the time the registration statement becomes effective. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the securities, nor shall there be any sale of the securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.

Movano Health's CEO, John Mastrototaro, highlights the significance of this investment in advancing the company's innovative healthcare data delivery approach. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The private placement conducted by Movano Health can be considered a strategic financial maneuver, indicative of the company's efforts to secure a robust financial runway. The participation of a tier-1 medical device company as a strategic investor suggests a vote of confidence in Movano Health's market potential and technology. The $24 million raised, supplemented by the company's existing cash reserves, projects an operational solvency extending into 2025. This financial buffer may reassure investors of the company's stability and its capacity to sustain R&D and market expansion without immediate pressure to secure additional funds.Furthermore, the terms of the placement reveal a unit price of $0.533, with the common stock and warrants priced at $0.4071 and $0.125 respectively. The pricing strategy reflects the current valuation Movano Health and its investors agree upon, which is important for potential future investors evaluating the company's stock. The immediate exercisability of the warrants could lead to future dilution of shares, but also represents a potential for additional capital influx if the company's stock performs well. Healthcare Industry Analyst The strategic investment from a leading medical device company into Movano Health underscores the growing interest in health technology, particularly in the wearable medical device sector. Movano Health's focus on delivering medical-grade data to consumers and enterprises aligns with the industry's shift towards personalized healthcare and preventive medicine. The capital infusion is likely to expedite the development of Movano's proprietary technologies, which could position the company as a key player in the competitive landscape of healthcare solutions.By examining the broader industry context, Movano Health's partnership with an established medical device entity may facilitate future collaborations, potentially expanding its market reach and enhancing product credibility. The investment also reflects a trend where traditional medical device firms are increasingly engaging with innovative startups to stay at the forefront of technological advancements and meet evolving consumer demands. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the announcement of Movano Health's private placement and the associated strategic investment could influence investor perceptions and stock market performance. The involvement of Movano Health's management and board members in the investment round demonstrates internal confidence in the company's direction and may positively impact investor sentiment. This internal investment can often be interpreted as a strong signal of commitment to the company's future success.Additionally, the announcement of the private placement in conjunction with the forthcoming quarterly results release could create anticipatory effects in the market. Investors may scrutinize the forthcoming financial results for indications of the company's operational efficiency and growth trajectory, which could influence stock volatility in the short term. Long-term, the capital raised through this placement could enable Movano Health to achieve key milestones that may drive further market value. 04/02/2024 - 05:01 PM Financing included a strategic seed investment by a tier-1 multi-billion dollar medical device company and participation from members of Movano Health's management team and board of directors Hosting conference call on April 4, 2024 at 2:00 PM PT/5:00 PM ET PLEASANTON, Calif., April 2, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Movano Health (Nasdaq: MOVE), a pioneer in health technology, today has agreed to sell approximately 45 million units in a $24 million private placement, with each unit consisting of one share of the Company's common stock (or pre-funded warrant in lieu thereof) and one warrant to purchase a share of common stock, to a select group of investors that includes a tier-one multi-billion dollar medical device company, institutional and accredited investors, and members of the Company's management team and board of directors.

(NYSE: ECVT) (""Ecovyst"" or the ""Company""), a leading integrated and innovative global provider of advanced materials, specialty catalysts and services, today announced that it has recognized three outstanding teams with the Company's 2023 Sustainability Leadership Awards. The award winners, which were selected by Chief Executive Officer Kurt J. Bitting and members of the executive management team, are the Ecoservices Hammond, Indiana site for the most impactful Climate Change Reduction Project, the Conshohocken, Pennsylvania Zeolyst International team for the Best New Sustainable Product and/or Process, and the Ecoservices Martinez, California site for the Most Impactful Social Contribution, during 2023. ""We are proud of all the sustainability efforts undertaken by our Advanced Materials & Catalysts and Ecoservices business units throughout 2023, some of which were highlighted in seventeen applications received and reviewed for these awards,"" said Mr. Bitting. ""As part of our sustainability focus, this is the second year that Ecovyst has conducted the Sustainability Leadership Award program to recognize Ecovyst sites, work teams, or individual employees that demonstrate meaningful sustainability improvements in the areas of climate change reduction, product/process innovation, and social engagement."" To qualify for the awards, detailed applications were submitted describing particular projects and the resulting sustainability improvements. From the many impressive projects, the following projects or teams were selected as the 2023 Sustainability Award Recipients: Ecovyst Environmental Initiative Award for the Most Impactful Climate Change Reduction Project – The Ecoservices Hammond site for reducing water and chemical solution consumption through its demineralization project and management system improvements for resin regeneration. In 2023, approximately 4,530,000 gallons of water (which roughly equates to the annual water usage of over 40 American homes), 101 tons of 93% acid, 95 tons of 50% NaOH caustic solution, and 60 dry tons of Mg(OH)2 were conserved during regeneration cycles, and the resultant, less frequent resin replacements yielded approximately 1,350 gallons of waste minimization in 2023. Ecovyst Sustainable Innovation Award for the Best New Sustainable Product and/or Process – The Conshohocken Zeolyst International team for developing an innovative product for use in Renewable Diesel (RD) and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production to meet the growing demand for reducing transportation carbon footprints. The carbon footprint of RD and SAF from waste cooking oil is more than 80% lower than when produced from crude oil. Biomass conversion to ethanol and then to jet fuel can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60-80% compared with petroleum-based fuels. RD and SAF are produced from renewable sources such as plant-based oils, animal fat, waste cooking oil, or biomass. RD and SAF production units have been built globally, and a significant new demand for zeolite catalysts has emerged. The Conshohocken Zeolyst team plays a key role in meeting this worldwide demand. Ecovyst Community Impact Award for the Most Impactful Social Contribution – The Ecoservices Martinez site for leveraging community engagement with an emphasis on participation and relationship building through the Community Advisory Panel (CAP) founded in 1992. The Site also maintained exceptional community relationships with various other industry coalitions, community-based organizations, and charitable organizations, including the Martinez Community Foundation and Chamber of Commerce. Specifically, the Martinez site participated in numerous community events, including the 5K Run for Education and Cars 4 Community, and supported various youth initiatives, including the Yacht Club Sea Scouts and local sports programs. Significant contributions were made over 2023 to health and safety, economic development, and sustainable growth in the Martinez area. As reinforced by testimonials from community leaders, government officials, local businesses, and neighboring citizens, the Site's continuous collaboration with the CAP and other organizations has created lasting social impact and positive change by making the community more inclusive, safer, and more resilient. We congratulate these award recipients for their leadership in supporting our sustainability goals and proudly thank all our applicants and employees who demonstrate their commitment to sustainability on a daily basis.

Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The initiation of a tender offer by Virtus Total Return Fund Inc. to acquire up to 10% of its outstanding shares for cash at a price slightly below the net asset value (NAV) is a strategic move that can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, this could signify that the management believes the shares are undervalued and is therefore looking to provide liquidity to shareholders at a near-NAV rate, which could potentially increase the earnings per share (EPS) for remaining shareholders if executed below intrinsic value. On the other hand, it might indicate a desire to return capital to shareholders in a period where the Fund might not have better investment opportunities.From a market perspective, such tender offers often lead to a short-term uptick in the stock price as they provide a floor price for the shares. However, investors should be aware that purchasing shares at 98% of NAV could also be seen as a signal that the Fund's assets are not expected to appreciate significantly in the near term. This action can affect investor sentiment and could lead to a reevaluation of the Fund's long-term growth prospects. Financial Analyst When analyzing the financial implications of the tender offer, it is important to consider the impact on the Fund's capital structure and shareholder value. By reducing the number of outstanding shares, the offer could improve return metrics such as return on equity (ROE) and could be accretive to the NAV per share for the remaining shareholders. However, it is critical to evaluate the Fund's balance sheet strength and liquidity position, as the cash outlay for this tender offer will reduce the cash reserves of the Fund.Additionally, the offer price being set at 98% of NAV might be attractive to shareholders looking for immediate liquidity, but it also represents a discount to the NAV, which might not be appealing to all investors. Those who perceive the Fund's long-term value to be higher might refrain from tendering their shares, leading to a potential self-selection bias in the tendering process. 04/02/2024 - 04:43 PM HARTFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Virtus Total Return Fund Inc.

Targeted path towards becoming the world's second-largest foundry by 2030. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Intel's announcement of a new financial reporting structure is a strategic move aimed at enhancing transparency and accountability. By aligning financial results with its foundry operating model, Intel is signaling a commitment to cost discipline and shareholder value creation. The establishment of Intel Foundry as a separate segment underscores the company's focus on becoming a major player in the foundry services market, competing with the likes of TSMC and Samsung.Intel's shift towards a foundry model is reflective of the broader industry trend where companies are increasingly outsourcing their manufacturing needs to specialized foundries. This transition could potentially open up new revenue streams for Intel, as it seeks to leverage its manufacturing prowess to attract external customers. Additionally, setting aggressive non-GAAP gross and operating margin targets for 2030 indicates Intel's confidence in the profitability of this strategic pivot.However, investors should monitor the execution of this transition closely. The foundry business is capital intensive with high entry barriers and Intel's success will depend on its ability to achieve process parity and leadership, especially as it aims to become the world's second-largest foundry by 2030. The targeted operating losses peak in 2024 highlights the near-term financial burden as the company scales its foundry operations. Financial Analyst Intel's recasting of its operating segment financial results dating back to 2021 offers investors a clearer picture of the company's financial trajectory under the new operating model. This level of retrospective transparency is helpful in assessing the effectiveness of Intel's strategic shifts and the potential return on investment. The appointment of experienced CFOs for both Intel Foundry and Intel Products is a positive sign of Intel’s commitment to the financial rigor of each unit.The financial targets set for 2030, including a non-GAAP gross margin of 60% and an operating margin of 40%, are ambitious. Achieving such margins would be a significant improvement over current levels and could signal strong operational efficiency and product competitiveness. However, it's important to note that non-GAAP measures exclude certain costs that are real and can affect the company's cash flow. Investors should take a holistic view of Intel's financial health, including both GAAP and non-GAAP measures.Moreover, the expected peak in operating losses for Intel Foundry in 2024 is a critical factor to consider. While it may weigh on short-term profitability, the long-term outlook is predicated on the assumption of increased demand for Intel's foundry services and successful execution of its advanced packaging business. Given the historically cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, these projections should be considered within the context of broader market conditions. Technology Industry Analyst Intel's differentiation strategy as both a semiconductor manufacturer and a technology provider is a unique approach that could potentially create a competitive advantage. The company's focus on AI Everywhere and the establishment of the world's first systems foundry for the AI era is indicative of its intent to lead in high-growth areas. This could position Intel favorably as AI and machine learning applications continue to expand across various industries.The new reporting segments, including Client Computing, Data Center and AI and Network and Edge, reflect the company's strategic priorities and growth areas. The separation of Altera into a standalone business suggests a more focused approach to capitalizing on the opportunities in programmable solutions.However, the semiconductor industry is known for rapid technological advancements and intense competition. Intel's ability to maintain technological leadership, particularly in EUV lithography, will be essential for the success of its foundry business. Additionally, the reliance on non-GAAP measures to communicate financial targets may raise questions about the underlying assumptions and the exclusion of certain costs.Investors should also consider the potential risks associated with the foundry business, such as the need for continuous capital investments, the challenge of attracting and retaining external customers and the impact of geopolitical tensions on the global supply chain. 04/02/2024 - 04:05 PM New financial reporting structure reflects Intel’s transition to a foundry operating model to drive greater transparency, cost savings and growth. SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Intel Corporation today outlined a new financial reporting structure that is aligned with the company’s previously announced foundry operating model for 2024 and beyond. This new structure is designed to drive increased cost discipline and higher returns by providing greater transparency, accountability and incentives across the business. To support the new structure, Intel provided recast operating segment financial results for the years 2023, 2022 and 2021. The company also shared a targeted path toward long-term growth and profitability of Intel Foundry, as well as clear goals for driving financial performance improvement and shareholder value creation. “Intel’s differentiated position as both a world-class semiconductor manufacturer and a fabless technology leader creates significant opportunities to drive long-term sustainable growth across these two complementary businesses,” said Pat Gelsinger, Intel CEO. “Implementing this new model marks a key achievement in our IDM 2.0 transformation as we hone our execution engine, stand up the industry’s first and only systems foundry with geographically diverse leading-edge manufacturing capacity, and advance our mission to bring AI Everywhere.” The new operating model establishes a foundry relationship between Intel Foundry, the company’s manufacturing organization, and Intel Products, comprised of the company’s product business units. Launched at its inaugural Direct Connect event in February, Intel Foundry is the world’s first systems foundry for the AI era, offering full-stack optimization from the factory network to software. The combination of Intel’s world-class foundry and product capabilities will leverage a more resilient, sustainable and secure source of supply while delivering cutting-edge solutions to customers through continuous technology improvements, reference designs and new standards. New Reporting Structure Beginning with the first quarter 2024, the company will present segment results aligned to the following operating segments: Client Computing Group (CCG); Data Center and AI (DCAI); Network and Edge (NEX); Intel Foundry; Altera, an Intel Company (formerly Intel’s Programmable Solutions Group); Mobileye; and Other. CCG, DCAI and NEX will collectively be referred to as Intel Products; Altera, Mobileye and Other will collectively be referred to as All Other. Intel Foundry is a newly established operating segment that includes foundry technology development, foundry manufacturing and supply chain, and foundry services (formerly IFS). Under this new structure, Intel Foundry will recognize revenues generated from both external foundry customers and Intel Products, as well as technology development and product manufacturing costs historically allocated to Intel Products. The new Altera operating segment, which was previously reported under DCAI, follows its announced separation into a standalone business. The Form 8-K containing recast operating segment results for the years 2023, 2022 and 2021 aligned with the foundry operating model was furnished with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and posted on the company’s Investor Relations website. Dave Zinsner, Intel chief financial officer, said, “This model is designed to unlock significant cost savings, operational efficiencies and asset value. As it begins to take hold, we expect to accelerate on our path toward achieving our ambition of 60% non-GAAP gross margins and 40% non-GAAP operating margins in 2030. Ultimately, improved cost competitiveness will help us deliver process technology, product and foundry leadership while driving significant financial upside for Intel and our owners.” Clear Path to Value Unlock and Margin Expansion The transition to the new operating model is expected to enable Intel Foundry to achieve profitable growth and unlock unrealized value across Intel’s approximately $100 billion in capital assets. It will also create significant efficiency and cost savings opportunities across both Intel Foundry and Intel Products. Intel Foundry: Operating margin improvement is expected through shifting volume mix to leading-edge extreme ultraviolet (EUV) nodes as the company achieves process parity and leadership. Intel Foundry expects to drive further operating margin expansion by manufacturing a larger percentage of Intel’s products, growing its high-margin advanced packaging business, continuing to expand its external foundry business, and further focusing on capital utilization, cost efficiency and growing scale. Intel Foundry’s operating losses are expected to peak in 2024 as Intel completes its five-nodes-in-four-years journey, and the company is driving for Intel Foundry to achieve break-even operating margins midway between now and the end of 2030, when it targets 40% non-GAAP gross margins and 30% non-GAAP operating margins. Intel Foundry currently has an expected lifetime deal value with external customers of more than $15 billion and remains focused on its goal of becoming the world’s second-largest foundry by 2030. Intel Products: Intel Products already exhibits healthy operating margins today, which are expected to improve as the product operating segments benefit from the new operating model. In this model, product operating segments will have increased visibility into and be accountable for the financial drivers for their businesses. Instead of recognizing manufacturing costs that were previously allocated to the product operating segments, they will be charged a market-based price by Intel Foundry. Continued operating margin improvement is expected as the product segments build on their execution momentum with leadership products and improved pricing, drive cost optimizations in design and roadmap decisions, and realize improved costs in package, assembly and test. Intel Products targets 60% non-GAAP gross margin and 40% non-GAAP operating margin by the end of 2030. Appointment of Intel Foundry CFO As part of today’s news, Intel also announced the appointment of Lorenzo Flores as chief financial officer of Intel Foundry, effective April 8, 2024. Flores possesses nearly 30 years of financial experience in semiconductors and technology, including most recently as the chief financial officer of Xilinx. This complements the earlier appointment of Mark Henninger as the chief financial officer of Intel Products. Both will report to Zinsner. Investor Webinar Intel will host an investor webinar at 1:30 p.m. PDT today to present the vision and financial framework for the Intel Foundry business, including the recast financials and new segment reporting structure aligned with the foundry operating model. The webcast and corresponding presentation slides can be accessed on Intel's Investor Relations website at intc.com.

(Nasdaq: SILK) has launched the ENROUTE Transcarotid Neuroprotection System PLUS, enhancing the TCAR portfolio with improved features for smoother insertion, greater precision, and a simplified prep experience.

Given that the device aims to streamline the surgical workflow, it could also reduce operation times and costs for healthcare providers, which is a compelling value proposition in today's cost-conscious healthcare environment. Healthcare Market Research Analyst Carotid artery disease treatment is a niche but significant segment of the cardiovascular market. The deployment of NPS PLUS could capture additional market share for Silk Road Medical, especially if the device demonstrates a tangible benefit in terms of procedural efficiency and outcomes. Market penetration will likely depend on the company's ability to communicate these benefits to physicians and hospitals effectively.It's also essential to consider the competitive landscape. If competitors lack a comparable innovation, Silk Road Medical might gain a competitive edge. However, if competitors are close to releasing similar upgrades, the window for market impact could be narrow. The company's long-term success will hinge on its ability to maintain a pipeline of innovative products and secure insurance coverage and reimbursement, which can be a significant barrier to adoption for new medical technologies. Financial Analyst The launch of a new product like the ENROUTE NPS PLUS could be a driver for stock performance, particularly if it leads to market share gains and improved financial metrics such as margins and earnings per share. The initial market reaction will depend on the perceived value of the improvements in the NPS PLUS and the company's ability to execute a successful roll-out.Investors will be watching closely for early adoption indicators, such as partnerships with hospitals and testimonials from key opinion leaders in the vascular surgery field. Additionally, they will be interested in the impact of this product launch on the company's operating expenses, given that new product launches can be capital-intensive. Long-term, the ability of Silk Road Medical to leverage this product to drive growth will be critical in assessing the company's financial health and stock valuation. 04/02/2024 - 04:30 PM SUNNYVALE, Calif., April 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Silk Road Medical, Inc. (Nasdaq: SILK), a company focused on reducing the risk of stroke and its devastating impact, today announced the launch of its ENROUTE® Transcarotid Neuroprotection System PLUS (“NPS PLUS”), a key component of the TCAR® portfolio. This next generation device builds upon the prior ENROUTE Transcarotid Neuroprotection System to deliver smoother arterial sheath insertion, greater flow precision, and a simplified prep experience for surgical teams, all while maintaining unparalleled neuroprotection during the TCAR procedure. “With the launch of the NPS PLUS, we're thrilled to empower our TCAR-trained physicians with a solution that addresses their insights and feedback to further strengthen and streamline the TCAR procedure,” shared Chas McKhann, Chief Executive Officer of Silk Road Medical. “Our focus on new product innovation reflects our ongoing commitment to leadership in the treatment of carotid disease.” TCAR combines direct carotid artery access with robust blood flow reversal, providing neuroprotection akin to open surgical techniques in a less invasive, more patient-friendly approach to treating carotid artery disease. During TCAR, the surgical team inserts a tube-like sheath into the carotid artery and connects it to the ENROUTE Neuroprotection System, which temporarily reverses blood flow. The system filters potentially dangerous debris from the blood to reduce intraprocedural stroke risk while the team uses a TCAR-specific balloon and stent to open the artery and contain the carotid artery disease. TCAR delivers less than 1% periprocedural stroke rates and a better patient recovery experience than open surgery. “Silk Road Medical's responsiveness to our feedback has provided us with better procedure predictability and a more streamlined workflow for our entire surgical team,"" remarked Brian Peterson, MD, FACS, FSVS of St. Luke’s Heart and Vascular Institute. ""With over 500 TCAR procedures performed by our team, we view TCAR as a first-line treatment option for carotid disease and we’re excited about what these improvements mean for patient care.” Click here for more information on the ENROUTE Neuroprotection System PLUS. About TCAR with the ENROUTE Transcarotid Neuroprotection and Stent SystemTCAR (Transcarotid Artery Revascularization) is a clinically proven procedure combining surgical principles of neuroprotection with minimally invasive endovascular techniques to treat blockages in the carotid artery at risk of causing a stroke. The ENROUTE Transcarotid Stent is intended to be used in patients at high risk and standard risk for complications from CEA, in conjunction with the ENROUTE Transcarotid Neuroprotection System (NPS) during the TCAR procedure. The ENROUTE Transcarotid NPS is a first in class device used to directly access the common carotid artery and initiate high-rate temporary blood flow reversal to protect the brain from stroke while delivering and implanting the ENROUTE Transcarotid Stent.

Edible Garden Announces Reverse Stock Split of the Company’s Common Stock,2024-04-02T20:30:00.000Z,Neutral,Very Positive,Edible Garden AG Incorporated announces a planned 1-for-20 reverse stock split of its common stock to meet Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirements and improve marketability.,"Edible Garden Announces Reverse Stock Split of the Company’s Common Stock Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags stock split Rhea-AI Summary Edible Garden AG Incorporated announces a planned 1-for-20 reverse stock split of its common stock to meet Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirements and improve marketability. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst A reverse stock split, such as the one Edible Garden is implementing, typically indicates an effort to boost the stock's market price and ensure compliance with exchange listing requirements. In this case, the 1-for-20 ratio suggests a significant consolidation of shares to prop up the price. From a financial perspective, while the market capitalization remains unaffected, the liquidity of the stock may decrease as the number of shares in circulation is reduced.Investors should note that while the percentage ownership remains the same, the market's perception of such a move can vary. Some may view it positively, as it could avoid delisting from a major exchange like Nasdaq, while others may interpret it as a sign of underlying issues within the company. Furthermore, the adjustment to warrants and equity awards will maintain their value, but the attractiveness of these instruments could be impacted by the stock's performance post-split. Market Research Analyst In the context of controlled environment agriculture (CEA), Edible Garden's reverse stock split reflects broader industry trends where companies are striving for financial stability and investor appeal. The CEA sector is capital-intensive and a higher share price post-split may improve perceptions of financial health and potentially attract institutional investors.However, the effectiveness of reverse splits in the long term is debatable. Companies in this industry need to balance financial engineering with operational success. Stakeholders should look beyond the reverse split and focus on Edible Garden's ability to innovate, manage costs and maintain sustainable growth in a competitive market. The true test will be the company's subsequent financial performance and ability to leverage its position in organic and sustainable produce. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the reverse stock split follows shareholder approval and board discretion within the previously agreed range, showcasing proper corporate governance. The unchanged par value and the proportionate adjustment of warrants and equity awards are standard procedures to maintain equity value and contractual obligations.Investors should be aware of the legal implications of fractional share rounding, which can lead to minor changes in total outstanding shares. Additionally, the new CUSIP number is a routine update reflecting changes in the capital structure. These legal formalities, while often viewed as procedural, are critical for ensuring transparency and regulatory compliance. 04/02/2024 - 04:30 PM BELVIDERE, NJ, April 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Edible Garden AG Incorporated (“Edible Garden” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: EDBL, EDBLW), a leader in controlled environment agriculture (CEA), locally grown, organic and sustainable produce and products, today announced a planned reverse stock split of its shares of common stock at a ratio of 1-for-20.

At the Company’s special meeting of stockholders held November 6, 2023, stockholders approved an amendment to the Company’s certificate of incorporation to implement a reverse stock split in a range of 1-for-5 to 1-for-50, and granted the board of directors the authority to implement and determine the exact split ratio within such range, which was subsequently set by the board at 1-for-20. Following the reverse stock split, the new CUSIP number of the common stock will be 28059P303, with the par value per share of common stock remaining at $0.0001. A proportionate adjustment will be made to the per-share exercise prices and number of shares issuable under all outstanding warrants and equity awards. Jim Kras, CEO of Edible Garden, commented, “The reverse split is being implemented because we believe it will allow us to meet Nasdaq’s minimum bid price requirements, among other listing requirements. We also believe that the increased market price of the common stock that is expected as a result of implementing the reverse stock split could improve the marketability of the Company’s shares.” When the reverse stock split becomes effective, every 20 shares of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock will be combined into one share of common stock. Each stockholder’s percentage ownership interest in Edible Garden will remain unchanged after the reverse stock split. Any fractional shares resulting from the reverse stock split will be rounded up to the nearest whole share of common stock. The reverse stock split will not reduce the number of authorized shares of common stock.

The company secured new distribution agreements, expanded its dealer network, and partnered with ADASTEC for an automated Vicinity Lighting EV transit bus. Revenue increased to $19.1M for the full year 2023, with a gross profit of $2.1M. However, the net loss for Q4 2023 was $9.1M, with an adjusted EBITDA loss of $3.2M. Positive None. Negative Net loss increased to $9.1 million in Q4 2023, compared to $3.8 million in Q4 2022. Cash used in operating activities rose to $5.7 million in Q4 2023, compared to $3.9 million in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA loss was $3.2 million in Q4 2023, higher than $1.4 million in Q4 2022. Market Research Analyst The reported revenue of $5.1 million from Vicinity Motor Corp. for Q4 2023, primarily from the sale of 11 Vicinity Classic transit buses, represents a substantial increase from the $2.0 million reported in Q4 2022. This growth is a positive signal to the market, indicating that the company's strategic focus on electric vehicles (EVs) is beginning to bear fruit, especially considering the order backlog of over $125 million with 75% attributed to EVs. The company's efforts to secure new dealership agreements and government incentives, such as the Écocamionnage Program, highlight a proactive approach to capitalizing on the shift towards sustainable transportation.However, the net loss widening to $9.1 million in Q4 2023 from $3.8 million in the same period last year raises concerns. Despite the growing sales funnel and backlog, the increased net loss could reflect underlying challenges in scaling operations and managing costs. Investors will be paying close attention to how the company plans to address these challenges and convert its backlog into profitable revenue streams. Financial Analyst While Vicinity Motor Corp.'s gross profit margin improvement in 2023 to 11% from 2% in the previous year indicates better cost management and a favorable product mix shift towards higher-margin electric trucks, the company's increased cash used in operating activities—$24.7 million for the year compared to $9.1 million in 2022—suggests a higher cash burn rate. This situation, coupled with a modest cash and cash equivalents position of $2.0 million as of December 31, 2023, may raise liquidity concerns.The company's strategic partnerships, such as the one with ADASTEC for the development of the SAE Level-4 automated Vicinity Autonomous Lightning EV, are innovative moves that could position Vicinity as a leader in automated EV solutions. However, the financial viability and market acceptance of these advanced technologies remain to be seen. Investors should monitor the company's ability to convert its technological advancements and strategic partnerships into profitable ventures. Automotive Industry Analyst The shift towards electric and automated vehicles in the commercial sector is a key trend and Vicinity Motor Corp.'s focus on this market is strategically aligned with industry direction. The partnership with ADASTEC to develop an SAE Level-4 automated Vicinity Lightning EV transit bus is particularly noteworthy, as it places the company at the forefront of innovation in the North American market.However, the commercial EV market is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological advancements. The success of Vicinity's EV lineup, including the newly developed autonomous bus, will depend on the company's ability to deliver reliable and cost-effective products that meet the needs of fleet operators. As government incentives continue to support the adoption of EVs, the company's inclusion in incentive programs like the Écocamionnage Program could provide a competitive edge. Yet, the long-term success will also hinge on the company's ability to manage production costs and improve operational efficiency. 04/02/2024 - 04:20 PM Q4 2023 Deliveries of 11 Vicinity™ Classic Transit Buses Generate $5.1M in RevenueVANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / April 2, 2024 / Vicinity Motor Corp. (NASDAQ:VEV)(TSXV:VMC) (""Vicinity"" or the ""Company""), a North American supplier of commercial electric vehicles, today reported its financial and operational results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023.Fourth Quarter 2023 and Subsequent Operational HighlightsOrder backlog as of December 31, 2023 exceeded $125 million, of which electric vehicles accounted for over 75%.Revenue increased to $5.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily driven by the sale of 11 Vicinity™ Classic transit buses.Invoiced 71 EV trucks to dealers in December of 2023, which were not recognized as revenue in 2023 results, with upfitting of boxes and delivery of trucks scheduled in 2024.Secured four (4) new VMC 1200 distribution agreements to establish new dealerships in strategic markets across Canada, including two (2) new dealerships in Ontario, one (1) new dealership in Quebec, and one (1) new dealership in Alberta.Secured new orders for twenty (20) Vicinity™ Classic Clean Diesel Buses from Autobus La Québécoise for delivery in 2024 in Quebec, Canada.Partnered with automated driving software platform provider ADASTEC to create an SAE Level-4 automated Vicinity Lighting EV transit bus (the Vicinity Autonomous Lightning EV) for the North American market, signing agreements to deploy a vehicle at both Michigan State University and the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus in mid-2024.Management Commentary""The fourth quarter of 2023 demonstrated an increasing pace of operational execution and a growing cadence of sales momentum across all of our product lines with the invoicing of 71 VMC 1200 electric trucks for delivery in 2024 and the successful delivery of 11 Vicinity™ Classic transit buses to our eager customer base,"" said William Trainer, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Vicinity Motor Corp. ""To enable this growth, we remain highly focused on the ongoing buildout of our North American VMC 1200 dealer network, adding four new partners in recent months. Each partner has exceptional experience and expertise in their respective regions, making them well suited to help fleet operators seamlessly transition to an all-electric future and expand VMC 1200 sales and service coverage in strategic markets across Canada.""The VMC 1200 provides an ideal entry into the underserved commercial EV market for dealerships, with an extremely attractive price point that is further reduced through Canadian federal and provincial rebates. For example, we were recently approved by the Quebec Ministry of Transport and Sustainable Mobility in Canada for the VMC 1200 to be included in its Écocamionnage Program to incentivize the electrification of the commercial freight and heavy vehicle transportation industry. This CAD$85,000 incentive represents an exciting opportunity to attract attention and lower costs for new buyers who are considering making the transition to EVs.""We also continued to seek new partners and opportunities for the forthcoming Vicinity Lighting EV transit bus. During the fourth quarter of 2023 we partnered with automated driving software platform provider ADASTEC to create an SAE Level-4 automated Vicinity Lighting EV transit bus - the Vicinity Autonomous Lightning EV - for the North American market. This innovative new commercial partnership brings together our expertise in transit buses with ADASTEC's SAE Level-4 automated driving software platform. The collaboration is set to be the first of its kind in North America, marking a substantial leap in the realm of transportation, with a strong emphasis on automated, connected, and shared solutions - driving innovation, accessibility, and sustainability. We have signed agreements with Michigan State University and the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus to deploy initial Vicinity Autonomous Lightning Electric transit buses in the second quarter of 2024.""During the fourth quarter, our transit bus business continued to provide a solid recurring customer base, with strong order momentum for the Vicinity™ Classic transit bus. A new purchase order from Autobus La Québécoise for Vicinity™ Classic buses to service the City of Joliette, Quebec, and a follow-on purchase order to service the cities of La Prairie, Candiac, Saint-Philippe, Delson, Saint-Constant and Sainte-Catherine in Quebec once again demonstrated our position as the market leader in the Canadian mid-sized heavy-duty segment. Our transit buses will continue to play an important role in our backlog, providing an important pillar while we concurrently grow our electric vehicle business.""Looking ahead, with a growing sales funnel and strong backlog - which exceeded $125 million as of December 31, 2023 - we are laying the foundation for future success. The increasing adoption of commercial EVs is being driven by government incentives, corporate sustainability goals and declining cost of ownership - with our EV lineup and growing dealer network capitalizing on this transition to be the commercial EV supplier of choice for many. I look forward to providing additional updates in the months to come as we strive to create sustainable, long-term value for my fellow shareholders,"" concluded Trainer.Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial ResultsAll figures stated in this press release are in U.S. dollars unless stated otherwise.Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 increased to $5.1 million, as compared to $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022.

Diversified Healthcare Trust Provides Monthly SHOP Performance Update,2024-04-02T20:15:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Diversified Healthcare Trust (DHC) reports on its Senior Housing Operating Portfolio (SHOP) segment performance for February 2024, showing an increase in occupancy rates and revenue compared to the previous year. However, there are slight decreases in certain metrics from January 2024.","Diversified Healthcare Trust Provides Monthly SHOP Performance Update Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Diversified Healthcare Trust (DHC) reports on its Senior Housing Operating Portfolio (SHOP) segment performance for February 2024, showing an increase in occupancy rates and revenue compared to the previous year. However, there are slight decreases in certain metrics from January 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The update from Diversified Healthcare Trust (DHC) on its Senior Housing Operating Portfolio (SHOP) segment's performance provides a mixed picture. While the occupancy rate slightly declined by 10 basis points month-over-month, it's important to note the yearly increase of 190 basis points. This suggests a steady recovery in the senior housing market, which had been previously affected by the pandemic. The modest dip in Resident Fees and Services revenue by 0.4% from the previous month is not particularly alarming, especially considering the 9.9% year-over-year growth. The main takeaway here is the resilience and potential growth trajectory in the senior housing sector, which investors should watch for its long-term implications on DHC's revenue stability and growth.Moreover, the significant 38.7% month-over-month increase in net operating income (NOI) and the improvement in NOI margin by 280 basis points from January 2024, are indicators of effective cost management and operational efficiency. These improvements in margins are essential for the company's profitability, especially in the face of inflationary pressures that have increased operating expenses year over year. Investors should appreciate DHC's ability to manage expenses and maintain profitability margins in such an economic environment. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the reported figures indicate DHC's adeptness in navigating short-term fluctuations while maintaining a positive year-over-year growth trend. The 9.9% increase in Resident Fees and Services revenue compared to February 2023 is a robust sign of the company's ability to raise rental and care rates effectively. However, the slight decrease in revenue from January 2024 could be attributed to the shorter month, which is a seasonal factor and not indicative of underlying business issues.Investors should also consider the increase in property operating expenses, driven by inflationary effects on wages and utilities, as well as higher property insurance premiums. While DHC has managed to improve its NOI margin, the rising costs are a concern that needs monitoring for future sustainability. The financial health of DHC, particularly within the SHOP segment, seems to be on a positive trajectory, but it's imperative to keep an eye on how they balance revenue growth with the rising costs of operation. Real Estate Investment Trust Analyst When evaluating DHC's performance, it's important to understand the nuances of the real estate investment trust (REIT) industry. The SHOP segment's performance is a critical factor for DHC, as senior housing is a core investment area for the trust. The reported increase in NOI is a positive sign for investors, as it reflects the potential for steady cash flows, which are vital for the trust's ability to pay out dividends. The NOI margin's year-over-year improvement, albeit slight, is a testament to the trust's operational efficiency.The change in methodology for calculating the average monthly rate, now based on the exact number of days in the month, aligns the revenue recognition with occupancy rates, providing a more accurate reflection of the property's performance. While other REITs may calculate NOI differently, DHC's approach offers transparency and comparability for investors. The detailed breakdown of operating expenses and revenue streams in the report allows for a better assessment of the trust's performance and potential risks associated with the senior housing market. 04/02/2024 - 04:15 PM NEWTON, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Diversified Healthcare Trust (Nasdaq: DHC) today provided an update regarding the recent performance of its Senior Housing Operating Portfolio, or SHOP, segment. Monthly Unaudited Results in DHC’s Total SHOP Properties: February 2024 occupancy was 78.9%, a decrease of 10 basis points from January 2024, and 190 basis points higher than February 2023. February 2024 Resident Fees and Services revenue was $102.3 million, a decrease of $0.4 million, or 0.4%, from January 2024, and higher by $9.2 million, or 9.9%, compared to February 2023. February 2024 net operating income, or NOI, was $10.1 million, an increase of $2.8 million, or 38.7%, from January 2024, and higher by $1.2 million, or 12.9%, compared to February 2023. February 2024 NOI margin was 9.9%, 280 basis points above January 2024, and 30 basis points above February 2023. February 2024 total SHOP revenues decreased slightly from the prior month due to a decrease in skilled nursing revenue as a result of two fewer days in February. Year over year, total SHOP revenues increased 9.9% primarily due to increases in rental and care rates, partially offset by higher discounts and lower community fees. February 2024 total SHOP operating expenses decreased 3.4% from the prior month, which was driven by a decrease in labor expenses as a result of two fewer days in February. Year over year, total SHOP operating expenses increased primarily due to the inflationary effects related to higher wages and utilities as well as higher property insurance premiums in select markets.

Because the quarterly financial close process and review for these periods is not yet complete, DHC’s final results upon completion of its quarterly close process and review may vary from these preliminary estimates. (2) Previously, average monthly rate was calculated as average daily rate (revenue divided by occupied days) multiplied by 30 days. Retroactively to January 2023, we are now calculating the average monthly rate as the average daily rate multiplied by the exact number of days in the month. This change in methodology is now largely consistent with changes in revenue and occupancy as they are based on the same time period. (3) The calculation of NOI shown excludes certain components of net income (loss) in order to provide results that are more closely related to DHC's property level results of operations. DHC defines NOI as income from its real estate less its property operating expenses. NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions that DHC records as depreciation and amortization. DHC uses NOI to evaluate individual and company-wide property level performance. Other real estate companies and real estate investment trusts, or REITs, may calculate NOI differently than DHC does.

WSC's $15 million sales in 2023 are expected to boost Curtiss-Wright's earnings and free cash flow. The acquisition aligns with Curtiss-Wright's focus on advanced nuclear technologies and supports long-term growth objectives.","Curtiss-Wright Completes Acquisition of WSC, Inc. Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Curtiss-Wright acquires WSC, Inc. for $34 million, enhancing its portfolio with state-of-the-art simulation technology for nuclear power plants. WSC's $15 million sales in 2023 are expected to boost Curtiss-Wright's earnings and free cash flow. The acquisition aligns with Curtiss-Wright's focus on advanced nuclear technologies and supports long-term growth objectives. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of WSC, Inc. by Curtiss-Wright Corporation represents a strategic expansion within the power generation and naval sectors. The transaction, valued at approximately $34 million, is not just a capital allocation but a step towards enhancing Curtiss-Wright's product offerings in nuclear simulation technology. The deal is expected to be accretive to Curtiss-Wright's earnings, which is a key indicator for investors as it suggests potential for increased profitability.WSC's simulation and digital twin capabilities are particularly noteworthy as they align with industry trends towards digitalization and optimization of power plant operations. This technology is critical in reducing risks and costs associated with the commissioning and operation of nuclear plants. The mention of a free cash flow conversion rate in excess of 100% is significant, indicating efficient operations and the potential for shareholder returns through dividends or share buybacks.Furthermore, WSC's involvement with TerraPower and its contract to support the Natrium reactor project underlines the relevance of WSC's technology in the development of Advanced Small Modular Reactors (ASMRs), a growing area in the nuclear industry. This could position Curtiss-Wright favorably in a niche but expanding market, potentially leading to long-term growth opportunities. Financial Analyst When evaluating the financial implications of Curtiss-Wright's acquisition of WSC, it is important to consider both the short-term and long-term perspectives. In the short term, the market will likely focus on the immediate impact on earnings and cash flow. The acquisition is expected to be accretive, excluding first-year purchase accounting costs, which may result in a positive reaction from investors. Additionally, the strong free cash flow conversion rate suggests that the acquisition will not strain Curtiss-Wright's liquidity and may provide additional capital for future investments or shareholder returns.In the long-term, the strategic value of the acquisition comes into play. WSC's 225 plant simulators installed base and its proprietary 3KEYMASTER™ simulation platform provide a competitive edge. The ability to enhance the design and operation of nuclear power generation and process plants, including involvement in cutting-edge ASMR projects, positions Curtiss-Wright to capitalize on the nuclear industry's evolution. Investors should monitor how effectively Curtiss-Wright integrates WSC's offerings with its existing portfolio and whether this translates into sustained earnings growth and market share expansion. Energy Sector Analyst The energy sector is undergoing significant transformation with a focus on modernization and efficiency. Curtiss-Wright's acquisition of WSC taps into this trend by enhancing its capabilities in the nuclear power sector. WSC's simulation technology is important for training, design and operation of nuclear facilities, which are areas of high regulatory scrutiny and operational risk. The mention of WSC's contract with TerraPower highlights the importance of simulation technology in next-generation nuclear projects, such as the Natrium reactor, which is a collaboration between TerraPower and Bill Gates.This acquisition also underscores the importance of digital twin technology in optimizing plant performance and reducing costs, which is a growing area of interest in the energy sector. Curtiss-Wright's ability to offer comprehensive solutions, including digital safety systems and advanced condition monitoring technology, could give it a competitive advantage in bids for new projects and service contracts. The impact on the business could be substantial if Curtiss-Wright successfully leverages WSC's technology to secure a foothold in the burgeoning market for advanced nuclear reactors. 04/02/2024 - 04:15 PM A Leading Global Supplier of Power Plant Control Room Simulation Technology to the Commercial Nuclear and Process Industries DAVIDSON, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Curtiss-Wright Corporation (NYSE: CW) today announced that it has completed the acquisition of WSC, Inc. for approximately $34 million in cash. WSC is a leading provider of state-of-the-art simulation technology that supports the design, commissioning, and reliable operation of commercial nuclear power generation and process plants worldwide with an installed base of over 225 plant simulators. WSC generated sales of approximately $15 million in 2023 and is expected to be accretive to Curtiss-Wright's adjusted diluted earnings per share in its first full year of ownership, excluding first year purchase accounting costs, and produce a strong free cash flow conversion rate in excess of 100%. The acquired business will operate within Curtiss-Wright's Naval & Power segment. “The acquisition of WSC increases the breadth of Curtiss-Wright’s portfolio of advanced commercial nuclear technologies utilized in the modernization of existing power plants and design of new power plants such as Advanced Small Modular Reactors,” said Lynn M. Bamford, Chair and Chief Executive Officer. “The combination of WSC's solutions, including their simulation and digital twin capabilities, with Curtiss-Wright's digital safety systems and advanced condition monitoring technology, will benefit our customers developing advanced reactors as well as those optimizing any power or process plant designs. The acquisition also supports Curtiss-Wright's financial objectives for long-term profitable growth and strong free cash flow generation.” WSC’s proprietary 3KEYMASTER™ simulation platform is used in their nuclear full scope simulators that are mandated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and remain integral to reactor operator training and licensing. Simulation assisted engineering tools optimize the design and commissioning of plants, to include Advanced Small Modular Reactors (ASMRs), by creating a digital twin of plant components and systems to reduce risk, accelerate delivery, and improve quality at a lower cost. In 2023, WSC was awarded a contract by TerraPower to support the design and development of the Natrium sodium fast reactor, and continues to contribute to the development of other leading ASMR platforms. In addition, generic simulators are used at universities, regulatory agencies, training centers and plants to offer classroom-based training on the operation of nuclear plants under normal and abnormal conditions. WSC’s simulation capabilities have also proven beneficial for U.S. Navy nuclear design agencies and shipyards to enhance the design process of nuclear systems and components for aircraft carriers and submarines. WSC, which was founded in 1995 and employs approximately 45 people, maintains operations in Frederick, MD.

The Offers are part of Aon's plans to acquire NFP Intermediate Holdings A Corp. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Aon plc regarding the cash tender offers for various senior notes and the solicitation of consents to amend the restrictive covenants and release collateral securing the notes is a significant financial maneuver that impacts the company's capital structure and debt profile. From a financial perspective, the proposed amendments could potentially reduce the company's cost of capital and increase financial flexibility. The reduction of restrictive covenants and the release of collateral may make Aon more attractive to investors, as it suggests confidence in the company's future cash flows and financial stability. However, the buying back of debt at a premium, as indicated by the total consideration above the face value, suggests an immediate cash outflow which could impact Aon's liquidity in the short term. Investors should assess the long-term benefits of reduced interest expenses against the short-term use of cash reserves. The tie-in with a merger condition also indicates strategic financial restructuring in line with broader corporate strategy, which could have implications for the company's future performance and stock valuation. Debt Market Analyst The tender offer and consent solicitation by Aon are notable events in the debt market, particularly for the holders of the specified notes. The offer prices and the total consideration, which includes an early tender payment, are designed to incentivize note holders to act swiftly. The structure of the offer, with fixed price notes and fixed spread notes, provides clarity on the return that investors can expect if they choose to tender their notes before the early deadline. Market participants should closely monitor the reference yields and fixed spreads for the fixed spread notes, as these will determine the final payout. The reference to U.S. Treasury securities as benchmarks for pricing the fixed spread notes is a common practice that aligns the offer with market conditions. Investors should be aware that fluctuations in treasury yields could affect the final total consideration for these notes. The conditionality of the offer on the completion of a merger adds a layer of complexity and uncertainty, which could influence the decision-making process of note holders. Mergers & Acquisitions Expert The connection between the tender offer and the anticipated merger with NFP Intermediate highlights a strategic approach to corporate restructuring ahead of a significant acquisition. The timing and successful execution of the tender offer and consent solicitation are likely to be critical for the post-merger capital structure of Aon. By aligning the expiration of the offers with the expected closing of the merger, Aon is attempting to streamline the process and minimize disruption. It is important to note that the merger is not contingent on the completion of the tender offer, indicating that Aon is proceeding with a multi-faceted strategy to ensure the merger's success. The outcome of the tender offers and consent solicitations could provide insights into the confidence levels of debt holders in Aon's post-merger financial health and operational synergy potential with NFP Intermediate. 04/02/2024 - 04:15 PM DUBLIN, April 2, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Aon plc (NYSE: AON) (""Aon""), a leading global professional services firm, announced today that its wholly owned subsidiary, Randolph Acquisition Corp.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The completion of Farmer Mac's $308.1 million securitization represents a notable event for the agricultural finance sector. The securitization process involves pooling various agricultural loans and selling them to investors as mortgage-backed securities. This diversification allows for risk distribution and provides liquidity to the market, which is essential for the ongoing funding of rural and agricultural projects.The offering's success, with demand tripling expectations, indicates strong investor confidence in both Farmer Mac and the agricultural loan asset class. This confidence is particularly significant given the recent volatility in credit markets, suggesting that agricultural assets are perceived as a stable investment amid uncertainty. The creation of new senior note classes to meet investor cash flow demands also reflects a level of innovation and responsiveness to market needs, which may contribute positively to Farmer Mac's reputation and financial stability. Market Research Analyst Farmer Mac's securitization adds depth to the agricultural mortgage-backed securities (AMBS) market, which is relatively niche compared to other sectors. By offering notes in three classes, Farmer Mac is not only catering to a broader range of investment strategies but also potentially increasing the liquidity of these instruments. Increased liquidity can lead to more accurate pricing and make it easier for investors to enter or exit positions, thereby attracting further capital to the sector.Furthermore, the expansion of Farmer Mac's investor base suggests a growing interest in rural credit markets. This could have downstream effects, such as encouraging more lenders to extend credit to farmers and rural businesses, ultimately supporting the broader agricultural economy. Agricultural Economist The securitization has implications for the agricultural sector at large. By increasing the accessibility of financing, Farmer Mac is directly influencing the capital availability for farmers and rural businesses. This can lead to increased investment in agricultural infrastructure and operations, potentially boosting productivity and growth within the sector.Moreover, the successful securitization amid market volatility underscores the resilience of the agricultural sector. The ability to attract capital reinforces the notion that the agricultural economy serves as a cornerstone of stability, which might be particularly attractive to investors in times of economic uncertainty. 04/02/2024 - 04:15 PM WASHINGTON, April 2, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac; NYSE: AGM and AGM.A), the nation's secondary market provider that increases the accessibility of financing for American agriculture and rural infrastructure, announced today that it has completed a $308.1 million securitization of agricultural mortgage loans. This is Farmer Mac's fourth transaction in the FARM series since 2021. ""We are very pleased with the execution of our fourth agricultural mortgage-backed securitization (AMBS) transaction, FARM 2024-1, as we return to the market in the new year,"" says President and Chief Executive Officer, Brad Nordholm. ""Farmer Mac remains committed to developing a vibrant and liquid AMBS market that is central to our core mission to improve credit accessibility in rural America."" The mortgage pool for FARM Series 2024-1 consists of 443 agricultural mortgage loans with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of approximately $308.1 million. The loans in the pool were underwritten to Farmer Mac's standards and acquired by Farmer Mac between February 2022 and August 2023. This deal included a $285.0 million senior tranche guaranteed by Farmer Mac and a $23.1 million unguaranteed subordinate tranche. The senior tranche reflects an enhanced sophistication of the securitization by offering notes in three classes, A, A1, and A2, each of which are guaranteed by Farmer Mac. These three guaranteed classes provide for differing principal repayment cashflows, which provided more investment options and drove new investor demand. ""We have witnessed significant volatility in the credit markets over the past year and the fact that we were able to generate more than three times the demand for this offering is a testament to Farmer Mac's reputation with institutional investors and the overall market appetite for the underlying agricultural asset class,"" said Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Aparna Ramesh. ""Not only was demand strong but we were able to successfully expand our investor base and introduce new classes of senior notes to address cashflow demands of capital markets.""

The index includes prominent companies like SpaceX, Anduril, and Epic Games, ranked by a modified capitalization weighting methodology. This collaboration aims to enhance market reach and provide investors with simplified access to private company growth opportunities. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Forge Global Holdings' partnership with Accuidity to track the Forge Accuidity Private Market Index represents a significant development in the realm of private market investing. This collaboration leverages Forge's robust marketplace infrastructure and Accuidity's asset management expertise to offer investors a novel means of engaging with the private sector. The index includes high-profile companies such as SpaceX and Epic Games, which are indicative of the burgeoning potential within the late-stage venture-backed space.From a financial perspective, the introduction of such an index can be seen as a democratizing force within the investment landscape. It potentially lowers barriers to entry for investors who previously may have been excluded from private market opportunities due to the high capital requirements or lack of access. Moreover, the index's modified capitalization weighting methodology may provide a more balanced representation of the private market, as opposed to the traditional venture capital approach that can be heavily weighted towards a few large players.However, it's important to note that while the index may offer diversification, investing in private companies carries a distinct risk profile compared to public equities. Liquidity concerns, valuation complexities and limited financial disclosures are factors that investors must weigh carefully. Moreover, the performance of such indices can be difficult to predict given the opaqueness of the private market. Hence, while the index may represent an attractive proposition, it is not without its challenges. Market Research Analyst Forge's move to partner with Accuidity and create an index tracking late-stage, venture-backed private companies signifies an evolving trend in the investment community where there's an increasing appetite for alternative assets. This index could potentially serve as a benchmark for private market performance, which has been historically difficult to quantify due to the bespoke nature of private investments and the lack of standardized data.Given the composition of the Forge Accuidity Private Market Index, its performance will be closely watched by investors and analysts alike as a barometer for the health and trajectory of the innovation economy. The presence of high-growth companies in sectors such as technology and aerospace within the index could also act as a leading indicator for future trends in the broader economy.For Accuidity, the adoption of this index within their Megacorn strategy may enhance their product offerings and attract investors seeking exposure to disruptive companies before they go public. However, it's essential to monitor how the index is received in the market, its correlation with public markets and its ability to withstand economic downturns. The success of this index could influence the development of similar products and spur further interest in private market investing. Economist The creation of the Forge Accuidity Private Market Index could potentially reflect broader economic trends, particularly those related to the growth and scaling of innovative ventures. By capturing the performance of a segment of the economy that is not directly observable through public markets, the index could provide valuable insights into the entrepreneurial ecosystem and its contribution to economic growth.While the index may serve as a tool for investors to tap into private market growth, its impact on the economy hinges on its ability to accurately represent the performance of its constituents and to facilitate the efficient allocation of capital. If successful, it can contribute to the dynamism of the private sector by channeling investment towards promising ventures.However, the concentration of investment in late-stage companies, as opposed to early-stage startups, may have implications for the distribution of capital across the entrepreneurial lifecycle. Economically, this could influence the types of innovation that receive funding and ultimately shape the direction of technological progress and competitiveness. 04/02/2024 - 04:15 PM Accuidity to track latest Forge index, providing investors with access to institutionally managed strategy of dozens of venture-backed late-stage private companies SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Forge Global Holdings, Inc.

Investors are advised to be cautious and seek current market quotations before taking any action. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The unsolicited mini-tender offer by TRC Capital Investment for ON Semiconductor Corporation's shares is a notable event for investors and the company alike. The offer price is set below the recent closing share price, which suggests a potential undervaluation of onsemi's stock. Investors should be aware that such offers might seem attractive but could reflect an opportunistic attempt to acquire shares at a discount.It's essential to scrutinize the offer's terms, especially since mini-tender offers are subject to fewer regulations than larger bids, potentially posing higher risks to uninformed shareholders. The recommendation by onsemi for investors to seek advice and compare the offer price with the market value is sound, emphasizing the need for due diligence.Furthermore, the fact that TRC Capital Investment has a history of making similar offers could indicate a pattern in their investment strategy, which might impact the trading dynamics of onsemi's stock. While the offer represents a small percentage of the outstanding shares, it could still influence investor sentiment and the stock's market liquidity. Securities Lawyer From a legal perspective, the mini-tender offer by TRC Capital Investment raises several points of interest. Mini-tender offers are generally not subject to the same strict regulatory requirements as larger tender offers, which is why the SEC issues cautionary advice regarding them. This lack of regulation can lead to less transparency and fewer protections for shareholders.onsemi's proactive stance in urging shareholders to consult with financial advisors and to carefully consider the offer is a prudent measure to help protect their interests. The company's request for brokers and dealers to review the SEC's guidance on mini-tender offers further underscores the importance of informed decision-making in these situations.Shareholders should also be aware of their rights to withdraw tendered shares before the offer's expiration. This flexibility is important in case market conditions change or if investors reassess the value proposition of the mini-tender offer in light of new information. Market Research Analyst Analyzing market trends, the mini-tender offer for onsemi's shares could be seen as a strategic move by TRC Capital Investment to capitalize on potential undervaluation. However, the impact on the market depends on the response from onsemi's shareholders. If many investors find the offer appealing and choose to tender their shares, this could lead to a temporary dip in the company's stock price due to perceived market sentiment.Conversely, if the majority of shareholders heed onsemi's advice and reject the offer, it could reinforce investor confidence in the company's valuation and stability. The offer's outcome might also serve as a signal to the market about the shareholders' perception of the company's future prospects and inherent value.It's important to monitor the market's reaction to such offers, as they can sometimes precede more significant corporate actions or indicate broader investor attitudes towards the company and its industry sector. 04/02/2024 - 04:15 PM SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ON Semiconductor Corporation (Nasdaq: ON) (“onsemi”) disclosed today that it has received notice of an unsolicited mini-tender offer by TRC Capital Investment Corporation, an Ontario corporation (“TRC Capital Investment”). onsemi is not affiliated or associated in any way with TRC Capital Investment, its mini-tender offer or its offer documentation. The offer is for the purchase of up to 1.5 million shares of onsemi’s common stock at a price of $70.75 per share, approximately 4.4% lower than the $74.04 closing share price of onsemi’s common stock on March 19, 2024, the trading day immediately prior to the date of the offer. The offer represents approximately 0.35% of the shares of onsemi’s common stock outstanding as of the March 20, 2024 offer date. onsemi urges investors to obtain current market quotations for their shares, to consult with their broker or financial advisor, and to exercise caution with respect to TRC Capital Investment’s offer. onsemi recommends that stockholders who have not responded to TRC Capital Investment’s offer take no action. Stockholders who have already tendered their shares may withdraw them at any time prior to the expiration of the offer, in accordance with TRC Capital Investment’s offer documentation. The offer is currently scheduled to expire at 12:01 a.m. EDT on April 19, 2024. TRC Capital Investment may extend the offering period at its discretion. onsemi encourages brokers and dealers, as well as other market participants, to review the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) letter regarding broker-dealer mini-tender offer dissemination and disclosure at www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/minitenders/sia072401.htm. The SEC has cautioned investors that some bidders making mini-tender offers at below-market prices are “hoping that they will catch investors off guard if the investors do not compare the offer price to the current market price.” TRC Capital Investment has made many similar mini-tender offers for shares of other companies. Mini-tender offers seek to acquire less than 5% of a company’s shares outstanding, thereby avoiding many disclosure and procedural requirements of the SEC that apply to offers for more than 5% of a company’s shares outstanding. As a result, mini-tender offers do not provide investors with the same level of protections as provided for larger tender offers under U.S. securities laws. onsemi requests that a copy of this news release be included with all distributions of materials relating to TRC Capital Investment’s mini-tender offer related to shares of onsemi’s common stock. About onsemi onsemi (Nasdaq: ON) is driving disruptive innovations to help build a better future.

Gambling.com Group Completes Acquisition of Freebets.com and Related Assets,2024-04-02T20:15:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,"Gambling.com Group  (Nasdaq: GAMB) completed the acquisition of Freebets.com and related assets, expecting $10.0 million revenue and $5.0 million EBITDA by 2024.

CEO Charles Gillespie foresees a shift in the European online gambling affiliate market balance, fueling growth. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of Freebets.com by Gambling.com Group is a strategic move that positions the company to capitalize on the European online gambling market. The projected revenue of $10.0 million and an Adjusted EBITDA of $5.0 million indicate a significant impact on Gambling.com Group's financials. It's important to note that the online gambling industry is highly competitive, with regulatory challenges that vary by country. The ability to navigate these complexities will be critical for the success of the acquisition.From a market perspective, the deal could signal a consolidation trend within the industry, where larger affiliates absorb smaller ones to gain market share. This can lead to increased bargaining power with online gambling operators and improved economies of scale. However, it also raises questions about market diversity and competition. Stakeholders should monitor how this acquisition affects Gambling.com Group's market positioning and whether it leads to increased revenue streams from the European markets. Financial Analyst Examining the financial aspects of this transaction, the payment structure is noteworthy. The initial payment of $20.0 million, with additional payments tied to performance, suggests a confident outlook on the acquired assets' revenue-generating capabilities. This performance-based earn-out could motivate the integration of the new assets to achieve the forecasted financial targets.Investors should consider the impact of this acquisition on Gambling.com Group's cash flow and debt levels. The total consideration of up to $42.5 million represents a substantial investment. It's essential to assess whether the anticipated revenue and EBITDA will justify this outlay and how quickly the return on investment will materialize. Additionally, the deal's impact on the company's balance sheet and future investment capabilities should be scrutinized. Legal Expert When a company like Gambling.com Group expands within the European market, regulatory compliance becomes a focal point. The online gambling industry is subject to stringent regulations that can vary significantly from one European country to another. The acquisition of Freebets.com, therefore, not only represents a financial investment but also a commitment to navigate a complex legal landscape.Investors should be aware of potential legal hurdles that could arise from the integration of the new assets. For example, data protection laws, such as GDPR and country-specific gambling regulations could affect the operation and profitability of the acquired assets. The company's ability to manage these legal aspects efficiently will be essential in realizing the expected financial benefits without encountering regulatory penalties or restrictions that could undermine the acquisition's value. 04/02/2024 - 04:15 PM CHARLOTTE, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Gambling.com Group Limited (Nasdaq: GAMB) (“Gambling.com Group” or the “Company”), a leading provider of player acquisition services for the regulated global online gambling industry, announced today that it completed the previously announced acquisition of Freebets.com and related assets.

ANNOUNCES UPSIZE AND PRICING OF $400.0 MILLION OFFERING OF SENIOR NOTES DUE 2029 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Comstock Resources, Inc. (CRK) announces the pricing of $400.0 million senior unsecured notes due 2029, increasing from the initially proposed $375.0 million. The offering is expected to close on April 9, 2024, with net proceeds of approximately $365.0 million. The company plans to use the proceeds to repay borrowings under its bank credit facility and pay related fees. Positive Comstock Resources, Inc. increases the size of its private placement of senior unsecured notes from $375.0 million to $400.0 million. The Notes will be issued at 93% of par and are due in 2029. The offering is expected to close on April 9, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. The net proceeds from the sale of the Notes are estimated to be around $365.0 million after deducting discounts and expenses. The company intends to use the proceeds to repay a portion of its outstanding borrowings under the bank credit facility and pay associated fees. The senior unsecured notes are expected to be eligible for trading by qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A and non-U.S. persons under Regulation S. Negative None. Financial Analyst The issuance of new 6.75% senior unsecured notes by Comstock Resources represents a strategic financial maneuver to optimize its capital structure. By increasing the offering from $375 million to $400 million, the company is tapping into investor demand for higher-yielding debt instruments amidst a potentially volatile interest rate environment. The issuance price at 93% of par indicates a yield to maturity that is higher than the coupon rate, which could be indicative of the market's perception of the company's credit risk.Investors should note that the decision to repay portions of the company's bank credit facility could signal a strategic pivot towards fixed-rate debt, hedging against future interest rate hikes. However, the discount on par value and the subsequent higher effective interest rate could impact the company's interest expense and profitability margins in the short term. Long-term, the move may strengthen the balance sheet if it leads to a more favorable debt maturity profile and interest expense savings. Debt Market Analyst The private placement of senior unsecured notes by Comstock Resources, especially to qualified institutional buyers and non-U.S. persons, reflects a broader trend in corporate debt markets where companies seek to diversify their investor base and capitalize on global investment appetites. The notes' eligibility for trading under Rule 144A and Regulation S is a key factor that could influence liquidity and pricing in the secondary market.Prospective and current stakeholders should be aware that the unregistered nature of these notes under the Securities Act of 1933 limits their marketability to a certain extent. However, the trade-off for Comstock Resources could be a quicker access to capital and potentially lower issuance costs compared to a public offering. It's imperative to consider how the company's credit ratings and the overall industry's financial health might interact with this debt issuance, affecting its success and the perceived risk by investors. Energy Sector Analyst For an energy company like Comstock Resources, the infusion of capital through the issuance of senior unsecured notes is indicative of the capital-intensive nature of the industry. The intended use of proceeds to repay existing debt suggests a focus on maintaining liquidity and managing debt levels, which is important for energy companies facing fluctuating commodity prices and regulatory changes.It's important to scrutinize the company's operational efficiency and project pipeline, as these factors will ultimately dictate its ability to service the new debt. Stakeholders should also consider the impact of environmental policies and energy market dynamics, as these could influence Comstock's future cash flows and ability to meet its financial obligations. 04/02/2024 - 04:30 PM FRISCO, TX, April 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Comstock Resources, Inc.

(NASDAQ: CALM) reported strong financial performance in Q3 FY 2024 with net sales of $703.1 million, net income of $146.4 million, and record sales volume. The company faced challenges due to HPAI outbreaks impacting egg prices but managed to meet strong consumer demand. Cal-Maine Foods acquired assets of Fassio Egg Farms, Inc. and Tyson Foods, Inc. to enhance its production capacity. Despite lower egg prices, the company remains optimistic about future growth opportunities and maintaining dividend payments. Positive None. Negative None. Market Analyst The report from Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. showcases a mixed financial picture, with a notable decline in net sales from $997.5 million to $703.1 million year-over-year for the third quarter. This decrease is primarily attributed to a substantial drop in egg prices, despite an increase in total sales volume. The market for shell eggs has been volatile due to the impact of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), which has led to fluctuations in supply and prices.Investors should note the company's strategic moves, such as the acquisition of assets from Fassio Egg Farms and Tyson Foods, which indicate an expansionary approach geared towards increasing market reach and production capabilities. These developments, coupled with the company's focus on specialty eggs—a segment that has seen a 4.4% increase in sales—suggest a strategic pivot towards products with potentially higher margins.However, the ongoing threat of HPAI poses a risk to operations, as evidenced by the depopulation events at the company's facilities. This has implications for future production stability and could affect investor confidence if not managed effectively. The company's commitment to robust biosecurity measures and operational efficiency in the face of these challenges is critical for maintaining production continuity and safeguarding its market position. Financial Analyst Cal-Maine Foods' dividend policy reflects a prudent approach to capital distribution, paying out one-third of quarterly net income as dividends. This quarter's dividend of $1.00 per share aligns with this policy, given the reported net income of $146.4 million. The policy also dictates no dividend payment in the absence of net income, emphasizing a focus on financial stability and shareholder value over the long term.From a financial perspective, the reduction in feed costs by 19.9% is a positive indicator for margin improvement. Lower feed costs can have a significant impact on profitability in the egg production industry, where feed constitutes a major portion of total production expenses. This cost reduction, combined with the company's highest recorded sales volume, may cushion the effect of lower egg prices on the overall financial health of the company.Moreover, the company's strong balance sheet and investment in operational efficiencies and capacity expansion, particularly in the cage-free segment, are strategic decisions that may provide a competitive edge and drive long-term growth. Investors should closely monitor the company's ability to manage external risks and capitalize on its strategic initiatives to gauge future performance. Agricultural Economist The dynamics of the shell egg market as detailed by Cal-Maine Foods offer insights into the broader agricultural economy. The fluctuations in egg prices, influenced by both HPAI and seasonal trends, underscore the susceptibility of agricultural commodity prices to external shocks and disease outbreaks. The company's ability to maintain a record sales volume despite these challenges is indicative of strong underlying consumer demand for eggs, which are often viewed as a cost-effective protein source.Additionally, the mention of favorable corn supply projections and the potential for lower prices could have broader implications for the agricultural sector. Corn is a fundamental feed ingredient and its price movements can significantly influence the cost structure of poultry and livestock operations. A better stocks-to-use ratio for corn suggests a potential easing of feed costs, which could benefit producers in the short term.However, the persistent risk of HPAI and the uncertainty of its future impact, along with the global supply chain disruptions, highlight the need for resilience in the agricultural sector. The ability of companies like Cal-Maine Foods to adapt to these challenges through biosecurity measures and supply chain management will be critical in maintaining stability and ensuring the uninterrupted supply of agricultural products. 04/02/2024 - 04:05 PM RIDGELAND, Miss.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. (NASDAQ: CALM) (“Cal-Maine Foods” or the “Company”), the largest producer and distributor of fresh shell eggs in the United States, today reported results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (thirteen weeks) ended March 2, 2024. Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Highlights Quarterly net sales of $703.1 million Quarterly net income of $146.4 million, or $3.01 per basic common share Record quarterly sales volume of total dozens sold and specialty dozens sold Cash dividend of $48.9 million, or $1.00 per share, pursuant to the Company’s established dividend policy Overview Sherman Miller, president and chief executive officer of Cal-Maine Foods, stated, “We are very pleased with Cal-Maine Foods’ strong financial and operating performance for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Our sales reflect lower average selling prices compared to a year ago, when the shell egg industry experienced record high market prices due primarily to the impact of highly pathogenic avian influenza (“HPAI”) and other market factors resulting in a significant reduction in supply. While the more recent outbreaks of HPAI have also affected supply and caused market prices to move higher, the overall market impact has not been as severe. Fueled by strong demand, our total sales volumes (dozens sold) for the quarter were higher than the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and reached a Company record. Consumer demand for eggs has been strong, especially during the winter holiday season. We have worked hard to meet this demand with a favorable product mix of conventional and specialty eggs, as well as enhanced egg products offerings. Our managers and employees have continued to efficiently run our operations in a challenging environment due to the impact of and ongoing threat of HPAI. Despite the distractions, we have continued to meet the needs of our valued customers. “In addition to our strong organic growth opportunities, we are pleased with the operational performance and successful integration of our acquisition of assets of Fassio Egg Farms, Inc., located in Erda, Utah outside of Salt Lake City, acquired in our second fiscal quarter. Following the end of the third quarter, we completed the acquisition from Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) of a recently closed broiler processing plant, hatchery and feed mill located in Dexter, Missouri. We intend to repurpose the acquired assets for use in egg and egg products production. We remain focused on identifying other acquisition opportunities that complement our operating model and further extend our market reach.” Sales Performance & Operating Highlights Max Bowman, vice president and chief financial officer of Cal-Maine Foods, added, “For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, our net sales were $703.1 million compared with $997.5 million for the same period last year, which was the Company’s highest quarterly sales period with record high average selling prices for conventional and specialty eggs. The decline in sales revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was primarily due to the significant decrease in egg prices compared to a year ago. However, market prices moved higher sequentially in the third fiscal quarter due to both the recent impact of HPAI and normal seasonal fluctuations. “Our overall sales volumes improved 3.2% compared to the same period last year as we sold 300.8 million dozens compared with 291.4 million dozens for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Conventional eggs sold reached 192.2 million dozens, up 2.6%, while specialty eggs sold were 108.6 million dozens, a 4.4% increase over the prior-year period. These results represent the highest total dozens sold and highest specialty dozens sold in any quarter for Cal-Maine Foods. “Net income attributable to Cal-Maine Foods for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $146.7 million, or $3.00 per diluted share, compared with $323.2 million, or $6.62 per diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, which was another record for the Company. “The net average selling price per dozen was $2.152 for conventional eggs in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, down 41.5% compared with $3.678 for the prior-year quarter. Net average selling price for specialty eggs was $2.415 per dozen, compared with $2.616 per dozen for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, a decline of 7.7%. Specialty dozens sold were 36.1% of total dozens sold in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with 35.7% in the prior-year period. “We reported operating income of $162.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, compared with operating income of $407.8 million for the prior-year quarter, primarily reflecting lower market prices. However, we benefitted from lower feed ingredient prices compared with the same period a year ago. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, feed costs per dozen were down 19.9% compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Our other farm production costs were higher primarily due to higher flock amortization and increased facility costs. “Current indications for corn supply project an overall better stocks-to-use ratio, implying potentially lower prices in the near term. However, as we continue to face uncertain external forces including weather patterns and global supply chain disruptions, price volatility could remain. Soybean meal supply has remained tight relative to demand in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.” 13 Weeks Ended 39 Weeks Ended March 2, 2024 February 25, 2023 March 2, 2024 February 25, 2023 Dozen Eggs Sold (000) 300,779 291,416 862,078 850,819 Conventional Dozen Eggs Sold (000) 192,182 187,357 566,174 555,045 Specialty Dozen Eggs Sold (000) 108,597 104,059 295,904 295,774 Dozen Eggs Produced (000) 259,527 263,174 774,984 782,186 % Specialty Sales (dozen) 36.1 % 35.7 % 34.3 % 34.8 % % Specialty Sales (dollars) 38.5 % 28.2 % 42.5 % 29.6 % Net Average Selling Price (per dozen) $ 2.247 $ 3.298 $ 1.866 $ 2.771 Net Average Selling Price Conventional Eggs (per dozen) $ 2.152 $ 3.678 $ 1.624 $ 2.984 Net Average Selling Price Specialty Eggs (per dozen) $ 2.415 $ 2.616 $ 2.328 $ 2.369 Feed Cost (per dozen) $ 0.544 $ 0.679 $ 0.564 $ 0.677 HPAI & Table Egg Supply Outlook Outbreaks of HPAI have continued to occur in U.S. poultry flocks. From November 2023 through January of 2024, the USDA division of Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service reported that approximately 15.7 million commercial layer hens and pullets have been depopulated as a result of HPAI outbreaks. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, Cal-Maine Foods experienced an HPAI outbreak within its facilities in Kansas, resulting in depopulation of approximately 1.5 million laying hens and 240,000 pullets. Following the end of the third quarter, on April 1, 2024, one of the Company’s facilities located in Parmer County, Texas, tested positive for HPAI, resulting in depopulation of approximately 1.6 million laying hens and 337,000 pullets, or approximately 3.6% of the Company’s total flock as of March 2, 2024. Production at the facility has temporarily ceased as the Company follows the protocols prescribed by the USDA. Cal-Maine Foods is working to secure production from other facilities to minimize disruption to its customers. The Company remains dedicated to robust biosecurity programs across its locations; however, no farm is immune from HPAI. HPAI is still present in the wild bird population and the extent of possible future outbreaks, with heightened risk during the migration seasons, cannot be predicted. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the human health risk to the U.S. public from HPAI viruses is considered to be low. Also, according to the USDA, HPAI cannot be transmitted through safely handled and properly cooked eggs. There is no known risk related to HPAI associated with eggs that are currently in the market and no eggs have been recalled. Looking Ahead Miller added, “We are proud of our ability to manage our operations effectively and deliver favorable results to date for fiscal 2024. Like other producers, we have navigated significant challenges related to HPAI, and we remain diligent in our efforts to mitigate any future risks. We commend our team of managers and employees who have worked through these challenges with minimal disruption to our overall production and distribution. Importantly, we remain committed to meeting the needs of our valued customers with a diverse offering of quality products. Demand for shell eggs has remained strong as consumers look for an affordable and nutritious protein option. Across our operations, we are focused on meeting this demand, as we continue to identify opportunities to extend our market reach. We are also making significant investments in our operations to drive innovation and more efficient production and support our ability to add capacity, including cage-free opportunities. We have a strong balance sheet that provides us with the flexibility to fund our growth initiatives, including potential acquisitions. We believe fiscal 2024 will be another successful year for the Company, and we look forward to the opportunities ahead for Cal-Maine Foods.” Dividend Payment For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, Cal-Maine Foods will pay a cash dividend of approximately $1.00 per share to holders of its common and Class A common stock. Pursuant to Cal-Maine Foods’ variable dividend policy, for each quarter in which the Company reports net income, the Company pays a cash dividend to shareholders in an amount equal to one-third of such quarterly income. Following a quarter for which the Company does not report net income, the Company will not pay a dividend with respect to that quarter or for a subsequent profitable quarter until the Company is profitable on a cumulative basis computed from the date of the most recent quarter for which a dividend was paid. The amount paid per share will vary based on the number of outstanding shares on the record date. The dividend is payable on May 16, 2024, to holders of record on May 1, 2024. About Cal-Maine Foods Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. is primarily engaged in the production, grading, packaging, marketing and distribution of fresh shell eggs, including conventional, cage-free, organic, brown, free-range, pasture-raised and nutritionally enhanced eggs.

The Fund's current indicated distribution rate is 5.52% based on its closing price and 5.28% based on net asset value. US markets shifting to T+1 settlement will affect the ex-date for June distribution. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of cash distributions by the Miller/Howard High Income Equity Fund is a tangible event for shareholders, as it directly influences the yield they receive on their investment. The indicated distribution rate of 5.52% based on the closing price and 5.28% based on net asset value (NAV), is a key figure. It's important to compare these rates to the average dividend yield of similar high-income equity funds. If the Fund's distribution is higher, it could attract income-focused investors, potentially increasing demand for the Fund's shares. However, a distribution rate significantly above the norm may raise questions about sustainability. Investors should monitor the payout ratio, which is the percentage of earnings paid out as dividends, to assess the long-term viability of these distributions. Market Research Analyst The transition to T+1 settlement, which shortens the time between a trade and its settlement, could have implications for the Fund's liquidity and volatility. This change may lead to increased trading efficiency and reduced credit risk. For investors, this means that the timing of transactions around the ex-date for distributions becomes more critical. The revised ex-date for the June distribution is a direct response to this policy change and will require investors to adjust their strategies accordingly. It's also worth noting how the market reacts to such structural changes, as they can influence investor behavior and fund performance. Economist The Fund's distribution rate and its review process are reflective of broader economic conditions. Factors such as interest rates, inflation and market volatility play a role in determining realized and projected market returns. The Board of Trustees' commitment to monitor the distribution level suggests a proactive approach to managing these economic influences. For the broader market, the Fund's performance and distribution rates can act as indicators of the health of the high-income equity sector, which is often sensitive to changes in the economic landscape. Investors should consider macroeconomic trends when evaluating the Fund's future distributions and overall performance. 04/02/2024 - 04:05 PM Kingston, NY, April 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Board of Trustees of the Miller/Howard High Income Equity Fund (NYSE: HIE) (the “Fund”) declared, on April 1, 2024, cash distributions of $0.051 per share for each of April, May, and June 2024.

Each quarter, the Board of Trustees reviews the Adviser’s recommended amount of any potential distribution to shareholders. The Board of Trustees will monitor the Fund’s distribution level. The Fund’s distribution rate may be affected by numerous factors, including changes in realized and projected market returns, Fund performance and other factors. There can be no assurance that an unanticipated change in market conditions or other unforeseen factors will not result in a change in the Fund’s distribution rate at a future time. The distribution rate should not be considered the dividend yield or total return on an investment in the Fund.

The company aims to reach 35 to 37 exahash this year and 50 exahash next year, with a clear growth strategy in place. Positive Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. has successfully closed the acquisition of a Bitcoin mining data center in Garden City, Texas. The new data center has a name plate capacity of 200 megawatts, expanding Marathon's capacity to 1.1 gigawatts. The acquisition allows Marathon to have more control over its operations and reduce costs per coin at the site.

Market Research Analyst The acquisition by Marathon Digital Holdings represents a strategic expansion in the Bitcoin mining industry, which is known for its high energy consumption and significant infrastructure investment. The 200-megawatt capacity of the newly acquired data center can be seen as a substantial increase in Marathon's operational capabilities, potentially leading to increased efficiency and reduced cost per coin mined.From a market perspective, the company's growth targets of 35 to 37 exahash this year and 50 exahash next year suggest aggressive scaling, which could position Marathon as a dominant player in the market. This scale of operation could leverage economies of scale and reduce marginal costs. However, the Bitcoin mining sector is subject to high volatility, with profitability closely tied to the fluctuating price of Bitcoin and the overall market sentiment towards cryptocurrencies.Investors might view this expansion as a positive indicator of Marathon's commitment to growth and operational excellence. However, they should also be aware of the inherent risks associated with the cryptocurrency market, such as regulatory challenges, energy costs fluctuations and potential technological obsolescence. Financial Analyst Marathon Digital Holdings' acquisition is a capital-intensive move that could impact its financials in the short to medium term. The initial outlay for the acquisition and subsequent investment in expansion may strain the company's cash reserves or lead to increased debt, which investors should monitor closely in the company's financial statements.The company's statement on the anticipated reduction in cost per coin suggests an improvement in its operational efficiency that could enhance its profit margins. However, this must be weighed against the capital costs and potential depreciation associated with the new infrastructure. Furthermore, the expansion of capacity to 1.1 gigawatts indicates Marathon's bullish outlook on the future of Bitcoin mining, which could be a double-edged sword if the market takes a downturn.Investors should also consider the company's diversification across eleven sites on three continents as a risk mitigation strategy, potentially safeguarding against region-specific issues such as regulatory changes or power supply instability. Energy Sector Analyst The acquisition highlights the significant energy requirements of the Bitcoin mining industry. Marathon's focus on expanding its capacity to 1.1 gigawatts underscores the importance of energy availability and cost in this sector. The site's location in Texas is noteworthy, as the state is known for its relatively low energy prices and a deregulated power market, which could be advantageous for Marathon's operational costs.Investors should note that the energy sector's dynamics, including price volatility and the push for renewable sources, could impact Marathon's operations. While Texas offers competitive energy prices, any changes in energy policy or market conditions could alter the cost structure for Marathon's mining operations.Additionally, the environmental impact of such large-scale energy consumption is a growing concern and any future regulatory changes aimed at reducing carbon footprints could affect Marathon's operational viability and cost efficiency. 04/02/2024 - 04:05 PM Fort Lauderdale, FL, April 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MARA) (""Marathon"" or ""Company""), one of the world’s largest publicly traded Bitcoin miners and a leader in supporting and securing the Bitcoin ecosystem, has closed its previously announced acquisition of a Bitcoin mining data center in Garden City, Texas, with a name plate capacity of 200 megawatts, from Applied Digital Corporation (“Applied Digital”). “With the closing of this acquisition, we have gained more influence over our operations, an opportunity to reduce our cost per coin at this site, and an additional 100 megawatts of capacity in which to expand,” said Fred Thiel, Marathon’s chairman and CEO. “Following the anticipated expansion of this site later in the year, our Bitcoin mining portfolio will consist of 1.1 gigawatts of capacity, 54% of which we will directly own and operate, and all of which are diversified across eleven sites on three continents. With orders and options for machines that represent an additional 45 exahash of capacity already placed, and with the acquisition of our third Bitcoin mining site now complete, we believe we have a clear path to reach our growth targets of 35 to 37 exahash this year and 50 exahash next year.” Wes Cummins, CEO and chairman of Applied Digital, commented, “The Bitcoin mining data center in Garden City, Texas is state-of-the-art and a testament to the quality of Applied Digital’s infrastructure. With this transaction now closed, both Marathon and Applied Digital are better positioned to pursue their long-term strategies.” Investor Notice Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk.

Positive Adaptive Biotechnologies concluded its strategic review by deciding to operate MRD and Immune Medicine businesses internally with increased independence. Preliminary revenue results for Q1 2024 show a total revenue increase of approximately 12% compared to Q1 2023, with MRD revenue up by about 47%. CFO Tycho Peterson will be leaving the company to pursue other opportunities, with Kyle Piskel succeeding him as the new CFO, bringing over 15 years of financial expertise. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The strategic review by Adaptive Biotechnologies, resulting in the decision to increase operational independence between the MRD and Immune Medicine businesses, signals a notable shift in the company's internal structure. By allocating dedicated resources and separate segment reporting, the company aims to enhance focus and potentially improve the financial performance of each unit. This reorganization could lead to improved transparency for investors, as they will be able to evaluate the performance of each business more clearly.The preliminary revenue growth of 12% year-over-year, with a particularly strong performance from the MRD segment, suggests robust demand for Adaptive's offerings. The 47% revenue increase in the MRD segment is a positive indicator of the company's market penetration and the growing acceptance of its diagnostic tools. Investors may view this as a sign of Adaptive's growing competitive edge in the precision medicine field. Financial Analyst Adaptive's strong capital position, as mentioned in the update, is a critical factor for future growth. With adequate capital, the company is well-positioned to reach profitability in its MRD business and make targeted investments in Immune Medicine. The emphasis on profitability and strategic investment suggests a disciplined approach to financial management, which could be reassuring for shareholders concerned about cash burn in biotech firms.The CFO transition is a noteworthy event, as the CFO plays a important role in financial stewardship and investor relations. Kyle Piskel's appointment as CFO, given his previous interim role and long tenure at Adaptive, is likely to ensure continuity in financial strategy. However, transitions in key executive positions can also introduce uncertainty and stakeholders will be closely monitoring the new CFO's impact on the company's financial health and strategic direction. Biotechnology Industry Analyst The strategic review's outcome underscores Adaptive's commitment to leveraging its expertise in the adaptive immune system. Operating the MRD and Immune Medicine businesses with increased independence could enable Adaptive to tailor its strategies to the unique challenges and opportunities of each sector. In the biotech industry, where rapid innovation is common, such flexibility can be a significant advantage.Moreover, the focus on segment-specific reporting reflects an industry trend towards greater accountability and performance metrics. For Adaptive, this could enhance its ability to attract strategic partnerships or funding by showcasing the potential of each business unit individually. This level of detail in financial reporting is often appreciated by investors who specialize in biotech and look for clear indicators of growth and value creation within different segments of a company. 04/02/2024 - 04:05 PM Announces CFO transitionSEATTLE, April 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation (Nasdaq: ADPT), a commercial stage biotechnology company that aims to translate the genetics of the adaptive immune system into clinical products to diagnose and treat disease, today announced a business update, including the conclusion of its recent strategic review, preliminary revenue for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024, and transition of the chief financial officer role. Strategic Review Update After evaluating a number of potential opportunities as part of the strategic review, Adaptive’s management team and board of directors concluded that the current best outcome to maximize shareholder value is to operate the MRD and Immune Medicine businesses internally within Adaptive while increasing their independence from one another by restructuring each business with dedicated resources and separate segment reporting. Importantly, under this structure, Adaptive preserves its strong capital position which will bridge the MRD business to profitability and support targeted investments in Immune Medicine. Management will provide further details on the process and outcome of the strategic review during the conference call this afternoon. First Quarter 2023 Preliminary, Unaudited Revenue Results Total revenue of approximately $41 to $43 million for the first quarter of 2024, an increase of approximately 12% compared to the first quarter of 2023.MRD revenue of approximately $31 to $32 million for the first quarter of 2024, an increase of approximately 47% compared to the first quarter of 2023. CFO Transition Adaptive Biotechnologies announced that Tycho Peterson, chief financial officer (CFO), will be departing the company to pursue another opportunity. Kyle Piskel, who currently serves as the company’s Principal Accounting Officer and has held various financial roles at Adaptive over the past 8 years, will succeed Tycho as full-time CFO. Kyle previously served as the company’s Interim CFO from February to June 2022 and brings over 15 years of financial expertise to the role. “I am excited to announce Kyle as our new chief financial officer,” said Chad Robins, chief executive officer and co-founder, Adaptive Biotechnologies. “I am confident he has the business knowledge to operate and execute, with the necessary guardrails in place, so that our team can maximize the full value of both MRD and Immune Medicine businesses. I would like to thank Tycho for his financial leadership and significant contributions to Adaptive over the past two years, including his leadership during the strategic review process. We wish him success in his next endeavor.” “I’m proud of the great work we accomplished together through a critical time in the company’s evolution over the past two years,” said Tycho Peterson, chief financial officer, Adaptive Biotechnologies. “Adaptive has a bold vision and world class science and is just beginning to unlock the potential on both its MRD and Immune Medicine businesses.

Our proprietary immune medicine platform reveals and translates the massive genetics of the adaptive immune system with scale, precision and speed. We apply our platform to partner with biopharmaceutical companies, inform drug development, and develop clinical diagnostics across our two business areas: Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) and Immune Medicine. Our commercial products and clinical pipeline enable the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and infectious diseases.

(Nasdaq: SGHT) presents clinical data on OMNI Surgical System for glaucoma and TearCare System for dry eye disease at ASCRS Annual Meeting, showcasing long-term efficacy and support for primary treatment. Additional data reveals impressive outcomes at 36 months and superior results compared to existing treatments. Positive None. Negative None. Ophthalmologist From a clinical standpoint, the OMNI Surgical System's 36-month outcomes are noteworthy. The longevity of efficacy post-surgery is a critical factor in the management of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), which is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment strategies. The sustained reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP) and medication use over a three-year period post-OMNI procedure, as indicated by the extended Gemini Study, suggests a potential shift in the treatment paradigm for POAG. This could lead to a decrease in the reliance on long-term medication, which often comes with compliance challenges and side effects. Additionally, the minimally invasive nature of the procedure aligns with the current trend towards less invasive surgical interventions, which can result in reduced recovery times and complications. Market Research Analyst The presentation of these long-term clinical results at a high-profile event like the ASCRS Annual Meeting is likely to have a positive impact on the market perception of Sight Sciences. The data could strengthen the company's position in the ophthalmic device market, potentially influencing stock performance favorably. Investors often look for companies with a robust pipeline of evidence-backed products and the OMNI and TearCare systems appear to be differentiating themselves in a competitive space. The additional data could also aid in marketing efforts, as strong, long-term results are compelling for both clinicians and patients when considering treatment options. Furthermore, the focus on TearCare as a primary treatment for dry eye disease (DED) taps into a large patient population, expanding the potential market reach and revenue streams for Sight Sciences. Medical Device Regulatory Expert The positive clinical outcomes for both OMNI and TearCare technologies highlighted in these presentations are significant from a regulatory perspective. Demonstrating long-term efficacy and safety is important for maintaining and expanding regulatory approvals, which can directly affect market access and insurance coverage. The emphasis on TearCare as a primary treatment for DED, a condition often managed with pharmaceuticals, could lead to an expanded indication for the device. This would be a strategic win for Sight Sciences, potentially broadening its user base and increasing its competitive edge. Moreover, the ability of TearCare to show improvement in symptoms for patients already treated with cyclosporine suggests that it could be positioned as an adjunctive or alternative therapy, offering additional treatment options for clinicians and patients. 04/02/2024 - 04:05 PM Clinical results demonstrate long-term efficacy of the OMNI® Surgical System for primary open-angle glaucoma and support use of TearCare® technology as a primary treatment for dry eye disease. MENLO PARK, Calif., April 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sight Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: SGHT), an eyecare technology company focused on developing and commercializing innovative, interventional technologies intended to transform care and improve patients’ lives, announced today that data from studies of two of its proprietary glaucoma and dry eye technologies, the OMNI Surgical System (“OMNI”) and the TearCare System (“TearCare”), will be presented in two oral presentations and two posters at this year’s ASCRS Annual meeting April 5th to 8th in Boston, MA. OMNI technology facilitates surgeons’ ability to perform a comprehensive, implant-free, minimally invasive glaucoma surgical procedure in adults with primary open-angle glaucoma (“POAG”). TearCare technology enables a proprietary, interventional eyelid procedure for diseased meibomian glands and is intended for the application of localized heat therapy in adult patients with evaporative dry eye disease (“DED”) due to meibomian gland dysfunction, when used in conjunction with manual expression of the meibomian glands. “We are excited that additional data supporting the efficacy and safety of our OMNI and TearCare technologies will be presented at ASCRS, the largest annual gathering for anterior segment surgeons,” said Paul Badawi, CEO and co-founder of Sight Sciences. “In addition to our existing robust body of clinical evidence, we now have additional data showing impressive OMNI results at 36-months, which demonstrate the vital long-term element of OMNI’s efficacy. We are also pleased that new TearCare data will be shared that supports the use of TearCare technology as a primary treatment for DED.” Oral Presentation: OMNI Surgical System 36-Month Outcomes for Canaloplasty and Trabeculotomy Combined with Cataract Surgery: Extended Follow-up from the Gemini Study – oral presentation on Sunday, April 7th at 3:50 PM ET at the BCEC Meeting level 2 room 259A. Lead author: Arkadiy Yadgarov, MD “Long-term data is key in the selection of a surgical treatment,” said Arkadiy Yadgarov, MD, of Omni Eye Services of Atlanta, GA. “The 12-month GEMINI trial demonstrated efficacy of the OMNI procedure combined with cataract surgery for IOP and medication reduction in mild-to-moderate glaucoma.1,2 This extension of the trial shows that these positive 12-month outcomes were sustained through 36 months.” Oral and Paper Presentations: TearCare System Tear Break-up, Meibomian Gland, and Dry Eye Symptom Improvement for Cyclosporine-Treated Patients after Localized Heat Therapy Treatment (SAHARA Cross-Over/phase 2) – oral presentation on Sunday, April 7 at 3:30 PM ET at the BCEC Meeting level 2, room 259B. Lead author: Brandon Ayres, MDRapid Improvement in the Signs and Symptoms of Dry Eye Disease with Localized Heat Therapy (LHT) or Cyclosporine Ophthalmic Emulsion (CsA) (SAHARA subanalysis) – poster presentation. Lead author: Julio Echegoyen, MD, PhDLocalized Heat Therapy (LHT) Compared to Cyclosporine Ophthalmic Emulsion (CsA): A Subanalysis on Age, Gender, and Disease Burden (SAHARA subanalysis) – poster presentation. Lead author: Jennifer Loh, MD “These data once again support the conclusion that TearCare should be a preferred treatment for DED associated with meibomian gland dysfunction,” says Brandon Ayres, MD, of Wills Eye Hospital, Philadelphia, PA. “In phase 1 of the SAHARA trial, we found the interventional TearCare procedure provided statistically superior and sustained improvement in tear break-up time and multiple measures of meibomian gland secretion when compared to treatment with Restasis.3 In phase 2 (cross-over) of the study, we found that a single TearCare procedure improved signs and symptoms for patients beyond what was achieved with six months of Restasis.” Red Carpet EventAdditionally, at ASCRS, Sight Sciences will be hosting a red carpet event at its booth (#545), where the company will celebrate its shared commitment to elevating eyecare for the benefit of patients. The event will be on Saturday, April 6, 2024, from 3:45 PM to 4:30 PM ET.

The merger will create Holdco Nuvo Group D.G  and result in a new Nasdaq listing under the ticker symbols 'NUVO' and 'NUVOW'.,"LAMF Global Ventures Corp. I Shareholders Approve Previously Announced Business Combination with Nuvo Group Ltd. Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Nuvo Group and LAMF Global Ventures Corp. announced the approval of a business combination by LAMF's shareholders. The merger will create Holdco Nuvo Group D.G and result in a new Nasdaq listing under the ticker symbols 'NUVO' and 'NUVOW'. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The approval of the business combination between Nuvo Group Ltd. and LAMF Global Ventures Corp. I represents a pivotal development in the corporate strategy of both entities. The overwhelming support from LAMF's shareholders, with over 93.4% in favor, underscores the confidence the market has in the potential synergies of this merger. However, the redemption of shares by a significant number of shareholders, leading to a cash outflow from LAMF's trust account, indicates a level of dissent among investors regarding the future prospects of the combined entity.From a financial perspective, the decision by shareholders to redeem their shares at approximately $11.03 per share provides an immediate liquidity event for those investors, albeit at the potential cost of foregoing future growth. The remaining cash in the trust account post-redemption, approximately $434,982, may seem modest relative to the scale of such transactions, potentially impacting the combined company's immediate working capital post-merger. The small percentage of shares remaining outstanding, approximately 1.3%, could lead to increased volatility in the stock price post-merger due to lower liquidity.For the stock market, the expected listing of the combined company under the new ticker symbol 'NUVO' will introduce a new investment opportunity, especially in the healthcare technology sector. The performance of the new ticker will be closely watched by investors as an indicator of the merger's success. Market Research Analyst The merger between a remote pregnancy monitoring platform and a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) like LAMF reflects a trend in the healthcare industry towards increased digitization and remote care solutions. The positive vote for the merger indicates a market appetite for innovative healthcare technologies, which could be seen as a growth sector in the coming years.However, it is critical to analyze the market dynamics and the competitive landscape that NUVO will face post-merger. With the backdrop of a global push for telemedicine and remote health monitoring, the combined company must leverage its FDA clearance and capitalize on the current market trends to secure a strong market position. The adoption rate of their technology and the ability to scale operations will be key factors in determining their long-term success and impact on the stock market.Furthermore, the redemption rate and the small number of shares remaining could suggest that some investors are skeptical about the SPAC's ability to deliver long-term value. This sentiment could influence the initial performance of the 'NUVO' ticker, as investor perception often plays a significant role in stock valuation. Legal Expert The legal complexities of a merger involving multiple entities across different jurisdictions, such as the United States, Israel and the Cayman Islands, require careful scrutiny. The successful vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting indicates that the merger has been structured to comply with the regulatory requirements of each jurisdiction, including SEC regulations.Post-merger, the combined company will need to maintain transparency and adhere to the stringent reporting and compliance obligations of a Nasdaq-listed entity. The filing of the results with the SEC is a procedural step that ensures regulatory compliance and provides investors with critical information about the merger's outcome and the redemption of shares.It is also worth noting the legal right of shareholders to redeem their shares, which has been exercised in this case. This aspect of SPAC mergers offers investors an exit strategy, which can be appealing but also introduces an element of risk for the remaining shareholders and the newly formed company in terms of cash reserves and share liquidity. 04/02/2024 - 04:01 PM TEL AVIV, Israel and LOS ANGELES, April 2, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Nuvo Group Ltd.

Voters representing over 93.4% of the issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares of LAMF, par value $0.0001 per share (the ""LAMF Class A Ordinary Shares"") cast votes in favor of the proposal in connection with the business combination at the Extraordinary General Meeting. LAMF shareholders also voted to approve the proposal regarding the adoption of the plan of merger, presented at the Extraordinary General Meeting. In connection with the Extraordinary General Meeting, shareholders holding an aggregate of 2,913,194 LAMF Class A Ordinary Shares exercised their right to redeem their LAMF Class A Ordinary Shares for approximately $11.03 per share of the funds held in LAMF's trust account, leaving approximately $434,982 in cash in the trust account after satisfaction of such redemptions. 39,422 LAMF Class A Ordinary Shares (representing approximately 1.3% of the total LAMF Class A Ordinary Shares held by public shareholders prior to redemptions) will remain outstanding after satisfaction of such redemptions. LAMF plans to file the results of the Extraordinary General Meeting, as tabulated by the inspector of elections, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on a Current Report on Form 8-K. Upon closing of the transaction, which the parties are working to effect as soon as practicable, the combined company will operate as Holdco and is expected to be listed on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ""NUVO"", with warrants under the ticker symbol ""NUVOW.""

Mr. Green will succeed CEO, Paul Casey, who has announced his retirement and who will continue to serve on the Board of Directors. Mr. Green is a seasoned public company executive and healthcare IT leader, with more than 20 years of experience including an impressive track record of driving growth, leading business transformations and creating shareholder value. As President and CEO, Green will lead all facets of OneMedNet’s business involving its iRWD™ offering, including R&D, product, strategy, and sales across global markets.

Aaron’s past successes as a business leader within the healthcare IT industry and necessary relevant public company experience made him the perfect candidate to assume the CEO role upon my retirement. Since Aaron joined, I have confidence that Aaron’s many years of successful executive leadership coupled with the depth of his direct industry expertise offered the necessary talent to drive OneMedNet forward. Having worked daily with Aaron since he assumed the role of President, the time is right for us to complete this leadership transition.

(PLAY) announces financial results for Q4 and fiscal year 2023, with revenue growth, net income, adjusted EBITDA, and store openings. Despite revenue increases, pro forma combined comparable store sales declined. The company plans to open new stores domestically and internationally, focus on cost efficiency, and achieve a $1 billion Adjusted EBITDA target in the coming years. Positive Revenue increased by 6.3% in Q4 and 12.3% in fiscal year 2023 compared to the previous year. Net income for Q4 was $36.2 million, with adjusted net income of $42.0 million. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 was $151.8 million, representing a 9.7% increase. The company opened 16 new stores in fiscal year 2023 and completed test remodels of nine stores. Dave & Buster's repurchased 8.5 million shares totaling $300 million in fiscal year 2023. The company entered into an international franchise partnership agreement to develop two stores in the Dominican Republic. Dave & Buster's reduced the spread on its loans in Q4, resulting in over $5.0 million of annual interest savings. Negative Pro forma combined comparable store sales decreased in Q4 and fiscal year 2023. Despite revenue growth, net income decreased in Q4 compared to the previous year. The company's Net Total Leverage Ratio was 2.2x, nearing the maximum permitted ratio of 3.5x. Weather conditions significantly impacted Q4 2023 sales performance. Financial Analyst Upon reviewing Dave & Buster's Entertainment, Inc.'s fiscal year and fourth quarter financial results, several key aspects stand out. The company's revenue increase of 6.3% in the fourth quarter and 12.3% for the fiscal year indicates a positive trajectory in terms of growth. However, the reported decrease in pro forma combined comparable store sales by 7.0% in the fourth quarter and 6.2% for the fiscal year raises concerns about the underlying same-store performance, which is a important indicator of retail health.The significant share repurchase activity, with 17.5% of outstanding shares bought back and an additional $100 million authorization, suggests a strong balance sheet and a management confident in the intrinsic value of the company. This is further supported by the reduction in leverage, with a Net Total Leverage Ratio of 2.2x, well below the maximum permitted 3.5x. The company's ability to generate $97.2 million in operating cash flow and maintain a robust liquidity profile of $527.6 million, positions it favorably for future investments and growth initiatives.Investors should be mindful of the potential risks associated with the decrease in comparable store sales and the impact of macroeconomic factors on discretionary consumer spending. Nonetheless, the company's strategic expansion with new stores and international franchises, along with its focus on cost efficiency and margin improvement, could provide avenues for sustained growth. Market Research Analyst The entertainment and dining sector, where Dave & Buster's operates, is highly competitive and sensitive to consumer discretionary spending. The report of abnormally adverse weather affecting the fourth quarter performance highlights the vulnerability of brick-and-mortar entertainment venues to external factors. Moreover, the 8.0% increase in pro forma combined comparable store sales compared with the same period in 2019 indicates a recovery from pre-pandemic levels, but the recent downward trend could signal market saturation or shifts in consumer preferences.Expansion into the Dominican Republic through an international franchise partnership agreement is a strategic move to tap into new markets. However, the success of this venture will depend on the company's ability to adapt to local tastes and competition. The acceleration of the company's remodels, which have reportedly outperformed expectations, suggests a focus on enhancing the customer experience and could be a differentiator in retaining and attracting customers.Overall, while Dave & Buster's shows strong financial health and a commitment to growth, the challenge lies in maintaining same-store sales momentum and navigating an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Retail Industry Analyst Dave & Buster's performance reflects broader trends in the retail and hospitality sectors, where experience-based businesses are striving to differentiate themselves. The company's Adjusted EBITDA margin improvement is a positive indicator, reflecting efficient operations and the ability to manage costs effectively. The test remodels of nine stores and the plan to accelerate the portfolio-wide rollout could rejuvenate the brand and enhance customer engagement, which is vital for driving repeat business in a competitive landscape.The emphasis on organic growth initiatives and the anticipated opening of new domestic and international stores suggest a bullish outlook by the company on its expansion strategy. However, it is essential to monitor how these investments translate into sustained revenue growth, especially in light of the reported decrease in comparable store sales. The company's financial strategy, including the reduction of interest costs and the repricing of Term Loan B, demonstrates prudent financial management that could give it a competitive edge.Investors should consider the company's long-term growth strategy, including international expansion and store remodels, against the backdrop of its current performance metrics and industry trends. 04/02/2024 - 04:05 PM DALLAS, April 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dave & Buster's Entertainment, Inc., (NASDAQ: PLAY), (""Dave & Buster's"" or ""the Company""), an owner and operator of entertainment and dining venues, today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 4, 2024, which includes a 14th week in the fourth quarter and a 53rd week in the fiscal year, respectively.

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure commonly used in our industry and should not be construed as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because we believe that it provides useful information to investors and analysts regarding our operating performance. By reporting Adjusted EBITDA, we provide a basis for comparison of our business operations between current, past and future periods by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. A reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for period presented is provided below: Quarter Ended Fiscal Year Ended February 4, 2024 January 29, 2023 February 4, 2024 January 29, 2023Net income$36.2 6.0% $39.1 6.9% $ 126.9 5.8% $ 137.1 7.0%Add back: Interest expense, net 34.9 30.5 127.4 87.4 Loss on debt refinancing 4.9 — 16.1 1.5 Provision for income taxes 13.6 7.6 36.2 36.5 Depreciation and amortization expense 58.6 49.0 208.5 169.3 EBITDA 148.2 24.7% 126.2 22.4% 515.1 23.4% 431.8 22.0%Add back: Share-based compensation (1) 0.6 8.5 16.0 20.0 Transaction and integration costs (2) 1.5 3.0 11.1 25.3 System implementation costs (3) 3.2 — 9.4 — Other items, net (4) (1.7) 0.7 4.0 3.3 Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure$151.8 25.3% $138.4 24.5% $ 555.6 25.2% $ 480.4 24.5% (1)Non-cash share-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated comprehensive income statement.(2)Transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition and integration of Main Event recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated comprehensive income statement.(3)System implementation costs represent expenses incurred related to the development and launch of new enterprise resource planning, human capital management and inventory software for our stores and store support teams and staff augmentation for the implementation team at the store support center. These charges are primarily recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated comprehensive income statement.(4)Includes one-time, third-party consulting fees that are not part of our ongoing operations, impairment expenses and (gain) loss on property and equipment transactions. Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization: Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization, a non-GAAP measure, represents operating income, plus depreciation and amortization expense, general and administrative expenses and pre-opening costs. We believe that Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization is another useful measure in evaluating our operating performance because it removes the impact of general and administrative expenses, which are not incurred at the store level, and the costs of opening new stores, which are non-recurring at the store level, and thereby enables the comparability of the operating performance of our stores for the periods presented. We also believe that Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization is a useful measure in evaluating our operating performance within the entertainment and dining industry because it permits the evaluation of store-level productivity, efficiency, and performance, and we use Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization as a means of evaluating store financial performance compared with our competitors. However, because this measure excludes significant items such as general and administrative expenses and pre-opening costs, as well as our interest expense, net, loss on debt extinguishment/refinance and depreciation and amortization expense, which are important in evaluating our consolidated financial performance from period to period, the value of this measure is limited as a measure of our consolidated financial performance. A reconciliation of operating income to store operating income before depreciation and amortization for periods presented is provided below: Quarter Ended Year Ended February 4, 2024 January 29, 2023 February 4, 2024 January 29, 2023Operating income$ 89.6 15.0% $ 77.2 13.7% $ 306.6 13.9% $ 262.5 13.4%Add back: General and administrative expenses 30.6 39.0 122.6 137.8 Depreciation and amortization expense 58.6 49.0 208.5 169.3 Pre-opening costs 5.7 3.8 18.4 14.6 Store operating income before depreciation and amortization, a non-GAAP measure$ 184.5 30.8% $ 169.0 30.0% 656.1 29.8% 584.2 29.7% Credit Adjusted EBITDA and Net Total Leverage Ratio: Credit Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, represents Adjusted EBITDA plus certain other items as defined in our Credit Facility. Other adjustments include (i) entertainment revenue deferrals, (ii) the cost of new projects, including store pre-opening costs, (iii) business optimization expenses and other restructuring costs, and (iv) other costs and adjustments as permitted by the Debt Agreements. We believe the presentation of Credit Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate as it provides additional information to investors about the calculation of, and compliance with, certain financial covenants in the Credit Facility. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of Net income to Credit Adjusted EBITDA for the periods shown: Quarter Ended February 4, 2024 Trailing Four Quarters Ended February 4, 2024Net income$36.2 $ 126.9 Add back: Interest expense, net 34.9 127.4 Loss on debt refinancing 4.9 16.1 Provision for (benefit from) income taxes 13.6 36.2 Depreciation and amortization expense 58.6 208.5 EBITDA 148.2 515.1 Add back: Share-based compensation (1) 0.6 16.0 Transaction and integration costs (2) 1.5 11.1 System implementation costs (3) 3.2 9.4 Pre-opening costs (4) 5.7 18.4 Entertainment revenue deferrals (5) (1.8) 3.1 Other items, net (6) (1.7) 4.0 Credit Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure$ 155.7 $ 577.1 (1)Non-cash share-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated comprehensive income statement.(2)Transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition and integration of Main Event recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated comprehensive income statement.(3)System implementation costs represent expenses incurred related to the development and launch of new enterprise resource planning, human capital management and inventory software for our stores and store support teams.

These costs are considered a ""cost of new projects"" as defined in our Credit Facility.(5)Represents non-cash adjustments to our deferred entertainment revenue liabilities.

(Nasdaq: ZNTL), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company discovering and developing clinically differentiated small molecule therapeutics targeting fundamental biological pathways of cancers, will present a poster with new preclinical data at the 2024 Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) taking place in San Diego April 5-10, 2024. Research demonstrated that the Company’s WEE1 inhibitor, azenosertib, exerts synergistic anti-tumor activity when combined with KRASG12C inhibitors. ""As we advance azenosertib in multiple ongoing clinical studies, our understanding of its potential utility as a monotherapy and in combination across diverse tumor types and treatment settings continues to deepen,” said Mark Lackner, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of Zentalis. “By exploiting azenosertib’s mechanism, which targets common vulnerabilities related to cancer cell cycle dysregulation and high levels of replication stress and DNA damage, we sought to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of azenosertib in KRAS-driven cancers when combined with KRASG12C inhibitors. Our preclinical data demonstrate that combining azenosertib with KRASG12C inhibitors dramatically enhances anti-tumor activity. This compelling approach warrants further investigation as a potential treatment option for patients with KRASG12C tumors.” Azenosertib is a potent and selective inhibitor of WEE1, a master cell cycle regulator that acts to slow cell cycle progression and enable DNA repair. Inhibition of WEE1 by azenosertib suppresses key cell cycle checkpoints, preventing DNA repair and increasing DNA damage, resulting in mitotic catastrophe and cell death. Previous research has determined that cancer cells, which are often characterized by cell cycle dysregulation and high levels of DNA damage, are highly sensitive to azenosertib. KRAS is a potent oncogenic driver that results in unchecked cell cycle progression while increasing replication stress and accumulation of DNA damage. The research that will be presented at AACR Annual Meeting 2024 evaluated the anti-tumor activity of azenosertib when administered in combination with KRASG12C inhibitors sotorasib or adagrasib. The data demonstrated synergistic cell growth inhibition across a panel of KRASG12C cell lines in both 2D and 3D assays. Furthermore, administration of azenosertib in KRASG12C inhibitor-sensitive and resistant xenograft models, including using non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and pancreatic cancer cell lines, demonstrated monotherapy activity as well as synergistic tumor growth inhibition when combined with KRASG12C inhibitors. In addition, extended administration of azenosertib combined with KRASG12C inhibitors increased the duration of response versus single agent use. Together, these results support continued study of the potential for azenosertib to provide clinical benefit as a combination therapy.Poster Presentation Details Title: The selective WEE1 inhibitor azenosertib shows synergistic anti-tumor activity with KRASG12C inhibitors in multiple KRASG12C modelsAuthors: Jameson, N.M. et al.Date/Time: Tuesday, April 9, 2023 at 1:30 pm - 5:00 pm PTAbstract Number: 6487Session: Targeting Kinase and ERK Pathways About AzenosertibAzenosertib is a novel, selective, and orally bioavailable inhibitor of WEE1 currently being evaluated as a monotherapy and combination clinical studies in ovarian cancer and additional tumor types. WEE1 acts as a master regulator of the G1-S and G2-M cell cycle checkpoints, through negative regulation of both CDK1 and CDK2, to prevent replication of cells with damaged DNA. By inhibiting WEE1, azenosertib enables cell cycle progression, despite high levels of DNA damage, thereby resulting in the accumulation of DNA damage and leading to mitotic catastrophe and cancer cell death. About Zentalis Pharmaceuticals Zentalis® Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company discovering and developing clinically differentiated small molecule therapeutics targeting fundamental biological pathways of cancers. The Company’s lead product candidate, azenosertib (ZN-c3), is a potentially first-in-class and best-in-class WEE1 inhibitor for advanced solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. Azenosertib is being evaluated as a monotherapy and in combination across multiple clinical trials and has broad franchise potential. In clinical trials, azenosertib has been well tolerated and has demonstrated anti-tumor activity as a single agent across multiple tumor types and in combination with several chemotherapy backbones.

(IRDM) completes the acquisition of Satelles, Inc., becoming a leader in secure satellite-based time and location services. The new Iridium Satellite Time and Location (STL) service enhances GPS security for critical infrastructure, data centers, 5G base stations, and various sectors. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The completion of Iridium Communications' acquisition of Satelles marks a strategic expansion into satellite-based time and location services. This move could potentially open up new revenue streams and consolidate Iridium's market position. The integration of Iridium Satellite Time and Location (STL) into their existing portfolio diversifies their offerings and provides a hedge against vulnerabilities in GPS and GNSS systems. By providing a solution that is resistant to spoofing and jamming, Iridium addresses a critical need for secure communication, which is especially relevant in sectors like aviation and maritime where safety and reliability are paramount.From a market perspective, this acquisition could enhance Iridium's appeal to investors who are looking for companies with a robust and diversified service offering. Additionally, the fact that the service can be integrated by Iridium's large ecosystem of partners suggests potential for widespread adoption, which could translate into significant long-term revenue growth. However, it's important to monitor how quickly the market adopts these new services and whether Iridium can maintain a competitive edge as other players may look to offer similar solutions. Financial Analyst Financially, the acquisition of Satelles by Iridium Communications could have meaningful implications for the company's balance sheet and income statement. The initial investment and associated costs of the acquisition will need to be scrutinized against the potential increase in revenue from STL services. Investors should look for increases in operating expenses in the short term, as integrations of this nature typically involve significant upfront costs. However, if the STL service is as scalable and in-demand as suggested, there could be a positive impact on the company's profit margins over time.Another financial aspect to consider is the potential for Iridium to leverage STL services to enter into long-term contracts with clients in critical sectors, which would provide a stable and predictable cash flow. The ability to secure critical infrastructure and 5G base stations could also position Iridium favorably as these technologies continue to expand globally. The company's next few quarterly reports will be key in assessing the financial success of this acquisition. Cybersecurity Expert From a cybersecurity standpoint, the acquisition of Satelles by Iridium Communications is a significant development. The reliance on GPS and other GNSS systems for critical infrastructure and data centers comes with inherent risks of spoofing and jamming, which can lead to severe disruptions. Iridium's STL solution offers an additional layer of security that is becoming increasingly necessary as threats to global positioning systems grow more sophisticated. By using small, low-cost hardware that doesn't require outdoor antennas, Iridium is lowering the barrier to entry for enhanced security measures.For businesses and sectors that are particularly vulnerable to these risks, such as aviation and maritime, the value proposition of STL services is clear. The ability to secure time-synchronized applications is not just a technical improvement; it's a business necessity that could prevent potentially catastrophic events. As cyber threats continue to evolve, the demand for such secure solutions is likely to increase, positioning Iridium as a key player in this niche market. 04/02/2024 - 04:01 PM MCLEAN, Va., April 2, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Iridium Communications Inc.

The Company extinguishes repurchase obligations of approximately US$183 million and participates in Series C fundraising of the Hangzhou Company for US$19 million. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The completion of I-Mab's divestiture transaction, involving the transfer of equity interest from I-Mab Shanghai to the Hangzhou Company, represents a significant liquidity event for the firm. From a financial perspective, this transaction alters the capital structure of I-Mab by reducing its repurchase obligations substantially, by approximately US$183 million. This reduction in liabilities can improve the company's balance sheet and potentially its credit rating, which may lead to reduced borrowing costs in the future.Additionally, the contingent consideration of up to US$80 million tied to regulatory and sales milestones can provide future cash inflows. However, these are uncertain and dependent on the Hangzhou Company's performance. Investors should note that such contingent deals can be quite common in the biotech industry, where future revenues are often unpredictable and tied to drug development success.Lastly, I-Mab's participation in the Series C fundraising of the Hangzhou Company signals a strategic investment, which could yield substantial returns if the Hangzhou Company's therapies succeed in the market. However, such investments are also risky, particularly in the biotech sector where the success rate of therapies can be low. Market Research Analyst The divestiture of I-Mab Shanghai and the subsequent financial maneuvers indicate a strategic repositioning of I-Mab within the biotech market. By divesting a part of its business, I-Mab is likely aiming to streamline operations and focus on its core competencies in developing immunotherapies for cancer. This could be seen as a positive move by the market, as specialization often leads to greater efficiency and innovation.Moreover, the extinguishment of repurchase obligations and the investment in the Hangzhou Company could be interpreted as a sign of confidence in the latter's potential. This may attract investor interest in both I-Mab and the Hangzhou Company. However, the actual impact on the stock price would depend on the market's perception of the transaction's long-term value creation potential versus the immediate reduction in capital available to I-Mab due to the cash outlay for the Series C investment. Legal Expert In transactions such as the one described, it is important to understand the legal implications of the transfer of equity interests and the extinguishment of repurchase obligations. The fact that the transaction has closed successfully indicates that all legal hurdles, including regulatory approvals and satisfaction of contractual conditions, have been navigated effectively.Investors should be aware that the legal structuring of such deals can have significant tax implications and can also affect shareholder rights. The transfer on a cash-free and debt-free basis is typically designed to make the transaction as clean as possible, potentially avoiding the transfer of liabilities that could affect the valuation of the equity interests involved.Furthermore, the contingent nature of part of the consideration introduces an element of legal complexity and potential for future disputes if there is disagreement over whether the milestones have been met. It is important for stakeholders to closely monitor the fulfillment of these milestones to gauge the likelihood of receiving the contingent payments. 04/02/2024 - 04:01 PM ROCKVILLE, Md., April 2, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- I-Mab (the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: IMAB) a U.S.-based, global biotech company, exclusively focused on the development and potential commercialization of highly differentiated immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer, today announced that all conditions precedent to the divestiture transaction previously announced on February 7, 2024 (the ""Transaction"") have been either satisfied or waived and accordingly, the Transaction has successfully closed.

(OTC: OCLN) announced a strategic partnership with Kevin Harrington to promote its crowdfunding campaign. The company aims to address global water scarcity issues with its disruptive water technology platform. Investors can reserve a position in the campaign and support OriginClear's innovative solutions. Positive None. Negative None. Environmental Technology Analyst OriginClear's partnership with Kevin Harrington is an interesting move to garner attention for their crowdfunding campaign. Harrington's celebrity status could potentially increase visibility and attract investors. However, the effectiveness of celebrity endorsements in crowdfunding is variable and depends on the alignment between the endorser's image and the company's mission.Water On Demand™, as described, seems to offer a comprehensive approach to water treatment and recycling, integrating financing and technology. This could address a significant gap in the market, given the increasing stress on water resources globally. The 'pod' technology could allow for scalability and adaptability in various industrial and agricultural settings.The merger with Fortune Rise Acquisition Corporation (FRLA) indicates a strategic move towards rapid growth, using the SPAC route to go public. It's important to note that SPACs have been under increased scrutiny due to concerns over inflated valuations and regulatory oversight. Investors should be cautious and consider the long-term viability and operational capabilities of OriginClear beyond the initial hype. Financial Analyst OriginClear's majority ownership in Water On Demand, Inc. (WODI) could be significant for investors, particularly with the announcement of a Business Combination with Fortune Rise Acquisition Corporation (NASDAQ-FRLA). This move may streamline the process of going public, potentially providing liquidity and capital for expansion.However, the nature of FRLA as a 'shell company' with no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash poses risks. The lack of operating revenues until after the completion of a business combination means that the investment is speculative and based on the future performance of the merged entity.Investors should perform due diligence on OriginClear's financials, the specifics of the 'pod' technology and the projected growth trajectory post-merger. While the water sector presents a significant growth opportunity, the success of such ventures often hinges on technology adoption, market penetration and competitive landscape. Sustainability Investment Advisor The water treatment and recycling industry is becoming increasingly important as water scarcity issues intensify. OriginClear's focus on industry and agriculture as primary customers for water treatment is strategically sound, given these sectors' substantial water usage and pollution contributions.Investments in water technology platforms like OriginClear could be seen as impact investments, which aim to generate social and environmental benefits alongside financial returns. The long-term potential for wealth creation in the water sector is significant, but it requires careful consideration of sustainability factors, regulatory compliance and the adoption rate of new technologies.Investors interested in sustainability should evaluate OriginClear's environmental impact, the efficacy of its water treatment solutions and the company's alignment with global water conservation goals. While the prospect of contributing to a solution for water scarcity is appealing, it is essential to balance this with a realistic assessment of the company's capacity to deliver on its promises and generate returns. 04/02/2024 - 04:00 PM Everyday investors can now reserve a position in a highly disruptive water technology platform CLEARWATER, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- OriginClear, Inc. (OTC Other: OCLN), the Clean Water Innovation Hub™, today announced that it will further its strategic partnership with Kevin Harrington, an original “shark” on the hit TV show Shark Tank, and co-founding board member of the Entrepreneur’s Organization, to bring critical global attention to OriginClear's crowdfunding campaign, now in a preview invitational stage.

They win, and the rest of us get better and more abundant water while averting this disaster.” Harrington added, “OriginClear has built Water On Demand™, a disruptive water business, which provides end to end solutions and financing for water projects. OriginClear’s subsidiary Water On Demand, Inc. (WODI) combines project financing, a veteran engineering company, and downsized ‘pod’ technology, all to serve the new breed of treat-in-place commercial water recycling and treatment systems. Investors can benefit from OriginClear’s current majority ownership in WODI, while also helping to build future world class companies. Water has the unique distinction of being both the world's most vital asset and in my view, holds the potential to become the largest wealth creation opportunity of our lifetime.” In October of 2023, WODI announced the signing of a Business Combination with Fortune Rise Acquisition Corporation (NASDAQ-FRLA) which contemplates the merger of WODI with and into FRLA. FRLA is a blank check company incorporated in February 2021 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses. FRLA is a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, because it has no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash. FRLA will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial business combination, at the earliest. To date, FRLA’s efforts have been limited to organizational activities and activities related to its initial public offering as well as the search for a prospective business combination target. About OriginClear Once a government monopoly, the business of treating and reusing sewage water is going private. Local industries and communities are now treating-in-place, enabling large-scale recycling while also responding to the challenge of water scarcity and climate change. OriginClear’s approach is dramatically simple: support that new trend and open the door to everyday investors. Get live weekly updates every Thursday by signing up at www.originclear.com/ceo.

The focus on employee experience has increased due to worker demands for flexibility and a tight labor market, impacting enterprises with hourly workers in retail, manufacturing, healthcare, and hospitality.","Employee Experience, Agile Work Driving Advances in Workforce Management Software Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Companies are adopting workforce management software to enhance employee experience and optimize agile workforces, as per a study by Ventana Research. The focus on employee experience has increased due to worker demands for flexibility and a tight labor market, impacting enterprises with hourly workers in retail, manufacturing, healthcare, and hospitality. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Advancements in workforce management software are indicative of broader market trends, where efficiency and employee satisfaction converge. With the integration of smart forecasting and agile scheduling, companies can anticipate customer demands and align their staffing accordingly. This proactive approach can lead to cost savings by reducing overstaffing during low-demand periods and ensuring adequate coverage during peak times, which in turn can improve the company's bottom line.Moreover, the inclusion of comprehensive absence management and precise time and activity tracking can mitigate compliance risks associated with labor laws and regulations. By automating these processes, businesses reduce the likelihood of human error and the potential for costly legal repercussions. The use of such technologies can thus be seen as a strategic move to safeguard against operational and financial vulnerabilities. Human Capital Management Expert The emphasis on employee experience (EX) within workforce management software reflects an evolving labor market where workers increasingly value flexibility and autonomy. By fostering a culture of self-service and open communication, companies can boost employee engagement and productivity. Engaged employees are more likely to contribute positively to the company's culture and customer service, which can be a competitive differentiator in industries with high customer interaction, such as retail and hospitality.Furthermore, integrating gig workers into the staffing mix offers businesses the ability to scale their workforce in response to fluctuating demands. This flexibility can be particularly beneficial for sectors with variable peak periods. However, it's important to note that relying on gig workers also presents challenges in maintaining a consistent company culture and ensuring quality standards. Technology Integration Specialist Workforce management software has become more than a simple administrative tool; it's now a strategic enabler that integrates into daily processes. The seamless integration of such software into existing systems is important for adoption and utility. When workforce management tools are perceived as 'additive' rather than disruptive, employees are more likely to embrace the technology, leading to higher utilization and more accurate data collection.Successful integration requires a deep understanding of the company's operational workflows and the ability to customize software features to meet specific needs. Businesses must ensure that their technology investments are compatible with their existing infrastructure and they should consider the long-term scalability of these solutions to accommodate future growth. 04/02/2024 - 03:32 PM Companies are turning to Workforce Management software to streamline processes and foster a culture of self-service, open communication and teamwork, new study says STAMFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Companies looking to enhance employee experience (EX) and maximize the performance of increasingly agile workforces are driving advances in workforce management software, according to a new study from Ventana Research, the software research business of Information Services Group (ISG) (Nasdaq: III), a leading global technology research and advisory firm. The 2024 Ventana Research Buyers Guides for Workforce Management note the focus on EX has grown steadily in recent years amid worker demands for greater flexibility and a tight labor market. At the same time, enterprises are challenged by workplace logistics and the need to optimize labor. These dynamics continue to impact organizations, particularly enterprises with substantial numbers of hourly workers like those in retail, manufacturing, healthcare and hospitality, the study says. “Workforce management software providers are paying attention to what is really impacting workers and those that manage them,” said Matthew Brown, director, Human Capital Management Research, at ISG’s Ventana Research. “They are developing and delivering capabilities that build trust and confidence in technology and its ability to seamlessly integrate into daily processes and behaviors in a way that feels additive more than ever before.” At its heart, workforce management software is like “the supportive backbone of a company,” the study says, offering a suite of tools that streamline processes and foster a culture of self-service, open communication and teamwork. The key components of today’s workforce management software are smart forecasting, agile scheduling, comprehensive absence management and precise time and activity tracking. By ensuring the right people with the right skills are in the right place at the right time, organizations can efficiently and profitably meet customer needs and business demands. “For business leaders, workforce management is a dynamic puzzle that involves understanding not just who is available but who works best together, how to manage staffing levels and how to leverage diverse talents, including those of gig workers. It’s about seeing both the big picture and the fine details,” Brown said. Software providers continue to integrate AI and ML capabilities into their workforce management products, the study says. Such capabilities will permit scheduling that benefits both employee and company, enable seamless fulfillment of time-off requests balanced with customer needs and provide virtual assistants to improve efficiency and job satisfaction. Time recording will be enhanced with finger scans and facial recognition, and advanced analytics will enable managers to accurately forecast labor demand. Mobile-first product strategies are the norm in workforce management software, the study notes, with advanced mobile capabilities increasingly connecting workers with targeted learning opportunities that make them eligible for certain shifts or jobs as part of normal workflows.

The transaction is expected to close in Q2 2024, pending customary conditions. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The approval by M.D.C. Holdings' stockholders of the merger with Sekisui House represents a significant shift in the company's structure and future strategy. The buyout price of US$63.00 per share provides a clear exit strategy for current investors and could reflect a premium over the recent trading price, which is a common practice in acquisition scenarios to incentivize shareholder agreement. The near-unanimous vote indicates strong stockholder alignment with the company's decision, which can be interpreted as confidence in the strategic benefits of the merger.Looking at the potential market implications, this merger could enhance MDC's operational capabilities and market reach, given Sekisui House's international presence. For the homebuilding industry, this deal might signal a consolidation trend, which could lead to increased competition among the top players. Investors should monitor the execution of the merger and any regulatory hurdles that could affect the timeline and finalization of the deal.

This move could disrupt the current market dynamics by combining MDC's local expertise with Sekisui House's global experience and resources. The merger's success will likely hinge on the integration of corporate cultures and systems, an aspect that can be challenging but is important for realizing the anticipated synergies.From a market perspective, the transaction may lead to a reevaluation of MDC's market share and competitive positioning. Stakeholders should consider the possible effects on supplier relationships, cost structures and product offerings. Additionally, the increased scale may provide MDC with better bargaining power and efficiency, which could translate into improved margins and profitability in the long run.

The investment aims to align interests with clients, accelerate business growth, and attract top professionals. Azimut Alternative Capital Partners, will divest its minority equity interest. The investment will not impact Kennedy Lewis' operations. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The minority investment by Petershill into Kennedy Lewis Investment Management can be a strategic move for the latter, potentially enhancing its capacity for growth and expansion. The infusion of capital typically allows a firm to invest in talent and operational capabilities, which can lead to increased competitiveness in the credit market. Kennedy Lewis' commitment to maintaining its existing investment process and management team indicates stability and continuity for clients and investors.From a financial perspective, the divestment of AACP's stake and the new partnership with Petershill could be seen as a reconfiguration of Kennedy Lewis' shareholder structure, potentially providing a fresh perspective and additional resources. For stakeholders, the alignment of interests with a well-regarded entity like Petershill may signal confidence in Kennedy Lewis' future prospects.However, it's important to monitor how the partnership evolves over time, ensuring that the 'passive' nature of the investment does not shift, which could affect the firm's strategic direction. Additionally, one must consider the broader market conditions and how Kennedy Lewis' opportunistic, industry-focused approach will perform, particularly in a fluctuating economic landscape. Market Research Analyst The private credit sector, where Kennedy Lewis operates, has seen increased interest from investors seeking alternatives to traditional fixed income investments. The firm's focus on specialized areas of the credit markets that are underserved by traditional lenders is a competitive advantage, as it can cater to a niche demand.Petershill's investment could be interpreted as a positive market signal, potentially attracting further interest from investors looking for firms with strong backing and growth potential. The emphasis on Kennedy Lewis' ability to provide attractive potential returns and diversification could resonate well with investors seeking to hedge against market volatility.It is also worth noting that the exit of AACP and the entry of Petershill may affect the dynamics within the GP Staking landscape.

Inflation concerns prompt a shift in consumer behavior towards intentional spending. Positive None. Negative None. 04/02/2024 - 03:00 PM Entertainment pricing is soaring, leading consumers to re-evaluate their spending SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Today TiVo, a wholly owned subsidiary of entertainment technology company Xperi Inc. (NYSE: XPER), found in its Q4 2023 Video Trends Report that consumers are reevaluating how much they are spending on entertainment and the ways they enjoy it. With inflation top of mind for many, consumers are becoming more intentional about where they spend their dollars – especially as the number of video services options increases and content discovery continues to remain an issue. In 2023, the overall monthly spend on video services dropped by around $13, with users utilizing 4.0 non-paid services – doubling from 2.4 in 2021 – indicating ad-tolerance is at an all-time high (62.8%). The shift in reduced spending signals the entertainment industry’s emergence from a period of growth characterized by changes in TV viewing habits to a new period of stabilization. In addition to the increase in ad-supported video on demand (AVOD) and free ad-supported streaming TV (FAST) consumption, 20.0% of respondents shared that they feel they have too many services and 62.5% admitted to reducing their entertainment spend in light of recent economic inflation. In response to the industry shift from a growth to a profit mindset, and the change in consumer viewing behavior, video service providers started developing “hit” original series to draw in new subscribers and retain current customers. Even with these efforts, the gap between users adding and canceling subscription video on demand (SVOD) services has decreased by 4.4 percentage points as consumers are now canceling services almost as often as they are adding new ones. Consumers are showing they are not afraid to leave a service if they can’t justify the cost – making cost the leading reason for SVOD cancellations (21.3%). On the other hand, Pay TV churn risk declines as 63.7% of respondents are cord-revivers, resubscribing to Pay TV in the last 6 months, with 33.8% reporting that they couldn’t get all the entertainment they were looking for without it. “The post-covid U.S. streaming market is maturing rapidly and we’re seeing OTT service providers raising subscription fees to test the limits of consumer entertainment budgets. This trend pushes consumers to balance their media diets (and pocketbooks) with FAST/AVOD services resulting in more churn, lower spend and increased use of non-paid services,” said Scott Maddux, VP of global content strategy and business at Xperi. “In the end this is a win-win, as major media companies are monetizing at both ends of the spectrum (subscription AND ad-supported) and consumers have more options.” As consumers continue to proceed with caution on their entertainment journeys, video service providers will continue to work to capture the attention of viewers and keep their retention rates climbing. With the entertainment industry shifting to focus more on profit over growth, 2024 will be a year of change as video service providers step into the future of what it means to watch video. Additional TiVo Video Trend Report Highlights Let’s Get Personal: When it comes to content recommendations, personalized recommendations from streaming services still fall short of word of mouth and organic interactions in daily life as 45.9% of respondents go to 2 or 3 streaming apps before settling on something to watch. TVOD Is Sticking Around: While movie theaters are making a well-deserved comeback, consumers are still interested in using transactional video on demand (TVOD) services to enjoy new releases from home, with 52.3% of respondents saying they used TVOD services in 2023 – an increase from the year prior. You Can Watch Where?: With consumers watching an average of 4.7 hours per day, many are splitting their time watching content on their phones (60.3%), TVs (78.2%), and even in their vehicles (38.0%). In addition to traditional entertainment like TV shows and movies, social video is rising in popularity climbing from 14.7% in Q4 2022 to 17.1% in Q4 2023. Your Phone and TV are a Match Made in Heaven: QR codes remain the most commonly used interactive ad method, as well as the one most commonly recognized by respondents (40.2%). Gen Z is most likely to tap an interactive commercial on a tablet or phone (40.7%) while Millennials are the most likely to utilize QR codes in a TV show or commercial (35.9%).

Access to water is a human right, yet, 2.2 billion people live without safely managed drinking water services. Water is also at the heart of adaptation to climate change, serving as the crucial link between the climate system, human society and the environment. This year's theme for World Water Day is ""Water for Peace,"" which focuses on water's vital role in creating a more stable and prosperous world.As part of Cisco's Purpose to Power and Inclusive Future for All, we invest in solutions that build resiliency for communities, individuals and natural ecosystems, including equitable access to clean and affordable drinking water.Cisco and the Cisco Foundation, through our cash grant programs and technology donations to nonprofit organizations, support organizations that are working to raise awareness of global water issues, increase access to safe drinking water, and protect this precious natural resource. It's one example of how our social impact and environmental sustainability efforts come together in support of an inclusive future. In honor of World Water Day, we would like to shine a spotlight on four of these nonprofits - to learn more about them, please keep reading!Cool.orgCool.org has supported educators and parents with online, real-world, evidence-based education resources for 15 years.With an emphasis on environmental sustainability, Cool weaves content from industry experts and scientific organizations to create real-world resources that empower students to address big environmental challenges.Since 2019, Cisco has been instrumental in supporting Cool to ensure their platform and systems are best in class. This support has played a crucial role in the development of their new educator-customized platform, saving time for educators and ensuring access to exceptional resources for all educators globally.Cool creates and supplies teaching resources about water - from the water cycle to marine biology, from hydropower to geothermal energy, from conservation and adaptations. These resources provide teachers with a myriad of opportunities to bring water into the classroom. Through engaging activities, students can explore the wonders of water through Cool resources and develop a profound appreciation for its role in sustaining all life on Earth.Join For WaterJoin For Water changes lives by guaranteeing water for people and for nature. They operate in Benin, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Mali, Uganda, Ecuador and Peru. Their projects focus on drinking water, water for food production, sanitation, environmental management, and conscious water consumption in upper income countries.Starting in 2020, Cisco provided several product grants of both hardware and subscriptions to Join For Water. Initially these grants consisted of five collaboration endpoints and supporting Webex subscription, which allowed for improved inter-office collaboration. The most recent grant in 2023 provided a complete Meraki network solution, now installed in the Belgian office. Cisco is currently working with Join For Water and a Cisco partner to equip five of the remote offices with a similar Meraki network, allowing for a more secure and easy experience in managing their global network.These donations have helped Join For Water reduce costs and CO2 emissions related to airplane travel. They have also enhanced connections between teams in Africa and South America that used to work separately from each other.Join For Water says that Cisco support is contributing to their efforts to improve quality of life for 420,000 people over 5 years - most of them women. This includes enabling 67,000 people to get access to decent drinking water, 50,000 farmers to produce sufficient food through irrigated fields, and 7,000 people, mainly school children, to gain improved access to toilets. Join For Water also anticipates protecting and conserving 237,000 hectares of freshwater ecosystems during that five-year period (2022 through 2026).WaterAidWaterAid transforms lives by improving access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) in the world's poorest communities. They work with local partners and influence decision-makers to maximize their impact.With 40 years as an industry leader, WaterAid places special emphasis on evidence-based, sustainable solutions that help communities prosper in the long term. They strengthen systems at the community and the national level. WaterAid has reached 29 million people with clean water, 29 million people with decent toilets and 28 million people with good hygiene.WaterAid is working to transform the lives of people in rural La Guajira, Colombia, who are forced to drink untreated water, exposing them to a range of deadly diseases, microbiological contaminants, elevated salinity levels, and heavy metals.Thanks to a Regional Solutions Grant from the Cisco Foundation in 2023, WaterAid rolled out the first mobile water quality lab in La Guajira. By analyzing water quality data, communities can identify maintenance and repair needs, ensuring the longevity and effectiveness of water systems. Now there are fewer gastrointestinal illnesses, cases of dehydration, and related fatalities. The partnership has been key to multiplying the impact of a large-scale WASH investment project recently launched by WaterAid and Colombia's Ministry of Housing.One Acre FundOne Acre Fund supports smallholder farmers in nine countries across sub-Saharan Africa in gaining the knowledge and means to achieve big harvests, support healthy families, and cultivate rich soil. One Acre Fund is now elevating their farmer-facing model with technology and is pursuing a remote-sensing strategy to offer farmers data-driven recommendations that will improve their farm yields and offer critical climate protection. This guidance may include an alert for when a major shock like a flood is coming.Providing accurate flood prediction is crucial because in recent years, heavy seasonal rains in East Africa have increasingly led to devastating floods. Poor land management practices and extreme droughts can lead to erosion and dry soil, reducing the land's ability to absorb water and increasing surface runoff during heavy rains. For farmers that are heavily reliant on rain-fed agriculture, flooding can lead to crop destruction, loss of livestock, damage to infrastructure such as irrigation systems and roads, and displacement of local communities, all of which can pose threats to livelihoods and food security in the region.In many countries in the Global North, flood maps are usually made using stream gauges that track rising water levels, which are not readily available in East Africa due to limited financial resources and poor infrastructure. Cisco Foundation supports One Acre Fund's pilot program to develop remote sensing capabilities through analysis of data from modeling programs and on-the-ground validation.Learn more about how Cisco and the Cisco Foundation support nonprofit organizations on our ESG Reporting Hub.View original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-inc Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View the original press release on accesswire.com What is the theme of World Water Day 2024 according to Cisco Systems Inc.?

Our technology is based on our proprietary cell-therapy platform that uses a patient’s own stem cells to regenerate and restore function to damaged organs. We believe that our technology represents a next-generation solution for restoring organ function because it allows the patient to regenerate their own organ, thus eliminating the need for human donor or animal transplants, the sacrifice of another of the patient’s own organs or permanent artificial implants. We conducted the world’s first successful regeneration of the esophagus in a patient with esophageal cancer in August 2017. This surgery was performed by Dr. Dennis Wigle, Chair of Thoracic Surgery at the Mayo Clinic. The results were published in the Journal of Thoracic Oncology Clinical and Research Reports in August 2021. The procedure demonstrated that our technology was able to successfully regenerate esophageal tissue, including the mucosal lining, to restore the integrity, continuity and functionality of the esophageal tube. HRGN has 13 issued U.S. patents, 2 issued in China, 1 issued in Japan, 2 issued in Europe and 2 orphan-drug designations which can provide seven years of market exclusivity once we won the market approval.

Market Research Analyst The new partnership between Gray Television and CBS for market research and consulting services is a strategic move that could potentially influence the competitive landscape of television broadcasting. By leveraging the Strat Team's expertise, CBS aims to enhance its market insights and strategic planning, which is essential in an industry where audience preferences and consumption patterns are constantly evolving.From a market research perspective, the collaboration could lead to more targeted and effective content strategies for CBS's owned-and-operated stations. The ability to understand and anticipate viewer demands can drive advertising revenue and audience loyalty, two critical factors for the financial health of any broadcaster. Analyzing viewer data and engagement metrics will be key in crafting programming that resonates with audiences and outperforms competitors.Furthermore, this partnership may signal a trend where broadcasters increasingly rely on specialized research teams to navigate the complexities of the digital age. The emphasis on data-driven storytelling and digital strategies reflects the industry's shift towards multi-platform content distribution and the need to monetize online viewership effectively. Financial Analyst Investors should monitor the financial implications of this partnership for Gray Television, as it represents a diversification of revenue streams beyond traditional advertising. The deal with CBS could provide Gray with a stable source of income from consulting services, potentially improving its financial robustness. It is also indicative of Gray's ability to scale its services beyond its own network, which may open up additional growth opportunities in the future.However, it's important to consider the costs associated with expanding the Strat Team's capabilities and whether this investment will yield a significant return. Investors will be looking at the subsequent quarterly reports to gauge the impact of this partnership on Gray's bottom line. If successful, it could lead to similar deals with other networks, further strengthening Gray's market position.While this deal is not likely to cause immediate fluctuations in the stock market, it is a development that long-term investors might view positively if it leads to sustained revenue growth and a stronger competitive edge for Gray Television. 04/02/2024 - 02:00 PM ATLANTA, April 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gray Television, Inc.

Focus on improving gross profit through pricing strategies and cost efficiencies. Cash position decreased to $0.23 million by the end of 2023. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported revenue increase of 54% for EzFill Holdings, Inc. is a significant indicator of the company's growth trajectory, especially in the context of the mobile fueling industry. This sector is characterized by its capital-intensive nature and the necessity to achieve scale for profitability. The addition of 148 new fleet accounts suggests a robust expansion strategy, tapping into the recurring revenue model that fleet contracts typically offer.However, it is worth noting the reported net loss, which, despite decreasing by 40%, still indicates that the company is in a growth phase and has not yet reached profitability. Investors often scrutinize such metrics to gauge the sustainability of a company's growth. The increase in average fuel margin per gallon by 44% is also a positive sign, suggesting improved operational efficiency or pricing power, both of which are critical for margin expansion in this industry. Financial Analyst The reduction in operating expenses by 42% and the reported gross profit of $1.3 million for EzFill are pivotal for understanding the company's financial health. A decrease in operating expenses can reflect improved operational efficiency or cost-cutting measures, both of which can enhance profitability margins. Nevertheless, the balance sheet reflects a concerning cash position of $0.23 million, a significant drop from the previous year's $2.1 million. This liquidity position may raise concerns about the company's ability to sustain operations without additional financing.The increase in interest expense year over year due to loans taken to fund operations is another critical point of analysis. It indicates reliance on external financing, which could be a red flag for potential investors looking for financially independent operations. Moreover, the impairment recorded on materials for constructing delivery vehicles suggests potential overestimation of asset values in the past or changes in strategy that impacted the expected realizable value of these assets. Energy Sector Analyst Within the energy sector, the mobile fueling industry is becoming increasingly competitive and EzFill's performance must be contextualized within this environment. The company's ability to increase its average margin per gallon in a year with volatile gas prices is commendable. This resilience against market volatility is a testament to the company's pricing strategy and cost management. The growth in gallons delivered by 63% also indicates that the demand for mobile fueling services is on the rise, possibly driven by convenience and the growth of fleet services requiring on-site fueling solutions.Looking ahead, the company's focus on enhancing technology offerings could be a strategic move to differentiate itself from competitors and add value to its services. However, the long-term sustainability of this growth will depend on the company's ability to continue improving its gross profit and managing operating costs amidst the challenges of fluctuating fuel prices and the capital-intensive nature of the industry. 04/02/2024 - 01:33 PM — 2023 Revenue Increased 54% year over year to $23.2 Million From $15.0 Million – — Reports first year with a gross profit of $1.3 million — — Gallons delivered increased 63% year over year to 5.8 million from 3.5 million in 2022 — — Average Fuel Margin per Gallon Rose 44% to $0.65 Compared to $0.45 in 2022 — — Net loss decreased 40% an approx. $7 million reduction from prior year — — 148 New Fleet Accounts Added in 2023 — MIAMI, FL, April 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- EzFill Holdings, Inc.

The additional gallons were in existing as well as new markets. ●Cost of sales was $21,845,574 for the year ended December 31, 2023, resulting in a gross profit of $1,370,849, compared to $(173,513) for the prior year.

For further information, please contact: Investor and Media ContactTelx, Inc.Paula LunaPaula@Telxcomputers.com Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use non-GAAP measures. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure which we use in our financial performance analyses. This measure should not be considered a substitute for GAAP-basis measures, nor should it be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of net interest expense, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock compensation expense, provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of our financial results. Non-GAAP measures are not formally defined by GAAP, and other entities may use calculation methods that differ from ours for the purposes of calculating Adjusted EBITDA. As a complement to GAAP financial measures, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA assists investors who follow the practice of some investment analysts who adjust GAAP financial measures to exclude items that may obscure underlying performance and distort comparability. The following is a reconciliation of net loss to the non-GAAP financial measure referred to as Adjusted EBITDA for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (unaudited): Three Months Ended December 31, Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net loss $(3,427,569) $(6,290,176) $(10,471,889) $(17,505,765)Interest expense, net 752,922 13,802 1,719,296 19,486 Depreciation and amortization 279,049 492,514 1,108,186 1,769,622 Impairment changes 105,506 2,894,516 105,506 2,894,516 Stock compensation 835,857 266,811 1,525,146 1,412,283 Adjusted EBITDA $(1,454,235) $(2,622,533) $(6,013,755) $(11,409,858) EzFill Holdings, Inc.Consolidated Statements of Operations Three Months Ended December 31, Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 REVENUES Revenues $5,690,746 $4,858,818 $23,216,423 $15,044,721 TOTAL REVENUES 5,690,746 4,858,818 23,216,423 15,044,721 COSTS & EXPENSES Cost of Sales 5,316,544 4,930,057 21,845,574 15,218,234 Operating expenses 2,837,210 5,712,622 9,087,223 15,543,145 Depreciation and amortization 279,049 492,514 1,108,186 1,769,621 TOTAL COSTS AND EXPENSES 8,432,803 11,135,193 32,040,983 32,531,000 OPERATING LOSS (2,742,057) (6,276,375) (8,824,560) (17,486,279) OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES Interest and other income 67,410 25,621 99,127 84,603 Interest expense (752,922) (39,422) (1,719,296) (98,834)Loss on sale of marketable debt securities - net 0 0 27,160 5,255 LOSS BEFORE INCOME TAXES (3,427,569) (6,290,176) (10,471,889) (17,505,765) PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES - - - - NET LOSS $(3,427,569) $(6,290,176) $(10,471,889) $(17,505,765) NET LOSS PER SHARE Basic and diluted $(0.77) $(1.90) $(2.79) $(5.30)Basic and diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding 4,443,276 3,311,842 3,753,038 3,301,484 EzFill Holdings, Inc. and SubsidiaryConsolidated Balance Sheets December 31,2023 December 31,2022 Assets Current Assets Cash $226,985 $2,066,793 Investment in debt securities - 2,120,082 Accounts receivable - net 1,192,340 766,692 Inventory 134,057 151,248 Prepaids and other 220,909 329,351 Total Current Assets 1,774,291 5,434,166 Property and equipment - net 3,310,187 4,589,159 Operating lease - right-of-use asset 297,394 521,782 Operating lease - right-of-use asset - related party 286,397 - Deposits 49,063 52,737 Total Assets $5,717,332 $10,597,844 Liabilities and Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit) Current Liabilities Accounts payable and accrued expenses $845,275 $1,256,479 Accounts payable and accrued expenses - related parties 72,428 - Line of credit - 1,000,000 Notes payable - net 946,228 811,516 Notes payable - related parties - net 4,802,115 - Operating lease liability 246,880 230,014 Operating lease liability - related party 72,034 - Total Current Liabilities 6,984,960 3,298,009 Long Term Liabilities Notes payable- net 353,490 1,198,380 Operating lease liability 69,128 316,008 Operating lease liability - related party 215,960 - Total Long Term Liabilities 638,578 1,514,388 Total Liabilities 7,623,538 4,812,397 Commitments and Contingencies Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit) Preferred stock - $0.0001 par value; 5,000,000 shares authorized none issued and outstanding, respectively - - Common stock - $0.0001 par value, 50,000,000 shares authorized 4,776,531 and 3,335,674 shares issued and outstanding, respectively 451 334 Common stock issuable 26 - Additional paid-in capital 43,410,367 40,674,864 Accumulated deficit (45,317,050) (34,845,161)Accumulated other comprehensive loss - (44,590)Total Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit) (1,906,206) 5,785,447 Total Liabilities and Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit) $5,717,332 $10,597,844 What was EzFill Holdings' revenue for 2023?

Drawing inspiration from nature's most enchanting transitions, Indigo's Hour symbolizes the delicate balance between transformation and tradition. Much like the lifecycle of a butterfly, which we've chosen to represent our whiskey through the bottle's label design, the bourbon undergoes a metamorphosis of its own, as it journey's from barrel to bottle with meticulous care and attention to detail. Distilled in Indiana, aged in Kentucky and bottled in Tennessee, each stage of this liquid's journey contributed to its unique character and complexity. Experience the full interactive Multichannel News Release here: https://www.multivu.com/players/English/9258651-indigos-hour-limited-edition-straight-bourbon-whiskey ""Indigo's Hour is perfect for those who appreciate the complex flavors and craft behind American-bourbon making,"" said DIAGEO Master Blender Andrew Mackay. ""Its liquid and bottle label symbolizes how the Orphan Barrel collection continues to evolve from its predecessors, making it a true collectible for those who appreciate fine spirits and rare whiskies."" Crafted from a carefully selected mashbill of 68% corn, 28% rye, and 4% malt, Indigo's Hour aged gracefully over 18 years in charred white oak barrels, resulting in an exquisite Straight Bourbon Whiskey. Its flavor profile evolves on the palate, initially presenting creamy vanilla notes on the nose, followed by toasted oak, baking spices and red fruit. Subtle hints of caramel, honey, rich vanilla, and spice gradually yield a velvety finish with a touch of oak. The bottle design pays homage to the spirit's origin story - drawing inspiration from the crops, flora and fauna native to the heartlands of America's whiskey regions. The spirit animal is the Pipevine Swallowtail, the most colorful butterfly to call Indiana home, where this rare whiskey is distilled. Part of the label was inspired by The Witches Tree, a legendary maple tree found in Louisville, KY just a few minutes away from where Indigo's Hour was aged. The landscapes depicted in the background were inspired by the creek that sits amongst the rivers and marshlands in Cascade Hollow, Tullahoma, Tennessee, where Indigo's Hour was bottled. Indigo's Hour, like other Orphan Barrel Whiskeys, embodies the fleeting nature of exceptional liquid craftsmanship. Inspired by the time of day, which we call Indigo's Hour, between dusk and dark when the sky is at its most beautiful and a bourbon beckons to be sipped, this whiskey is made in only one highly-limited batch, and once it's gone, it's gone forever. This special edition bottle is available at select spirits retailers nationwide with a suggested retail price of $225 for 750mL, and is available for purchase beginning April 1, 2024 as a timely collectible for those who treasure rare spirits and seek to capture a piece of whiskey history. Indigo's Hour can also be purchased on ReserveBar, where shipping and delivery options are available.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of severe vision loss and blindness for people aged 60 years and older in developed countries worldwide, with a profound impact on the quality of life of affected individuals.

We provide this measure in addition to, but not as a substitute for, net income reported on a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) basis. Our management and the Board of Directors review Cash Earnings to evaluate our ongoing performance, allocate resources and review our dividend policy. We believe that this non-GAAP performance measure, while not a substitute for GAAP net income, is useful for management and investors when evaluating our underlying operating and financial performance and our available resources. We do not advocate that investors consider this non-GAAP measure without considering financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In calculating quarterly and full year Cash Earnings, we add back to net income, the non-cash amortization expense associated with our intangible assets. In addition, as a result of an assessment of the carrying value of the intangible assets, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $59,000 and $400,000 in the fourth quarters and full years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. For purposes of calculating Cash Earnings, the Company added back the after-tax amounts associated with this impairment charge of $41,330 and $280,200 for the fourth quarters and full years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Although depreciation on property & equipment and amortization of leaseholds are also non-cash expenses, we do not add it back when calculating Cash Earnings because those charges represent a decline in the value of the related assets that will ultimately require replacement. The following table provides a reconciliation of net income to Cash Earnings and Cash Earnings Per Share for the quarterly periods presented: For the Quarter Ended December 31, (unaudited) 2023 2022 Net income $ 299,895 $ 425,562 Add: Intangible amortization - customer relationships 81,475 81,475 Add: Impairment of intangible assets (net of tax impact) 41,330 280,200 Cash Earnings $ 422,700 $ 787,237 Cash Earnings Per Fully Diluted Share $ 0.26 $ 0.49 The following table provides a reconciliation of net income to Cash Earnings and Cash Earnings Per Share for the full year periods presented: For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Net income $ 1,205,118 $ 1,600,939 Add: Intangible amortization - customer relationships 325,898 325,898 Add: Impairment of intangible assets (net of tax impact) 41,330 280,200 Cash Earnings $ 1,572,346 $ 2,207,037 Cash Earnings Per Fully Diluted Share $ 0.98 $ 1.62 ABOUT TETON Teton Advisors, Inc.

(EDR) to be acquired by Silver Lake at a 55% premium value of $27.50 per share in cash, totaling $13 billion equity value and $25 billion enterprise value, making it the largest private equity take-private in a decade and the largest in the media and entertainment sector ever. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The acquisition of Endeavor by Silver Lake represents a significant event in the media and entertainment industry, not only because of its size but also due to the premium paid over the unaffected share price. The 55% premium indicates a bullish stance on the future prospects of Endeavor, acknowledging its potential to generate value as a private entity. The strategic move by Silver Lake to consolidate TKO's value into Endeavor, resulting in a $25 billion enterprise value, suggests a confident investment approach aimed at leveraging the dynamic growth in the content, sports and live events sectors.From a financial perspective, this transaction could be seen as a positive development for current Endeavor shareholders, as they are offered an immediate and substantial return on their investment. However, the removal of Endeavor's stock from the public market eliminates the opportunity for public investors to participate in its future growth directly. This could have a ripple effect on the media and entertainment sector, potentially prompting re-evaluations of similar companies by the market. Market Research Analyst Endeavor's transition from a public to a private company underlines a trend where companies believe they can better navigate industry changes outside the scrutiny of public markets. For the media and entertainment sector, this deal is a testament to the high value placed on content creation and distribution. The mention of global content spending exceeding $200 billion per year highlights the vast market potential and the importance of strategic partnerships in capturing market share.The deal may also influence the competitive landscape, as other players in the sector might consider similar strategic moves to consolidate or expand their market presence. It's essential to monitor how this transaction might prompt a series of mergers and acquisitions, as companies strive to match the capabilities and reach of a newly private Endeavor. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the unanimous recommendation of the transaction by Endeavor's Independent Directors' Special Committee is a critical aspect of this deal. It underscores the procedural rigor and fiduciary responsibility exercised in evaluating the offer, which is essential in securing shareholder approval and mitigating legal risks associated with such significant transactions. The legal intricacies of transitioning a company of this magnitude from public to private will involve substantial due diligence, regulatory approvals and potentially antitrust considerations, given the size and influence of Endeavor in the media and entertainment sector. 04/02/2024 - 12:30 PM Endeavor Stockholders to Receive $27.50 Per Share in Cash, a 55% Premium Value to Unaffected Share Price Special Committee of Endeavor’s Independent Directors Unanimously Recommended Approval of Transaction Transaction at $13 Billion Equity Value and $25 Billion Consolidated Enterprise Value is Largest Private Equity Sponsor Take-Private in 10 Years and Largest Ever in Media & Entertainment Sector BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. & MENLO PARK, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Endeavor Group Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: EDR) (“Endeavor” or the “Company”), a global sports and entertainment company, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Silver Lake, the global leader in technology investing, in partnership with the Endeavor management team and additional anchor investors. Under the terms of the agreement, Silver Lake will acquire 100% of the outstanding shares it does not already own, other than rolled interests. Endeavor stockholders will receive $27.50 per share in cash, representing a 55% premium to the unaffected share price of $17.72 per share at market close on October 25, 2023, the last full trading day prior to Endeavor’s announcement of its review of strategic alternatives, and a 39% premium to Endeavor’s unaffected 30‐day VWAP. With the significant premium being delivered to stockholders, Endeavor is being acquired at an equity value of $13 billion. Silver Lake believes that when consolidating all of TKO’s value into Endeavor, the combined total enterprise value of $25 billion will make this the largest private equity sponsor public-to-private investment transaction in over a decade, and the largest ever in the media and entertainment sector. On the unaffected date, the equity value was $8.2 billion, and the premium to be paid by Silver Lake represents $4.6 billion more equity value to all Endeavor stockholders. Ariel Emanuel, CEO of Endeavor, said: ""Since 2012, Endeavor’s strategic partnership with Silver Lake and Egon Durban have been central to our evolution into the global sports and entertainment leader we are today. We believe this transaction will maximize value for all of Endeavor’s public stockholders and are excited to continue to unlock and invest in the growth opportunities ahead as a private company.” Egon Durban, Co-CEO and Managing Partner of Silver Lake, and Chairman of the Board of Endeavor, said: “Our unwavering belief in Ari and Patrick, together with Mark and other talented leaders at Endeavor, has never been stronger. This is a very special partnership. Together, we have built and grown Endeavor from $350 million in annual revenue when we first invested in 2012 to nearly $6 billion in consolidated revenue today. Now, Endeavor can take advantage of its unique core platform to meet the dynamic forces driving growth in content, sports, and live events with bold vision. Consistent with our mission and underscored by this commitment being among the largest in Silver Lake’s history, we are all in on working with the Endeavor team and our trusted anchor investors to create value by accelerating growth at scale.” Patrick Whitesell, Executive Chairman of Endeavor, said: “With Silver Lake’s continued partnership and support, Endeavor is ideally positioned to capitalize on compelling trends in media and entertainment, where global content spending has reached more than $200 billion per year. In a business where the only constant is change, I know Endeavor will continue to lead the industry forward.” Mark Shapiro, President and Chief Operating Officer of Endeavor, said: “Endeavor’s assets and capabilities across entertainment, sports, fashion, and music are unparalleled. This transaction further enhances our ability to deliver category-defining deals and iconic events and experiences for clients, partners, and fans around the world. Egon, Stephen, and the broader Silver Lake team have been and will continue to be phenomenal partners in Endeavor’s journey, and we look forward to the road ahead.” Stephen Evans, Managing Director of Silver Lake and a Director of Endeavor, said: “The team at Silver Lake is proud of our longstanding partnership with Endeavor, marked by more than $3.5 billion of direct investment across six distinct transactions over 12 years. We are excited about what we can achieve together in this next phase, spearheaded by Endeavor’s visionary expertise across talent representation and content and ownership of truly special, marquee assets in sports.” The transaction builds on multiple investments Silver Lake has made in Endeavor starting with Silver Lake’s initial investment in William Morris Endeavor in 2012 and continuing through Endeavor’s subsequent acquisition of IMG in 2014 and initial public offering in 2021. Silver Lake also supported Endeavor’s acquisition of UFC in 2016 and the merger of UFC and WWE, creating premium sports and entertainment company TKO Group Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: TKO) (“TKO”) in 2023. TKO is not party to this transaction and will remain a publicly traded company that will continue to benefit from its connectivity to Endeavor’s expertise, relationships, and significant capabilities. TRANSACTION DETAILS The premium value delivered by the transaction to Endeavor stockholders is substantially higher than the median premium in the low-to-mid-30% range paid in private equity sponsor take-privates larger than $10 billion in enterprise value over the last five years in the technology, media, entertainment, and telecommunications sector. The consummation of the transaction is not subject to any financing condition. The transaction will be financed through a combination of new and reinvested equity from Silver Lake and additional capital anchored by Mubadala Investment Company, DFO Management, LLC, Lexington Partners, and funds managed by Goldman Sachs Asset Management; equity rolled over by members of the Endeavor management team including Emanuel, Whitesell, and Shapiro; and new debt financing fully committed by Goldman Sachs, USA, JP Morgan, N.A., Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., Bank of America, N.A., Barclays PLC, Deutsche Bank AG New York, and Royal Bank of Canada. Consistent with Endeavor’s announcement on October 25, 2023 of the initiation of a formal review to evaluate strategic alternatives, and Silver Lake’s public response that it was working toward a proposal to take Endeavor private, Endeavor proceeded to form a Special Committee of independent directors to review and consider any proposal that might materialize in connection with the strategic review. The Special Committee reviewed, negotiated, unanimously approved, and recommended approval by Endeavor’s Executive Committee of the proposed transaction. Following formal approval by Endeavor’s Executive Committee, the definitive agreement was signed, and the transaction was approved by the written consent of stockholders representing a majority of the outstanding voting interests of the Company. The transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and required regulatory approvals. No other stockholder approval is required. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2025. Upon completion of the transaction, Endeavor’s common stock will no longer be listed on any public market. Further information regarding terms and conditions contained in the definitive transaction agreements will be made available in Endeavor’s Current Report on Form 8-K, which will be filed in connection with this transaction.

Mercury Insurance Offers New Coverages and Discounts in New Jersey,2024-04-02T16:00:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Mercury Insurance (NYSE: MCY) introduces new coverages and discounts for homeowners in New Jersey, focusing on added protection and eco-friendly perks.

Product manager Andrew Morris highlights the benefits of these offerings. Positive None. Negative None. Insurance Industry Analyst Mercury Insurance's introduction of new coverages and discounts in New Jersey represents a strategic move to align with the increasing consumer demand for eco-friendly products and services. By incentivizing policyholders who adopt environmentally responsible behaviors, Mercury is not only encouraging a shift towards sustainability but is also potentially reducing the risk profile of its insured base. Eco-friendly homes may be less prone to certain types of damage or may cost less to repair due to the use of sustainable materials.From a market perspective, this initiative could enhance Mercury's competitive edge in a crowded insurance landscape. By offering unique eco-conscious discounts, Mercury may attract a segment of customers who prioritize environmental considerations in their purchasing decisions. This could lead to an increase in policy uptake, improving the company's market share and potentially its financial performance in the long term.However, the financial impact of these discounts and new coverages on Mercury's profit margins must be monitored. If the discounts significantly outweigh the reduced risk or if they do not lead to a corresponding increase in policy sales, the company's revenue could be adversely affected. It will be essential for Mercury to balance the attractiveness of these discounts with the need to maintain a profitable pricing strategy. Environmental Policy Expert Mercury Insurance's decision to offer discounts for eco-friendly measures aligns with broader environmental policy trends aimed at reducing carbon footprints and promoting sustainability. By doing so, Mercury is not only contributing to the environmental cause but is also leveraging public policy incentives that may be available for green initiatives. This could result in indirect savings for the company through tax credits or other governmental support mechanisms designed to encourage sustainable practices in the private sector.Additionally, Mercury's focus on environmentally friendly replacement products in their coverage could set a precedent in the insurance industry, potentially influencing other companies to adopt similar practices. This could have a ripple effect, encouraging more widespread adoption of eco-friendly materials in home construction and maintenance, furthering the environmental benefits.It's important to note that while these measures are positive from an environmental standpoint, their actual impact on reducing emissions or waste will depend on the scale of adoption and the specific nature of the eco-friendly measures incentivized by Mercury's discounts. Consumer Behavior Specialist The introduction of eco-friendly incentives by Mercury Insurance could have significant implications for consumer behavior. By offering financial benefits for sustainable practices, Mercury is effectively using economic levers to influence the decision-making of homeowners and renters. This approach can accelerate the adoption of green technologies and practices among consumers, as financial savings are a powerful motivator.Understanding the psychology behind consumer choices is essential. If the perceived effort or cost of adopting eco-friendly measures is lower than the perceived benefits, such as insurance discounts, consumers are more likely to engage in these behaviors. Moreover, by positioning itself as an environmentally responsible company, Mercury can build brand loyalty among a growing demographic of environmentally conscious consumers.However, the effectiveness of these incentives will largely depend on the marketing and visibility of the discounts. If consumers are not aware of the potential savings or do not fully understand the benefits, the impact on consumer behavior—and consequently on Mercury's business—could be limited. 04/02/2024 - 12:00 PM Mercury's new added protection comes with environmentally friendly perks, while discounts put hard-earned money back in the pockets of policyholders LOS ANGELES, April 2, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Mercury Insurance (NYSE: MCY) today announces three new coverages and four new discounts that are available for homeowners or renters in New Jersey. Mercury's new coverages provide additional insurance protections with an option for environmentally friendly replacement products. Discounts are available for homeowners already taking eco-friendly measures and will put hard-earned money back in the pockets of policyholders. ""Mercury's new discounts are a big step in the right direction and a new approach to protecting our customers,"" said Andrew Morris, product manager of New Jersey at Mercury Insurance. ""As a company, we pride ourselves in caring about our policyholders and aim to help them in any way possible, so offering expanded coverages and discounts is a vital part of business to us. We know that homeowners are reevaluating what's important to them, and that there is a growing demand for environmentally friendly materials throughout the home. We support our policyholders in their efforts to be environmentally conscious by providing coverages and discounts that help sustain a greener lifestyle."" New coverages include: Green Home: Mercury will cover up to an additional 10% of the replacement costs for environmentally friendly alternatives or construction methods with a covered loss. For example, if a homeowner with this additional coverage has damaged carpeting and selects an eco-friendly replacement, Mercury would issue funds up to 10% more than the costs to replace the carpeting so the homeowner can go with the green flooring option. The protection also extends to personal property such as HVAC systems or appliances when replaced with an eco-friendly product. ""Each day, we issue more than a million dollars to put policyholders' lives back together. At the same time, we also see materials that will take a long time to break down ending up in landfills. Mercury is committed to helping policyholders and the environment as well,"" Morris said. Matching of Undamaged Siding and Roofing: Many times, roofing or siding repair is limited to a damaged area of the home, and with time the older existing and non-damaged material will fade — or the roofing or siding is no longer available. In the past, homeowners could end up with roofing or siding that does not match. Today, Mercury is providing two additional coverages — siding or roofing — that allow the undamaged portions to be replaced as well when there is a mismatch.Refrigerated Products: During the pandemic, many homeowners spent hundreds of dollars stocking their refrigerators from top to bottom. Mercury's new protection covers up to $1,000 of food items if there's a loss of power or a mechanical failure of a refrigerator resulting in spoiled food.New discounts include: Green Home: Mercury is offering up to a 5% discount for all perils if the home has a Green certification by the U.S. Green Building Council LEED rating system, or meets the requirements of the National Association of Home Builders Green Building Guidelines (NAHB).Updated Home: Mature homes more than 20 years old with permitted renovations — such as HVAC replacement, re-roofing, remodeling or a new addition — during the last 10 years are eligible for up to a 10% discount on wind and water perils.Good Payer: Homeowner policyholders who have paid on time for the past 36 months are eligible for the Good Payer Discount, which saves 2% on the policy. Both new business and existing policyholders are eligible for the discount.Paid in Full: Mercury is offering a discount of up to 10% in savings on premium for renters insurance policyholders.Mercury offers insurance for Personal Auto, Mechanical Protection Condo, Homeowners, Home Cyber Protection, Home Systems Protection, Identity Management Services, Renters, and Service Line Protection in New Jersey.

The lineup offers a diverse range of trim levels and over 100 accessories for personalization, delivering iconic American design and balanced performance. Positive None. Negative None. Motorcycle Industry Analyst The introduction of the 2025 Indian Scout lineup signifies a significant investment by Indian Motorcycle into the mid-sized cruiser segment, a category that has witnessed considerable evolution over the past decade. The strategic diversification of the lineup with five distinct models and three trim levels is indicative of a tailored approach to market segmentation, aiming to capture a broader consumer base with varying preferences and price sensitivities.The new SpeedPlus 1250cc V-Twin engine, which boasts up to 111 horsepower, represents a notable advancement in terms of powertrain technology within the cruiser category. This development not only enhances the product's competitive edge but also likely contributes to an increase in manufacturing costs. The balance between the cost of technological upgrades and the pricing strategy will be a critical factor in maintaining profitability while attracting new customers.Additionally, the emphasis on customization with over 100 accessories aligns with current consumer trends towards personalization in the automotive industry. This strategy could potentially drive higher margins through aftermarket sales while also fostering brand loyalty. Market Research Analyst The launch of the new Indian Scout models comes at a time when consumer demand for motorcycles with advanced rider technology is on the rise. The inclusion of features such as ABS, Traction Control and Ride Modes across various models addresses safety concerns and enhances the overall riding experience, which is likely to resonate well with the target demographic.Furthermore, the focus on a low seat height and nimble handling could appeal to a demographic that includes newer riders and those of shorter stature, potentially expanding the market reach. The decision to maintain the iconic aesthetic of the Scout while integrating modern technology demonstrates an understanding of the brand's heritage value among consumers, which can be a powerful differentiator in a market with strong brand loyalty. Automotive Technology Expert The introduction of rider-centric technologies in the new Indian Scout lineup reflects a broader trend within the automotive industry, where connectivity and digital features are becoming increasingly standard. The strategic implementation of these technologies in a way that complements the traditional riding experience without overwhelming it is a delicate balance that Indian Motorcycle appears to be addressing.From a technical standpoint, the all-new SpeedPlus engine's performance metrics are impressive for the cruiser segment, potentially setting a new benchmark for power and efficiency. The steel tube frame design not only contributes to the motorcycle's aesthetic but also impacts the customization process. This could lead to a surge in the customization sub-sector, as enthusiasts look to personalize their rides further. 04/02/2024 - 12:29 PM All-New 2025 Indian Scout Lineup Delivers Unique Combination of Iconic American Design, Legendary Balance of Power & Control, and New Rider-Centric Technology Five Models, Including Scout Bobber, Sport Scout, Scout Classic, Super Scout, and 101 Scout, and Three Diverse Trim Levels Offer a Robust Lineup with Varying Price Points2025 Indian Scout Lineup Introduces All-New SpeedPlus Engine – A 1250cc Liquid-Cooled, V-Twin Delivering up to 111 HorsepowerNew Steel Tube Frame Delivers Timeless Style and Makes for Easier CustomizationLightweight, Nimble Handling, and Low Seat Height Delivers Balanced Ride and Inspires Confidence Full Line of Over 100 Scout Family Accessories Offer Convenient Personalization Across Entire LineupMINNEAPOLIS, April 2, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Indian Motorcycle, America's First Motorcycle Company, today introduced the next evolution of the iconic Indian Scout. Leveraging authentic Scout DNA, the all-new 2025 Indian Scout lineup builds upon its unparalleled history with five models, three trim levels, and more than 100 Scout family accessories for endless personalization. With roots celebrating Indian Motorcycle's rich history, the new Scout family delivers a unique combination of iconic American design, a legendary balance of power and control, and new rider-centric technology. Developed from extensive rider research and insights, the Indian Scout offers confidence-inspiring performance, usable technology, and class-leading rider amenities. Featuring the industry's lowest seat height, the Indian Scout delivers a confident riding position, as well as sporty and stable handling. ABS across the entire lineup instills rider confidence and increases braking ability, while Traction Control and Ride Modes on select models offer a tailored riding experience at the touch of a button. ""Scout is the most iconic American cruiser of all time and is synonymous with the Indian Motorcycle brand,"" said Mike Dougherty, President for Indian Motorcycle. ""As our top-selling platform, Scout has long been a staple in our lineup. And while riders around the world love the current Scout offering, we're excited to take it to the next level and continue its evolution with a robust offering of models to meet the diverse needs of our global riding community."" ""Having the opportunity to lead the design efforts for the next evolution of Scout is a dream come true,"" said Ola Stenegard, Director of Product Design for Indian Motorcycle. ""Our top priority was to uphold the iconic namesake of Scout and ensure the new lineup is as timeless as all its predecessors. For us, it was imperative to keep it clean, follow the iconic lines of Scout, and create a package that offered seamless customization. To achieve this, it all started with the steel tube frame and all-new, V-Twin engine."" At the heart of the all-new Indian Scout is a completely redesigned 1250cc liquid-cooled, V-Twin engine – the SpeedPlus 1250. Delivering up to 111 horsepower and north of 82 ft-lbs of torque, each Indian Scout offers crisp acceleration and superior passing power. Electronic fuel injection provides consistent fueling for smooth throttle response, while a responsive six-speed transmission keeps all the power easily within reach for sporty riding. ""Scout is a beloved model and the most iconic and historic of our lineup, resonating with all types of riders, men and women, from all over the world,"" said Ben Lindaman, Product Director for Indian Motorcycle. ""Since launching the current Scout 10 years ago, the mid-sized cruiser segment has evolved. After conducting tons of research, rider insights drove our developments that prioritized the Scout's iconic styling, its class-leading performance, and new rider-centric technology."" To evolve an American icon like Indian Scout, Indian Motorcycle focused its efforts in three areas. First and foremost, the new Scout must uphold its legendary design DNA. Unanimously, riders love the look and style of the Indian Scout. Next, Indian Motorcycle engineered the lineup to meet the needs of its diverse group of riders. Lightweight and a low seat height of 25.6-inches offers nimble handling and inspires rider confidence. The third priority when engineering the all-new Indian Scout was technology. While rider-centric technology wasn't a priority for riders 10 years ago, it is today. The new 2025 model year lineup offers a variety of technology packages – providing riders with a wide price range and the opportunity to select a ride with the industry's most cutting-edge technology. A completely new platform, built from the ground up, the 2025 Indian Scout lineup comprises five models with trim levels – ensuring there's a style and price point for its diverse mix of riders. Model Lineup Indian Scout BobberStripped down with an aggressive stance and raw power, the Scout Bobber is the perfect expression of iconic bobber style. Blacked out front to back with chopped bobber fenders and headlight nacelle, it leans hard into a mean bobber vibe. A solo bobber-style seat reinforces a minimalist bobber aesthetic—without trading comfort—and firmly plants riders in control under hard acceleration. Slammed two-inch suspension creates a low stance for an aggressive, custom look. Bar-end mirrors give the bike a cut down and clean look with improved visibility. Indian Sport ScoutInspired by history but redesigned for the style of today, the Sport Scout gives a more aggressive spirit to the Scout lineup. Stylish gloss black six-inch moto style risers with machine highlights come standard. Machined triples and moto handlebars complete the package, both in custom looks and dialed ergonomics that fit its menacing style with improved reach and control for aggressive riding. The sport-style seat provides riders more back support and comfort to ride longer and harder, without compromising the bike's sleek style. The quarter fairing gives the Sport Scout a stylish and custom look straight from the factory, while also providing protection from the wind. The 19-inch front wheel adds to the aggressive nature of the Sport Scout – both in style and agile handling. Indian Scout ClassicThe Scout Classic is where heritage-inspired design meets the needs of today's American cruiser rider. Premium chrome, classic Indian Motorcycle flared fenders, and flawless paint will turn heads at every intersection. Wire wheels add to the timeless, authentic style. A low seat height and relaxed ergonomics makes for an easy, confident ride at every speed, whether commuting or going on a weekend trip. Indian Super ScoutWhen the goal is to hit the open road, riders must ensure no corners are cut or details overlooked. Built for any type of riding, saddlebags, wire wheels, windshield, and passenger pillion all come standard. Super Scout's saddlebags allow riders to effortlessly carry essentials and offer simple ease of use with a quick pull tab. The quick-release windshield comes off in seconds for a different look, while its three inches of suspension travel increases comfort to ride longer and farther. Premium chrome finishes and flawless paint add to the timeless styling born from the Indian Scout's heritage. Indian 101 ScoutRooted in history as one of the greatest motorcycles ever made, the Indian 101 Scout is purpose built to be the highest performing Scout Indian Motorcycle has ever offered. When it comes to capability and style, the Indian 101 Scout resets the bar for American V-Twin cruisers. With adjustable piggyback rear shocks, inverted adjustable front forks, and dual disk Brembo® brakes, the Indian 101 Scout is packed with premium components that make a statement about the rider's ability to go fast. A custom-stitched, gunfighter-style solo seat provides premium comfort to match the bike's premium performance – delivering unrivaled rider confidence. Up top, stylish gloss black six-inch moto style risers with machine highlights, machined triples and moto handlebars tie it all together, with custom appeal and purposeful ergonomics that fit its aggressive character. Exacting attention to detail finishes the look with 101 Scout badging and exclusive paint and graphics. Trim LevelsNew for model year 2025, the Indian Scout family is available with three technology trim levels. Standard Trim provides an offering at an attainable price point to get riders into the lineup, while the Limited Trim takes it to the next level and introduces rider-centric technology. At the top of the line, Limited +Tech Trim delivers the best-of-the-best, with the most ride-enhancing technology ever offered on an Indian Scout. StandardStarting the lineup are three models with standard equipment: Scout Classic, Scout Bobber, and Sport Scout. Each of these models come standard with ABS, new LED lighting, and an analog gauge with newly introduced fuel level and fuel economy readouts – perfect for riders looking to get into the all-new Scout lineup at a lower price point. LimitedThe Indian Scout's Limited Trim adds to the Standard Trim with the premium badging and the next level of usable technology. Traction Control provides confident, predictable handling in all conditions, while Cruise Control improves comfort when traversing long, highway rides. A USB Charger keeps riders connected, while three selectable ride modes, including Sport, Standard, and Tour, allow riders to adjust throttle response to dial-in their ride experience. Riders can choose from Scout Classic Limited, Scout Bobber Limited, and Sport Scout Limited. Limited +TechAt the top of the line, Limited +Tech Trim delivers an unrivaled Indian Scout experience.

(NASDAQ: CALM) reported a facility in Texas testing positive for avian influenza, leading to the depopulation of 1.6 million hens and 337,000 pullets. The company's total flock was affected by approximately 3.6%. Production has halted temporarily, with efforts to secure production from other facilities. The risk of future outbreaks remains, but human health risk is low.

Reports Positive Test Result for Avian Influenza at Texas Facility Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. (NASDAQ: CALM) reported a facility in Texas testing positive for avian influenza, leading to the depopulation of 1.6 million hens and 337,000 pullets. The company's total flock was affected by approximately 3.6%. Production has halted temporarily, with efforts to secure production from other facilities. The risk of future outbreaks remains, but human health risk is low. The company maintains strong biosecurity measures and collaborates with government agencies to manage the situation. Positive None. Negative The avian influenza outbreak caused the depopulation of a significant portion of Cal-Maine Foods' flock, impacting production and potentially leading to financial losses in the short term. Market Research Analyst The outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) at a Cal-Maine Foods facility, resulting in a substantial loss of poultry, represents a significant operational disruption for the company. The loss of 1.6 million laying hens and 337,000 pullets, which accounts for approximately 3.6% of the total flock, is not only a setback in terms of animal health but also impacts production capacity and supply chain continuity.From a market perspective, this incident could lead to a short-term increase in egg prices due to the reduced supply. Investors and stakeholders should monitor Cal-Maine Foods' ability to redistribute production across its network to mitigate this impact. The company's focus on biosecurity and its collaboration with government agencies suggest a proactive stance in managing such risks, which may reassure the market of its resilience and operational risk management.Long-term implications may include increased operational costs due to enhanced biosecurity measures and potential shifts in consumer preferences if concerns about food safety arise. However, the CDC's assurance regarding the low risk of HPAI to public health and the USDA's confirmation that the virus cannot be transmitted through properly handled and cooked eggs may alleviate some consumer concerns. Financial Analyst The depopulation of a significant portion of Cal-Maine Foods' flock due to HPAI is a material event that could have financial repercussions for the company. The immediate costs associated with the depopulation, including the loss of productive assets and potential cleanup and repopulation expenses, will likely affect the company's financial performance in the short term.Investors should consider the potential for reduced revenue due to lower egg production and possible compensation expenses from insurance claims, if applicable. The company's statement about not providing interim updates unless material suggests that they are not expecting a significant long-term financial impact, which could indicate confidence in their risk management protocols and insurance coverage.However, the market's reaction to such events can be unpredictable and any future outbreaks, especially during migration seasons, could compound the financial strain. Thus, monitoring the company's quarterly reports for updates on the financial impact of the outbreak and any changes in operational strategy will be important for a comprehensive assessment of the company's financial health. Agricultural Industry Analyst HPAI outbreaks are a recurring threat in the poultry industry and can have a cascading effect on supply chains, consumer prices and industry practices. The loss of poultry at the Cal-Maine Foods facility is a stark reminder of the vulnerability of livestock to disease and the importance of biosecurity in agricultural operations.While Cal-Maine Foods' swift response and adherence to USDA protocols demonstrate industry-standard practices, the incident highlights the ongoing risk of HPAI in the wild bird population and the challenges of preventing its spread to commercial flocks. The company's commitment to robust biosecurity programs is essential, but the unpredictable nature of HPAI, especially with the risk heightened during migration seasons, necessitates continuous vigilance and preparedness within the industry.Stakeholders should observe how this event influences regulatory discussions and biosecurity investments across the sector. The industry may see a push for more stringent measures or innovative solutions to mitigate the risk of future outbreaks, which could drive up operational costs but also potentially lead to more resilient agricultural practices. 04/02/2024 - 12:09 PM RIDGELAND, Miss.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. (NASDAQ: CALM) (“Cal-Maine Foods” or “Company”) today reported that one of the Company’s facilities located in Parmer County, Texas, tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza (“HPAI”), resulting in depopulation of approximately 1.6 million laying hens and 337,000 pullets, or approximately 3.6% of the Company’s total flock as of March 2, 2024. Production at the facility has temporarily ceased as the Company follows the protocols prescribed by the USDA. Cal-Maine Foods is working to secure production from other facilities to minimize disruption to its customers. The Company remains dedicated to robust biosecurity programs across its locations; however, no farm is immune from HPAI. HPAI is still present in the wild bird population and the extent of possible future outbreaks, with heightened risk during the migration seasons, cannot be predicted. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the human health risk to the U.S. public from HPAI viruses is considered to be low. Also, according to the USDA, HPAI cannot be transmitted through safely handled and properly cooked eggs. There is no known risk related to HPAI associated with eggs that are currently in the market and no eggs have been recalled. The Company continues to work closely with federal, state and local government officials and focused industry groups to mitigate the risk of future outbreaks and effectively manage the response. The APHIS division of the USDA and individual states track and publicly report individual incidents of HPAI by location. The Company will provide updated information in its next quarterly report to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and does not expect to provide interim updates unless material.

In the campaign, called ""Inner Child Intervention,"" a man's inner child takes him on a joy ride in the electrified Hornet R/T, determined to get his adult self to realize his childhood dreams don't compare to the instant torque of the Hornet and the visceral excitement it brings. ""The Hornet RT stands apart from other compact UVs, with 383 lb.-ft. of torque that gives drivers the kind of instant acceleration and engaging driving experience that is unheard of in the category,"" said Tim Kuniskis, Dodge brand chief executive officer - Stellantis. ""As the first electrified vehicle from the brand – with our first fully battery-electric vehicle, the Dodge Charger Daytona, arriving this year – we know that when compared to horsepower, torque can sometimes be underappreciated. We're launching this campaign to change that perception."" The Dodge Hornet launched last year with class-exclusive and best-in-class performance features that optimize multiple aspects of the vehicle, from powertrain to suspension, braking, steering and handling. Standard all-wheel drive with dynamic torque vectoring, and available segment-exclusive features, including Brembo brakes and dual stage suspension, further enhance the overall dynamic driving experience. The spot takes viewers to the side of the road where a man comes face to face with a familiar-looking boy and quickly finds himself on a joyride with his inner child. His ""inner child"" hits the gas and zooms through the streets while schooling him on what he really needs in life, reminding him that ""horsepower keeps you going, but torque gets you going."" Tapping into a child-like surge of excitement, the spot evokes a surge of adrenaline, placing drivers behind the wheel of Dodge's ""totally torqued-out crossover."" The torque-loving inner child is especially obsessed with the Hornet R/T's PowerShot. This on-demand feature leverages Dodge's first hybrid powertrain to delivers an instantaneous boost of acceleration, letting drivers tap into the maximum electrical power to reach 60 mph in just 5.6 seconds. The new campaign includes a 30-second spot, and additional social media elements designed to humorously educate consumers about torque will include a limited series for TikTok and Instagram called ""Torque for Newbs."" The series of four videos, set to roll out online in the coming weeks, is designed to humorously educate torque novices on automotive jargon like ""pound foot"" and how torque relates to horsepower. In one of the videos, the inner child reminds his adult self of that time he made a human slingshot and shot his cousin Max across a parking lot. ""That's what torque is!,"" the inner child explains. ""Only instead of Max, we release the wheels."" The cross-channel campaign will span across broadcast, social media channels and online video. Broadcast media placement will include college basketball playoffs. ""Inner Child Intervention"" is the next step in the evolution in the Dodge brand's marketing campaign efforts for the brand's first crossover vehicle, the Dodge Hornet. The marketing campaign was created by the Dodge brand in partnership with GSD&M. Build and price configurator is live on Dodge.com for both the Hornet R/T and Hornet G/T.

Focus on enhancing safety and reliability of electric and gas networks in Rhode Island. Support for clean energy transition in the state. Reaffirmation of 2024 earnings forecast range and annual earnings per share growth projections. Confirmation of $14.3 billion capital investment plan for 2024 through 2027. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst The unanimous approval for Rhode Island Energy's planned spending signifies a substantial investment in the region's energy infrastructure. This initiative aligns with broader industry trends where utilities are increasingly prioritizing grid modernization, safety improvements and reliability. The capital allocation towards electric and gas infrastructure, particularly $168 million for gas, suggests a strategic focus on enhancing the gas network. Given the current market dynamics, where gas plays a pivotal role in energy transition, this could enhance RIE's competitive positioning. However, stakeholders should monitor how these expenditures translate into operational performance and customer satisfaction, as well as their impact on PPL's financial health in the context of its earnings forecast and capital investment plan. Financial Analyst PPL Corporation's reaffirmation of its earnings forecast and capital investment plan offers a clear financial trajectory for investors, signaling confidence in the company's strategic direction. The projected annual EPS growth of 6% to 8% through at least 2027 is noteworthy, potentially reflecting the expected returns from the approved investments. Investors should consider the implications of these investments on PPL's leverage and liquidity, particularly as the firm commits to a multi-year capital expenditure plan. It's essential to assess the balance between the costs associated with these upgrades and the anticipated efficiency gains or revenue growth from improved infrastructure. Regulatory Compliance Expert The endorsement from the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission underscores the regulatory support for RIE's infrastructure projects, which is critical in the heavily regulated utility sector. This approval also highlights the growing emphasis on clean energy transitions within state policies. The alignment with Rhode Island's progressive clean energy goals may provide RIE with regulatory goodwill and potential access to incentives or supportive measures. From a compliance perspective, maintaining a strong working relationship with regulatory bodies is essential for smooth operations and can impact the company's ability to execute on its ISR plans without significant legal or regulatory hurdles. 04/02/2024 - 11:30 AM ALLENTOWN, Pa., April 2, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- PPL Corporation (NYSE: PPL) subsidiary Rhode Island Energy (RIE) on Thursday (3/28) received unanimous approval from the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission (RIPUC) for approximately $326 million in planned spending from April 1, 2024, to March 31, 2025, to improve the safety and reliability of Rhode Island's electric and gas networks. The planned spending, connected to RIE's annual electric and gas Infrastructure, Safety and Reliability (ISR) plans, addresses approximately $300 million in capital investments ($132 million for electric and $168 million for gas) and $26 million in operating costs for vegetation management, restoration paving on gas main replacement projects, system inspections and other work. ""These investments are critical to maintaining and improving the safety and reliability of electricity and gas service for our customers in Rhode Island and help to enable the clean energy transition in the state, where Rhode Island has some of the most progressive clean energy transition goals in the nation,"" said Vincent Sorgi, PPL president and chief executive officer.

The company offers the most electrified vehicle options among all automakers, with 27 models available at dealerships. The sales figures for March and the first quarter show impressive growth for both the Toyota and Lexus divisions, with strong performances in various vehicle categories. Positive None. Negative None. Automotive Industry Analyst The substantial increase in electrified vehicle sales reported by Toyota Motor North America underscores a significant shift in consumer preferences and the automotive market's trajectory. The 74 percent surge in first quarter sales of electrified vehicles, which now represent over a third of total sales, indicates a robust demand for eco-friendly transportation options. This trend is likely to have a ripple effect across the supply chain, influencing battery manufacturers, raw material suppliers and charging infrastructure providers.Moreover, the introduction of more than 20 new, refreshed or special edition vehicles, including hybrid and exclusively hybrid models, demonstrates Toyota's commitment to diversifying its product offerings and securing a competitive edge in the electrified segment. This strategy not only caters to the growing environmental concerns among consumers but also positions Toyota favorably in markets where regulations are increasingly stringent on emissions. Market Research Analyst The data presented by TMNA reveals a notable performance differential between the Toyota and Lexus divisions, with Toyota vehicles showing a more pronounced increase in sales. This could suggest a broader market appeal for Toyota's pricing strategy, model diversity, or brand perception. The impressive sales growth of specific models like the RAV4 and the all-electric bZ4X indicates strong market acceptance and the potential for these models to become leaders in their respective categories.Additionally, the performance of Lexus, particularly in the electrified vehicle segment, with an 87.5 percent increase in March sales, may reflect a successful alignment of luxury with sustainability, a combination that is increasingly sought after in the high-end market. The launch of the all-new TX and the significant sales increase of all-electric RZ model could also signal Lexus's growing footprint in the luxury electric vehicle space. Environmental Policy Analyst Toyota's aggressive expansion into electrified vehicles aligns with global environmental policy trends aiming to reduce carbon emissions from the transportation sector. The company's performance and product strategy may contribute positively to the broader goals of carbon neutrality, potentially influencing legislative discussions and public policy. The success of Toyota's electrified vehicles could serve as a case study to support further investments in renewable energy and electric vehicle incentives. However, the environmental impact of this transition also depends on the sustainability of the supply chain and the lifecycle analysis of these vehicles, from production to end-of-life disposal. 04/02/2024 - 11:30 AM • First quarter sales of electrified vehicles surges 74 percent on a volume basis; represents 36.6 percent of total sales volume • 27 electrified Toyota and Lexus vehicle options available at dealerships, the most among any automaker PLANO, Texas, April 2, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Toyota Motor North America (TMNA) today reported March 2024 U.S. sales of 214,894 vehicles, up 21.8 percent on a volume and daily selling rate (DSR) basis versus March 2023.

Positive None. Negative None. 04/02/2024 - 11:17 AM SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., April 2, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- (OTC Pink: CETI), Cyber Enviro-Tech, Inc. (CETI) is pleased to announce it is filing a formal application to upgrade its trading platform from the Pink Open Market (Pink), aka OTC Pink, to the OTCQB (Over-The-Counter Quotation Bureau). This advancement will mark a pivotal step forward as companies listed on the OTCQB market place are required to go through more rigorous reporting requirements including PCAOB* audited financial statements. In contrast, companies listed on the Pink Open Market are not required to file audited financial statements and certain other mandated Securities and Exchange (SEC) disclosures, which could increase risks to investors due to limited and unaudited financial information. The upgrade process to OTCQB necessitates adherence to specific criteria to include: maintaining current reporting status, undergoing annual verification and certification, meeting a $0.01 bid test, non-bankruptcy status, having at least 50 beneficial shareholders, and a public float in excess of 10% of the total shares outstanding. The Company estimates the approval process will take four to eight weeks. ""Since the inception of CETI, formed nearly four years ago, we have consistently maintained our reporting standards to mirror those of entities listed on the OTCQB and other more regulated exchanges,"" said Kim D. Southworth co-founder and CEO. ""In the past two years alone, we have filed two PCAOB audited annual 10-K reports as well as five reviewed quarterly statements. This surpasses the reporting obligations of Pink and aligns seamlessly with those of the OTCQB market place. Such proactive measures signify a natural progression for our company. This heightened regulatory compliance is valuable as CETI embarks on further domestic and international expansion, providing an additional layer of assurance for both existing and potential investors."" For access to CETI's annual and quarterly reports, interested parties may visit the SEC website and navigate to the Filings section. * Public Corporate Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) is a nonprofit corporation established by the United States Congress to oversee the audits of public companies.

Negative None. 04/02/2024 - 11:00 AM CHEYENNE, WY / ACCESSWIRE / April 2, 2024 / The MFB Value-Add Wildfire Risk Reduction Team has been in discussions with SkyScout Ai Innovations in Vancouver, Canada for the last several months, and MFB is ready to join forces with SkyScout to bring CitroTech to Canada, a region that is desperately in need of the safest fire retardant chemistry in the world. This business alliance will augment MFB's growth and market penetration.SkyScout Ai Innovations Inc. has a vertically integrated technology platform which uses satellites and drones to detect hotspots and early inception fires, and it offers a new way of detecting and responding to wildfires. These new and better early fire elimination techniques are what MFB is excited to be a part of, because they increase firefighter safety for those on the frontlines, and they also increase firefighting efficacy.The 2023 Canadian wildfire season was the worst in recorded history for that nation. According to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center (CIFFC) more than 6,600 fires burned a total area of more than 45 million acres, which is over six times their 10 year average. Many in the U.S. watched and saw how those wildfires caused unhealthy air as far south as New York City, and the Canadian wildfire smoke created unhealthy air across the northern tier of the United States. News reports stated that over 70 million people were subjected to unhealthy air quality. Just last week, Science News said exposure to rising levels of wildfire smoke could lead to more than 10,000 additional deaths each year in the U.S. by the year 2050. This could make deaths due to wildfire smoke the costliest consequence of climate change for the country, accounting for nearly as much economic damage as all other climate-related impacts combined.Canada is currently forecasting another challenging wildfire season for most of the country, and MFB is committed to supporting, on a technical level from coast to coast, with product demonstrations and product knowledge seminars.On another front, there is ever-worsening news about the U.S. Fire Insurance Crisis that is now beginning to impact the Canadian markets. With the combined efforts of MFB and SkyScout Ai, there is the potential for a real, positive impact on the insurance crisis as well as on air quality. Accordingly, this business alliance between MFB and SkyScoutAi is something that both the U.S. Government and the Canadian Government should support.The Canadian Property Owners will get the benefit of the MFB's Wildfire Defense Systems through SkyScoutAi's Contractor customers. MFB's WFD System adds the ""airbag approach"" with remote activation of CitroTech Sprinkler Systems. This type of WFD will reduce the risk of loss better than ever before. Furthermore, it is now supported by the AIA and the U.S. GreenBuild Council, and it is taught on the AEC Daily (CES) platform.The fact that Mighty Fire Breaker's MFB-31-CitroTech is certified by the U.S. EPA Safer Choice Program should help expedite MFB's current effort to become qualified and listed in the CEPA, which is the Canadian Environmental Protection Act Registry. The CEPA provides for assessment of new and existing chemical substances. The CEPA program should support MFB's vision and efforts to reduce the risk from wildfires to humans and to the environment.For additional information, photos, and footage from the event or to learn more about Mighty Fire Breaker's technology and mission, please contact:For more information, please visit www.mightyfirebreaker.comFor technical product information: Info@mightyfirebreaker.comContact InformationTwitter: @GEVIOfficialWebsite:​ https://generalenterpriseventures.com/Forward Looking Statements:This document contains ""forward-looking statements"", which includes statements regarding expected financial performance and growth information relating to future events.

CCTS has $25m cash on its balance sheet. Agreement to be finalized by early May 2024, with the merger targeted for completion by August 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst The proposed merger between Tembo E-LV and Cactus Acquisition Corp. 1 Limited (CCTS) is a strategic move that could potentially reshape the competitive landscape for utility vehicle electrification. The indicative pre-money equity valuation of Tembo at $838 million suggests a substantial size for the deal, which will likely influence investor sentiment and stock prices. The issuance of 83.8 million shares at $10 per CCTS share represents a significant capital structure change and the distribution of Tembo Dividend Shares to VivoPower shareholders enhances shareholder value, albeit with a lock-up period that may temper immediate market liquidity.From a financial perspective, the $25 million of cash on CCTS's balance sheet is a important liquidity injection for Tembo Group post-merger. This capital could be leveraged for further research and development, expansion of market presence, or scaling of production capabilities. Investors should monitor the final terms of the Business Combination Agreement and the independent fairness opinion, as these will provide further clarity on the transaction's financial soundness. Market Research Analyst The electric vehicle (EV) sector is experiencing rapid growth and utility vehicle electrification is a niche yet expanding segment. Tembo's merger with CCTS positions the company to capitalize on this momentum. The lock-up period for the Tembo Dividend Shares may stabilize the stock price post-listing by preventing a flood of shares into the market. However, investors should be aware of the potential dilution caused by the new share issuance. The impact on VivoPower's stock will need to be assessed, considering the 5-for-1 Tembo Group share exchange ratio for existing shareholders.Long-term, the merger could provide Tembo Group with access to CCTS's SPAC expertise and capital, which can be pivotal for accelerating growth and capturing market share. The EV market's dynamics, including regulatory changes and technology advancements, must be considered when evaluating the potential success of the merger. Stakeholders should also consider the synergies that may arise from the combination, such as operational efficiencies and expanded product offerings. Legal Expert The legal intricacies of the merger, including the finalization of the Business Combination Agreement and the independent fairness opinion, are fundamental to ensuring compliance with NASDAQ listing requirements and protecting shareholder interests. The fairness opinion will provide an external validation of the transaction's equity terms, which is an important safeguard for minority shareholders. The lock-up period is a standard practice in such transactions to prevent excessive volatility, but it also means that shareholders will need to be patient before they can realize potential gains from the free trading of their shares.Legal due diligence is paramount to uncover any potential liabilities or regulatory hurdles that could affect the merger timeline or conditions. Investors should pay close attention to the F-4 filing, which will disclose more detailed information about the transaction and the combined entity's future plans. Understanding the legal framework and potential risks associated with the merger is critical for stakeholders to make informed decisions. 04/02/2024 - 11:19 AM Tembo E-LV (“Tembo”), a subsidiary of VivoPower International PLC (“VivoPower”), will merge with CCTS (“Cactus Acquisition Corp. 1 Limited”), a NASDAQ-listed company. Tembo will be the surviving entity and upon closing, will change its name to Tembo Group. CCTS has $25m of cash on its balance sheet, as of its last quarterly filing. VivoPower shareholders on the final record date will receive 5 Tembo Group shares for each 1 VivoPower share held.

Swartz is the organization's first Champion from the cruise industry. ""It's an honor to be selected to work alongside other like-minded leaders committed to steering the world toward a more sustainable future,"" said Swartz. ""As industry leaders in reducing food loss and waste across our operation, Carnival Corporation realizes that collaboration leads to great solutions. I'm eager to work with leaders across several sectors to find ways to leverage each other's learnings and expertise."" ""We are pleased that Jan will be joining the Champions 12.3 coalition. The cruise industry is an important part of the travel and hospitality sector, and as such, it has a vital role to play in helping reduce food loss and waste globally,"" said Dr. Liz Goodwin OBE, member of Champions 12.3. ""Jan brings a unique insight into the daily challenges of tackling food loss and waste in a globally dispersed organization operating 24/7, 365 days a year and serving millions of guests each year. She is ideally placed to represent the efforts on food waste reduction across Carnival Corporation's nine brands and share best practices across the industry.""

The Italian cruise line partners with local food banks to give fully prepared, unserved food to local communities and has donated more than 300,000 servings of food since 2017. While Champions 12.3 is made up of executive leaders across various business, government and civil sectors, the Friends of Champions network is a wider group of nearly 150 organizations working on specific initiatives designed to drive action toward the collective mission of reducing global food waste. Swartz's invitation to join the coalition comes shortly after Carnival Corporation announced it has achieved a 38% reduction in food waste per passenger relative to its 2019 baseline as part of its circular economy objectives to use fewer resources, produce less waste, and maximize recycling. The achievement places the global cruise company on track to reach its goal to reduce food waste by 50% per person by 2030 compared to its 2019 baseline. Carnival Corporation teams across several areas have collaborated to develop creative ways to proactively reduce food waste aboard its ships while still creating memorable experiences for guests. Culinary teams across its fleet track dining trends and adjust the amount of food prepared and served while also educating guests and crew alike on doing their part to help reduce food waste onboard. This effort is further supported by the creation of recipes that use as much of every ingredient as possible. Carnival Corporation's investment in advanced food loss reduction practices at every level places the company as an industry leader in food waste management.

CME Group €STR Options to Launch on May 20,2024-04-02T14:25:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"CME Group to Launch Options on Euro Short-Term Rate Futures on May 20, 2024","CME Group €STR Options to Launch on May 20 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary CME Group to Launch Options on Euro Short-Term Rate Futures on May 20, 2024 Positive CME Group, the leading derivatives marketplace, announced the upcoming launch of options on Euro short-term rate (€STR) futures on May 20, 2024. The new €STR options aim to assist clients in managing risk amidst shifting European interest rate expectations. The launch follows the successful introduction of €STR futures in 2022, with increased order book depth, reduced bid-ask spreads, and record futures settlement. CME Group continues to enhance its €STR marketplace, catering to the growing liquidity and participation in €STR futures. The options will adhere to CME Group's rules and regulations, providing clients with a reliable trading environment. CME Group offers a wide range of global benchmark products across various asset classes, empowering market participants to manage risk effectively. The company's exchanges facilitate trading in futures, options, cash, OTC markets, and provide clearing services for efficient risk management. CME Group's commitment to innovation and market leadership is evident through the introduction of new products like €STR options. Negative None. Financial Analyst The introduction of options on Euro short-term rate (€STR) futures by the CME Group represents a strategic expansion in their financial derivatives offerings. The move could potentially attract a broader range of institutional investors looking for hedging and speculative opportunities, especially in the context of the current volatile interest rate environment in Europe. The 79% increase in order book depth and the 31% reduction in bid-ask spreads for €STR futures indicate a significant improvement in market liquidity, which can be seen as a positive signal for the uptake of the new options product.Market participants might also interpret this development as CME's commitment to innovation and customer needs, which could enhance the company's competitive position in the derivatives market. This could have implications for CME Group's revenue streams and market share, as options trading typically involves higher margin transactions compared to futures trading. Market Research Analyst From a market trend perspective, the launch of €STR options is timely. It aligns with the global shift towards risk management tools that can accommodate the discontinuation of traditional benchmarks like LIBOR. The €STR, being a risk-free rate, is becoming increasingly relevant for financial contracts in the Eurozone. The growth in liquidity and participation in €STR futures since their inception signals a market appetite for such products.Furthermore, the performance of these new options could serve as an indicator of the market's confidence in the stability and reliability of €STR as a benchmark. This could influence the strategies of other financial institutions and exchanges as they continue to adapt to the evolving regulatory and economic landscape. Economist The introduction of €STR options is not just a business development but also reflects broader economic shifts. As monetary policies in Europe continue to evolve in response to inflationary pressures and economic challenges, the ability for firms to manage interest rate risk becomes increasingly important. The enhanced precision in risk management offered by options on €STR futures could provide firms with better tools to navigate the uncertainty in interest rates, which in turn could impact capital allocation decisions and broader economic stability.Additionally, the improved market efficiency indicated by deeper order books and narrower bid-ask spreads can reduce transaction costs for market participants. This reduction in costs can have a ripple effect on the overall cost of capital and investment activity within the economy. 04/02/2024 - 10:25 AM CHICAGO, April 2, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- CME Group, the world's leading derivatives marketplace, today announced that it will launch options on Euro short-term rate (€STR) futures on May 20, 2024.
