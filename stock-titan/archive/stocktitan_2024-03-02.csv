(BRSH) received a delisting notice from Nasdaq due to its common shares trading below $1 for ten consecutive days. The company also failed to meet the $1 minimum bid price requirement. A hearing before a Panel is scheduled for April 25, 2024, where the company will present a plan to regain compliance. Positive None. Negative The company faces delisting from Nasdaq due to low share prices and failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement, potentially impacting investor confidence and market perception. Market Research Analyst The notice of delisting received by Bruush Oral Care Inc. from Nasdaq due to non-compliance with the Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(iii) is a significant event that signals potential distress within the company. The persistent low bid price of the company's common shares suggests a lack of investor confidence, which can be attributed to various factors such as poor financial performance, loss of competitive edge, or unfavorable market conditions. The delisting process is critical as it may affect the company's ability to raise capital and its visibility in the market.Moreover, the impending hearing with the Nasdaq Hearings Panel provides an opportunity for the company to present a plan to regain compliance. The outcome of this hearing will be crucial for the company's future on the stock exchange. If Bruush Oral Care Inc. fails to convince the Panel, the consequences could include reduced liquidity for shareholders and decreased access to investment, which might further impact the company's operational capabilities.Considering a reverse share split as a potential remedy to regain compliance is a strategic move that could help increase the per-share price. However, it is important to note that such corporate actions do not address the underlying issues that may have led to the stock's decline. Shareholders and potential investors should closely monitor the company's strategy and execution leading up to and following the hearing. Financial Analyst The notification of potential delisting from a major stock market like Nasdaq is a red flag for investors and stakeholders of Bruush Oral Care Inc. The stock's failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement is a critical indicator of the company's market valuation and investor perception. Such a scenario often leads to increased volatility and can trigger a sell-off, further driving down the stock price.From a financial perspective, the company's ability to present a viable plan to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel will be under scrutiny. Investors will be looking for a comprehensive strategy that addresses not just the stock price, but also the operational and financial challenges that the company faces. The potential for a reverse share split may provide a temporary solution to the stock price issue, but it could also dilute existing shareholder value if not accompanied by a solid plan for growth and profitability.It is essential for investors to assess the company's fundamentals and future prospects in light of this development. The Panel's decision, which will be made after the scheduled hearing, will have significant implications for the company's ability to attract future investments and maintain a stable shareholder base. Legal Expert The legal process initiated by Bruush Oral Care Inc. in response to the Nasdaq delisting notice is a procedural step that allows the company to address the compliance issues with the Listing Rules. The Nasdaq Listing Rule 5800 Series outlines the procedures for appeal, which includes a hearing before the Panel. During this hearing, the company will have the opportunity to present legal and financial arguments to support its case for continued listing.The legal implications of delisting are significant, as it may affect contractual obligations with creditors and suppliers that are often contingent on the company's listed status. Furthermore, the company's governance practices and disclosure obligations may come under scrutiny during the hearing process. The legal team of Bruush Oral Care Inc. must ensure that all arguments are well-founded and that any proposed plan to regain compliance is legally sound and adheres to the regulatory requirements.Stakeholders should be aware of the legal nuances of the delisting process and the potential impacts on the company's obligations and operations. The decision of the Panel, whether favorable or not, will have legal ramifications for the company's status as a publicly-traded entity and its governance moving forward. 03/01/2024 - 11:20 PM VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / March 1, 2024 / Bruush Oral Care Inc.

CURO Group Holdings Corp.

The agreements aim to strengthen the company's balance sheet and enhance long-term growth prospects.","CURO Group Holdings Corp. Enters Forbearance Agreements and Waiver to Allow for Continued Constructive Discussions with Lenders and Stakeholders Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary CURO Group Holdings Corp. (NYSE: CURO) announces forbearance agreements with majority note holders and a waiver of default events, providing financial relief until March 18, 2024. The agreements aim to strengthen the company's balance sheet and enhance long-term growth prospects. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The entry into forbearance agreements by CURO Group Holdings Corp. with a significant majority of its note holders and obtaining a waiver for certain defaults is a strategic financial maneuver that provides the company with immediate short-term relief from potential liquidity crises. This indicates that CURO may be facing challenges in meeting its debt obligations, which can be a red flag for its financial health and stability. The forbearance period until March 18, 2024, offers a window for the company to restructure its debts, potentially negotiate better terms, or find alternative financing solutions.For investors, the implications are twofold. On one hand, the agreements suggest that lenders still have enough confidence in CURO's business model and future prospects to grant a reprieve rather than pushing for immediate repayment or collateral seizure. On the other hand, the need for forbearance points to underlying financial distress, which could impact the company's creditworthiness and stock valuation. Investors should closely monitor CURO's forthcoming financial statements and any strategic announcements for signs of improvement or further distress. Debt Restructuring Advisor CURO's engagement in forbearance agreements and the receipt of a waiver from certain defaults is a critical step in debt restructuring. This approach typically indicates that a company is taking proactive measures to avoid bankruptcy or default. The terms '1.5 Lien' and '2.0 Lien' refer to the priority of debt repayment in the event of liquidation, with 1.5 Lien being a hybrid tier that sits between first and second lien in terms of repayment priority. The '1.0 Lien Credit Agreement' represents the most senior debt, which has the first claim on any assets in case of default.By negotiating these terms, CURO is effectively buying time to realign its financial strategy without the immediate threat of enforcement actions from creditors. The extended forbearance period suggests that the company's creditors are willing to negotiate, which is a positive sign for the company's ability to reach a comprehensive restructuring plan. Stakeholders should be aware that while this alleviates short-term pressure, it does not resolve the underlying debt obligations. The success of this strategy hinges on CURO's ability to improve its operational efficiency and cash flow to meet its renegotiated obligations post-forbearance. Market Research Analyst The consumer finance sector, in which CURO operates, is highly sensitive to economic cycles and consumer credit health. CURO's need to enter into forbearance agreements may reflect broader market challenges such as increased default rates, tightening credit conditions, or competitive pressures. The company's focus on omni-channel consumer finance indicates a diversified approach to customer engagement, which can be a strength in adapting to changing consumer behaviors and preferences.However, the market will likely react to these developments with caution. While forbearance agreements provide breathing room, they do not address potential systemic issues within the company or the market at large. Investors and analysts will be watching for CURO's next steps, particularly how it plans to use the forbearance period to strategically invest in growth and operational improvements. Success in these areas could reposition the company favorably in the eyes of the market, but failure to do so could lead to further negative sentiment and potential long-term repercussions for its stock performance and market share. 03/01/2024 - 04:05 PM CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CURO Group Holdings Corp. (NYSE: CURO) (“CURO” or the “Company”), an omni-channel consumer finance company serving consumers in the United States and Canada, today announced that it entered into forbearance agreements (the “Forbearance Agreements”) with the holders of approximately 84% of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 7.500% Senior 1.5 Lien Secured Notes due 2028 (the “1.5L Noteholders”) and the holders of approximately 74% of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 7.500% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the “2.0L Noteholders”) and that it obtained a waiver (the “Waiver”) of certain events of default from lenders holding more than 80% in amount of term loans the Company’s 1.0 Lien Credit Agreement (together with the 1.5L Noteholders and the 2.0L Noteholders, the “Lenders”).

Despite external headwinds, the company focuses on brand transformation and strategic initiatives for long-term growth. Financially, net sales decreased, gross margin increased, but operating margin and earnings per share declined. The company closed stores, opened new ones, and aims to maintain adjusted gross margins in 2024. Positive LL Flooring reported a 19.6% decline in comparable store sales in the fourth quarter. The company is focusing on brand transformation and strategic initiatives for long-term growth. Net sales decreased by 19.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year. Gross margin increased by 270 basis points to 38.6% in the fourth quarter. Operating margin loss increased by 170 basis points to 8.3% in the fourth quarter. Loss per Diluted Share increased by $0.09 to $0.62 in the fourth quarter. The company closed seven stores and opened one new store in the fourth quarter. For the full year, net sales decreased by 18.5% compared to the previous year. Gross margin decreased to 35.7% for the full year. Adjusted gross margin increased to 37.5% for the full year. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased by 740 basis points to 44.6% for the full year. Operating margin loss increased by 780 basis points to 8.9% for the full year. Loss per Diluted Share increased by $3.17 to $3.59 for the full year. The company opened three new stores and closed eight during the year. The company had liquidity of $118.2 million as of December 31, 2023. Cash flows from operating activities were $21.3 million in 2023. The company is not providing financial guidance for 2024 due to uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. Adjusted gross margins are expected to maintain year-over-year in 2024. SG&A spend is expected to increase year-over-year in 2024. Capital expenditures of approximately $15 million are expected in 2024. Negative Comparable store sales declined by 19.6% in the fourth quarter. Operating margin and earnings per share declined in the fourth quarter. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased significantly for the full year. Loss per Diluted Share increased substantially for the full year. Market Research Analyst The reported decline in net sales by 19.7% for the fourth quarter and 18.5% for the full year at LL Flooring is a significant metric for investors, as it indicates a sizeable reduction in consumer and professional spending within the flooring industry. This is likely reflective of broader economic trends, such as a slowdown in the housing market and a decrease in home improvement activities, which are traditionally correlated with existing home sales. The decrease in transaction count and average transaction size suggests a reduced consumer confidence and a potential shift in market demand.Moreover, the increase in gross margin points to successful cost management strategies, such as vendor negotiations and lower transportation costs. However, the substantial increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, despite a decrease in absolute terms, highlights the challenge of maintaining operational efficiency in the face of declining sales. This suggests that fixed costs, such as store rents and distribution centers, are taking up a larger share of revenue, which could impact profitability if sales do not rebound. Financial Analyst The operating margin loss widening to 8.3% and 8.9% for the quarter and year respectively, coupled with an increased loss per diluted share, raises concerns about the company's profitability in the near term. Investors would be prudent to consider the company's liquidity position, which remains robust at $118.2 million, as an indicator of its ability to weather the current economic headwinds. The generation of $21.3 million in cash flows from operating activities is a positive signal of effective inventory management and cost control measures.However, the absence of financial guidance for 2024 due to macroeconomic uncertainties could be perceived as a lack of visibility into future performance, which might contribute to investor caution. The company's focus on strategic initiatives, such as CRM and Pro initiatives and the rollout of new products like carpet, are intended to drive long-term growth, but their impact on sales and margins in the short term remains uncertain. Economist The reported financial results by LL Flooring reflect broader macroeconomic challenges, such as low consumer confidence, inflation and volatile interest and mortgage rates. These factors are likely contributing to the reported decline in existing home sales and, by extension, the home improvement industry. The company's expectation of continued challenges through the first half of 2024 is indicative of the potential for a prolonged period of economic stagnation or even recession, which could have wider implications for consumer spending and investment.The company's strategic focus on improving customer experience and operational efficiencies may be essential for adapting to the shifting economic landscape. However, the potential benefits of these initiatives will likely be contingent on the normalization of the macroeconomic environment, which remains uncertain. 03/01/2024 - 04:05 PM RICHMOND, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- LL Flooring Holdings, Inc. (“LL Flooring” or “Company”) (NYSE: LL), a leading specialty retailer of hard and soft surface flooring in the U.S., today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. ""Fourth quarter business conditions remain difficult as we continue to experience the impact of weakness in existing home sales and the corresponding softness in the home improvement industry. We reported comparable store sales down 19.6% as we saw continued declines in traffic and lower average project sizes for our consumer and pro customers. Despite external headwinds, we are focused on our ability to deliver the high-touch service of an independent flooring retailer combined with the value, assortment, and convenience of a national brand,” said President and Chief Executive Officer Charles Tyson. Tyson continued ""Leading economic indicators suggest that home improvement spending will continue to be challenged through at least the first half of 2024, however, the long-term fundamentals of our business are strong due to aging housing stock, increased household formation and rising home values. To that end, we remain focused on executing on our brand transformation and on our strategic initiatives which we believe will drive revenue growth, increase brand awareness, spur product innovation and deliver a consistent customer experience. We are also gaining traction on several of our operating strategies, focusing on the customer experience, driving and improving NPS scores, innovating products including the execution of our carpet initiatives, and maintaining a strong focus on improving operational efficiencies and working capital management. All of which, gives us confidence in achieving long-term growth.” Fourth Quarter Financial Highlights Net sales decreased 19.7% to $211.8 million compared to the same period last year, driven by a decrease in transaction count and average transaction size reflecting lower spend by consumers and Pros. Total comparable store sales decreased 20.2% versus the same period last year. Gross margin increased 270 basis points to 38.6% and Adjusted gross margin1 increased 260 basis points to 38.3% compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by vendor cost outs and lower transportation costs, partially offset by headwinds from higher vinyl sourcing costs as we increased sourcing from domestic vendors. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 430 basis points to 46.8% compared to the fourth quarter of last year and Adjusted SG&A1 as a percentage of net sales increased 800 basis points to 46.8% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The increases in both SG&A and Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of net sales were due primarily to expense deleverage from lower sales volumes; Adjusted SG&A spending decreased $3.1 million primarily due to restructuring activities and lower advertising spend. Operating margin loss increased 170 basis points to 8.3% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Adjusted operating margin loss1 increased 550 basis points to 8.6% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Loss per Diluted Share increased $0.09 to $0.62 compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Adjusted Loss per Diluted Share1 increased $0.35 to $0.64 compared to the fourth quarter of last year. We’ve continued to evaluate our store portfolio, resulting in the closure of seven stores during the fourth quarter. We also opened one new store, bringing our total store portfolio to 437 stores as of December 31, 2023. 1Please refer to the “Non-GAAP and Other Information” section and the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation tables below for more information. Full Year Financial Highlights Net sales decreased 18.5% to $904.7 million compared to last year, driven by a decrease in transaction count and average transaction size reflecting lower spend by consumers and Pros. Total comparable store sales decreased 19.6% versus last year. Gross margin decreased 40 basis points to 35.7% compared to 2022 and Adjusted gross margin1 increased 140 basis points to 37.5% compared to 2022. Gross margin decreased due to unfavorable antidumping duty rate changes and customs detentions on certain vinyl flooring products from Asia. The increase in adjusted gross margin1 was primarily due to lower vendor and transportation costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 740 basis points to 44.6% compared to last year and adjusted SG&A1 increased 820 basis points to 44.5% compared to last year. Both SG&A and Adjusted SG&A increased as a percentage of net sales primarily due to expense deleverage on lower net sales; Adjusted SG&A spend remained relatively flat compared to 2022, as the cost savings from our restructuring activities and lower spend on advertising were offset by higher occupancy costs associated with the addition of a third distribution center, rents of new stores and lease renewals at higher rental rates, non-recurring professional services and IT spend associated with the rollout of our CRM. Operating margin loss increased 780 basis points to 8.9% compared to last year. Adjusted operating margin loss1 increased 680 basis points to 7.0% compared to last year. Loss per Diluted Share increased $3.17 to $3.59 compared to last year. Adjusted Loss per Diluted Share1 increased $2.84 to $3.01 compared to last year. During 2023, the Company opened three new stores and closed eight, bringing total stores to 437 as of December 31, 2023. 1Please refer to the “Non-GAAP and Other Information” section and the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation tables below for more information. Cash Flow & Liquidity As of December 31, 2023, the Company had liquidity of $118.2 million, consisting of excess availability under its Credit Agreement of $109.4 million, and cash and cash equivalents of $8.8 million. During 2023, the Company generated $21.3 million of cash flows from operating activities, primarily driven by our effective inventory management and our cost savings initiatives implemented by management. 2024 Business Outlook The Company continues to navigate uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment due to low consumer confidence, inflation, a volatile interest and mortgage rate environment and continued declines in existing home sales. As a result, the Company is not providing financial guidance at this time. The Company is, however, providing the following commentary. The Company expects: In terms of our sales outlook for 2024, while we strongly believe that our strategic initiatives of our CRM and Pro initiatives will improve the customer experience and help drive traffic to stores, our visibility is limited as to when the macroeconomic environment will normalize. Adjusted gross margins1 are expected to maintain year-over-year, driven primarily by potential reductions in transportation costs. The Company will continue to monitor the competitive pricing environment to inform its pricing and promotion strategies. SG&A dollar spend and SG&A spend as a percentage of sales are expected to increase year-over-year, primarily due to lower net sales as we continue to invest in our strategic initiatives while navigating a dynamic macroeconomic environment. Capital expenditures of approximately $15 million in 2024, primarily related to our strategic initiatives such as the rollout of Carpet across our store portfolio, and maintenance capital investments. 1Please refer to the “Non-GAAP and Other Information” section and the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation tables below for more information.

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the Company’s control. The Company specifically disclaims any obligation to update these statements, which speak only as of the dates on which such statements are made, except as may be required under the federal securities laws. For a discussion of the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements, see the “Risk Factors” section of the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the Company’s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

Non-GAAP and Other Information To supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures in the body of this press release and in the supplemental tables at the end of the release: (i) Adjusted Gross Profit; (ii) Adjusted Gross Margin; (iii) Adjusted SG&A; (iv) Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of net sales; (v) Adjusted Operating Income (Loss); (vi) Adjusted Operating Margin (Loss); (vii) Adjusted Other Expense; (viii) Adjusted Other Expense as a percentage of net sales; (ix) Adjusted Earnings (Loss); and (x) Adjusted Earnings (Loss) per Diluted Share. These non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. These supplemental measures may vary from, and may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures are presented because we believe the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends related to our financial condition and results of operations, These measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating our ongoing operating performance, and management, in certain cases, uses them to determine incentive compensation. The presented non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that management does not believe reflect our core operating performance, which include regulatory and legal settlements and associated legal and operating costs, changes in antidumping and countervailing duties, and goodwill impairment, as such items are outside of our control or due to their inherent unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring, or non-cash nature. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are provided on the pages that follow. Reconciliations of forward-looking non-GAAP measures are not provided because the company is unable to provide such reconciliations without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty and inherent difficulty of predicting the occurrence and financial impact of certain items, including, but not limited to, the timing and significance of antidumping rate changes or vinyl charges.

The decision to offer two distinct share classes, Institutional (IXDXX) and Investor (VXDXX), caters to a diverse investor base, potentially broadening the fund's appeal and accessibility.From a financial analysis standpoint, the adherence to Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 signifies a strong commitment to maintaining the fund's quality and stability. This rule ensures that the fund invests in high-quality, short-term securities, which is a fundamental criterion for investors seeking safety in their cash-equivalent holdings. The allocation of at least 99.5% of total assets to U.S. government securities and other qualified investments is a conservative strategy, likely to attract risk-averse investors, particularly in a volatile market environment. Market Research Analyst The launch of the XD Treasury Money Market Fund can be seen as a strategic move to capture demand within a niche segment of the investment community that prioritizes safety and liquidity over higher returns. The presence of a seasoned Chief Portfolio Manager like Scott Riecke at the helm could instill confidence among potential investors regarding the fund's risk management capabilities. It's important to assess the competitive landscape, as the money market fund arena is highly competitive, with established players already dominating the market.Interest in such funds often correlates with the broader economic climate, particularly interest rate trends and market volatility. Given the current economic uncertainties, investors may be more inclined to allocate a portion of their portfolios to lower-risk assets, which could work in favor of the XD Treasury Money Market Fund. However, the fund's success will also depend on its yield performance relative to its peers, fee structure and the ability of the management team to navigate changing market conditions. Legal Expert The compliance with Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 is a critical legal aspect of the XD Treasury Money Market Fund's operations. This rule is designed to limit the risks associated with money market funds by enforcing diversification, maturity and quality requirements. For investors, this compliance is an assurance of the fund's conservative investment approach and regulatory oversight, which is particularly significant in the aftermath of past financial crises that have affected money market funds.It is also worth noting the legal implications of offering two share classes. This structure must be carefully managed to ensure equitable treatment of all investors. The legal framework governing such funds requires transparency in disclosures and operations, which can be a deciding factor for institutional investors who are often more rigorous in their due diligence processes. Prospective investors will likely scrutinize the fund's prospectus and statements for any legal red flags that could affect their investment. 03/01/2024 - 07:58 PM WINDSOR LOCKS, Ct.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- XD Fund Advisor, an emerging mutual fund management start-up established in 2023, proudly announces the launch of the XD Treasury Money Market Fund.

(TSX:FLOW; OTCQX:FLWBF) (“Flow” or the “Company”) today announced it has completed the previously announced additional non-brokered private placement of 5,577,000 subordinate voting shares (“SV Shares”) at a price of $0.28 per SV Share to RI Flow LLC (the “Investor”) for gross proceeds of $1,561,560 (the “Additional Offering”), following the initial closing on January 30, 2024 of the non-brokered private placement of 6,473,000 SV Shares at a price of $0.28 per SV Share to the Investor for gross proceeds of $1,812,440 (the “Initial Offering”). The Investor is affiliated with NFS Leasing Canada Ltd., a lender to Flow, and its founder Clifford L. Rucker. The total proceeds raised from the Initial Offering and the Additional Offering are $3,374,000. This funding is expected to bridge Flow’s working capital and other capital requirements until it reaches profitability and cash flow positive results, which is currently expected for the three-month period ending October 31, 2024 (“Q4 2024”). Flow’s financial outlook has recently improved given $148 million in contracted revenue expected from the signing of co-manufacturing agreements with Joyburst, BeatBox and BioSteel, in addition to ongoing growth in Flow brand net revenue. Revenue from the Joyburst agreement began in February 2024, with commercial production for BeatBox and BioSteel beginning shortly thereafter. “NFS and Cliff have been wonderful financial partners for Flow over the last six years. They have been an instrumental funding source for our working capital and capital expansion requirements, and we believe their investment in Flow’s equity demonstrates their confidence in our near term and long term prospects. We are currently installing our fourth production line at Aurora and expect a 25% increase in capacity beginning in fiscal Q2 2024.

Positive Adial Pharmaceuticals, Inc. enters a definitive agreement for the immediate exercise of outstanding warrants. 1,150,000 shares of common stock to be purchased at an exercise price of $2.82 per share. Gross proceeds expected to be $3,530,500 before deducting fees and expenses. New unregistered warrants to purchase up to 2,300,000 shares of common stock to be issued. H.C. Wainwright & Co. serves as the exclusive placement agent for the offering. Negative None. Financial Analyst The immediate exercise of warrants by Adial Pharmaceuticals represents a strategic move to boost liquidity and potentially strengthen the company's balance sheet. The capital raised, amounting to $3,530,500, will likely be allocated towards advancing the company's pipeline, particularly in the realm of addiction treatment therapies. The involvement of a notable placement agent, H.C. Wainwright & Co., underscores the legitimacy of the offering, which could instill investor confidence.However, investors should be aware of the dilutive effect of such transactions. Issuing new warrants to purchase up to 2,300,000 shares, in addition to the 1,150,000 shares from the exercised warrants, increases the total number of shares outstanding. This dilution can lead to a decrease in existing shareholders' equity value and could potentially depress the stock price in the short term. Long-term implications hinge on the effective use of the proceeds and the success of the company's therapeutic developments. Market Research Analyst The biopharmaceutical sector is highly competitive, with significant research and development costs. Adial's focus on addiction treatment therapies places it within a niche but growing market, given the increasing awareness and need for such treatments. The exercise price of $2.82 per share for both the original and new warrants suggests confidence in the company's valuation and future prospects, as it aligns with the market's perceived value of the stock at the time of the original warrant issue.The market will be observing the deployment of the raised funds and any subsequent impact on Adial's drug pipeline progression. Success in clinical trials and eventual FDA approval could position Adial as a key player in the addiction treatment space, potentially leading to significant future revenue streams. The terms of the new warrants could also indicate an anticipated positive stock performance, as they encourage investment at a fixed price over a period when significant milestones may be achieved. Medical Research Analyst From a medical research perspective, the influx of funds is crucial for Adial Pharmaceuticals as it navigates the costly landscape of clinical trials and FDA approval processes. The specific focus on addiction and related disorders is timely, given the opioid crisis and the rising demand for novel and effective treatments. The success of Adial's therapies could have a substantial impact on public health and by extension, its financial performance.Investors should monitor the company's clinical trial outcomes and any emerging data on the efficacy and safety of its treatments. Positive results could lead to an uptick in investor interest and an increase in stock value. Conversely, any setbacks in the clinical process could have a negative impact on the company's financial health and stock performance. Thus, the long-term business impact hinges on the scientific outcomes of Adial's research endeavors. 03/01/2024 - 07:00 PM CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va., March 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Adial Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADIL) (“Adial” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapies for the treatment and prevention of addiction and related disorders, today announced the entry into a definitive agreement for the immediate exercise of certain outstanding warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,150,000 shares of common stock of the Company originally issued in October 2023, having an exercise price of $2.82 per share and eighteen months term. The shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants are registered pursuant to an effective registration statement on Form S-1 (No. 333-275397). The gross proceeds to the Company from the exercise of the warrants are expected to be $3,530,500, prior to deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses. H.C. Wainwright & Co. is acting as the exclusive placement agent for the offering.

The new warrants will have an exercise price of $2.82 per share, will be immediately exercisable upon issuance and will have a term of eighteen months from the issuance date. The offering is expected to close on or about March 6, 2024, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

About Adial Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Adial Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of treatments for addictions and related disorders. The Company's lead investigational new drug product, AD04, is a genetically targeted, serotonin-3 receptor antagonist, therapeutic agent for the treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) in heavy drinking patients and was recently investigated in the Company's ONWARD™ pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial for the potential treatment of AUD in subjects with certain target genotypes (estimated to be approximately one-third of the AUD population) identified using the Company's companion diagnostic genetic test.

The fund also disclosed top 10 holdings and updates on direct investments. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst An analysis of Ecofin Sustainable and Social Impact Term Fund's (TEAF) unaudited balance sheet reveals a robust asset coverage ratio of 946%, which is a measure of the company's ability to cover its debt obligations with its assets. This is significantly higher than the minimum 300% asset coverage ratio required by the 1940 Act for closed-end funds, indicating a strong financial position and potentially lower risk for debt holders. However, investors should be aware that a high coverage ratio could also signal that the company is not leveraging its assets as aggressively as it could to generate returns, which could impact the fund's performance relative to more leveraged peers. Market Research Analyst With a net asset value (NAV) per share of $14.55, TEAF's valuation is a key indicator for potential investors. The disclosed top 10 holdings on the fund's portfolio web page can provide insights into the fund's investment strategy and sector allocations. Investors should compare TEAF's portfolio composition and performance with other funds in the sustainable and social impact space to evaluate its competitiveness and market positioning. Furthermore, the commitment to reach a target of 60% direct investments might appeal to investors looking for exposure to private deals, which could differentiate TEAF from other funds that are limited to publicly traded securities.

Trifecta can purchase the second royalty interest from Strategic for the payment of 1,500 ounces of gold or the cash equivalent.If Trifecta exercises the First Option only, the parties shall form a joint venture to further explore and develop the properties.Project PortfolioThe optioned portfolio covers approximately 30,000 hectares of highly prospective land within the Yukon portion of the Tombstone Gold Belt across 11 properties - namely, Mt. Hinton, Rye, Lance, Liam, Lois, Leroy, Luke, Leah, Lisa, Husky and Naws. The locations of the properties are available on the Company's website.The flagship Mt. Hinton gold-silver project lies within the Keno Hill District of the Tombstone Gold Belt, ideally located immediately southeast of Hecla Mining Company's (""Helca"") Keno Hill Silver Mining Project, 35 km southeast of Victoria Gold's Eagle Mine, and 25 km east-southeast of Banyan Gold's AurMac Deposit. Mt. Hinton is a road accessible, camp scale property with over 60 precious metals veins identified to date. Mt. Hinton is a direct extension of the stratigraphy that hosts Hecla's Keno Hill Mines and much of the historical exploration at Mt. Hinton focused on these veins. Visible gold has been found in many of the known veins resulting in many bonanza grade (>100 g/t gold) assays being reported from surface grab and chip samples:August 21, 2019, Strategic Metals Ltd. Announces 2340 G/T Gold in a Rock Sample From its Mount Hinton Property, YukonSeptember 9, 2019, Strategic Metals Discovers More Gold-rich Veins at Its Mount Hinton Property, Yukon (includes a 202 g/t gold grab sample in Granite North)July 22, 2020, Strategic Metals Ltd. samples 200 g/t gold over 1.2 m at its Mt. Hinton gold and silver project, YukonJanuary 23, 2023, Strategic Metals Discovers New Veins at its Mt. Hinton Gold-Silver Project, Yukon (85 vein float samples grade 273 g/t gold and 138.5 g/t gold, outcrop sample from 15 vein grades 126.5 g/t gold, 19 vein float sample returned 101 g/t gold)There are active placer mines on all the creeks draining the property. Based on both metal zonation within the district and the regional magnetic signature at Mt. Hinton, a reduced intrusion on the property is theorized to be the driver for much of the mineralization in the district. Many recently identified gold-in-soil anomalies have yet to be prospected and a large magnetic low in the southeastern part of the project has not been investigated. Both will be priority targets for Trifecta.The Rye property is located 14 km south of Fireweed Metals' Macpass Project in eastern Yukon. It hosts a gold- and bismuth-in-soil anomaly associated with a known intrusion as well as multiple gold-rich veins more distal to the intrusion.Located midway between Mt. Hinton and Rye, the Lance property is centered on a multi-square kilometre gold- bismuth- and arsenic-in-soil anomaly that coincides with a magnetic low. Prospecting in 2023, in the western part of the project, discovered sheeted quartz veining within a secondary soil anomaly of a similar character.Liam is similarly centered on a large, coincident gold- bismuth- and arsenic-in-soil anomaly that is partially defined through grid soil sampling. The anomaly also has significant copper-in-soil that ranges from 200 to 847 ppm indicating potential for porphyry type mineralization as well.Lois, Leroy, Luke, Leah, Lisa, Husky and Naws are earlier stage targets that were staked on the same regional stream sediment signatures that mark all of the known deposits and major discoveries in the Tombstone Belt.Share ConsolidationTrifecta's board of directors has approved the consolidation of its common shares on the basis of one post-consolidation share for every four pre-consolidation shares. The effective date of the consolidation will be confirmed at a future time, following the Company's receipt of acceptance from the TSX Venture Exchange for this share consolidation.About Trifecta Gold Ltd.Trifecta is a Canadian-based precious metals exploration company dedicated to increasing shareholder value through the discovery and development of 100% held gold projects in Yukon and Nevada. Initial drilling at its Yuge Gold Project, located in northern Nevada, has identified multiple broad zones of gold mineralization near historical high-grade mines. The Company's Eureka Project hosts an 8 x 2.5 kilometre belt of surface showings and anomalous gold-in-soil that straddle the headwaters of two of the most productive placer creeks in Yukon's southern Klondike Goldfields. The Company's Treble Project covers a large hydrothermal system, located midway between Western Copper and Gold Corporation's Casino Deposit, the largest copper and gold deposit in the Yukon, and Rockhaven Resources Ltd.'s Klaza Deposit, a high-grade gold-silver deposit.ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD""Richard Drechsler""President and CEOFor further information concerning Trifecta or its various exploration projects please visit www.trifectagold.com or contact:Corporate InformationTrifecta Gold Ltd.Richard DrechslerPresident and CEOTel: (604) 687-2522This news release may contain forward looking statements based on assumptions and judgments of management regarding future events or results that may prove to be inaccurate as a result of exploration and other risk factors beyond its control, and actual results may differ materially from the expected results.Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this news release.SOURCE: Trifecta Gold Ltd.View the original press release on accesswire.com What projects has Trifecta Gold Ltd. acquired in Yukon's Tombstone Gold Belt?

Epsilon Energy Ltd.

The dividend is payable on March 29, 2024, to stockholders of record as of March 15, 2024. The earnings release is scheduled for March 20, 2024, with a conference call on March 21, 2024.","Epsilon Energy Ltd. Announces the Following Headlines Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Epsilon Energy Ltd. declares a dividend of $0.0625 per common share and announces the timing of its 2023 year-end earnings release and conference call. The dividend is payable on March 29, 2024, to stockholders of record as of March 15, 2024. The earnings release is scheduled for March 20, 2024, with a conference call on March 21, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a dividend by Epsilon Energy Ltd. represents a tangible return on investment for shareholders and is a critical component of shareholder value. The announced dividend of $0.0625 per share is a direct indicator of the company's current financial health and its ability to generate cash flow. It is important to analyze the dividend yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the price per share. This metric provides insight into the attractiveness of the stock to income-focused investors relative to other companies in the energy sector.Furthermore, the classification of the dividend as an 'eligible dividend' for Canadian tax purposes suggests that Canadian investors may benefit from preferential tax treatment, enhancing the after-tax return on their investment. This could potentially increase the demand for Epsilon's shares among Canadian investors. However, it is crucial to consider the sustainability of these dividends in the context of the company's earnings, payout ratio and long-term financial strategy. Market Research Analyst The timing of the dividend payment close to the earnings release could be strategic, potentially cushioning the stock price against any negative reactions to the year-end financial results. This approach can be seen as a way to maintain investor confidence, especially if the market is not expecting strong year-end results. It's also worth noting that the dividend amount has not changed, which could indicate a steady, but not necessarily growing, financial position.Comparing Epsilon's dividend policy and yield with its peers can provide additional context. For instance, if Epsilon's dividend yield is higher than average within the energy sector, it may attract dividend investors. Conversely, if the yield is lower, it may suggest that the company is reinvesting more of its earnings into growth or debt reduction. The market's reaction to this dividend announcement, juxtaposed with the upcoming earnings release, will provide a clearer picture of investor sentiment towards the company. 03/01/2024 - 07:12 PM Board declares dividend of $0.0625 per common shareCompany announces the timing of its 2023 year end earnings release and conference call HOUSTON, March 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Epsilon Energy Ltd.

Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial data released by Tortoise for its various funds such as TYG, NTG, TTP, NDP and TPZ provides critical insights into the funds' performance and financial health. The asset coverage ratios are particularly noteworthy, as they are a key indicator of a fund's ability to cover its debt obligations. Ratios well above 100% indicate a comfortable buffer, which is reassuring for investors concerned about default risks.TYG's 639% coverage for senior securities and 438% for preferred shares, NTG's 655% and 494%, TTP's 861% and 539%, NDP's 716% and TPZ's 498% suggest that these funds are managing their leverage prudently. This information is crucial for stakeholders analyzing the risk profile of their investments and assessing the funds' compliance with regulatory requirements.Furthermore, the net asset values per share offer a snapshot of the funds' performance and are essential for investors tracking the intrinsic value of their shares. The disclosed total assets and net asset values can impact the funds' share prices and investors' decisions regarding buying, holding, or selling these securities. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the balance sheet updates of Tortoise's funds can influence market sentiment and investor behavior. High asset coverage ratios and solid net asset values can attract investors looking for stability and potentially drive up demand for shares.The funds' focus areas, such as energy infrastructure and midstream energy, are sectors sensitive to commodity prices and regulatory changes, which can affect asset valuations and profitability. Investors and analysts would do well to consider these factors alongside the balance sheet information when evaluating the funds' prospects.The mention of the top 10 holdings on the funds' portfolio web pages is also significant as it provides transparency into the funds' investment strategies and diversification. Concentration in particular holdings or sectors could introduce additional risk factors that investors need to be aware of. Legal Expert Compliance with the 1940 Act is a legal requirement for investment companies and the reported asset coverage ratios suggest that Tortoise's funds are well within the regulatory thresholds. This compliance is crucial not only to avoid legal repercussions but also to maintain investor confidence and trust in fund management.The legal implications of these financial disclosures extend to the accuracy and timeliness of the information provided, which are essential for maintaining market integrity and ensuring that all stakeholders are making informed decisions based on the same set of facts. 03/01/2024 - 06:30 PM OVERLAND PARK, KS - March 1, 2024 - Tortoise today announced the following balance sheet information and asset coverage ratio updates for TYG, NTG, TTP, NDP and TPZ.Tortoise Energy Infrastructure Corp.

The Fund aims for capital growth and income through various investments, including real estate, fixed-rate loans, corporate bonds, equities, and more. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Highland Opportunities and Income Fund (HFRO) regarding its regular monthly distribution of $0.0385 per share is a critical piece of information for current and potential investors. This distribution rate provides insight into the fund's yield, which is a key determinant of the investment's attractiveness, particularly for income-focused investors. The yield, calculated as the annual distribution divided by the share price, serves as a benchmark for comparing the income-generating potential of HFRO against other investment opportunities.Investors often evaluate such funds based on their distribution consistency and the underlying assets' ability to support these payouts. HFRO's investment strategy, which includes a mix of real estate securities, corporate bonds and floating rate loans, among others, suggests a diversified approach aimed at balancing growth and income. The fund's performance, in terms of both capital appreciation and income generation, would need to be analyzed in the context of current market interest rates and the real estate market's health, as these factors can significantly impact the value and stability of the fund's holdings.Moreover, the recent adjustment of the monthly distribution rate in January 2024 indicates that the fund is actively managed to align with its portfolio performance and investment objectives. This could be seen as a positive sign of responsive fund management, but it also necessitates a close examination of the fund's portfolio to understand the drivers behind this adjustment. A change in distribution can sometimes signal shifts in the underlying asset values or the management's outlook on future earnings. Market Research Analyst From a market research perspective, the announcement by HFRO is an event that can influence investor sentiment towards closed-end funds. The ability of HFRO to maintain or adjust its distributions reflects its market positioning and competitive landscape. Closed-end funds like HFRO are often compared based on their distribution rates, portfolio diversity and risk management strategies.The fund's focus on a combination of real estate-related securities and other financial instruments, such as structured products and floating rate loans, indicates an attempt to tap into various sources of income while potentially mitigating risk through diversification. This strategy may appeal to investors looking for exposure to different market segments through a single investment vehicle.Additionally, the fund's emphasis on both direct and indirect investments, including the use of derivatives, is a noteworthy strategy. Derivatives can be used to hedge against market volatility or to gain exposure to certain assets without directly owning them, which can enhance the fund's flexibility in managing its portfolio. However, this also adds a layer of complexity and potential risk that investors need to consider, as derivatives can lead to amplified losses in adverse market conditions. Economist An economist would examine the broader economic implications of HFRO's distribution announcement. The fund's investment in a variety of instruments, including real estate and floating rate loans, indicates it is positioned to capitalize on certain economic conditions, such as stable or increasing property values and potentially rising interest rates. Floating rate loans, in particular, can be attractive during periods of interest rate volatility, as they typically offer interest payments that adjust with market rates, potentially providing a hedge against inflation.However, the overall economic environment must be considered, as it affects the performance of the assets within HFRO's portfolio. For instance, an economic downturn could lead to a decrease in real estate values and an increase in the default rates of corporate bonds and loans. Such conditions would challenge the fund's ability to maintain its distribution rate and could impact its share price.The fund's strategy to invest in distressed securities and structured products further indicates a willingness to engage in higher-risk investments, which could lead to higher returns but also increases the fund's exposure to economic downturns. Investors must weigh these risks against the potential for higher income in the context of their own investment goals and the current economic climate. 03/01/2024 - 06:00 PM DALLAS, March 1, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The Highland Opportunities and Income Fund (NYSE: HFRO) (""HFRO"" or the ""Fund"") today announced its regular monthly distribution on its common stock of $0.0385 per share. The distribution will be payable on March 28, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business March 21, 2024. The Fund is a closed-end fund that seeks to provide growth of capital along with income in a registered fund format. The Fund pursues its investment objective by investing directly and indirectly (e.g., through derivatives that are the economic equivalent of direct investments) in the following categories of securities and instruments: (i) investments in securities or other instruments directly or indirectly secured by real estate, including real estate investment trusts (""REITs""), preferred equity, securities convertible into equity securities and mezzanine debt; (ii) other instruments, including, but not limited to, secured and unsecured fixed-rate loans and corporate bonds, distressed securities, mezzanine securities, structured products (including but not limited to mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations and asset-backed securities), convertible and preferred securities, equities (public and private), and futures and options; and (iii) floating rate loans and other securities deemed to be floating rate investments.

Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the Highland Opportunities and Income Fund carefully before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus, which may be obtained by calling 1-800-357-9167 or visiting nexpointassetmgmt.com. Please read the prospectus carefully before you invest. The distribution may include a return of capital. Please refer to the 19(a)-1 Source of Distribution Notice on the NexPoint Asset Management website for Section 19 notices that provide estimated amounts and sources of the Fund's distributions, which should not be relied upon for tax reporting purposes. No assurance can be given that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. Shares of closed-end investment companies frequently trade at a discount to net asset value. The price of the Fund's shares is determined by a number of factors, several of which are beyond the control of the Fund. Therefore, the Fund cannot predict whether its shares will trade at, below or above net asset value. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Closed-End Fund Risk. The Fund is a closed-end investment company designed primarily for long-term investors and not as a trading vehicle. No assurance can be given that a shareholder will be able to sell his or her shares on the NYSE when he or she chooses to do so, and no assurance can be given as to the price at which any such sale may be affected. Credit Risk. The Fund may invest all or substantially all of its assets in Senior Loans or other securities that are rated below investment grade and unrated Senior Loans deemed by NexPoint to be of comparable quality. Securities rated below investment grade are commonly referred to as ""high yield securities"" or ""junk securities."" They are regarded as predominantly speculative with respect to the issuing company's continuing ability to meet principal and interest payments. Non-payment of scheduled interest and/or principal would result in a reduction of income to the Fund, a reduction in the value of the Senior Loan experiencing non-payment and a potential decrease in the NAV of the Fund. Investments in high yield Senior Loans and other securities may result in greater NAV fluctuation than if the Fund did not make such investments. Real Estate Industry Risk: Issuers principally engaged in real estate industry, including real estate investment trusts, may be subject to risks similar to the risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate, including: (i) changes in general economic and market conditions; (ii) changes in the value of real estate properties; (iii) risks related to local economic conditions, overbuilding and increased competition; (iv) increases in property taxes and operating expenses; (v) changes in zoning laws; (vi) casualty and condemnation losses; (vii) variations in rental income, neighborhood values or the appeal of property to tenants; (viii) the availability of financing and (ix) changes in interest rates and leverage. Illiquidity of Investments Risk. The investments made by the Fund may be illiquid, and consequently the Fund may not be able to sell such investments at prices that reflect the Investment Adviser's assessment of their value or the amount originally paid for such investments by the Fund. Ongoing Monitoring Risk. On behalf of the several Lenders, the Agent generally will be required to administer and manage the Senior Loans and, with respect to collateralized Senior Loans, to service or monitor the collateral. Financial difficulties of Agents can pose a risk to the Fund.

Positive None. Negative None. 03/01/2024 - 09:49 PM PALM BEACH, Fla., March 1, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The renowned Palm Beach Ice Works (PBIW), an Olympic-style ice rink located in West Palm Beach, embarks on a new chapter. After 15 years of leadership, philanthropist Lori Alf has sold the Palm Beach Breakers youth hockey and ice-skating program to Larry Robbins and Longwood Hockey, while also leasing the Palm Beach Ice Works space. Under a comprehensive five-year lease agreement, Rob Laferriere, President of Longwood Hockey, assumes responsibility for overseeing all aspects of rink operations and the hockey program in tandem with the current leadership.For the Alf family, Palm Beach Ice Works holds deep personal significance, which they built for their three children to pursue figure skating and hockey training. With their children now grown, the Alf family opted to list the property for sale and or lease with luxury real estate agents Senada Adžem and Paul Bergman of Douglas Elliman. Their priority was to find a suitable partner who would continue the family's legacy in West Palm Beach. Ms. Alf and Mr. Robbins are dedicated to promoting the development of figure skating and hockey in Palm Beach. They see this transition as the beginning of a new era for PBIW, marked by a continued commitment to growth. After over a year of searching, Longwood Hockey was identified as a perfect partner. Larry Robbins dedication and passion for both on-ice skills development and character building distinguished him as the ideal candidate to perpetuate and enhance the Alf family's efforts in bringing the joy of figure skating and hockey to the Palm Beach community. Mr. Robbins brings an extensive coaching background spanning 18 years of coaching youth hockey at the North Jersey Avalanche, which flourished into the country's leading Midget Hockey program. Larry's teams reached nationals 11 times and produced 75 Division 1 College Hockey players in the past seven years alone. Recently, he has focused on coaching Mite hockey for children aged 8 and under, fostering an early passion and love for the game among the youngest participants. In 2015, Larry acquired the USHL's Chicago Steel and transformed the program into the nation's premier junior hockey program, nurturing talents like Owen Powers, Adam Fantilli, and Macklin Celebrini, all former #1, #3, and projected #1 picks in three of the last four NHL drafts. Beyond his achievements in business, Mr. Robbins is dedicated to philanthropic endeavors that prioritize educational excellence and character development, as evidenced by his support for organizations such as Hockey in Harlem and the Sled Rangers. In 2018 he was honored alongside NHL commissioner Gary Bettman by the Positive Coaching Alliance for their shared commitment to character development in both youth hockey and the broader community. This transaction marks the beginning of Larry, Rob, and the Longwood team's efforts to revolutionize hockey in South Florida, with plans to invest in additional facilities and recruit top-tier coaches to establish the state as a center for on-ice development excellence. In keeping with their consistent approach, they will be organizing free youth clinics later at PBIW in March, featuring prominent guest coaches as a welcoming gesture to the community.

This activity was carried out on Nasdaq Stockholm by Citigroup Global Markets Limited on behalf of Millicom.","Millicom (Tigo) share repurchase activity Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Negative) Tags buyback Rhea-AI Summary Millicom (Tigo) recently announced the repurchase of 52,576 of its Swedish Depository Receipts (SDRs) between February 26, 2024, and March 1, 2024. The repurchases were made at varying daily average prices, totaling to approximately 10 million SEK. This activity was carried out on Nasdaq Stockholm by Citigroup Global Markets Limited on behalf of Millicom. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent share repurchase activity by Millicom is a strategic financial maneuver that can have several implications on the company's valuation and shareholder value. By repurchasing its Swedish Depository Receipts (SDRs), Millicom is reducing the number of shares available in the market, which could potentially increase the earnings per share (EPS) and, consequently, the stock price. This action often signals to the market that the company believes its stock is undervalued and is a good use of its cash reserves.Investors should consider the total repurchase amount in relation to the company's overall market capitalization and cash flow. The repurchase activity, when done at a price perceived to be below the intrinsic value of the company, can be accretive to shareholder value. However, if the repurchases are made at a premium, it could indicate a lack of profitable reinvestment opportunities within the company or an attempt to prop up the share price artificially. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Millicom's repurchase activity must be analyzed in the context of the telecommunications sector and broader market trends. Share repurchase programs are common in industries generating significant free cash flow, as they provide a mechanism for returning value to shareholders. The timing and scale of the repurchases can also reflect the company's confidence in its financial stability and future growth prospects.Market participants will be monitoring the impact of these repurchases on the company's leverage, as well as the opportunity cost of not investing in other areas such as research and development or strategic acquisitions. The repurchase activity could be a response to sector-specific challenges, such as regulatory changes, competition, or technological advancements that require companies to adapt their capital allocation strategies. Legal Expert It is essential to note that Millicom's share repurchase program is executed in accordance with Article 5 of the Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) and the Safe Harbour Regulation. These regulations ensure that the repurchases are conducted in a manner that does not manipulate the market. The adherence to the Safe Harbour rules provides a degree of legal protection against allegations of market abuse. Compliance with these regulations is critical for maintaining investor confidence and avoiding potential legal sanctions.The detailed disclosure of the repurchase transactions, including the number of SDRs repurchased and the average price paid, reflects transparency and is a regulatory requirement that helps maintain a fair market. Stakeholders should be aware that such disclosures are intended to provide clarity on the company's actions and prevent any potential misinterpretation of the buyback program's intent. 03/01/2024 - 05:30 PM Millicom (Tigo) share repurchase activity Luxembourg, March 1, 2024 – Pursuant to the share repurchase program announced on December 15, 2023, Millicom repurchased 52,576 of its Swedish Depository Receipts (SDRs) between February 26, 2024 and March 1, 2024, as detailed in the table below.

Positive None. Negative None. Labor Relations Expert The tentative agreement between CN and the United Steelworkers (USW) Local 2004 is a significant development in labor relations, particularly for a company where track and bridge maintenance is critical to operations. Labor agreements are vital for ensuring uninterrupted services, which in turn, can affect a company's financial performance and stock valuation. A ratified agreement would mitigate the risk of strikes or work stoppages that can lead to operational delays, increased costs and revenue loss.For investors, labor stability can be a positive signal, suggesting predictability in operations and potentially smoother revenue streams. Moreover, labor costs are a significant component of operating expenses for transportation companies. The details of the agreement, once ratified, will be crucial to understanding the financial implications, such as changes in wages or benefits that could affect the company's cost structure and profitability margins. Transportation Industry Analyst In the context of the transportation industry, particularly for rail companies like CN, the efficiency and reliability of track maintenance are directly connected to the company's ability to meet shipping demands. Any disruption in this area can have a ripple effect on supply chains, which may impact CN's reputation and its relationships with clients. Investors and analysts closely monitor such agreements as they can influence a company's competitive position.Furthermore, the outcome of these negotiations can set precedents for other labor agreements within the sector, potentially affecting industry labor costs. It's also important to consider the timing of the agreement's ratification in relation to economic cycles, as labor demands and concessions can vary depending on the state of the economy. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the announcement of a tentative agreement without the disclosure of details limits the ability to fully assess its impact on CN's financials. However, investors can view the progress toward a ratified agreement as a step toward reducing uncertainty. The expiry of the previous agreement without a new one in place could have led to concerns about potential labor disputes.Once the agreement is ratified and details are made public, it will be important to analyze the terms to forecast their impact on the company's labor costs and operating margins. This information can then be incorporated into financial models to adjust earnings projections and valuation metrics. The long-term financial health of CN will be influenced by how the agreement aligns with the company's strategic cost management and investment in infrastructure maintenance. 03/01/2024 - 05:15 PM MONTREAL, March 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CN (TSX: CNR) (NYSE: CNI) announced today that a new tentative three-year collective agreement has been reached with the United Steelworkers (USW) Local 2004.

(AVB) announced CEO Benjamin W. Schall and management will participate in a roundtable discussion at the 2024 Citi Global Property CEO Conference. The company expects a revenue increase of 3.7-3.8% for Q1 2024 compared to the prior year, outperforming expectations. Renewal offers for March and April 2024 are at a 5.0% average increase. The company posted an updated Investor Presentation on its website. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported increase in revenue for AvalonBay Communities, Inc. indicates a positive trend, particularly given that it exceeds the company's own expectations set earlier in the year. A higher revenue growth suggests a robust demand for the company's properties, which can be attributed to several factors such as strategic location, quality of service, or broader economic trends. The 45 basis point increase above the forecasted growth is a strong indicator of operational efficiency and market strength.From a market research perspective, the improvement in economic occupancy year-over-year and the like-term effective rent change provide insight into the company's pricing power and occupancy rates. A closer look at regional performance shows variance, with some areas like the Pacific NW and Mid-Atlantic showing higher rent changes, potentially due to stronger local economies or less housing supply. Conversely, regions like Southern California and New England show more modest increases, which could reflect market saturation or increased competition. Financial Analyst Investors should note the projected outperformance in AvalonBay's revenue, which is primarily attributed to better-than-expected occupancy and lower-than-expected uncollectible lease revenue. This is significant as it implies effective credit management and strong tenant retention strategies. The economic occupancy figures, which reflect the actual revenue-generating capability of the property portfolio, are particularly important as they account for both the physical occupancy and the rent levels that can be achieved in the market.Additionally, the renewal offers for March and April 2024 being delivered at an average increase of 5.0% indicate the company's confidence in its ability to retain tenants at higher rents, which is a positive sign for revenue sustainability. Investors should consider these figures in the context of the company's long-term portfolio strategy and overall market trends, as they could have implications for future dividend payouts and stock performance. Real Estate Economist The data provided by AvalonBay offers a microcosm of the broader real estate market dynamics. Economic occupancy and like-term effective rent change are critical metrics for understanding the health of the residential rental market. The reported increases in these areas suggest a tightening rental market where demand outpaces supply, leading to higher occupancy and the ability to command higher rents. This is consistent with macroeconomic trends of urbanization and housing shortages in certain regions.It is also important to analyze the different regional trends, as they can be indicative of disparate economic conditions and demographic shifts. For instance, the uptick in the Southeast FL and Denver, CO markets could reflect a growing population and economic expansion in these areas. Conversely, the relatively lower performance in regions like Southern California could be a result of affordability issues or a shift in population dynamics. Such regional insights are valuable for investors considering geographic diversification in their real estate investment portfolios. 03/01/2024 - 06:15 PM ARLINGTON, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AVALONBAY COMMUNITIES, INC. (NYSE: AVB) (the “Company”) announced today that Benjamin W. Schall, the Company’s CEO and President, and select members of the Company’s management team will be participating in a roundtable discussion at the 2024 Citi Global Property CEO Conference on Monday, March 4, 2024, at 11:00 A.M. Eastern Time.

The Company also provided the following Same Store Residential operating information: Revenue for the three months ending March 31, 2024 is expected to increase between 3.7% and 3.8% over the prior year period. The midpoint of this range is approximately 45 basis points above what the Company’s expectation was for revenue growth for this three-month period when the Company published its outlook for full year 2024 revenue growth on January 31, 2024. This projected outperformance is primarily attributable to better-than-expected occupancy and lower-than-expected uncollectible lease revenue.

Renewal Offers for March and April 2024 are being delivered to residents at an average increase of 5.0% over the existing lease. The Company has posted an updated Investor Presentation to its website. The presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of www.avalonbay.com. Definitions Economic Occupancy is defined as total possible Residential revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of total possible Residential revenue. Total possible Residential revenue (also known as “gross potential”) is determined by valuing occupied units at contract rates and vacant units at Market Rents. Vacancy loss is determined by valuing vacant units at current Market Rents. By measuring vacant apartments at their Market Rents, Economic Occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community’s gross revenue. Like-Term Effective Rent Change for an individual apartment home represents the percentage change in effective rent between two leases of the same lease term category for the same apartment. The Company defines effective rent as the contractual rent for an apartment less amortized concessions and discounts. Like-Term Effective Rent Change with respect to multiple apartment homes represents an average. New Move-In Like-Term Effective Rent Change is the change in effective rent between the contractual rent for a resident who moves out of an apartment, and the contractual rent for a resident who moves into the same apartment with the same lease term category. Renewal Like-Term Effective Rent Change is the change in effective rent between two consecutive leases of the same lease term category for the same resident occupying the same apartment. Market Rents as reported by the Company are based on the current market rates set by the Company based on its experience in renting apartments and publicly available market data. Market Rents for a period are based on the average Market Rents during that period and do not reflect any impact for cash concessions. Other Expansion Regions include markets located in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Dallas, Texas. Renewal Offers generally represent initial offers made to market rate apartments with expiring leases for which the residents have not provided notice of their intent to vacate. Residential represents results attributable to the Company's apartment rental operations, including parking and other ancillary Residential revenue. Same Store is composed of consolidated communities where a comparison of operating results from the prior year to the current year is meaningful as these communities were owned and had Stabilized Operations, as defined below, as of the beginning of the respective prior year period. Therefore, for 2024 operating results, Same Store is composed of consolidated communities that have Stabilized Operations as of January 1, 2023, are not conducting or are not probable to conduct substantial redevelopment activities and are not held for sale or probable for disposition within the current year. Stabilized Operations is defined as operations of a community that occur after the earlier of (i) attainment of 90% physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of development or redevelopment.

Barnes & Noble Education Receives Continued Listing Standard Notice From NYSE,2024-03-01T22:00:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Barnes & Noble Education, Inc. received a notice from the NYSE indicating non-compliance with the minimum share price requirement. The company plans to cure the deficiency within a six-month period to maintain its listing on the NYSE.","Barnes & Noble Education Receives Continued Listing Standard Notice From NYSE Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Barnes & Noble Education, Inc. received a notice from the NYSE indicating non-compliance with the minimum share price requirement. The company plans to cure the deficiency within a six-month period to maintain its listing on the NYSE. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Receiving a notice of non-compliance from the NYSE is a critical event for a publicly traded company. It indicates that the company's stock price has fallen below the exchange's minimum requirement, which could be a red flag to investors about the company's financial health or market valuation. The six-month cure period provides a window for the company to address the issue, which could involve strategic financial maneuvers such as a reverse stock split or operational improvements aimed at bolstering investor confidence.In the short-term, the stock may experience increased volatility as investors react to the news and the company's plans to regain compliance. Long-term implications could include a reassessment of the company's market position, potential restructuring, or a strategic shift to enhance profitability and shareholder value. If the company fails to regain compliance, it risks being delisted, which could severely limit its ability to raise capital and decrease stock liquidity, negatively affecting existing shareholders. Market Research Analyst The education solutions sector is competitive and rapidly evolving, with digital transformation and the pandemic reshaping the landscape. A company's failure to maintain the minimum stock price could reflect broader market trends or specific operational challenges. It is essential to analyze the company's market share, product offerings and competitive position to understand the underlying causes of the stock price decline.Investors should consider the company's response to the notice and its strategy to regain compliance. This could involve initiatives to increase revenue, cut costs, or improve operational efficiency. The company's ability to adapt to market changes and innovate could be a determining factor in its recovery and ability to satisfy the NYSE's requirements. Economist From an economic perspective, the notice of non-compliance could be symptomatic of macroeconomic factors such as a recession, reduced spending on education, or shifts in educational policy that could affect Barnes & Noble Education's core business. The company's performance must be contextualized within the broader economic environment, including consumer spending patterns and investment in education.Moreover, the company's plan to cure the stock price deficiency will need to account for these external economic pressures. Their strategy could include diversifying revenue streams or exploring new markets to mitigate sector-specific risks. The success of these initiatives will be crucial in determining the company's financial trajectory and its ability to maintain a listing on the NYSE. 03/01/2024 - 05:00 PM BASKING RIDGE, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Barnes & Noble Education, Inc.

The Notice has no immediate impact on the listing of the Company’s common stock on the NYSE.

Negative None. 03/01/2024 - 05:04 PM Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - March 1, 2024) - Element 29 Resources Inc. (TSXV: ECU) (OTCQB: EMTRF) (BVL: ECU) (""Element 29"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce that it has received environmental permit approval for exploration drilling at its wholly-owned Atravesado porphyry target on the Flor de Cobre copper project, located in southern Peru. The permit, known as a Declaración de Impacto Ambiental (""DIA""), allows the Company to drill from a maximum of 40 drilling platforms. Following approval of the environmental permit, Element 29 requested approval from the Peruvian General Mining Bureau (""DGM"") for the Authorization to Initiate Exploration Activities (""AIEA""), which is a normal course step that triggers Peruvian authorities to evaluate the effect of exploration activities on the local community. The outcome of this evaluation will establish whether there is a need for a prior consultation process (""Consulta Previa""). In parallel, the Company is negotiating a surface rights agreement with the local community. After completing these steps, the Company expects that Peruvian authorities will be able to issue approval of the AIEA. Partnering with GlobeTrotters on ExplorationThe Company plans to partner with GlobeTrotters Resource Group (""GlobeTrotters""), a private exploraton company focused on project generation in South America. GlobeTrotters has been actively exploring in Peru for more than 10 years and responsible for the initial discovery of the Company's flagship Elida porphyry Cu-Mo-Ag deposit and the Atravesado porphry Cu target at Flor de Cobre. The plans are to utilize GlobeTrotters' technical expertise in Peru to advance the Company's portfolio of highly prospective porphyry Cu projects and share operational resources to potentially significantly cut costs. The plans to partner with GlobeTrotters, the largest shareholder of the Company, complements the appointment of Manuel Montoya as Chief Technical Officer (see February 29, 2024 press release).Richard Osmond, Chairman and CEO, commented, ""The receipt of the Atravesado target DIA on our Flor de Cobre project is an important step towards drilling this highly prospective target. Our Peruvian team has worked diligently on both permitting and on gaining a better understanding of the Atravesado target. We anticipate receipt of the drill permit by Q3 2024.""Mr. Osmond continues, ""The planned partnership with GlobeTrotters fits perfectly with our strategic plans to reduce corporate costs and focus our efforts as much as possible on advancing our portfolio of highly prospective Peruvian porphyry copper projects in one of the top mining jurisdictions globally.""Atravesado is a large porphyry Cu target on the 1,800 hectare (""ha"") Flor de Cobre property (Figure 1) in the Southern Peru Copper Belt (Figure 2) that hosts some of the world's largest Cu mines and deposits. Outcrop samples anomalous in Cu and molybdenum (""Mo""), resistivity and chargeability anomalies, and corresponding geological indicators define the target with an area of approximately 1.5 km x 2.0 km. Mapping completed by the Element 29 geological team suggests Atravesado is part of a larger porphyry complex that extends to the Candelaria zone to the southeast. The core of the Atravesado target has not been tested by drilling (Figure 1 and Figure 3). Candelaria Concessions As part of the Company's option agreement renegotiation discussions with the underlying property vendor of the Candelaria concessions comprising a total of 127.12 ha, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary Candelaria Resources S.A.C. has signed a non-binding letter of intent following the expiry of the previous 5-year option agreement entered in 2019. The Company will provide status updates on the new negotiations with the property vendor.Figure 1: Map of the Flor de Cobre property, located in southern Peru. Atravesado is a large porphyry Cu-Mo exploration target associated with an increased density of quartz veinlets and late mineral porphyry dikes associated with a cluster of outcrop samples with anomalous Cu geochemistry. The target is also coincident with a high resistivity and moderate chargeability geophysical anomaly at a depth of 250 m thought to represent a leached potassic altered porphyry complex at depth. The location of two historical drill holes outside of the porphyry target area were completed by Anglo American in 2007. The blue dashed line is the location of the section shown in Figure 3 below. Concessions outlined in red are wholly owned by Element 29.

The high chargeability anomalies that straddle the high resistivity anomaly in the center of the section are interpreted to represent a pyritic halo associated with a flanking phyllic alteration zone. The low chargeability anomaly coincident with a moderately to low resistivity anomaly in the upper-central part of the section is interpreted to represent leached capping suggesting potential for enrichment at dept.To view an enhanced version of Figure 3, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/7414/200154_af030d60943ba9fe_003full.jpgQualified Person The scientific and technical content of this news release has been reviewed and approved by Richard Osmond (P.Geo.), Element 29's Chairman and CEO, who is the ""Qualified Person"" as defined by National Instrument 43-101 Standards for Disclosure for Mineral Projects. About Flor de Cobre Flor de Cobre is a porphyry Cu exploration project that contains the recently outlined Atravesado porphyry Cu target 2.5 km northwest of the historical Candelaria mine. The property is in the Southern Peru Copper Belt and is 5 km northwest of Nexa Resources' Chapi mine and 26 km southeast of the Cerro Verde mine owned by Freeport-McMoRan, Sumitomo Metal Mining, and Compañía de Minas Buenaventura. Flor de Cobre hosts a classic Andean porphyry system with primary Cu sulphide mineralization associated with a multi-phase quartz monzonite porphyry complex. Weathering redistributed primary mineralization into a sub-horizontal enrichment blanket containing secondary Cu oxide and sulphide minerals at the base of a hematitic leached cap. Remnants of the upper jarositic component of the leached cap overlying the hematitic cap are preserved on the higher hill tops around the Candelaria prospect. An IP/Resistivity geophysical survey completed in 2019 outlined a core of moderate resistivity that coincides with widespread Cu oxide mineralization, strong Cu geochemistry, and late-stage quartz monzodiorite porphyry dikes. The resistive core is surrounded by a high-chargeability halo corresponding with weathered quartz-sericite-pyrite alteration.About Element 29 Resources Inc. Element 29 Resources Inc. is an emerging copper exploration and development company focused on advancing its portfolio of Peruvian projects towards development in one of the world's more established mining jurisdictions. Element 29's growth strategy is led by our strong board and management, who have a proven track record of discovery and delivering value to our shareholders. The Company's principal objective is to explore and develop its Flor de Cobre Porphyry Cu Project located in the Southern Peru Copper Belt, 26 km southeast from Freeport-McMoRan's Cerro Verde copper mine, and its Elida Porphyry Cu Deposit in west-central Peru. Both projects are well located for potential mine development and will benefit from nearby infrastructure including roads, powerlines, ports, water, and a skilled workforce.

Global Self Storage Declares First Quarter 2024 Dividend,2024-03-01T22:25:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Global Self Storage, Inc. (NASDAQ:SELF) declares a cash dividend of $0.0725 per common share for Q1 2024, aiming to increase shareholder value through strategic business plans and property acquisitions.","Global Self Storage Declares First Quarter 2024 Dividend Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags dividends earnings Rhea-AI Summary Global Self Storage, Inc. (NASDAQ:SELF) declares a cash dividend of $0.0725 per common share for Q1 2024, aiming to increase shareholder value through strategic business plans and property acquisitions. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a cash dividend by Global Self Storage, Inc. is a significant indicator of the company's current financial health and its commitment to returning value to shareholders. Dividends are typically distributed by companies that are in a stable or mature phase of their business cycle, suggesting a steady stream of income that can support regular payouts. The dividend yield, calculated by annualizing the quarterly dividend and dividing by the stock price, is a critical metric for income-focused investors.From a financial analysis perspective, the announced dividend also reflects on the company’s cash flow management and capital allocation strategy. The ability to pay dividends consistently can often be viewed as a sign of financial stability and prudent management. However, investors should also consider the company's payout ratio—the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends—to assess the sustainability of the dividend in the long term. Market Research Analyst The self-storage industry is often considered recession-resistant due to the constant demand for storage regardless of economic conditions. This resilience contributes to the attractiveness of real estate investment trusts (REITs) like Global Self Storage in the investment community. The company's focus on acquisitions and expansion indicates a growth-oriented approach, which could enhance its portfolio and revenue streams in the future. It is crucial to analyze market trends, such as occupancy rates and rental price growth within the self-storage sector, to forecast potential performance.Moreover, the company's strategy to balance capital formation and maintain optimal debt levels is essential in managing risk, especially in a rising interest rate environment. Investors should monitor these metrics, as they can significantly impact the company's ability to finance its growth and maintain dividend payouts. Real Estate Investment Analyst For stakeholders in the REIT sector, the metrics outlined by Global Self Storage's board, such as FFO (Funds From Operations) and AFFO (Adjusted Funds From Operations), are pivotal. FFO adds depreciation and amortization to earnings, while AFFO further adjusts for rent increases and capital expenditures, providing a clearer picture of the company's operational performance. These indicators are more accurate than traditional earnings metrics for evaluating a REIT's profitability and ability to sustain dividends.Investors should also consider the company's capitalization rate, which is the rate of return on a real estate investment property based on the income that the property is expected to generate. This can provide insights into the property value and the potential return on investment. Given the strategic focus on acquisitions and expansions, the effective management of these projects is critical to driving shareholder value and justifying the dividend policy. 03/01/2024 - 05:25 PM MILLBROOK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / March 1, 2024 / Global Self Storage, Inc.

About BioVie Inc.BioVie Inc. (NASDAQ: BIVI) is a clinical-stage company developing innovative drug therapies for the treatment of neurological and neurodegenerative disorders and advanced liver disease. In neurodegenerative disease, the Company’s drug candidate NE3107 inhibits inflammatory activation of ERK and NFkB (e.g., TNF signaling) that leads to neuroinflammation and insulin resistance, but not their homeostatic functions (e.g., insulin signaling and neuron growth and survival). Both are drivers of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. The Company conducted and reported efficacy data from its randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study to evaluate NE3107 in patients who have mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (NCT04669028). Results of a Phase 2 investigator-initiated trial (NCT05227820) showing NE3107-treated patients experienced improved cognition and biomarker levels were presented at the Clinical Trial in Alzheimer’s Disease annual conference in December 2022. An estimated six million Americans suffer from Alzheimer’s. A Phase 2 study of NE3107 in Parkinson’s disease (NCT05083260) has completed, and data presented at the International Conference on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease and Related Neurological Disorders conference in Gothenburg, Sweden in March 2023 showed significant improvements in “morning on” symptoms and clinically meaningful improvement in motor control in patients treated with a combination of NE3107 and levodopa vs. patients treated with levodopa alone, and no drug-related adverse events. In liver disease, the Company’s Orphan drug candidate BIV201 (continuous infusion terlipressin), with U.S Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) Fast Track status, is being evaluated and discussed with guidance received from the FDA regarding the design of Phase 3 clinical testing of BIV201 for the treatment of ascites due to chronic liver cirrhosis. The active agent is approved in the U.S. and in about 40 countries for related complications of advanced liver cirrhosis. For more information, visit http://www.bioviepharma.com/.

Financial Analyst The announcement of a dividend payment is a significant event for shareholders as it directly impacts their return on investment. The specified dividend of $.04 per share may seem modest, but it's essential to consider the yield in relation to the share price. A consistent dividend can signal a stable cash flow and a management team confident in the Fund's financial health. However, investors should also consider the Fund's payout ratio, which indicates the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends, to assess sustainability. Market Research Analyst The New America High Income Fund's status as a diversified, closed-end management investment company with a leveraged capital structure has implications for risk and return. Leverage can amplify gains but also losses, which is a critical consideration for risk-averse investors. The Fund's focus on 'high yield' investments typically involves greater risk compared to investment-grade securities. It's important to examine the Fund's updated portfolio data for asset allocation and credit quality to gauge the risk-adjusted return potential. Investment Advisor Investors evaluating the Fund should not only focus on the dividend announcement but also on the pedigree of the investment adviser, T. Rowe Price. With a long history since 1937 and a significant amount of assets under management, including a substantial portfolio of high yield investments, T. Rowe Price's experience in managing high-yield assets could be a positive indicator of the Fund's potential performance.

Each Class A depositary share is equivalent to one-twentieth of a share of SITE Centers’ 6.375% Class A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. The dividend covers the period from January 15, 2024, to April 14, 2024, and will be paid in cash on April 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of March 28, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of the first quarter 2024 Preferred Class A stock dividend by SITE Centers Corp. is a significant event for income-focused investors and analysts monitoring the real estate investment trust (REIT) sector. The dividend rate of $0.39844 per depositary share reflects a substantial yield based on the current price of the preferred stock. This yield is particularly noteworthy in the context of the broader fixed-income market, where interest rates set by central banks influence the attractiveness of such dividends.Moreover, the consistency of dividend payments is often seen as a sign of financial stability and could be indicative of SITE Centers' operational cash flow. It is crucial to compare the dividend payout ratio with the company's earnings to assess the sustainability of these dividends. If the payout ratio is high relative to the company's net income, it may suggest that the dividends are being funded from sources other than earnings, which could raise questions about long-term sustainability. Market Research Analyst An analysis of the impact of SITE Centers Corp.'s dividend declaration on the stock market requires understanding the investor sentiment towards REITs and their associated risk profile. Dividends from REITs like SITE Centers are often sought after by investors seeking regular income streams and such announcements can influence the company's stock performance.It is important to evaluate the market conditions, including consumer spending habits and the health of the retail sector, as these factors directly affect the revenue of open-air shopping centers. The current economic climate, including inflation rates and consumer confidence, could also play a role in determining the performance of SITE Centers' assets and, by extension, its ability to maintain dividend distributions. Real Estate Investment Analyst The dividend announcement by SITE Centers Corp., which specializes in open-air shopping centers, offers insights into the niche market of suburban retail properties. Location is a key factor in real estate and SITE Centers' focus on high household income communities could imply a strategic advantage. These areas typically exhibit a stronger retail spending pattern, which may translate into more stable rental income for SITE Centers.Understanding the company's tenant mix and lease durations is essential, as a diverse portfolio with long-term leases can mitigate risks associated with economic downturns.

The MRE was prepared by Yann Camus, P.Eng., of SGS Canada Inc. - Geological Services (""SGS"").Highlights:The maiden MRE for the PCH Project is estimated at 52.8 million tonnes (Mt) comprising:6.6 Mt Indicated resource with a grade of 2,513 parts per million (ppm) total rare earth oxide (TREO).46.2 Mt Inferred resource with a grade of 2,888 ppm TREO.The deposit contains significant concentrations of Neodymium (Nd), Praseodymium (Pr), Dysprosium (Dy), and Terbium (Tb) which are the rare earth elements used in the production of permanent magnets and currently under high demand.The Company is currently undertaking a significant evaluation of the potential desorbed rare earth oxide (DREO), and results are pending.Significant anomalies of Scandium and Cobalt have been identified in the Buriti Zone, adding additional potential resource value to the project.Tom Drivas stated, ""Appia's team has done a tremendous amount of work over the past 8 months leading to the commissioning of this maiden MRE on our two (2) initial project areas, Target IV and the Buriti Zone. I couldn't be more pleased to confirm that our conviction was well placed as there is immense potential at our PCH project in Brazil. With an estimated 6.6 million tonnes of high-grade mineralization in the indicated category and 46.2 million tonnes of high-grade mineralization in the inferred category, and with some of the highest TREO grades in the world, we are well on our way to establishing the Company as a leader not only in Brazil, but the around the globe.""Stephen Burega, President, commented, ""Today's announcement is very important to the Company and our shareholders, and this is only the beginning for this amazing project. We have delineated a combined resource of 52.8 million tonnes of high-grade mineralization in an area of only 483 hectares across both target zones. Appia is continuing its exploratory auger drilling program to test multiple new target areas across the PCH project which covers over 40,000 hectares. We will continue to evaluate future targets for TREO as well as for Scandium and Cobalt potential."" Mineral Resource StatementThe block model representing the Current Resource of the PCH deposit is based on a total of 138 RC drillholes and 1 Diamond drillhole, which produced 1,869 samples in the 3 layers (Top Soil, Clay and Saprolite) above the rock. The 3 softer material layers were interpreted and modelled from this data.

Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves have not demonstrated economic viability. Additional drilling will be required to convert Inferred and Indicated Mineral Resources to Measured Mineral Resources. There is no certainty that any part of a Mineral Resource will ever be converted into Reserves.All analyses used for the MRE were performed by SGS GEOSOL by ICM40B: Multi Acid Digestion / ICP OES - ICP MS and by IMS95R: Lithium Metaborate Fusion / ICP-MS.MRE are stated at a cut-off total NSR value of 10 US$/t. The full price list and recovery used to estimate the NSR is in Table 2. The estimated basket price of TREO is US$26.98.GEOVIA's WhittleTM software was used to provide an optimized pit envelope to demonstrate reasonable prospection for economic extraction. Preliminary pit optimization parameters included overall pit slope of 30 degrees, in-pit mining costs of $2.10, processing and G/A costs of $9/t, and overall mining loss and dilution of 5%. Full details of the preliminary pit-optimization parameters can be found in Table 2. The basket price and oxides price list in Table 2 are based on forward-looking pricing. These future prices are predicted based on market trends, economic forecasts, and other relevant factors. The actual prices may vary depending on changes in these factors.Figures are rounded to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimate and numbers may not add due to rounding.Resources are presented undiluted and in situ, constrained within a 3D model, and are considered to have reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction.Bulk density values were determined based on physical test work and assumed porosities for each type of material.Total Rare Earth Oxides: TREO = Y2O3 + Eu2O3 + Gd2O3 + Tb2O3 + Dy2O3 + Ho2O3 + Er2O3 + Tm2O3 + Yb2O3 + Lu2O3 + La2O3 + Ce2O3 + Pr2O3 + Nd2O3 + Sm2O3Magnetic Rare Earth Oxides: MREO = Sm2O3 + Tb4O7 + Dy2O3 + Pr6O11 + Nd2O3 Heavy Rare Earth Oxides: HREO = Sm2O3 + Eu2O3 + Gd2O3 + Tb4O7 + Dy2O3 + Ho2O3 + Er2O3 + Tm2O3 + Yb2O3 + Lu2O3The MRE may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-political, marketing, or other relevant issues.The MRE is constrained within an optimized pit envelope using assumptions found in Table 2.

Therefore, only the RC and Diamond drillholes were used for the MRE estimation. The hard rock, while mineralized, was not included in the MRE because the required process would be different and is not currently part of the development strategy. Also, data from the hard rock is currently limited. Blocks of 10 x 10 x 0.2 m were used to fill the 3 layers volumes. The composites used are the original assays given that 1867 of the 1868 assay in the 3 layers have lengths between 0.5 m and 1.05 m. Capping was studied but was deemed unnecessary because no significant extreme grades are present in the database. It is estimated that capping of highest grades could potentially reduce the MRE by around 1%. Estimation of the block model was prepared by Yann Camus, P.Eng., of SGS Canada Inc. - Geological Services (""SGS"") from Blainville, Quebec, using the SGS Genesis© mining software. Interpolation was performed using inverse square distance (ID2) as well as different search ellipses which were adapted for the geology of the deposit with variable orientations to conform to the geometry of the 3 layers. Estimation was done in 3 passes. The composites used pertain to each layer as hard boundaries. Mineralized material classification was outlined by hand as Indicated in areas with at least 3 drillholes with a drilling grid of around 100 m. Inferred resources are in areas with a drill grid of up to 200 m. At this point, there are no measured resources in the project. The block model was then fed to GEOVIA's WhittleTM software to provide an optimized pit envelope constraining the Current Resource. The TREO basket price found for the MRE is 26.98 US$/kg TREO as detailed in Table 2. The base case MRE is detailed in Table 1.QA/QCReverse circulation (RC) drill holes are vertical and reported intervals are true thickness. The material produced from drill holes are sampled at one metre intervals, resulting in average sample sizes of 5-25 kg. A small representative specimen was taken from each sample bag and placed into a chip tray for visual inspection and logging by the geologist. Quartering of the material was performed at Appia's logging facility using a riffle splitter and continued splitting until a representative sample weighing approximately 500g each was obtained, bagged in a resistant plastic bag, labeled, photographed, and stored for shipment.The bagged samples are sent to the SGS laboratory in Vespasiano, Minas Gerais. In addition to the internal QA/QC of the SGS Lab, Appia includes its own control samples in each batch of samples sent to the laboratory.Quality control samples, such as blanks, duplicates, and standards (CRM) were inserted into each analytical run. For all analysis methods, the minimum number of QA/QC samples is one standard, one duplicate and one blank, introduced in each batch which comprise a full-length hole. The rigorous procedures are implemented during the sample collection, preparation, and analytical stages to insure the robustness and reliability of the analytical results.All analytical results reported herein have passed internal QA/QC review and compilation. All assay results of RC samples were provided by SGS Geosol, an ISO/IEC 17025:2005 Certified Laboratory, which performed their measure of the concentration of rare earth elements (REE) analyses by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) analytical methods.Qualified PersonThe technical content in this news release was reviewed and approved by Mr. Don Hains, P.Geo, Consulting Geologist, and a Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101.The MRE has been prepared by Yann Camus, P.Eng., of SGS Canada Inc. - Geological Services (""SGS"") from Blainville, Quebec and is a Qualified Person (QP) as defined under NI 43-101.

"ARMOUR Residential REIT, Inc. Announces Updated Estimated Book Value",2024-03-01T21:21:00.000Z,Low,Very Negative,"ARMOUR Residential REIT, Inc. (ARR) reported an estimated book value per common share between $20.96 and $21.06 as of February 29, 2024.","ARMOUR Residential REIT, Inc. Announces Updated Estimated Book Value Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary ARMOUR Residential REIT, Inc. (ARR) reported an estimated book value per common share between $20.96 and $21.06 as of February 29, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent announcement by ARMOUR Residential REIT, Inc. regarding its estimated book value per common share is a key metric for investors and analysts. Book value is a measure of the net asset value of a company, calculated as total assets minus intangible assets and liabilities. It provides an insight into what shareholders might expect to receive if the company were liquidated. The range provided, $20.96 to $21.06, suggests a stable financial position, although investors will compare this with past figures and the current market price of the shares to assess the potential for investment.It is essential to consider the company's historical book value trends and how these figures align with market expectations. A book value that is significantly lower than the market price could indicate that the stock is overvalued, while a book value near or above the market price may suggest undervaluation. Additionally, the stability of the book value over time can signal the company's resilience to market volatility, which is particularly relevant for a real estate investment trust (REIT) given the cyclical nature of real estate markets. Real Estate Market Analyst ARMOUR Residential REIT's disclosure of its book value is particularly pertinent to stakeholders within the real estate sector. As a REIT, ARMOUR's portfolio consists of mortgage-backed securities and its value is inherently linked to the performance of the housing market and interest rate fluctuations. The reported range indicates that the company has a solid grasp on its asset valuation, which can be reassuring for investors who rely on the stability and predictability of returns from real estate investments.Moreover, the book value per share is an important indicator for evaluating a REIT's performance relative to its peers. It can reflect the management's effectiveness in property selection and capital appreciation. However, investors should also consider the company's dividend yield and payout ratio, as these are crucial factors for REITs, given their requirement to distribute a significant portion of income to shareholders. 03/01/2024 - 04:21 PM VERO BEACH, Florida, March 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ARMOUR Residential REIT, Inc.

Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported surge in operating metrics for FlexTV, a subsidiary of Mega Matrix Corp., indicates a significant uptick in user engagement and revenue generation. A 360% increase in top-up and subscription fee revenue is a noteworthy achievement, likely to pique the interest of investors and analysts. This performance is a clear reflection of successful content strategy and market penetration. The focus on short dramas, a format gaining traction among mobile users, suggests that MPU is effectively capitalizing on current consumer content consumption trends.From a market research perspective, the success of the series 'Mr. Williams! Madame is Dying' could be indicative of a broader shift towards short-form, episodic content. The ability to film in diverse international locations and the intention to expand further suggests strategic moves to diversify content and appeal to a global audience. MPU's growth trajectory in this sector could position it as a formidable competitor in the streaming industry, potentially affecting the market share of established players. Financial Analyst The financial implications of FlexTV's performance for Mega Matrix Corp. are substantial. The 356% increase in unaudited revenue from various income streams, including top-up, subscription and advertising, provides a strong indicator of the subsidiary's contribution to MPU's overall financial health. This level of growth, if sustained, could lead to upward revisions in earnings forecasts and potentially influence the company's stock valuation positively.Investors should note the impact of unaudited figures, which while promising, will need to be confirmed through formal financial auditing processes. The emphasis on unaudited figures in the announcement may affect investor confidence until verified. However, the early success in 2024 sets a positive tone for MPU's Q1 outlook, which could lead to increased investor interest and potentially higher liquidity in MPU's stock. Content Strategy Expert The narrative efficiency and unique format of short dramas represent a strategic content innovation by FlexTV. This approach not only caters to the growing demand for quick and engaging entertainment suited for mobile consumption but also allows for creative storytelling that can resonate with a diverse audience. The success of this format could serve as a case study for content strategy within the entertainment industry.The ability to scale production across multiple countries and the intent to establish local partnerships are strategic moves that could enhance FlexTV's content relevance and cultural resonance in international markets. This global approach to content production and distribution is an important aspect of FlexTV's business model, which other industry players may look to emulate as they strive to capture a share of the global audience. 03/01/2024 - 04:20 PM PALO ALTO, Calif., March 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mega Matrix Corp.

The dividend will be payable on March 28, 2024, to common stockholders of record on March 15, 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a cash dividend by Stewart Information Services Corporation represents a tangible return on investment for shareholders. From a financial perspective, the dividend yield, calculated as the annual dividends per share divided by the share price, becomes a critical metric for investors. This yield offers insights into the company's ability to generate cash and return it to shareholders, an important aspect of shareholder value. Furthermore, the consistency and growth of dividends over time are often interpreted as signs of a company's financial health and stability.Investors should also consider the payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends. A sustainable payout ratio indicates that the company is not overextending itself, while a high ratio could suggest potential cash flow issues in the future. Additionally, the timing of the dividend payment relative to the fiscal calendar could influence short-term stock price movements as investors position themselves to capture the dividend, a phenomenon known as the 'dividend capture strategy'. Market Research Analyst In the context of the real estate information services industry, where Stewart Information Services operates, dividend announcements can reflect broader economic conditions. The real estate market is cyclical and sensitive to interest rates, which can impact companies like Stewart Information Services. A stable dividend might suggest that the company is not only managing its resources well but also navigating the economic environment effectively.It is also essential to consider the competitive landscape. How does Stewart Information Services' dividend compare to its peers? Are they providing higher or lower yields and what does that say about their market position? A company that can offer a competitive dividend may be seen as more attractive to income-focused investors, potentially increasing demand for its stock. 03/01/2024 - 04:20 PM HOUSTON, March 1, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Stewart Information Services Corporation (NYSE:STC) today announced that its Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.475 per share for the first quarter 2024, payable March 28, 2024, to common stockholders of record on March 15, 2024.

Discloses Communication from NYSE American Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Trinity Place Holdings Inc. (NYSE American: TPHS) announced that NYSE American accepted their compliance plan, granting a cure period until May 29, 2025. The Company received a deficiency letter due to stockholders' deficit and losses in recent fiscal years. The NYSE American will monitor compliance with the plan, with potential delisting if requirements are not met by the deadline. Positive None. Negative The Company received a deficiency letter from NYSE American due to stockholders' deficit and losses in recent fiscal years, indicating financial challenges. The potential delisting proceedings by NYSE American if the Company fails to meet continued listing standards by May 29, 2025, poses a risk to the Company's stock performance and investor confidence. Financial Analyst The acceptance of Trinity Place Holdings Inc.'s compliance plan by the NYSE American represents a crucial lifeline for the company, allowing it continued access to public equity markets. The extended cure period until May 29, 2025, provides a temporal cushion for the company to address its financial deficiencies and re-establish compliance with the listing standards, particularly the stockholders' deficit and the pattern of net losses.From a financial perspective, the 'below compliance' (.BC) designation is a red flag to investors, signaling heightened risk. It may result in increased volatility of the Common Stock and potentially reduced liquidity as some institutional investors have mandates that preclude investment in stocks not fully compliant with exchange requirements. The company's ability to attract new capital might be compromised, affecting its operational flexibility and strategic options.It is essential to monitor the company's progress against the Plan. Failure to adhere to the agreed initiatives or to show consistent progress may lead to delisting, which would likely have a significant negative impact on the company's stock price and its ability to raise funds in the future. Market Research Analyst Analyzing the market implications of Trinity Place Holdings Inc.'s situation, the market's reaction to the news of the compliance plan's acceptance is an indicator of investor confidence in the company's ability to turn around its financials. While the stock will continue trading, the added '.BC' designation may deter some investors, but it could also attract speculative traders looking for potential upside if the company successfully executes its Plan.Additionally, the company's recent closure of transactions under the Stock Purchase Agreement suggests strategic movements that could be aimed at improving financial stability. The stipulation of a potential delisting from the NYSE American within forty-five days post-closing, unless certain conditions are met, indicates a critical juncture for the company's capital structure and investor relations. The outcome of these strategic initiatives will be closely watched by the market, as they could significantly influence the company's future financial health and stock performance. Legal Expert The legal ramifications of the compliance plan's acceptance and the potential delisting scenario pose several considerations for Trinity Place Holdings Inc. The company must navigate the stringent regulatory environment of the NYSE American's listing standards while also adhering to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement and its obligations to the SEC. Compliance with these multifaceted legal and regulatory requirements is critical for maintaining investor trust and avoiding further legal complexities.Moreover, the company's ongoing business operations and SEC reporting requirements remain unaffected, which is crucial for maintaining transparency and upholding corporate governance standards. Investors should be aware of the legal stipulations of the Stock Purchase Agreement, as these will dictate the company's actions regarding the listing of its Common Stock and could have substantial legal and financial consequences if not managed effectively. 03/01/2024 - 04:15 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Trinity Place Holdings Inc. (NYSE American: TPHS) (the “Company”) announced that on February 21, 2024, the NYSE American notified the Company that it had reviewed the plan of compliance (the “Plan”) that the Company submitted to the NYSE American and determined to accept the Plan and grant a cure period through May 29, 2025.

As a result of the acceptance of the Company’s plan of compliance, the Company’s listing is being continued pursuant to an extension. The NYSE American staff will review the Company periodically for compliance with the initiatives outlined in the Plan. If the Company is not in compliance with the continued listing standards by May 29, 2025 or if the Company does not make progress consistent with the Plan during the cure period, the NYSE American staff will initiate delisting proceedings as appropriate. This notification from the NYSE American has no immediate impact on the listing of the Company’s shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”), which will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE American during the period mentioned above, subject to the Company’s compliance with the other listing requirements of the NYSE American.

(MAA) regarding its quarterly dividend for its 8.50% Series I Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock is a significant indicator of the company's current financial health and its commitment to delivering shareholder value. The dividend yield, calculated by dividing the annual dividends per share by the price per share, is an essential metric for income-focused investors. Given the fixed dividend rate of 8.50%, it offers a predictable income stream, which can be particularly attractive in volatile market conditions.However, it is crucial to assess the sustainability of these dividends by examining the company's payout ratio, cash flow statements and earnings reports. A payout ratio that is too high could signal potential trouble if earnings decrease, as it might not be sustainable in the long run. Additionally, investors should be aware of the tax implications of dividend income, as it can affect the net return on their investment. Real Estate Market Analyst As a Real Estate Market Analyst, the announcement from MAA should be contextualized within the broader real estate market trends. The real estate investment trust (REIT) sector has been historically known for providing substantial dividend yields due to the requirement to distribute at least 90% of taxable income to shareholders. MAA's dividend declaration reflects its operational performance in the residential real estate market, particularly in the multifamily housing segment.Investors should consider the occupancy rates, rental income growth and geographic diversification of MAA's property portfolio, as these factors directly impact the company's revenue-generating capability. The current economic conditions, including interest rates and housing market dynamics, can also influence REIT performance. An understanding of these elements can provide insights into the potential for future dividend stability or growth. 03/01/2024 - 04:15 PM GERMANTOWN, Tenn., March 1, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc., or MAA (NYSE: MAA), today announced a full quarterly dividend of $1.0625 per outstanding share of its 8.50% Series I Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock.

The Fund aims for high current income and capital gains through stock investments and covered call options. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of the quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share by the Madison Covered Call and Equity Strategy Fund (MCN) is a noteworthy event for shareholders and potential investors as it directly affects the income they receive from their investment. Dividends are a significant component of total return for investors, especially in a low-interest-rate environment. The declaration indicates the Fund's ability to generate cash flow and its commitment to returning capital to shareholders.Investors should be aware that the dividend amount is a key factor in the Fund's yield calculation, which is a common metric used to compare the income-generating potential of similar investment products. The yield, along with the payout ratio, can provide insights into the sustainability of the dividend. A payout ratio that is too high could indicate potential stress on the Fund's ability to maintain dividend levels in the future.Furthermore, the mention of Section 19(a) suggests that if the dividend is derived from sources other than income, such as capital gains or return of capital, it might not accurately reflect the Fund's performance. This distinction is crucial for evaluating the quality of dividends as income-focused investors prefer dividends paid out of earnings rather than capital. Market Research Analyst The Fund's strategy of using covered call options is an income-generating technique that can offer insights into its risk profile and market expectations. Covered calls can provide additional income but also limit the portfolio's upside potential if the underlying stocks appreciate significantly beyond the strike price of the calls. This strategy is typically employed in markets where moderate growth is expected, as it can enhance income while potentially tempering volatility.Investors should consider the Fund's option strategy in the context of their overall portfolio and risk tolerance. The use of covered calls suggests a focus on income generation over capital appreciation, aligning with the Fund's stated objective. However, market conditions that lead to increased volatility can affect the premiums received from writing options and, by extension, the overall performance of the Fund.It is also important to monitor the Fund's total assets, as significant changes can impact the ability to sustain dividend payments. A shrinking asset base can signal redemptions or poor performance, while growth in assets might indicate investor confidence and potentially more resources to generate income. Economist The dividend declaration by MCN should be evaluated within the broader economic context. Dividends are influenced by both company-specific factors and macroeconomic conditions. In a growing economy, companies may have higher profits and cash flow, potentially leading to higher dividends. Conversely, in a recession, companies may cut dividends to preserve cash.The current economic indicators, such as interest rates, inflation and GDP growth, can also affect investor preferences between dividend-paying equities and other income-generating assets like bonds. In a low-interest-rate environment, dividend-paying funds might be more attractive to income-seeking investors. However, if interest rates rise, the relative appeal of such funds could diminish as safer assets offer competitive yields.Lastly, forward-looking statements regarding the Fund's future performance are subject to a variety of risks, including market volatility and changes in the equity markets. These factors can significantly influence the Fund's ability to achieve its objectives and sustain its dividend policy, thus impacting investor sentiment and the Fund's market price. 03/01/2024 - 04:30 PM MADISON, Wis., March 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Madison Covered Call and Equity Strategy Fund (NYSE:MCN) (the “Fund”) declares its quarterly dividend of $0.18/share.

Shareholders should be aware of the potential for return of capital in distributions. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a consistent monthly distribution by XAI Octagon Floating Rate & Alternative Income Trust (XFLT) maintains investor expectations regarding cash flow from the investment. Stability in distribution amounts is generally perceived positively by the market, as it suggests a level of predictability in returns, which is particularly appealing to income-focused investors. However, it is essential to monitor the sources of these distributions. If distributions are frequently derived from capital rather than income, it may indicate that the Trust's investments are not generating enough income, which could be a red flag for sustainability of future distributions.It is also noteworthy that the Trust's investments in Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs) can lead to discrepancies between GAAP income and taxable income due to complex tax rules. This could affect the after-tax returns for shareholders and should be carefully considered when assessing the Trust's performance. Additionally, the potential for distributions to constitute a return of capital can have tax implications for shareholders, potentially increasing their capital gains liability upon the sale of shares. Tax Expert Investors should be aware of the tax implications of the Trust's distributions, particularly the distinction between ordinary income and return of capital. A return of capital is not immediately taxable but does reduce an investor's cost basis in the investment, potentially leading to higher capital gains taxes upon sale. Furthermore, the Trust's compliance with the excise tax requirements, mandating the distribution of a certain percentage of income and gains, is crucial for avoiding additional tax burdens on the Trust itself, which could indirectly impact shareholder value.The disclosure that the final taxable income will not be known until tax returns are filed emphasizes the importance of tax planning for shareholders. The complexity of tax treatment for CLOs should not be underestimated and shareholders may need to consult with tax professionals to understand the potential impact on their individual tax situations. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the Trust's investment strategy focusing on floating rate credit instruments and structured credit investments is designed to provide income across various credit cycles. This approach can offer a hedge against interest rate fluctuations, a significant consideration given the current environment of potential rate changes by central banks. However, the statement that there is no assurance of achieving the investment objective is standard and highlights the inherent risks involved in such investment strategies.The Trust's emphasis on maintaining stable distributions may appeal to a certain segment of the market, particularly risk-averse investors seeking regular income streams. Nevertheless, the ability of the Trust to continue these distributions without compromising its capital base is contingent upon the performance of its underlying assets and adherence to financial covenants of its senior securities, which requires ongoing scrutiny. 03/01/2024 - 04:15 PM CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- XAI Octagon Floating Rate & Alternative Income Trust (the “Trust”) has declared its regular monthly distribution of $0.085 per share on the Trust’s common shares (NYSE: XFLT), payable on April 1, 2024, to common shareholders of record as of March 15, 2024, as noted below.

The specific tax characteristics of the distributions will be reported to the Trust’s common shareholders on Form 1099 after the end of the 2024 calendar year. Shareholders should not assume that the source of a distribution from the Trust is net income or profit. For further information regarding the Trust’s distributions, please visit www.xainvestments.com. The Trust’s net investment income and capital gain can vary significantly over time; however, the Trust seeks to maintain more stable common share monthly distributions over time. The Trust’s investments in CLOs are subject to complex tax rules and the calculation of taxable income attributed to an investment in CLO subordinated notes can be dramatically different from the calculation of income for financial reporting purposes under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), and, as a result, there may be significant differences between the Trust’s GAAP income and its taxable income. The Trust’s final taxable income for the current fiscal year will not be known until the Trust’s tax returns are filed. As a registered investment company, the Trust is subject to a 4% excise tax that is imposed if the Trust does not distribute to common shareholders by the end of any calendar year at least the sum of (i) 98% of its ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gain or loss) for the calendar year and (ii) 98.2% of its capital gain in excess of its capital loss (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for a one-year period generally ending on October 31 of the calendar year (unless an election is made to use the Trust’s fiscal year). In certain circumstances, the Trust may elect to retain income or capital gain to the extent that the Board of Trustees, in consultation with Trust management, determines it to be in the interest of shareholders to do so. The common share distributions paid by the Trust for any particular period may be more than the amount of net investment income from that period. As a result, all or a portion of a distribution may be a return of capital, which is in effect a partial return of the amount a common shareholder invested in the Trust, up to the amount of the common shareholder’s tax basis in their common shares, which would reduce such tax basis. Although a return of capital may not be taxable, it will generally increase the common shareholder’s potential gain, or reduce the common shareholder’s potential loss, on any subsequent sale or other disposition of common shares. The distribution shall be paid on the Payment Date unless the payment of such distribution is deferred by the Board of Trustees upon a determination that such deferral is required in order to comply with applicable law to ensure that the Trust remains solvent and able to pay its debts as they become due and continue as a going concern, or to comply with the applicable terms or financial covenants of the Trust’s senior securities. Future common share distributions will be made if and when declared by the Trust’s Board of Trustees, based on a consideration of number of factors, including the Trust’s continued compliance with terms and financial covenants of its senior securities, the Trust’s net investment income, financial performance and available cash. There can be no assurance that the amount or timing of common share distributions in the future will be equal or similar to that described herein or that the Board of Trustees will not decide to suspend or discontinue the payment of common share distributions in the future. The investment objective of the Trust is to seek attractive total return with an emphasis on income generation across multiple stages of the credit cycle. The Trust seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in a dynamically managed portfolio of opportunities primarily within the private credit markets. Under normal market conditions, the Trust will invest at least 80% of its Managed Assets in floating rate credit instruments and other structured credit investments. There can be no assurance that the Trust will achieve its investment objective.

(NASDAQ: AADI) announces positive long-term efficacy and safety results from the Phase 2 AMPECT trial for nab-sirolimus in malignant PEComa patients, with a 40-month median duration of response and a >53-month median survival. The trial demonstrated a 38.7% overall response rate, including complete responses, and highlighted the potential of nab-sirolimus as an effective treatment for patients with mTOR-driven cancers. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The results from the AMPECT trial signify a noteworthy advancement in the treatment of malignant PEComa, a rare and aggressive form of cancer. The prolonged median duration of response (mDOR) of nearly 40 months and median overall survival (OS) exceeding 53 months represent a significant improvement over historical data, where median survival typically ranged between 16 and 29 months. This suggests that nab-sirolimus could be a substantial step forward in managing this condition.For clinicians and patients alike, the implications of these findings are substantial. The ability to achieve a durable response in a cancer type that has had limited treatment options can fundamentally alter the disease trajectory and improve quality of life. Moreover, the safety profile, characterized by the absence of grade 4 or 5 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), is reassuring for both patients and healthcare providers, indicating that the treatment is not only effective but also well-tolerated. Medical Research Analyst Analyzing the data from a research and development perspective, the AMPECT trial's results could potentially expedite further research into mTOR-driven cancers. The trial's design, a Phase 2, open-label, single-arm, multi-center study and its subsequent FDA approval of FYARRO® set a precedent for the development of targeted therapies in rare oncology indications. It's also worth noting that the disease control rate (DCR) remained stable at 71%, which underscores the consistency of nab-sirolimus's efficacy.From a research standpoint, the trial's outcome provides valuable insights into the long-term effects of targeted therapies on rare cancers. The additional patient who achieved a complete response (CR) could offer a case study for understanding the mechanisms behind exceptional responses to treatment. Such data are crucial for the ongoing efforts to personalize cancer treatment and improve patient outcomes. Financial Analyst For investors and stakeholders in Aadi Bioscience, Inc., the publication of these results in the prestigious Journal of Clinical Oncology is likely to be seen as a positive indicator of the company's research capabilities and the commercial potential of FYARRO®. The extended survival rates and robust efficacy data may lead to increased adoption of the drug, which in turn could have a favorable impact on the company's revenue and market share within the oncology sector.Furthermore, these results may attract partnership opportunities or interest from larger pharmaceutical companies looking to expand their portfolios in precision therapies for rare cancers. It's important to monitor how this data influences the company's stock performance, market valuation and strategic positioning in the competitive landscape of cancer therapeutics. 03/01/2024 - 04:08 PM After 3 years of follow-up in AMPECT trial, confirmed clinically meaningful overall response rate, including multiple patients with complete responses Demonstrated 40 months median duration of response and median survival >53 months Historically, median survival has ranged from 16 to 29 months in the setting of metastatic/unresectable malignant PEComa1,2 LOS ANGELES, March 1, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Aadi Bioscience, Inc. (NASDAQ: AADI), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing precision therapies for patients with mTOR-driven cancers, announced today that long-term efficacy and safety results from its completed Phase 2 registrational AMPECT study of nab-sirolimus in malignant PEComa were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO). The manuscript, ""A Phase 2 Trial of nab-Sirolimus in Patients with Advanced Malignant Perivascular Epithelioid Cell Tumors (AMPECT): Long-term Efficacy and Safety Update,"" authored by Andrew J. Wagner, MD, PhD and colleagues can be accessed online ahead of print here. ""We are excited to report the final outcomes of this registrational trial after an additional 3 years of follow-up. Responses to nab-sirolimus in patients with advanced PEComa lasted a median of 39.7 months,"" commented Dr. Wagner, Senior Physician at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. ""The median survival outcomes were consistent with the primary analysis, and the confirmed overall response rate remained at 38.7% and included an additional patient with a complete response. The long-term, durable responses to nab-sirolimus with tolerable safety are great news for patients with this rare disease."" ""The data published in JCO highlight the potential for nab-sirolimus to be an effective and highly differentiated treatment that may help patients suffering from this aggressive cancer achieve longer duration of responses and survival rates,"" said Loretta Itri, MD, Chief Medical Officer of Aadi. ""We want to thank the principal investigators, study coordinators, and the patients who participated in AMPECT. We believe these results provide a significant contribution to sarcoma research and we look forward to continuing to advance nab-sirolimus."" The AMPECT trial (NCT02494570) evaluated the efficacy and safety of nab-sirolimus in patients with advanced malignant PEComa and was the first prospective registrational study in this setting. Data from this Phase 2, open-label, single-arm, multi-center study served as the basis for the FDA approval of FYARRO® in advanced malignant PEComa regardless of mutational status. Key updates reported: Efficacy: At study completion, the confirmed ORR on the basis of independent radiographic review using RECIST v1.1 remained at 38.7% (95% CI, 21.8%-57.8%), with an additional converted confirmed complete response (CR) since the previously published analysis. The disease control rate (DCR) remained at 71% (95% CI, 52.0%–85.8%).Durability: At the time of the primary analysis, the median duration of response (mDOR) had not been reached. At study completion, the mDOR was reached at 39.7 months (95% CI, 6.5 months to NR), median PFS remained the same at 10.6 months (95% CI, 5.5-41.2 months), and median OS was 53.1 months (95% CI, 22.2 months to NR).Safety: The most common TRAEs were stomatitis (82.4%) and fatigue and rash (each 61.8%). No new or unexpected adverse events occurred, and no grade 4 or 5 TRAEs were reported.Bleeker JS, et al. Sarcoma. 2012;541626.Benson C, et al.

Announces Closing of $550 Million of Senior Secured Notes due 2031 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary StoneX Group Inc. closes $550 million offering of 7.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2031. Notes are fully guaranteed, secured on a second lien basis, and pay interest semiannually at 7.875% per annum. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The issuance of $550 million in Senior Secured Notes by StoneX Group Inc. represents a significant capital raising event that could have implications for the company's financial leverage and interest expense. With a 7.875% interest rate, these notes suggest a higher cost of debt compared to the current low-interest environment, possibly reflecting a risk premium associated with the company. Investors may interpret this as a signal regarding the company's creditworthiness and future cash flow commitments.Furthermore, the structure of the debt, being senior secured with a second lien, offers creditors a degree of protection, potentially making the notes more attractive despite the higher interest rate. However, it also indicates that the company has prioritized other debts with first liens, which could affect the recovery rate of these note holders in the event of financial distress. The use of the proceeds from this offering, whether for refinancing existing debt, funding acquisitions, or operational expansion, would be critical in assessing the impact on the company's financial position and growth prospects. Legal Expert The private offering of the Senior Secured Notes under Rule 144A and Regulation S indicates a targeted approach to sophisticated investors and those outside the United States, bypassing the general public. This method of offering is often used to expedite the capital-raising process and to avoid the more extensive disclosure requirements of a public offering.The contractual subordination of the notes to first lien obligations through an intercreditor agreement is a key legal structure that investors must understand. It delineates the hierarchy of claims on the company's assets, which could be crucial in a scenario where the company faces financial challenges. Moreover, the fact that the offering was not registered under the Securities Act implies that there are restrictions on the resale of these notes, which could affect their liquidity in the secondary market. Market Research Analyst StoneX Group Inc.'s decision to issue high-yield debt may be reflective of broader market conditions and investor appetite for risk. In a market where investors are seeking higher returns, a 7.875% yield could be attractive, especially when secured by company assets. This issuance could be indicative of trends within the financial services industry, where companies may be looking to lock in longer-term financing in anticipation of rising interest rates or economic uncertainty.Comparing the yield of these notes to industry benchmarks and prevailing economic conditions will provide a more comprehensive understanding of their market reception. Additionally, the performance of these notes post-issuance could serve as a barometer for the market's perception of the company's financial health and the financial sector's stability. 03/01/2024 - 04:15 PM NEW YORK, March 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- StoneX Group Inc. (the “Company”; NASDAQ: SNEX), today announced the closing of its previously-announced offering of $550 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2031 (the “Notes”).

The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior secured second lien basis by each of the Company’s existing and future subsidiaries that guarantees indebtedness under the Company’s senior secured revolving credit facility and certain other senior indebtedness. The guarantees are subject to release under specified circumstances. The Notes and the related guarantees are secured on a second priority basis by liens on substantially all of the Company’s and the guarantors’ property and assets, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens. The liens on the Company’s and the guarantors’ assets that secure the Notes and the related guarantees are contractually subordinated to the liens on the Company’s and the guarantors’ assets that secure the Company’s and the guarantors’ existing and future first lien obligations, including indebtedness under the Company’s senior secured revolving credit facility, as a result of an intercreditor agreement entered into by the collateral agent for the Notes and the agent for the Company’s senior secured revolving credit facility. The Notes pay interest semiannually, in arrears, at a rate of 7.875% per annum. This press release is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy the Notes, the related guarantees or any other security, nor shall there be any offer, solicitation or sale of any securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

The company operates a vast renewable power portfolio globally, with significant operating capacity and a substantial development pipeline.","Brookfield Renewable Completes Annual Filings Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Brookfield Renewable filed its 2023 annual reports, including audited financial statements, with the SEC and Canadian authorities. The company operates a vast renewable power portfolio globally, with significant operating capacity and a substantial development pipeline. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The filing of Brookfield Renewable's 2023 annual reports and audited financial statements is a significant disclosure that provides investors with essential information to assess the company's financial health and performance over the past year. The availability of these documents on multiple platforms, including EDGAR and SEDAR+, ensures transparency and accessibility for a broad investor base.From a financial perspective, the key figures to scrutinize would be revenue growth, profit margins and cash flow generation. Given the scale of Brookfield Renewable's operations, with an operating capacity of nearly 33,000 megawatts and a substantial development pipeline, the capital expenditure and operational efficiency ratios will also be critical in evaluating the company's ability to sustain and grow its dividends, which are of particular interest to income-focused investors.Furthermore, the company's investments in emerging areas such as carbon capture and storage, agricultural renewable natural gas and materials recycling may indicate a strategic direction aimed at diversifying and strengthening its portfolio in the face of evolving market demands and regulatory environments. The financial performance and potential of these investments could be a pivotal factor in the long-term valuation of the company. Market Research Analyst Brookfield Renewable's position as one of the world’s largest publicly traded platforms for renewable power highlights the growing investor interest in sustainable and renewable energy sources. With a development pipeline of approximately 155,400 megawatts, the company's future growth prospects are substantial. The market will be keen on understanding the timelines and potential returns from these projects, as they can significantly impact the stock's performance.Additionally, the company's dual-listing on both the NYSE and TSX and its availability through two different investment vehicles (BEP and BEPC), offer investors flexibility and choice in how they wish to participate in Brookfield Renewable's growth story. This dual structure can have implications for liquidity and market perception, possibly affecting the stock's volatility and investor sentiment.The renewable energy sector is subject to government policies and subsidies and any changes in these can have material effects on the company's operations and profitability. Hence, market analysts will also consider geopolitical and policy-driven risks when evaluating Brookfield Renewable's market outlook. Sustainability Expert Brookfield Renewable's diverse portfolio, encompassing hydroelectric, wind, solar and energy storage, positions the company as a leader in the transition to a more sustainable energy future. The integration of sustainable solutions, such as carbon capture and storage and renewable natural gas, reflects a proactive approach to addressing the broader challenges of climate change and positions the company at the forefront of the energy transition.Investors increasingly factor in environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria into their investment decisions and Brookfield Renewable's focus on sustainable solutions could enhance its ESG profile. The company's performance in these areas, detailed in the annual report, can influence investment from funds that prioritize sustainability in their portfolios.Long-term, the company's ability to navigate the complex regulatory environment surrounding renewable energy and to capitalize on technological advancements will be crucial. The annual report's insights into these aspects will be valuable for stakeholders interested in the sustainability and resilience of Brookfield Renewable's business model. 03/01/2024 - 04:05 PM BROOKFIELD, News, March 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEP, BEPC; TSX: BEP.UN, BEPC) announced today the filing of its 2023 annual reports, including audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, on Forms 20-F with the SEC on EDGAR as well as with Canadian securities regulatory authorities on SEDAR.

The Company aims to improve share price by August 26, 2024, considering options like a reverse stock split if needed.","Trio Petroleum Announces Notice of Noncompliance with NYSE American Listing Standards Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Trio Petroleum Corp (NYSE American: TPET) received a deficiency letter from NYSE American regarding non-compliance with listing standards due to low share price. The Company aims to improve share price by August 26, 2024, considering options like a reverse stock split if needed. Positive None. Negative The deficiency letter from NYSE American indicates that Trio Petroleum Corp is not in compliance with the continued listing standards due to the low price per share for a substantial period of time. The Company may need to resort to a reverse stock split if its common stock does not trade at a consistent level to regain compliance by August 26, 2024. Financial Analyst The notification received by Trio Petroleum Corp from the NYSE American regarding non-compliance with the listing standards, particularly related to the low trading price of its common stock, is indicative of underlying financial stress or market skepticism about the company's value and prospects. A prolonged low stock price can erode investor confidence and make it difficult for the company to raise capital through equity markets. The consideration of a reverse stock split is a tactical move often employed to bolster the stock price by reducing the number of shares outstanding, thereby increasing the price per share. However, this does not inherently change the company's market capitalization or address the fundamental issues causing the low stock price. Investors should monitor the company's operational performance in the McCool field closely, as its success or failure could significantly impact the stock's future trajectory and the company's ability to maintain its listing status. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Trio Petroleum Corp's strategy to initiate operations in the McCool field represents a potential pivot point for the company. The oil and gas sector is highly sensitive to changes in commodity prices, geopolitical events and shifts in supply and demand. The successful exploitation of a new field could materially improve the company's revenue streams and profitability. However, the market's response to such operational changes is often tempered by the execution risk and capital expenditure associated with bringing a new field online. Market participants will likely watch for production updates, cost management and any changes in the broader energy market that could influence the project's outcome. The company's ability to leverage the McCool field operations to positively affect its stock price will be critical to its efforts to regain compliance with the NYSE American's listing standards. Legal Expert Legally, the receipt of a deficiency notice from a stock exchange is a formal warning that can have significant implications for a publicly traded company. While it does not immediately impact Trio Petroleum Corp's business operations or SEC reporting obligations, it does trigger a compliance timeline that the company must adhere to. Failure to demonstrate sustained price improvement by the specified deadline could lead to delisting, which would severely limit the company's access to public capital markets and potentially lead to a loss of institutional investment. It is crucial for the company to communicate its strategy and progress transparently to shareholders and the market to maintain trust and credibility during this compliance period. Any proposed corporate actions, such as a reverse stock split, would require shareholder approval and must be carefully structured to comply with securities laws and regulations. 03/01/2024 - 04:05 PM Bakersfield, CA, March 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Trio Petroleum Corp (NYSE American: TPET) (“TPET”, “Trio” or the “Company”), a California-based oil and gas company, today announced that on February 26, 2024, it received a deficiency letter (the “Notice”) from the NYSE American LLC (the “NYSE American”) indicating that the Company is not in compliance with the continued listing standards as set forth in Section 1003(f)(v) of the NYSE American Company Guide (the “Company Guide”). Specifically, the Notice informed the Company that the NYSE American has determined that the shares of the Company's common stock have been selling for a low price per share for a substantial period of time, and pursuant to Section 1003(f)(v) of the Company Guide, the Company's continued listing is predicated on it demonstrating sustained price improvement by no later than August 26, 2024. The Company intends to begin the operations in the McCool field, which we expect to be in operation soon, and then monitor the price of its common stock and consider available options, including conducting a reverse stock split, if its common stock does not trade at a consistent level likely to result in the Company regaining compliance by August 26, 2024. The Company’s receipt of the Notice does not affect the Company’s business, operations or reporting requirements with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

TechPrecision Announces Receipt of Nasdaq Listing Determination; Expects Deficiency to Be Cured with Filing of Q3 Form 10-Q Today,2024-03-01T21:05:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"TechPrecision Corporation (NASDAQ:TPCS) received a notice from Nasdaq for non-compliance with filing its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

The company has 60 days to submit a plan for compliance, with a possible extension up to 180 days. Positive None. Negative TechPrecision Corporation received a notice of non-compliance from Nasdaq for not timely filing its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, potentially impacting the company's stock performance and investor confidence. Financial Analyst Regarding the situation with TechPrecision Corporation's delayed filing of the Q3 Form 10-Q, it is crucial to consider the implications of such a delay on investor confidence and the company's stock performance. Delays in financial reporting can often signal underlying operational or financial issues, which may lead to increased volatility in the stock price. Investors typically seek transparency and timeliness in financial disclosures, which are vital for making informed decisions.While the company has now filed the required report and expects Nasdaq to accept this as a cure for the deficiency, the market's reaction to this event will depend on the content of the delayed filing. If the report reveals any adverse financial developments or discrepancies, it could result in further negative pressure on the stock. Conversely, if the filing meets or exceeds market expectations, it could mitigate the initial negative impact of the delay. Legal Expert Under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), companies are required to timely file all required financial reports with the SEC to maintain listing standards. Failure to do so can result in a deficiency notice and potential delisting if not remedied. The 60-day period to submit a plan to regain compliance is a critical window for TechPrecision to demonstrate its commitment to adhering to market regulations and maintaining its listing status.Should the company fail to regain compliance within the granted extension period, it could face delisting from the Nasdaq exchange. This would have significant implications for the company's ability to attract institutional investors and maintain liquidity in its stocks. A delisting can also trigger negative perceptions among stakeholders regarding the company's governance and financial health. Market Research Analyst The impact of a delayed financial filing on TechPrecision's market position should be analyzed in the broader context of industry performance and investor expectations. In sectors where precision and reliability are paramount, such as the manufacturing services provided by TechPrecision, any signs of administrative or financial mismanagement could be particularly damaging to a company's reputation and competitive standing.Analyzing peer performance and market trends will be essential to understand the potential long-term effects on TechPrecision's business relationships and market share. The company's ability to quickly rectify the filing issue and communicate effectively with stakeholders will be key factors in mitigating any lasting impact on its market position. 03/01/2024 - 04:05 PM WESTMINSTER, MA / ACCESSWIRE / March 1, 2024 / TechPrecision Corporation (NASDAQ:TPCS) (""TechPrecision"" or ""we,"" ""us"" or ""our"") today announced that on February 26, 2024, TechPrecision Corporation (the ""Company"") received a notice (the ""Notice"") from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq"") stating that the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) because it had not timely filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023 (the ""Q3 Form 10-Q"") with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on or before February 20, 2024, the extended period provided for the filing under Rule 12b-25(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Magic Empire Global Limited Announces Receipt of Nasdaq Notification Regarding Minimum Bid Price Deficiency,2024-03-01T21:05:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Magic Empire Global Limited (NASDAQ: MEGL) received a letter from Nasdaq regarding non-compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, providing a compliance period until August 26, 2024, to meet the listing standards or face delisting.","Magic Empire Global Limited Announces Receipt of Nasdaq Notification Regarding Minimum Bid Price Deficiency Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Magic Empire Global Limited (NASDAQ: MEGL) received a letter from Nasdaq regarding non-compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, providing a compliance period until August 26, 2024, to meet the listing standards or face delisting. Positive MEGL received a notification from Nasdaq regarding non-compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. The Company has an 180-day compliance period, until August 26, 2024, to meet Nasdaq's listing standards. MEGL may be eligible for an additional 180-day compliance period if certain conditions are met. The Company is evaluating options to regain compliance and intends to meet Nasdaq's listing requirements. There is no assurance that MEGL will be able to regain compliance with Nasdaq's listing requirements. Negative MEGL's non-compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement may lead to delisting if not resolved. The Company's ability to cure the deficiency remains uncertain despite efforts to comply with Nasdaq's listing standards. Market Research Analyst The notification received by Magic Empire Global Limited regarding the non-compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement is a significant indicator of potential financial instability. The bid price is a critical metric since it reflects investor confidence and the perceived value of a company. A drop below the $1 threshold can often trigger a sell-off as institutional investors and mutual funds may have mandates preventing them from holding stocks that fall below this mark.For stakeholders, the short-term implications include the risk of increased volatility in MEGL's stock price. Investors may react negatively to the news, potentially leading to a further decline in the stock price. In the long term, if the company fails to regain compliance, the risk of delisting could erode the company's marketability and access to capital markets, making it more challenging to raise funds and invest in growth opportunities.The company's consideration of a reverse stock split to cure the deficiency is a common strategy that reduces the number of shares outstanding to increase the bid price. However, this can sometimes be viewed negatively by the market as it may indicate that the company is struggling to organically increase its share value. Financial Analyst Investors should closely monitor MEGL's financials and management's strategy to address the Nasdaq compliance issue. The company's ability to regain compliance will likely depend on its operational performance and market conditions. Financial analysts will evaluate MEGL's revenue growth, profitability, cash flow and other financial health indicators to forecast its potential to meet the Nasdaq's requirements within the given timeframe.It is essential to assess the company's operational efficiency and cost management, as these factors will play a crucial role in its recovery. Furthermore, the market will be looking for transparency and a clear plan of action from the company's management. Any signs of strategic direction or business model adjustments that could stimulate stock demand and price recovery would be considered positive indicators.However, the uncertainty surrounding the company's ability to meet Nasdaq's continued listing requirements may create a cautious sentiment among investors, potentially affecting the stock's liquidity and the company's valuation. Legal Expert From a legal perspective, Magic Empire Global Limited's disclosure about its non-compliance with Nasdaq's listing rules is a mandatory regulatory compliance issue. The company must adhere to strict communication and remediation guidelines to maintain its listing status. Failure to comply within the stipulated period can lead to delisting, which would trigger legal and financial repercussions.Delisting from a major exchange like Nasdaq can significantly impact a company's reputation and its relationships with shareholders, creditors and potential investors. It is crucial for the company to explore all legal avenues to regain compliance, which may include financial restructuring or other corporate actions subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.Additionally, the legal team must ensure that all investor communications regarding this matter are transparent and comply with securities law to prevent any allegations of market manipulation or misinformation, which could lead to further legal challenges and impact investor trust. 03/01/2024 - 04:05 PM Hong Kong, March 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Magic Empire Global Limited (NASDAQ: MEGL) (“MEGL”, or the “Company”) announced that, on February 28, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that based on the closing bid price of the Company for the period from January 16, 2024 to February 27, 2024, the Company no longer meets the continued listing requirement of Nasdaq under Nasdaq Listing Rules 5550(a)(2), to maintain a minimum bid price of $1 per share. The notification has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s ordinary shares. Nasdaq has provided the Company with an 180 calendar days compliance period, or until August 26, 2024, in which to regain compliance with Nasdaq continued listing requirement. In the event that the Company does not regain compliance in the compliance period, the Company may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar days, should the Company meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and is able to provide written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period, by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. However, if it appears that the Company will not be able to cure the deficiency, or if the Company is otherwise not eligible, Nasdaq will provide notice that the Company’s securities will be subject to delisting. The Company is currently evaluating options to regain compliance and intends to timely regain compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing requirement. Although the Company will use all reasonable efforts to achieve compliance with Rule 5550(a)(2), there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain compliance with that rule or will otherwise be in compliance with other Nasdaq continued listing requirement.

Cipher Mining Announces February 2024 Operational Update,2024-03-01T21:05:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Cipher Mining Inc. released its production and operations update for February 2024, highlighting key metrics such as BTC mined, power sales, BTC sold, and more. The company produced 334 BTC amidst a network hash rate increase of 9.4%, sold 33 BTC, and ended the month with a balance of 1,433 BTC. Cipher will host its Q4 and FY 2023 results call on March 5th, providing insights into financials, operations, and growth plans.","Cipher Mining Announces February 2024 Operational Update Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Cipher Mining Inc. released its production and operations update for February 2024, highlighting key metrics such as BTC mined, power sales, BTC sold, and more. The company produced 334 BTC amidst a network hash rate increase of 9.4%, sold 33 BTC, and ended the month with a balance of 1,433 BTC. Cipher will host its Q4 and FY 2023 results call on March 5th, providing insights into financials, operations, and growth plans. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent update from Cipher Mining Inc. regarding its February 2024 production figures is a pivotal piece of information for investors and market analysts. The company's disclosure of mining approximately 334 Bitcoins (BTC) is a direct measure of its operational efficiency and growth trajectory. Additionally, the sale of 33 BTC could be interpreted as a strategic move for liquidity purposes or risk management, which is a common practice among mining companies. However, the retention of a significant amount of BTC (1,433) indicates a bullish stance on the future valuation of the cryptocurrency.Furthermore, the increase in the network hash rate by approximately 9.4% is an important factor to consider. This increase in competition can potentially put pressure on mining margins if Cipher's cost of production doesn't scale efficiently with the rising hash rate. The deployment of 70,000 mining rigs and an operating hash rate of 7.4 EH/s (exahash per second) reflects the company's commitment to maintaining a competitive edge in the industry. The hash rate is a crucial metric, as it signifies the computational power used to mine and process Bitcoin transactions. Market Research Analyst Analyzing Cipher Mining's operations update reveals insights into the broader cryptocurrency mining sector. The company's expansion in operational hash rate and the deployment of new mining rigs signal confidence in the sustainability and profitability of the crypto mining industry despite potential challenges such as fluctuating Bitcoin prices, regulatory scrutiny and energy consumption concerns. Investors should monitor the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of Cipher's mining operations, particularly in the context of the increasing network hash rate, which can affect the rewards ratio per hash power contributed.Additionally, the timing of the BTC sales and the company's treasury management strategies are crucial in evaluating Cipher's financial health and its ability to navigate the volatile cryptocurrency market. Market participants will be keen on the upcoming financial results call to assess the company's performance and strategic plans, which could influence investor sentiment and stock valuation. Cryptocurrency Expert The operational update from Cipher Mining sheds light on the strategic aspects of running a cryptocurrency mining operation. Holding a substantial balance of mined BTC suggests a strategic reserve that could be leveraged for future financing, investment, or to hedge against market volatility. The decision to sell a portion of the mined BTC each month is a tactical approach to cover operational expenses and possibly take advantage of market timing.The mention of 'Disruptors being prepared for deployment' likely refers to the company's innovation in mining technology or operational processes, aiming to improve efficiency or reduce costs. Such advancements could significantly impact Cipher's competitive position in the market. Understanding these technological developments and their potential to disrupt the market is crucial for stakeholders looking to gauge the company's long-term viability and innovation trajectory. 03/01/2024 - 04:05 PM NEW YORK, March 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cipher Mining Inc.

(OGEN) completes a public offering, raising $2.1 million for the development of ONP-002, a neurosteroid drug for mild traumatic brain injuries. ThinkEquity and Laidlaw & Company act as book-running managers. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The completion of Oragenics, Inc.'s underwritten public offering, raising $2.1 million through the sale of 1,400,000 shares, is a strategic move aimed at bolstering the company's financial position. The offering price of $1.50 per share reflects the company's current market valuation and investor appetite for such offerings. The decision to provide underwriters with a 45-day option to purchase additional shares to cover over-allotments could potentially mitigate the risk of stock price volatility post-offering.Investors should note that the net proceeds are earmarked for the development of ONP-002, a neurosteroid drug compound for treating concussions, which indicates a focused allocation of capital towards a key project in the company's pipeline. This targeted use of funds may accelerate the development timeline and potentially bring the product closer to market, which could have positive implications for the company's revenue prospects in the long-term.However, the relatively modest size of the offering suggests that the company may require additional capital in the future, which could lead to further dilution for existing shareholders. Stakeholders should monitor the company's burn rate and subsequent funding rounds to assess the sustainability of its financial strategy. Medical Research Analyst Oragenics' focus on the development of ONP-002 for the treatment of mild traumatic brain injuries positions the company within a niche yet significant segment of the pharmaceutical market. Concussions are a common injury with a substantial unmet medical need for effective treatments, which could create a lucrative opportunity for Oragenics if ONP-002 proves to be effective and safe in clinical trials.The drug's characterization as a unique neurosteroid compound suggests it may have a novel mechanism of action, which could differentiate it from existing treatments and provide competitive advantages. However, the success of this compound is contingent upon rigorous clinical testing and eventual approval from regulatory bodies such as the FDA. The capital raised will be crucial for advancing ONP-002 through these necessary stages.Given the complexities and risks associated with drug development, particularly in the field of neurology, investors should consider the long development horizons and the high attrition rates in clinical trials. The company's progress in the development of ONP-002 will be a critical factor in evaluating its future prospects. 03/01/2024 - 04:04 PM SARASOTA, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Oragenics, Inc. (NYSE American: OGEN) (“Oragenics” or the “Company”), a company focused on developing unique, intranasal nanoparticle pharmaceuticals for the treatment of neurological disorders, today announced the closing of its previously announced underwritten public offering of 1,400,000 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $1.50 per share, for gross proceeds of $2.1 million, before deducting underwriting discounts, and offering expenses payable by the Company. In addition, the Company has granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 210,000 shares of its common stock at the public offering price, less discounts, to cover over-allotments, if any. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to fund the continued development of ONP-002, which is a unique neurosteroid drug compound intended to treat mild traumatic brain injuries also known as concussions, and for general corporate purposes and working capital.

The distribution includes a short-term capital gain of $0.04874 and is part of the Trust's objective to provide current income and total return through investments in income-producing securities. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Thornburg Income Builder Opportunities Trust regarding its monthly distribution of $0.10417 per share is a routine disclosure that typically garners attention from current and prospective investors seeking income-generating investments. The distribution's composition, including net investment income and net realized short-term capital gains, provides insight into the Trust's income sources and investment strategy effectiveness. The absence of a return of capital in this distribution is notable, as it suggests that the payouts are not eroding the principal value of the investments, which can be a concern for income-focused shareholders.From a financial analysis standpoint, the distribution rate relative to the net asset value or market price is a key metric for assessing the Trust's yield. A stable distribution, as indicated by 'No Change' from the previous declaration, can be perceived as a sign of stability or a well-managed distribution policy. However, investors should consider the total return, which includes both the income received and the capital appreciation of the shares, to evaluate the overall performance of the Trust. Tax Advisor The specific tax characteristics of the Trust's distributions, as will be reported on Form 1099 after the year-end, are crucial for shareholders' tax planning. The inclusion of short-term capital gains, which are taxed at ordinary income rates, as opposed to long-term capital gains, which typically benefit from lower tax rates, affects the after-tax return for investors. This distinction is particularly relevant for those in higher tax brackets. Furthermore, the potential for future distributions to include a return of capital underscores the importance of understanding the tax implications, as these are not taxable events in the year they occur but do adjust the shareholder's cost basis, potentially impacting capital gains upon sale of the shares. Market Research Analyst The Trust's investment strategy, which includes a broad range of income-producing securities from both U.S. and global markets, reflects a diversified approach aimed at generating current income and additional total return. The allocation to emerging market companies, capped at 20% of managed assets, introduces an element of geographical diversification that can potentially enhance returns but also brings additional risk factors such as currency fluctuation and geopolitical concerns. The Trust's adherence to its objective of investing at least 80% of its managed assets in income-producing securities is a key factor for investors seeking consistent income distributions.Investors also need to be aware of the excise tax implications for the Trust, as it may influence the timing and amount of distributions. The requirement to distribute at least 98% of its ordinary income and 98.2% of its capital gains to avoid the tax can lead to year-end distributions that investors need to anticipate in their investment planning. 03/01/2024 - 04:01 PM SANTA FE, N.M., March 1, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Thornburg Income Builder Opportunities Trust (the ""Trust"") (NASDAQ: TBLD) today announced a monthly distribution of $0.10417 per share on the Trust's common shares, payable on March 20, 2024 to common shareholders of record as of March 11, 2024. The Trust's monthly distribution is shown below: Amount Payable Date Ex-Dividend Date Record Date Change from Previous Declaration $0.10417 March 20, 2024 March 8, 2024 March 11, 2024 No Change Distribution rates are not performance and are calculated by summing the Trust's monthly distribution per share over four quarters and dividing by the net asset value or market price per share, as applicable, as of the distribution announcement date. Distributions on common shares are generally paid from net investment income (regular interest and dividends) and may also include capital gains and/or a return of capital. The Trust's distribution payable on March 20, 2024, does not include a long-term capital gain or a return of capital, but does include a short-term capital gain of $0.04874. The specific tax characteristics of the distributions will be reported to the Trust's common shareholders on Form 1099 after the end of the 2024 calendar year. The final determination for all distributions paid in 2024 will be made in early 2025 and reported to you on Form 1099-DIV. You should not use this notice as a substitute for your 1099-DIV. The Trust's fiscal year (10/01/2023 through 09/30/2024) cumulative distributions are shown below: Current Distribution Cumulative Distributions FYTD Net InvestmentIncome $0.05543 (53 %) $0.21639 (35 %) Net RealizedShort-term Capital Gain $0.04874 (47 %) $0.12546 (20 %) Net Realized Long-term Capital Gain $0.00000 (0 %) $0.08712 (14 %) Return of Capital or Other Capital Sources $0.00000 (0 %) $0.19605 (31 %) Total per share $0.10417 (100 %) $0.62502 (100 %) Shareholders should not assume that the source of a distribution from the Trust is net income or profit. A distribution comprised in whole or in part by a return of capital does not necessarily reflect the Trust's investment performance and should not be confused with ""yield"" or ""income."" Future distributions may consist of a return of capital. For further information regarding the Trust's distributions, please visit www.thornburg.com/tbld-distributions. The Trust's investment objective is to provide current income and additional total return. The Trust seeks to achieve its objective by investing, directly or indirectly, at least 80% of its managed assets in a broad range of income-producing securities. The Trust invests in both equity and debt securities of companies located in the United States and around the globe. The Trust may invest in non-U.S. domiciled companies, including up to 20% of its managed assets at the time of investment in equity and debt securities of emerging market companies. As a registered investment company, the Trust is subject to a 4% excise tax that is imposed if the Trust does not distribute to common shareholders by the end of any calendar year at least the sum of (i) 98% of its ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gain or loss) for the calendar year and (ii) 98.2% of its capital gain in excess of its capital loss (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for a one-year period generally ending on October 31 of the calendar year (unless an election is made to use the Trust's fiscal year). In certain circumstances, the Trust may elect to retain income or capital gain to the extent that the Board of Trustees, in consultation with Trust management, determines it to be in the interest of shareholders to do so. The common share distributions paid by the Trust for any particular period may be more than the amount of net investment income from that period. As a result, all or a portion of a distribution may be a return of capital, which is in effect a partial return of the amount a common shareholder invested in the Trust, up to the amount of the common shareholder's tax basis in their common shares, which would reduce such tax basis. Although a return of capital may not be taxable, it will generally increase the common shareholder's potential gain, or reduce the common shareholder's potential loss, on any subsequent sale or other disposition of common shares.

Absci Announces Closing of Public Offering of Common Stock Including Full Exercise of the Underwriters’ Option to Purchase Additional Shares,2024-03-01T21:01:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Absci Corporation (ABSI) successfully closes underwritten public offering, raising approximately $86.4 million for drug development and platform investment.","Absci Announces Closing of Public Offering of Common Stock Including Full Exercise of the Underwriters’ Option to Purchase Additional Shares Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Absci Corporation (ABSI) successfully closes underwritten public offering, raising approximately $86.4 million for drug development and platform investment. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent public offering by Absci Corporation represents a significant capital infusion, amounting to approximately $86.4 million before expenses. This move is indicative of the company's aggressive strategy to scale up its Integrated Drug Creation™ platform and advance its internal asset programs. The full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares suggests a strong market interest, which could be seen as a positive signal for the company's valuation.From a financial perspective, the offering price of $4.50 per share provides a benchmark for current investor appetite and valuation metrics within the biotech sector. It is essential to analyze Absci's historical stock performance, the pricing relative to its peers and the potential dilutive effect on existing shareholders. The capital raise should be juxtaposed with the company's burn rate and runway extension, which are critical factors for investors assessing the sustainability of Absci's operations. Market Research Analyst With the biotechnology sector being highly competitive and capital-intensive, Absci's move to secure additional funding through a public offering is a strategic effort to maintain its competitive edge. The focus on enhancing AI and wet-lab technologies is a clear indication of the company's commitment to innovation and staying at the forefront of the generative AI drug discovery niche. This niche is rapidly evolving and the ability to generate a robust pipeline can significantly impact Absci's market positioning and future partnerships.Investors should monitor the deployment of the raised funds into Absci's platform and asset development. Effective allocation could lead to accelerated drug discovery processes, potentially reducing time-to-market for new drugs and leading to strategic collaborations or licensing deals, which are common value inflection points in the biotech industry. Biotechnology Legal Expert Compliance with SEC regulations is paramount for public offerings and Absci's adherence to the process, including the use of a shelf registration statement, is a testament to its regulatory diligence. The shelf registration allows for a more expedited process of selling shares when market conditions are favorable, providing the company with flexibility in capital raising efforts.However, potential investors should be aware of the legal disclaimers, specifically the statement that this press release does not constitute an offer to sell securities. This is a standard legal precaution to prevent unlawful distribution of securities. Understanding the legal framework and implications of such offerings is crucial for stakeholders to appreciate the complexity and risks associated with investing in the biotech sector. 03/01/2024 - 04:01 PM VANCOUVER, Wash., March 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Absci Corporation (Nasdaq: ABSI) (“Absci”), a data-first generative AI drug creation company, today announced the closing of its underwritten public offering of 19,205,000 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $4.50 per share, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions.
