Financial Analyst The proposed acquisition of Base Resources by Energy Fuels, valued at around A$375 million, is positioned to create a company with significant operational synergies. The transaction is expected to enhance shareholder value through the integration of Toliara's heavy mineral sands project into Energy Fuels' portfolio. Considering the robust demand for rare earth elements (REEs) driven by their application in electric vehicles (EVs) and other advanced technologies, the additional supply from Toliara's monazite production could strategically position Energy Fuels in the market. The acquisition price needs to be weighed against the fundamental value of Toliara and the potential revenue streams it may generate.For investors, the key financial takeaway will be the accretive nature of the deal to Energy Fuels' net asset value per share, driven by anticipated low production costs that could lead to competitive pricing. However, attention must be paid to the risks inherent in integrating new projects and the volatility of REE prices. The strong backing from significant shareholders and directors, with intentions to vote in favor of the scheme, indicates confidence in the strategic fit and expected economic benefits of the transaction. Market Research Analyst The heavy mineral sands market, where the Toliara project operates, is a niche but critical segment of the mining industry. It provides key materials like ilmenite, rutile, zircon and monazite. These materials are important for various industries, including defense and clean energy. The demand for 'magnet' REEs like neodymium and praseodymium (NdPr), contained in monazite, is particularly strong due to their use in high-efficiency electric motors found in EVs.Strategically, Energy Fuels is poised to become a more dominant player in the U.S. and global REE market by capitalizing on the increasing need for non-Chinese REE sources. This is underscored by their ongoing discussions with U.S. government agencies, potentially leading to financial support for domestic critical mineral projects, hinting at a favorable policy environment. The acquisition could offer competitive advantages in terms of scale and cost, which is valuable information for stakeholders assessing the industry's growth trajectory and Energy Fuels' positioning within it. Mining Operations Expert The acquisition of Base Resources by Energy Fuels is not just a transaction of assets but also the transfer of expertise in the heavy mineral sands sector. Toliara's project development and operational experience in Africa will be a valuable addition to Energy Fuels' existing operations. This is significant when considering the complex nature of mining operations and the importance of proven track records in successfully bringing projects to profitable production.Base Resources' successful management of heavy mineral sands operations suggests a level of operational efficiency and governance that Energy Fuels can leverage. For prospective and current investors, this operational expertise is just as important as the assets themselves, as it can affect the timeline to production and the ability to navigate regulatory environments in different jurisdictions. The practical implications for the combined entity include potentially smoother project rollouts and an increased likelihood of meeting production and financial targets. 04/21/2024 - 07:13 PM The acquisition will include Base Resources' 100%-owned advanced, world-class Toliara heavy mineral sands project in Madagascar (""Toliara"" or the ""Project""), which includes a long-life, high-value and low cost monazite stream, produced as a byproduct of primary titanium and zirconium production.Toliara monazite production to be processed at Energy Fuels' 100%-owned White Mesa Mill (the ""Mill"") into separated rare earth element (""REE"") oxides, at low capital and operating cost, setting a new paradigm for low-cost, globally competitive U.S.-centered rare earth oxide production.The transaction will also secure Base Resources' mine development and operations team, who have a successful track-record of designing, constructing, and profitably operating a world-class heavy mineral sands operation in Africa.Energy Fuels is currently engaged in high-level discussions with various U.S. government agencies and other offices who provide support for critical mineral projects, domestically and abroad. The transaction is complementary to and further strengthens Energy Fuels' U.S.-leading uranium production capability and plans.Senator Mike Lee, the Senior Senator from Utah and a member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, stated: ""I'm grateful to Energy Fuels for their work to ensure the United States has a domestic critical mineral source. The acquisition of Base Resources and the Toliara project will only further their capacity and ability to produce minerals needed for defense, technology, and everyday life.""Conference call on Monday, April 22, 2024 at 8:00 am ET.LAKEWOOD, Colo., April 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Energy Fuels Inc. (NYSE American: UUUU) (TSX: EFR) (""Energy Fuels"" or the ""Company""), a leading U.S. producer of uranium, REEs, and vanadium, is pleased to announce that it has executed a definitive Scheme Implementation Deed (the ""SID"") with Base Resources Limited (ASX: BSE) (AIM: BSE) (""Base Resources"") pursuant to which Energy Fuels has agreed to acquire 100% of the issued shares of Base Resources (the ""Transaction"") in consideration for (i) 0.0260 Energy Fuels common shares (the ""Share Consideration"") and (ii) A$0.065 in cash, payable by way of a special dividend by Base Resources to its shareholders (the ""Cash Consideration"", and together with the Share Consideration, the ""Scheme Consideration"") for each Base Resources ordinary share held, for a total equity value of approximately A$375 million1. The Transaction will be effected by way of a scheme of arrangement under Australia's Corporations Act (the ""Scheme""). Unless otherwise indicated in this news release, all references to dollars or $ are references to United States dollars. KEY TRANSACTION HIGHLIGHTS The Transaction will unlock significant value for both Energy Fuels and Base Resources shareholders due to valuable and clearly identifiable synergies.Base Resources' Toliara project in Madagascar is a world-class, advanced-stage, low-cost, and large-scale heavy mineral sands project. In addition to its stand-alone, ilmenite, rutile (titanium) and zircon (zirconium) (collectively, ""Ilmenite and Zircon"") production capability, the Project also contains large quantities of Monazite which is a rich source of the 'magnet' REEs used in electric vehicles (""EVs"") and a variety of clean energy and advanced technologies.Subject to receipt of further required Government of Madagascar approvals, the Monazite can be recovered as a byproduct of Ilmenite and Zircon production at low incremental cost, thereby adding to Toliara's world-class Ilmenite and Zircon capability at a cost of production that the Company expects to be globally competitive and will position Energy Fuels to be a first-tier REE oxide producer.Once in production, the Monazite from Toliara will provide a large portion of the raw materials needed for Energy Fuels' rapidly expanding and world-competitive REE oxide production facility at the Mill. Since 2021, Energy Fuels has proven its technical capabilities, speed-to-market, and competitiveness in a manner that is not being accomplished by any other facility in North America, first by processing Monazite to produce a mixed REE carbonate at the Mill, which it has been selling into the commercial REE market since 2021, and now by the commissioning of its Phase 1 NdPr separation facility at the Mill. Energy Fuels is currently engaged in high-level discussions with numerous U.S. government agencies and other offices who provide financial support for critical mineral projects within the U.S. and internationally, which may include grants, low-interest debt, non- or limited-recourse debt, loan guarantees, and other support vehicles.Energy Fuels is also releasing an AACE International (""AACE"") Class 4 Pre-Feasibility Study (not a Pre-Feasibility Study subject to or intended to be compliant with National Instrument 43-101 (""NI 43-101"") or Subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K (""S-K 1300"")) dated April 22, 2024, prepared by Roger Mason, Engineering Manager, WSP USA Environment & Infrastructure Inc., indicating globally competitive capital and operating costs for its planned Phase 2 expanded REE oxide production at the Mill (the ""Mill PFS""), which will be filed on the Electronic Document Gathering and Retrieval System (""EDGAR"") at www.sec.gov/edgar, and will be available on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval Plus (""SEDAR+"") at www.sedarplus.ca, and on the Company's website at www.energyfuels.com.With the Mill's unique, globally competitive, U.S.-based REE production capability, Energy Fuels is uniquely positioned to unlock significant value from Toliara's low-cost Monazite production, in a manner that the Company believes no other facility in the U.S. is capable of at this time.Monazite from Toliara will also provide material quantities of low-cost uranium production at the Mill over the life of the Project, which will supplement Energy Fuels' U.S.-leading uranium production capacity.This addition of a low-cost source of REE raw materials to Energy Fuels' globally competitive U.S. REE production infrastructure, along with a sustainable low-cost source of uranium production, is expected to be highly accretive to Energy Fuels' shareholders on a net asset value per share basis, with potential to unlock significant further upside.As part of this Transaction, Energy Fuels will also access Base Resources' proven leadership and heavy mineral sands operations team, which has an exceptional record of responsible asset development, construction, commissioning and profitable production in Africa. The Base Resources team will not only continue to oversee the development and operation of Toliara but will also enhance Energy Fuels' heavy mineral sands teams in Australia and Brazil, thus allowing the Company to maximize the value of all projects to the Company's shareholders.The offer is unanimously recommended by Base Resources' Board of Directors and Base Resources has also received voting intention statements from each of Base Resources' two major shareholders, confirming that they each intend to vote in favor of the Scheme2. Those two shareholders respectively hold 26.5% and 24.8% of Base Resources' shares. In addition, each of Base Resources' directors, holding (in aggregate) an additional 1.2% of Base Resources' shares, has confirmed their intention to vote in favor of the Scheme2.Energy Fuels will host an investor webcast and conference call on April 22, 2024 at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time (10:00 p.m. Australian Eastern Standard Time).Mark S. Chalmers, President and CEO of Energy Fuels stated: ""The acquisition of Base Resources and the Toliara project represents a monumental leap forward for the Company, as we continue to execute on a truly revolutionary REE, uranium and critical mineral combined strategy. For the past four-plus years, Energy Fuels has innovated a new way to produce critical minerals, that we believe is more cost competitive than traditional approaches, by leveraging our uranium processing expertise and infrastructure to develop a secure, U.S.-centric REE oxide supply chain. ""At the same time, we plan to maintain our leadership and profitability in our core U.S.-based uranium business without diminishing our uranium capabilities or uranium growth potential in any way. In fact, Toliara will provide a steady, low-cost source of uranium for the Company over the life of the Project. ""To date, we have secured long-term sources of REE concentrate through offtake (Chemours), and direct ownership (the Company's 100% owned Bahia Project in Brazil once developed, and potentially 100% ownership of Base Resources' Toliara project, and further potential offtakes through a joint venture being negotiated with Astron Corporation Limited (the Astron Donald Project in Australia)). Toliara is expected to be the cornerstone source of feedstock supply to the Mill, with the scale to provide an average of 21,800 tonnes of rare earth-bearing Monazite per year at a cost that we believe will be at or below other leading global REE producers, including those in China. ""Energy Fuels has proven its REE processing capabilities at our Mill in Utah, as we have commercially produced a high-purity mixed REE carbonate since 2021. We recently completed construction of and are currently commissioning the Phase 1 REE separation circuit at the Mill, designed to produce up to 1,000 tonnes of NdPr oxide per year, which would be sufficient to supply enough 'magnet' REE oxides to produce 500,000 to 1 million EVs per year. We have also released the Mill PFS announcing what we believe to be globally competitive capital and REE production costs. Based on these highly compelling economics and the expected consummation of the Base Resources and Astron transactions, Energy Fuels is also planning to update the Phase 2 REE separation infrastructure for the Mill to expand our production capacity to 4,000 to 6,000 tonnes of NdPr oxide per year, along with 150 - 225 tonnes of Dy oxide and 50 - 75 tonnes of Tb oxide per year, which would supply enough 'magnet' REE oxides to power 3 to 6 million EVs per year. This would put Energy Fuels in the REE oxide production capacity category of the other major 'western' REE suppliers. ""We plan to supply REE oxides to U.S., European and Asian EV, wind energy and other clean energy manufacturers, along with emerging commercial REE metal-making, alloying, and magnet-making facilities now under development in the U.S. We also plan to be a reliable supplier to the U.S. defense industry, which could include offtake for other REE oxides, besides the 'magnet' oxides, contained in Monazite. This acquisition, along with the Mill's current and planned REE separation capability, will go a long way in establishing a 'western' REE supply chain. Energy Fuels is also in high-level discussions with numerous U.S. government agencies and offices that support critical mineral projects, and we look forward to advancing these discussions as we continue to build our REE business. ""The transaction will not only secure a world-class project for Energy Fuels at a highly attractive acquisition price compared to the fundamental value of the Project but will also secure a mine development and operations team with a successful track-record of designing, constructing, and profitably operating a world-class heavy mineral sands operation in Africa."" Tim Carstens, Managing Director of Base Resources, commented: ""This transaction reflects the exceptional quality of the Toliara project and the efforts of the Base Resources team over several years to advance the project towards construction readiness. The combined company will have the financial and technical capability to not only build Toliara into one of the best critical mineral projects in the world, but also to develop an integrated value chain for the rare earth elements that are essential to the global energy transition. Shareholders of Base Resources will receive both a compelling and immediate premium, and the opportunity to further participate in the market recognition and development of a company with a unique diversified position in the critical minerals landscape."" ABOUT TOLIARAThe Toliara project is a world-class, advanced-stage, large-scale critical mineral deposit underpinned by the Ilmenite, Zircon and Monazite-rich Ranobe deposit in southwest Madagascar. On September 27, 2021, Base Resources released the outcomes of its updated and enhanced Definitive Feasibility Study (""DFS2"")3 for the Toliara project, which calculated an after-tax NPV10 (10% discount rate) of $1 billion, after-tax IRR of 23.8%, undiscounted life-of-mine free cash flows of $5.9 billion, and initial capital expenditures of $520 million to achieve first production. According to DFS2, the Ranobe deposit's estimated Ore Reserves of 904 million tonnes at 6.1% heavy mineral, are sufficient to support an initial 38-year mine life4. These results are based on the production of Ilmenite and Zircon alone. The Ranobe deposit also contains large quantities of Monazite, which is a rich source of the 'magnet' REEs; neodymium and praseodymium (""NdPr""), Dysprosium (""Dy"") and Terbium (""Tb""), used in EVs and a variety of clean energy and advanced technologies, that can be recovered as a byproduct of Ilmenite and Zircon production at the Project. In response to rising demand for REEs, on December 14, 2023, Base Resources released a Pre-Feasibility Study for Toliara5 on the production of Monazite through the concentration of the existing waste stream from the DFS2 mineral sands processing facilities (the ""Monazite PFS""). Based on the combined outcomes of DFS2 and the Monazite PFS, Toliara has an overall after-tax NPV10 (10% discount rate) of $2.0 billion, after-tax IRR of 32.4%, undiscounted life of mine free cash flows of $10.7 billion, and initial capital expenditures of $591 million, which included additional incremental capital expenditures of $71 million for Monazite production, over the 38-year mine life. As the Monazite is an add-on to the stand-alone Ilmenite and Zircon production and would be produced through concentration of the waste stream from processing of the mined Ore Reserves, the Mineral Resources and Reserves at the Project did not change. The Monazite PFS thus demonstrated that world-class Monazite production capability can be added to Toliara's already stand-alone, world-class Ilmenite and Zircon production capability at a low incremental cost of production, thereby allowing the Monazite production to withstand low or variable REE oxide markets. Toliara is expected to be Energy Fuels' cornerstone source of Monazite supply, providing a long-term and large-scale supply of Monazite (21,800 tonnes per annum (""tpa"") average Monazite production), to the Mill for processing into REE oxides and other advanced REE materials, along with the recovery of contained uranium. As the Monazite will be a very low-cost byproduct of Toliara's primary Ilmenite and Zircon production, the total cost of production of REE oxides at the Mill is expected to be low-cost and globally competitive. Processing Monazite from Toliara will also add approximately 75,000 lbs of low-cost uranium production (at an incremental cost of approximately $8 per pound) per year at the Mill, totaling approximately 3 million pounds of recovered U3O8 over the life of the Project. This will provide a reliable low-cost stream of uranium production at the Mill that will be able to withstand lower uranium prices and will supplement Energy Fuels' U.S.-leading uranium production capacity from other mines and sources. Base Resources has a proven leadership and mineral sands operations team with an exceptional record of responsible and profitable production at its now winding down heavy mineral sands project in Kwale County, Kenya, all of whom are expected to join the Energy Fuels management team upon completion of the Transaction. The Base Resources team will continue to manage Toliara and will enhance Energy Fuels' teams in Australia and Brazil, thus allowing the Company to maximize the value of all projects to shareholders. Although the Toliara project holds a mining permit that allows production of Ilmenite, Rutile and Zircon, development at the Project was suspended by the Government of Madagascar pending negotiation of fiscal terms applying to the Project. With the recent adoption of a new Mining Code in Madagascar and Base Resources and the Government of Madagascar making sound progress on fiscal terms negotiations, the Company believes the suspension will be lifted, and required legal and fiscal stability achieved, during 2024. Aspects intended to facilitate the inclusion of Monazite on the Project's mining permit as soon as reasonably practicable after fiscal terms are agreed are included in the scope of current negotiations. However, there can be no assurance as to the timing of completion of fiscal terms negotiations and lifting of the current suspension, the timing for achieving sufficient legal and fiscal stability or the timing for approval of the addition of Monazite to the mining permit. If such approvals are not obtained, or obtained on terms less favorable than expected, this could delay any final investment decision in relation to the Project or prevent or otherwise have a significant effect on the development of the Project or ability to recover Monazite from the Project.

In contrast, the combined company would transport the Monazite to the Mill for additional processing and separation. The numbers in this table do not reflect any downstream processing or margins at the Mill. 2) The DFS2 is dated 27 September 2021. 3) The Monazite PFS and DFS2 constituted a ""Pre-Feasibility Study"" and ""Feasibility Study"" (respectively) for the purposes of JORC. Additionally, the Monazite PFS was based on Mineral Resources, and DFS2 was based on Ore Reserves, which, in each case, were estimated in accordance with JORC. The results from these studies and such estimates may not be comparable to data or estimates under either NI 43-101 or S-K 1300 – see note below under ""Qualified Person"". MILL SYNERGIESOn April 22, 2024, Energy Fuels will release its Mill PFS projecting globally competitive capital and operating costs for planned expanded REE oxide production at the Mill. The Mill is currently commissioning its Phase 1 NdPr separation facility, which has been constructed within the Mill's existing solvent extraction building and is designed to process up to 10,000 tpa of Monazite to produce up to 1,000 tpa of NdPr oxide. The economics detailed in the Mill PFS are for the Phase 2 expansion of REE separation capacity in one or more additional facilities at the Mill, capable of processing 30,000 tpa of Monazite to produce approximately 3,000 tpa of NdPr oxide. The Mill PFS shows globally competitive capital expenditures of $348 million for the 30,000 tpa Phase 2 separation facility and an average processing cost of $29.88/kg NdPr. This analysis does not include any capital or operating costs associated with the recovery of Dy and Tb or any revenues associated with the sales of those ""heavy"" REE oxides. Upon completion of the Transaction, Energy Fuels plans to update the DFS2 and the Monazite PFS and re-issue those reports in a form that complies with NI 43-101 and S-K-1300, and that also updates and incorporates the results of the Mill PFS to expand Phase 2 production capacity from a 30,000 tpa Monazite process plant capable of producing approximately 3,000 tpa of NdPr oxide to a 40,000 - 60,000 tpa Monazite process plant capable of producing approximately 4,000 - 6,000 tpa of NdPr oxide, along with Dy and Tb oxides. The details of the Mill PFS are presented below: Unit NdPr Production at the Mill1 Capital Costs to Construct Phase 2 Separation Facility at the Mill US$ millions 348 Operating Cost $/kg NdPr US$ 29.88 Plant Capacity2 Monazite tpa 30,000 Notes: 1) The Mill PFS addresses the production of NdPr alone from processing Monazite. It does not address or attribute any costs or value to the significant quantities of Dy and Tb that will also be recovered from the Monazite at the Mill. This will be updated in the future to also address Dy and Tb production from Monazite. 2) The Mill PFS assumes a Phase 2 separation facility capacity of 30,000 tpa of Monazite. With the planned Monazite production from the Company's Bahia Project in Brazil, the planned acquisition of Toliara, the potential acquisition of an interest in the Astron Donald Project, and other potential Monazite acquisitions, Energy Fuels plans to update the Mill PFS based on an increased Monazite throughput of 40,000 – 60,000 tpa, which would generate 4,000 - 6,000 tpa of NdPr, 150 - 225 tpa of Dy, and 50 - 75 tpa of Tb. The Phase 2 separation facility is subject to completion of engineering design and receipt of any required permits and licenses. See the Mill PFS, which will be available on the Company's website at www.energyfuels.com and on SEDAR and EDGAR, for important information about its scope, key assumptions, qualifications and risks.

(NYSE:CNHI) announces the appointment of Gerrit Marx to the role of CEO effective July 1, 2024. He succeeds Scott Wine, whose request to leave the Company at the end of the current three-year business plan cycle to pursue other interests, has been accepted by the Board. Mr. Marx rejoins CNH from Iveco Group where as CEO he has led that company’s drive into a new era of connectivity, integrating the latest digital and data technologies with Iveco’s product offering. He has also chaired Iveco’s powertrain business overseeing its transition to alternative propulsion systems. Prior to first joining CNH in January 2019, Mr. Marx worked for 20 years in senior roles at McKinsey, Daimler Trucks, and Bain Capital, living in Brazil, China, Europe and Japan. During the more than three years of Mr. Wine’s tenure as CEO, CNH has become an agriculture and construction pure-play following the Iveco Group demerger and is now solely listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Among his achievements, Mr. Wine has delivered three straight years of record revenues and EBIT margins while overseeing the improved performance of the Company’s Agriculture segment, the turnaround of the Construction segment, and the 2021 acquisition of Raven Industries, the precision agriculture technology business. In this period the Company has more than doubled its R&D expenditures, launched ambitious margin improvement and value enhancement initiatives, and by May 2024 will have returned more than $3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. CNH’s Chair, Suzanne Heywood commented: “We’re delighted to welcome Gerrit back to CNH as CEO. We look forward to him bringing the same energy and focus he has demonstrated so effectively when leading Iveco, to his new role at a time when CNH is navigating the current end-market downcycle with an emphasis on managing inventory and costs, expanding margins, and harnessing the full potential of the newly established tech stack. On behalf of the Board, I would also like to thank Scott Wine for his leadership and considerable contribution to CNH’s progress in these years and wish him well in his future endeavors.” With Mr. Marx’s appointment as the Company’s new CEO taking effect on July 1, 2024, the Board has decided that the Investor Day presentation scheduled for May 21, 2024, will be postponed to a later date to allow Mr. Marx to lead the Company’s planning and objectives for the next phase of its development.

The funding will allow SynOx to generate registrational data for emactuzumab, a next-generation therapy for TGCT. Negative None. Biotech Equity Analyst SynOx Therapeutics' Series B funding round of $75 million earmarked for the Phase 3 trial of emactuzumab represents a pivotal moment in the company's trajectory and underscores investor confidence in its potential. The commitment from seasoned investors like Forbion and HealthCap, coupled with the introduction of Bioqube Ventures, signals market validation of the therapeutic's promise. The substantial investment suggests a robust financial foundation, enabling SynOx to navigate the costly Phase 3 trial phase without immediate capital concerns.The focus on Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumour (TGCT) — a niche but serious medical condition with a high recurrence rate post-surgery — highlights a strategic move to target unmet medical needs. For investors, the unique appeal lies in the significant market opportunity for a treatment that could address both localized and diffuse TGCT. The reported objective response rate (ORR) of 71% positions emactuzumab as a potentially disruptive player in the oncology segment.However, risks remain inherent in biotech investing, particularly at this clinical stage. The transition from Phase 3 trials to regulatory approval is fraught with uncertainty and the eventual commercial success hinges on numerous factors including the final efficacy and safety profile, market penetration and reimbursement landscape. Furthermore, investor dilution is a common side effect of such capital raises and there is always the spectre of competition from other pharmaceutical entities. Medical Research Analyst The medical significance of emactuzumab cannot be understated, as it targets the CSF-1R pathway implicated in TGCT — a pathway essential for the growth of certain immune cells associated with this tumour type. From a clinical perspective, the therapeutic's ability to induce rapid tumour reduction and provide long-lasting effects offers a potential leap from the current standard of care, which is primarily surgical intervention with a high recurrence rate.It's noteworthy that the molecule is pegged as a 'next-generation' therapy; this designation often implies an improvement over existing treatments in terms of efficacy, safety, or patient convenience. The reported manageable safety profile is equally important, as tolerability can be a limiting factor in the adoption of new oncology treatments. Still, the true test lies ahead in the Phase 3 TANGENT trial, where the drug must demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit to warrant approval by regulatory agencies like the FDA.Given the complexity of biologic treatments like monoclonal antibodies, the scalability of production and the ability to maintain consistent quality (CMC - Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls) will be crucial. Investors should watch for any manufacturing hiccups that could delay market entry or affect the cost structure of the drug. Market Research Analyst Focusing on the market dynamics, TGCT, while classified as a rare disease, presents a significant commercial opportunity for SynOx, due to the lack of pharmacological options. Currently, treatment is predominantly surgical, which does not provide a permanent solution for many patients. A therapeutic like emactuzumab could become the standard of care if it proves superior in efficacy and safety, capturing a niche yet valuable market.Market penetration will depend not only on clinical outcomes but also on how effectively SynOx can navigate the regulatory landscape and negotiate with payers. Assuming emactuzumab achieves regulatory approval, SynOx will need a robust marketing strategy to educate physicians about its benefits over surgery and to secure favorable reimbursement rates.Tracking the company's progress through the Phase 3 trial and subsequent steps toward commercialization will be crucial. Any delays or setbacks could significantly impact investor sentiment, as the biotech market is highly sensitive to clinical trial results and regulatory decisions. Conversely, positive results could enhance SynOx's prospects for partnerships or even make it an acquisition target, offering potentially lucrative returns for early investors. 04/22/2024 - 03:30 AM Financing co-led by Forbion, HealthCap and new investor Bioqube Ventures Funds will be used for pivotal trial of potential best-in-class, next-generation treatment for Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumour DUBLIN and OXFORD, England, April 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- SynOx Therapeutics Limited (""SynOx"" or the ""Company""), the late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company, is pleased to announce the close of a $75m Series B financing. The financing was co-led by Forbion, HealthCap and new investor Bioqube Ventures. The proceeds will be used to generate registrational Phase 3 clinical and CMC data for emactuzumab, SynOx's potentially best-in-class CSF-1(R) inhibiting monoclonal antibody (mAb) for the treatment of Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumour (TGCT). TGCT is a type of tumour that affects the soft tissue lining of joints and tendons and is a highly debilitating disease often impacting large, important joints such as the knee, hip and ankle. TGCT is a chronic disease which often impacts patients throughout their lives. It seriously impacts quality of life by causing significant loss of function of the affected joints, pain, stiffness, and limiting range of motion. While most patients receive surgical intervention, more than 50% of patients with diffuse disease experience tumour recurrence within three years of surgery[1]. Emactuzumab is a novel, next-generation CSF-1R mAb with a potentially best-in-class profile. In earlier clinical work in TGCT[2] emactuzumab demonstrated substantial clinical activity with an objective response rate (ORR) of 71%, rapid and robust tumour reduction, a long duration of effect, and significant improvements in functional ability. Importantly, these studies also indicated that emactuzumab has good tolerability and a manageable safety profile. SynOx is initiating a Phase 3 trial (TANGENT) to assess the efficacy and safety of emactuzumab in patients with localized and diffuse TGCT. As part of the Series B financing both Dr Carlo Incerti, M.D., and Jon Edwards, PhD, have joined the Board of Directors. Dr Incerti has more than three decades of experience in the biopharmaceutical industry and brings an extensive track record in global drug development, including from his time at Sanofi Genzyme where he played a leading role in pioneering therapies for rare and genetic diseases. Jon Edwards brings a decade of therapeutic investment expertise and company creation experience, which includes several public listings and multi-billion-dollar acquisitions. Ray Barlow, Chief Executive Officer of SynOx Therapeutics, said: ""This is a transformational time for SynOx. This substantial funding will allow us to generate registrational data for emactuzumab in TGCT. As a highly effective, next-generation therapy with a short treatment cycle, rapid onset and long duration of response, we believe that emactuzumab is differentiated from other agents in development and will provide a much needed and valuable option for patients suffering from this grievous disease."" Dirk Kersten, General Partner at Forbion, commented: ""We are pleased to continue to support the SynOx team as it moves emactuzumab through to BLA and MAA submissions in TGCT. As a late-stage company with a clinically de-risked asset, focused on an attractive and underserved market, SynOx is a good example of the type of company Forbion Growth would typically invest in."" Jon Edwards, Bioqube Ventures commented: ""We are excited to join the SynOx syndicate and work with this fantastic team and board. We believe this asset has the potential to generate best-in-class data and are excited to help the team develop the product through approval and launch."" Ton Logtenberg, Non-Executive Chair of SynOx Therapeutics, added: ""The support of our existing and new investors is validation of SynOx's strategy and its great potential as a company. I would like to welcome Carlo Incerti and Jon Edwards to the Board of Directors. Their broad experience and knowledge, particularly in driving forward cutting-edge therapies for rare diseases, and executing deals at the highest level, complement the expertise of our existing directors and will be instrumental as we accelerate the late-stage clinical development of emactuzumab.""

About Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumour (TGCT)Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumour (TGCT), previously termed pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS), is a type of tumour that affects the soft tissue lining of joints and tendons. TGCTs are categorised as fibrohistiocytic tumours by the WHO classification and are subclassified based on growth patterns (localised- and diffuse types) and location (tendon sheath, and intra- and extra-articular forms). TGCTs are locally destructive and can be aggressive tumours. TGCT is a chronically debilitating disease which often impacts patients throughout their lives. It causes loss of function of the affected joints, pain, stiffness, limited range of motion and a significant impact on the quality of life as a result. Most patients receive surgical intervention, with 3-year post-surgery recurrence rates in more than 50% of patients[3]. Symptoms typically progress slowly but can be aggressive and destructive. If left untreated complications include moderate to severe joint deformity, degenerative articular changes, and osteoarthritis, which if severe enough, can lead to cortical bone destruction and occasionally the need for arthrodesis or amputation. About CSF-1 and Emactuzumab CSF-1 (or macrophage colony-stimulating factor) is a cytokine that binds to the CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R), expressed on macrophages and certain other cells, with effects on production, differentiation, and function of these cells. Emactuzumab is a humanised IgG1 CSF-1R targeted antibody that inhibits and depletes macrophages in the tumour tissue. Emactuzumab was originally discovered and developed by Roche and has been tested in several phase 1/b studies as a monotherapy and in combination with other agents, including chemotherapeutics and immunotherapies. In clinical studies as a monotherapy in 63 patients with TGCT, emactuzumab has shown a substantial effect on tumour response (ORR ~71%) and was well tolerated2. Emactuzumab is a novel monoclonal antibody inhibiting CSF-1R that offers a short course of treatment. Phase I/II studies indicated good tolerability and a manageable safety profile and substantial preliminary efficacy in TGCT patients with rapid, robust tumour reduction and durable response. Emactuzumab may also have utility in other macrophage driven diseases and the company is actively considering potential options in these areas.

A formal communication has also been received from the United States Patent and Trademark Office indicating that grant of the equivalent US patent application is imminent.The proprietary CellKeep slide is the result of a three-year development effort by ANGLE to address CTC loss endemic in standard laboratory microscopy techniques for the cytological analysis of CTCs. The result is a new device and method to attach cells to the slide, which extensive inhouse testing has demonstrated, eliminates over 70% of CTC loss experienced when using standard techniques.The Parsortix® system efficiently captures CTCs from blood and these remain intact and viable (live) prior to downstream analysis. When visualising CTCs by microscopy there is a critical step to transfer CTCs to a slide for biomarker labelling. In-house testing has shown that standard laboratory techniques, used worldwide, result in a high rate of cell loss (>50%) and cause damage to CTCs. Reducing cell loss to a minimum is critical for subsequent analysis of CTCs as they are present in very low numbers in the blood.ANGLE has developed the CellKeep slide to reduce cell loss during the transfer of CTCs to the microscope slide and to protect the morphology of the harvested cells. The technique also reduces costs by concentrating the CTCs into a smaller area on the slide, thereby limiting the quantity of high-cost antibodies and imaging time required to identify and analyse cells.In analytical studies, CTCs were harvested from duplicate cancer patient blood samples and deposited on either standard microscope slides or ANGLE's new CellKeep slides, then processed and stained for CTC biomarkers. The study demonstrated that the use of CellKeep slides significantly increased the identification of CTCs with higher sample positivity rates, and better preservation of CTC morphology and clusters.The new CellKeep slide is an integral part of ANGLE's Portrait®+ CTC staining kit which is available for customers to identify and enumerate CTCs harvested using the Parsortix system.ANGLE Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Newland, commented:""We are delighted to have secured intellectual property rights for our proprietary CellKeep slide in two major jurisdictions. Following harvesting of rare CTCs from patient blood samples using the Parsortix system, the CellKeep slide and associated methodology will significantly improve the capture of CTCs for microscopy-based biomarker assays and will enhance sensitivity across ANGLE's assay portfolio. This is a significant technology advancement for the CTC liquid biopsy field and another step towards enabling biomarker-guided precision medicine for people with cancer.ANGLE Chief Scientific Officer, Karen Miller commented:""We are pleased to share our success in securing IP rights for ANGLE's CellKeep slide which enhances the capture of CTCs on to slides and facilitates evaluation of cancer cell biomarkers. This technology is a significant advancement over current standards for CTCs and has the potential to capture other cell types from body fluids such as blood, urine or cerebrospinal fluid, for subsequent analysis.For further information:ANGLE plc+44 (0) 1483 343434Andrew Newland, Chief ExecutiveIan Griffiths, Finance Director Berenberg (NOMAD and Corporate Broker)Toby Flaux, Ciaran Walsh, Milo Bonser+44 (0) 20 3207 7800FTI ConsultingSimon Conway, Ciara MartinMatthew Ventimiglia (US)+44 (0) 203 727 1000+1 (212) 850 5624The information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the EU Market Abuse Regulation (596/2014).

Negative None. 04/22/2024 - 04:00 AM VANCOUVER, BC, April 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Luca Mining Corp. (""Luca"" or the ""Company"") (TSXV: LUCA) (OTCQX: LUCMF) (Frankfurt: Z68) reports strong Q1 2024 production of 14,148 troy oz of gold equivalent as our Tahuehueto gold and silver mine ramps up towards its 1,000 ton per day commercial production target and the optimization program rapidly progresses at Campo Morado. The Tahuehueto gold and silver mine in Durango state, produced approximately 3,657 troy oz of gold equivalent comprised of 43 tonnes of copper, 468 tonnes of zinc, 2,368 troy ounces of gold, 27,396 troy ounces of silver and 251 tonnes of lead in Q1 2024, an increase of 18% from Q4 2023.The second mill at Tahuehueto has been installed and underwent a successful commissioning period. In March 2024, the site was achieving approximately 60% of total installed milling capacity and a record of over 14,000 dry metric tons (dmt) milled (approximately 46% increase over February 2024). At this rate Tahuehueto is expected to declare commercial production as a brand-new gold and silver mine and achieve positive operating cash flow in 2H 2024.The Campo Morado copper-zinc mine in Guerrero state, produced approximately 10,491 troy ounces of gold equivalent comprised of 748 tonnes of copper, 2,600 tonnes of zinc, 1,929 troy ounces of gold, 180,108 troy ounces of silver and 410 tonnes of lead in Q1 2024. This is an increase of approximately 25% from the previous quarter.These strong results do not reflect the full potential of the optimization program which continues to be implemented at Campo Morado. New blending and reagent protocols have yielded higher concentrate grades and recoveries, and the mine is already generating positive operating cash flow. Ongoing improvements to grade control, reagent dosing systems, process controls and metallurgical testing will provide more benefits through the production of three separate, higher value concentrates – copper, zinc, and lead, expected to take place in H2 2024 which will further increase revenue and operating cash flow.Ramon Perez, President, and Interim CEO, commented, ""We are pleased with the continued performance of the operations at both Campo Morado and Tahuehueto. Having returned from the Tahuehueto Mine, I am very encouraged with the speed and progress we are making at site. We have already achieved over 60% of the nameplate capacity. A third filter press is enroute to the plant, which following installation, will allow for the tonnage to reach full capacity of 1,000 tpd. We are in the final stages of commissioning and look forward to declaring commercial production in H2 2024. At Campo Morado we are currently milling 1,600 tpd of our 2,400 tpd capacity. and are increasing the quality of our bulk and zinc concentrates. As we continue to modernise our equipment we expect the milling rate to increase in Q2 2024. In addition, the optimization program is also moving forward at a rapid pace with the ultimate objective to produce three separate, salable concentrates of copper, zinc and lead which will further enhance cash flow. I will be updating the market on this progress shortly."" 1. Gold equivalents are calculated using an 88.97:1 (Ag/Au), 0.001:1 (Au/Zn), 0.002:1 (Au/Cu) and 0.0004:1 (Au/Pb) ratio for Q1 2024 Operational PerformanceCampo Morado The Campo Morado copper-zinc mine in Guerrero state, processed approximately 125,105 tonnes of ore during Q1 2024, meeting expectations of the mine plan. Campo Morado has seen improvements in metallurgical recovery and bulk concentrate grades during the quarter which are the direct result of the ongoing improvement project. In Q1, improvements to ore blending, reagent dosing and equipment refurbishments have had a positive impact to operating results. Tahuehueto The Tahuehueto gold, silver mine in Durango state, currently in pre-production, processed approximately 33,319 tonnes of ore in Q1 2024, an increase of 42% from Q4 2023. Construction of permanent access to the pumping ponds at the tailings storage facility is ongoing. All peripheral installations of the second mill have been completed with the final testing ongoing throughout Q1. Additionally, the installation of the second filter press has been completed and is now operational. Throughput for the month of January was 9,665 tonnes and in the month of February was 9,617 tonnes, which continues to increase systematically as ramp up continues. In March, Tahuehueto achieved a new daily milling record of 703 tonnes and a monthly record of over 14,000 tonnes. We caution that as with any company bringing a new mine into production, the monthly results may vary dramatically while operations are halted for plant installations and testing, and we do not expect to report consistent, stable results until commercial production is achieved at Tahuehueto, which is expected by H2 2024. Furthermore, we will not be able to provide guidance on certain metrics for Tahuehueto such as ""All In Sustaining Costs"", until commercial production is achieved. We do not expect to report consistent, stable results until commercial production is achieved at Tahuehueto, which is expected by H2 2024. 1.

Cautionary Note Regarding Production Decisions and Forward-Looking Statements It should be noted that Luca declared commercial production at Campo Morado prior to completing a feasibility study of mineral reserves demonstrating economic and technical viability. Accordingly, readers should be cautioned that Luca's production decision has been made without a comprehensive feasibility study of established reserves such that there is greater risk and uncertainty as to future economic results from the Campo Morado mine and a higher technical risk of failure than would be the case if a feasibility study were completed and relied upon to make a production decision. Luca has completed a preliminary economic assessment (""PEA"") mining study on the Campo Morado mine that provides a conceptual life of mine plan and a preliminary economic analysis based on the previously identified mineral resources (see news releases dated November 8, 2017, and April 4, 2018).

(Graphic: FICO) Highlights Average spend increased 1.55% over January 2024, reaching an average of £785 With inflation still higher than the same period in 2023, spend remains higher year-on-year Payments to balance fell by 3.1% from January, with just 36.5% of outstanding balances paid in February and balances increasing 0.1% to £1770 Fewer customers missed one or two payments compared to the previous month, but figures remain higher than 2023 There was a slight year-on-year and month-on-month increase in the number of customers missing three payments Key Trend Indicators – UK Cards February 2024 Metric Amount Month-on-Month Change Year-on-Year Change Average UK Credit Card Spend £785 +1.6% +0.3% Average Card Balance £1,770 +0.1% +6.6% Percentage of Payments to Balance 36.47% -3.1% -3.6% Accounts with One Missed Payment 1.5% -10.9% +5.5% Accounts with Two Missed Payments 0.33% -10.3% +3.6% Accounts with Three Missed Payments 0.22% +1.8% +2.2% Average Credit Limit £5,645 +0.2% +1.7% Average Overlimit Spend £85 0% -6.5% Cash Sales as a % of Total Sales 0.86% -0.2% -0.1 Source: FICO FICO Comment UK credit card spending has started to pick up, after the usual seasonal dip in January, increasing by 1.6% on the previous month to an average of £785, an increase of 0.3% on 2023. Although inflation is now stabilising, inflation does remain higher than last year; spend patterns are, therefore, likely to remain high. Higher inflation rates also continue to impact the average credit card balance, which is now £1,770 – 6.6% higher than February 2023. Credit card providers will also want to monitor the percentage of the total balance being paid. In February this dropped to 36.5%; a 3.1% decrease compared to January and 3.6% lower year-on-year. This has been trending down since May 2022, with reduced pandemic savings no longer helping to pay down balances as much as they were previously. Lenders will, however, be encouraged that the pattern of missed payments stabilised in February. The number of customers missing one credit card payment decreased by 10.9% month-on-month, to 1.5%. This measure has been erratic for many months, although it has been trending upwards since April 2022. There is also a more obvious overall upward trend for customers missing two payments; especially for those who have had their credit card for less than five years. However, following the usual Christmas spike, this decreased by 10.3% month-on-month in February to 0.3%, while remaining 3.6% higher than the same month in 2023. Another important data point is the average balance on accounts with one missed payment. This has increased for the second consecutive month and now stands at an average of £2,255. This is also 5.7% higher than the same period in 2023. For customers missing two payments, this has increased by 4.7% month-on-month to £2,705, with a larger number of accounts and balances missing payments rolling forwards in their delinquency. Although the number and average balance of one, two and three missed payments is trending upwards, the balance of customers not missing payments has also been trending upwards. The rate of missed payment balances to the overall up-to-date balance has remained flat since the start of 2023; this suggests that collections and limit management risk strategies are effective at controlling customers spending capabilities. One other measure that credit card providers continue to monitor closely is the percentage of customers taking out cash on their credit card. This continues to decrease; it’s down 2.2% on the previous month, although it remains 3% higher than the previous year, now standing at 3.3%. This has been trending down since September 2023 but if it follows the same trend as 2023, it is likely to stabilise within the next couple of months.

Smith, Vice President of Exploration for the Company, comments: ""The 2023 drilling at CV5 has more than doubled the spodumene pegmatite's strike from 2.2 km at the end of 2022, to 4.6 km at the end of 2023 and remains open. To put this further into perspective, the maiden mineral resource estimate for CV5 – announced July 2023 – covered only ~3.7 km of this strike length and highlights the deposit's growth potential over time. While much work has been done, in many respects it feels like we are only just beginning to unlock the potential at Corvette."" Patriot Battery Metals Inc. (the ""Company"" or ""Patriot"") (TSX: PMET) (ASX: PMT) (OTCQX: PMETF) (FSE: R9GA) is pleased to announce the remaining core assay results for drill holes completed in 2023 at the CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite. The Corvette Property (the ""Property"" or ""Project""), wholly owned by the Company, is located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of Quebec. The CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite, with a maiden mineral resource estimate (""MRE"") of 109.2 Mt at 1.42% Li2O inferred1, is situated approximately 13.5 km south of the regional and all–weather Trans-Taiga Road and powerline infrastructure. Drill results for the remaining 42 drill holes completed in 2023 at the CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite are reported herein (Figure 4). This drilling included both infill holes as well as holes completed over the western extension of the pegmatite body, discovered subsequent to the June 2023 MRE. Collectively, through to the end of 2023, drilling has traced the CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite over a strike length of 4.6 km, which remains open along strike at both ends and to depth (Figure 1). Highlights for the holes reported herein include: Infill Drill Holes133.9 m at 1.21% Li2O, including 41.5 m at 1.52% Li2O; and 42.2 m at 1.59% Li2O, including 10.1 m at 3.22% Li2O (CV23-298).50.5 m at 1.42% Li2O, including 11.4 m at 3.13% Li2O; and 38.7 m at 2.06% Li2O, including 15.6 m at 3.26% Li2O (CV23-285).123.5 m at 0.72% Li2O, including 35.5 m at 1.07% Li2O; and 12.9 m at 1.30% Li2O, (CV23-272A).76.7 m at 0.69% Li2O, including 34.1 m at 0.98% Li2O (CV23-327).Drill holes CV23-298 and CV23-285 returned sub-intervals of very high grade at 10.1 m at 3.22% Li2O and 15.6 m at 3.26% Li2O, respectively (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 5, and Figure 6). These high-grade intercepts are situated at depth within the central areas of CV5, outside of the Nova Zone, and highlight the robustness of the mineralized system. Western Extension30.5 m at 0.77% Li2O, including 14.2 m at 1.57% Li2O; and 21.0 m at 0.81% Li2O, including 11.0 m at 1.46% Li2O (CV23-283) – collared in pegmatite.21.3 m at 0.88% Li2O, including 6.4 m at 1.87% Li2O; and 24.9 m at 0.83% Li2O, including 11.1 m at 1.80% Li2O (CV23-295).Over the western extension at CV5, the principal pegmatite is interpreted to have bifurcated into two (2) sub-parallel trending bodies, both of which remain mineralized and open to the west and at depth. This is illustrated via a simplified geological cross-section for drill holes CV23-283 and 295 (Figure 7 and Figure 8). Additionally, very high-grade intervals continue to be discovered over the extension including 3.9 m at 3.99% Li2O (CV23-273), as well as in the final and most westerly drill hole completed in 2023 at CV5 (CV23-364), which returned a strong intercept of 13.1 m at 0.91% Li2O, including 4.3 m at 2.22% Li2O (Figure 9). Collectively, the results announced herein continue to demonstrate strong grades and widths of spodumene pegmatite at the western extension, which remains open. Through 2023, the CV5 and CV13 spodumene pegmatites have been traced by drilling to within approximately 2.9 km of each other (Figure 10). This highly prospective corridor between the two spodumene pegmatites, also coincident with a local structural and magnetic trend, remains to be drill tested. In 2023 at the Corvette Property, the Company completed a total of 78,213 m (266 holes), including 58,460 m (168 holes) at CV5, 14,917 m (74 holes) at CV13, 4,071 m (18 holes) at CV9, and 765 m (6 holes) at Camp Shaakichiuwaanan. The 2024 winter drill program, which recently concluded at the Property, totalled 62,518 m (166 holes) – 50,961 m (121 holes) at CV5, and 11,557 m (45 holes) at CV13. All results for this drilling remain to be reported. A summary update on the program is anticipated to be announced shortly. Since discovery (fall 2021) through to the recently completed 2024 winter drill program, the Company had completed 134,129 m (369 holes) at CV5, of which only 56,461 m (166 holes) were included in the June 2023 MRE. The majority of the drilling completed since the June 2023 MRE has been focused on infill rather than resource growth in order to upgrade the resource category from inferred to indicated at CV5. An updated MRE for the Corvette Project, incorporating drilling through April 2024, is planned for Q3 2024. This MRE update will include both the CV5 and CV13 spodumene pegmatites and a total anticipated metreage of 134,129 m (369 holes) and 29,121 m (133 holes), respectively. The primary objective of the Q3 2024 MRE update is to increase confidence in resource category at CV5, from inferred to indicated, to further support development studies underway. Core sample assays for drill holes reported herein from the CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite are presented in Table 1 for all pegmatite intersections >2 m. Drill hole locations and attributes are presented in Table 2. 1 The CV5 mineral resource estimate (109.2 Mt at 1.42% Li2O and 160 ppm Ta2O5 inferred) is reported at a cut-off grade of 0.40% Li2O with effective date of June 25, 2023 (through drill hole CV23-190). Mineral resources are not mineral reserves as they do not have demonstrated economic viability. Largest lithium pegmatite resource in the Americas based on contained LCE Quality Assurance / Quality Control (QAQC)A Quality Assurance / Quality Control protocol following industry best practices was incorporated into the program and included systematic insertion of quartz blanks and certified reference materials into sample batches at a rate of approximately 5%. Additionally, analysis of pulp-split and coarse-split sample duplicates were completed to assess analytical precision at different stages of the laboratory preparation process, and external (secondary) laboratory pulp-split duplicates were prepared at the primary lab for subsequent check analysis and validation. All core samples collected were shipped to SGS Canada's laboratory in Val-d'Or, QC, for sample preparation (code PRP89 special) which includes drying at 105°C, crush to 90% passing 2 mm, riffle split 250 g, and pulverize 85% passing 75 microns. The pulps were shipped by air to SGS Canada's laboratory in Burnaby, BC, where the samples were homogenized and subsequently analyzed for multi-element (including Li and Ta) using sodium peroxide fusion with ICP-AES/MS finish (codes GE_ICP91A50 and GE_IMS91A50). About the CV Lithium TrendThe CV Lithium Trend is an emerging spodumene pegmatite district discovered by the Company in 2017 and is interpreted to span more than 50 kilometres across the Corvette Property. The core area includes the approximate 4.6 km long CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite, which hosts a maiden mineral resource estimate of 109.2 Mt at 1.42% Li2O inferred1. To date, eight (8) distinct clusters of lithium pegmatite have been discovered across the Corvette Property – CV4, CV5, CV8, CV9, CV10, CV12, CV13, and the recently discovered CV14. Given the proximity of some pegmatite outcrops to each other, as well as the shallow till cover in the area, it is probable that some of the outcrops may reflect a discontinuous surface exposure of a single, larger pegmatite ""outcrop"" subsurface.

Appendix 1 – JORC Code 2012 Table 1 (ASX Listing Rule 5.7.1)Section 1 – Sampling Techniques and DataCriteria JORC Code explanation Commentary Sampling techniques • Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels, random chips, or specific specialized industry standard measurement tools appropriate to the minerals under investigation, such as down hole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc). These examples should not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling. • Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity and the appropriate calibration of any measurement tools or systems used. • Aspects of the determination of mineralization that are Material to the Public Report. • In cases where 'industry standard' work has been done this would be relatively simple (eg 'reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was pulverized to produce a 30 g charge for fire assay'). In other cases more explanation may be required, such as where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems. Unusual commodities or mineralization types (eg submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed information. • Core sampling protocols meet industry standard practices. • Core sampling is guided by lithology as determined during geological logging (i.e., by a geologist). All pegmatite intervals are sampled in their entirety (half-core), regardless if spodumene mineralization is noted or not (in order to ensure an unbiased sampling approach) in addition to ~1 to 3 m of sampling into the adjacent host rock (dependent on pegmatite interval length) to ""bookend"" the sampled pegmatite. • The minimum individual sample length is typically 0.3-0.5 m and the maximum sample length is typically 2.0 m. Targeted individual pegmatite sample lengths are 1.0 m. • All drill core is oriented to maximum foliation prior to logging and sampling and is cut with a core saw into half-core pieces, with one half-core collected for assay, and the other half-core remaining in the box for reference. • Core samples collected from drill holes were shipped to SGS Canada's laboratory in Val-d'Or, QC, for sample preparation (code PRP89 special) which included drying at 105°C, crush to 90% passing 2 mm, riffle split 250 g, and pulverize 85% passing 75 microns. Core sample pulps were shipped by air to SGS Canada's laboratory in Burnaby, BC, where the samples were homogenized and subsequently analyzed for multi-element (including Li and Ta) using sodium peroxide fusion with ICP-AES/MS finish (codes GE_ICP91A50 and GE_IMS91A50). Drilling techniques • Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer, rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, sonic, etc) and details (eg core diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of diamond tails, face-sampling bit or other type, whether core is oriented and if so, by what method, etc). • NQ size core diamond drilling was completed for all holes. Core was not oriented. Drill sample recovery • Method of recording and assessing core and chip sample recoveries and results assessed. • Measures taken to maximize sample recovery and ensure representative nature of the samples. • Whether a relationship exists between sample recovery and grade and whether sample bias may have occurred due to preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse material. • All drill core was geotechnically logged following industry standard practices, and include TCR, RQD, ISRM, and Q-Method. Core recovery is very good and typically exceeds 90%. Logging • Whether core and chip samples have been geologically and geotechnically logged to a level of detail to support appropriate Mineral Resource estimation, mining studies and metallurgical studies. • Whether logging is qualitative or quantitative in nature. Core (or costean, channel, etc) photography. • The total length and percentage of the relevant intersections logged. • Upon receipt at the core shack, all drill core is pieced together, oriented to maximum foliation, metre marked, geotechnically logged (including structure), alteration logged, geologically logged, and sample logged on an individual sample basis. Core box photos are also collected of all core drilled, regardless of perceived mineralization. Specific gravity measurements of pegmatite are also collected at systematic intervals for all pegmatite drill core using the water immersion method, as well as select host rock drill core. • The logging is qualitative by nature, and includes estimates of spodumene grain size, inclusions, and model mineral estimates. • These logging practices meet or exceed current industry standard practices. Sub-sampling techniques and sample preparation • If core, whether cut or sawn and whether quarter, half or all core taken. • If non-core, whether riffled, tube sampled, rotary split, etc and whether sampled wet or dry. • For all sample types, the nature, quality and appropriateness of the sample preparation technique. • Quality control procedures adopted for all sub-sampling stages to maximize representivity of samples. • Measures taken to ensure that the sampling is representative of the in situ material collected, including for instance results for field duplicate/second-half sampling. • Whether sample sizes are appropriate to the grain size of the material being sampled. • Drill core sampling follows industry best practices. Drill core was saw-cut with half-core sent for geochemical analysis and half-core remaining in the box for reference. The same side of the core was sampled to maintain representativeness. • Sample sizes are appropriate for the material being assayed. • A Quality Assurance / Quality Control (QAQC) protocol following industry best practices was incorporated into the program and included systematic insertion of quartz blanks and certified reference materials (CRMs) into sample batches at a rate of approximately 5% each. Additionally, analysis of pulp-split and course-split sample duplicates were completed to assess analytical precision at different stages of the laboratory preparation process, and external (secondary) laboratory pulp-split duplicates were prepared at the primary lab for subsequent check analysis and validation at a secondary lab. • All protocols employed are considered appropriate for the sample type and nature of mineralization and are considered the optimal approach for maintaining representativeness in sampling. Quality of assay data and laboratory tests • The nature, quality and appropriateness of the assaying and laboratory procedures used and whether the technique is considered partial or total. • For geophysical tools, spectrometers, handheld XRF instruments, etc, the parameters used in determining the analysis including instrument make and model, reading times, calibrations factors applied and their derivation, etc. • Nature of quality control procedures adopted (eg standards, blanks, duplicates, external laboratory checks) and whether acceptable levels of accuracy (ie lack of bias) and precision have been established. • Core samples collected from drill holes were shipped to SGS Canada's laboratory in Val-d'Or, QC, for standard sample preparation (code PRP89 special) which included drying at 105°C, crush to 90% passing 2 mm, riffle split 250 g, and pulverize 85% passing 75 microns. Core sample pulps were shipped by air to SGS Canada's laboratory in Burnaby, BC, where the samples were homogenized and subsequently analyzed for multi-element (including Li and Ta) using sodium peroxide fusion with ICP-AES/MS finish (codes GE_ICP91A50 and GE_IMS91A50). • The Company relies on both its internal QAQC protocols (systematic use of blanks, certified reference materials, and external checks), as well as the laboratory's internal QAQC. • All protocols employed are considered appropriate for the sample type and nature of mineralization and are considered the optimal approach for maintaining representativeness in sampling. Verification of sampling and assaying • The verification of significant intersections by either independent or alternative company personnel. • The use of twinned holes. • Documentation of primary data, data entry procedures, data verification, data storage (physical and electronic) protocols. • Discuss any adjustment to assay data. • Intervals are reviewed and compiled by the VP Exploration and Project Managers prior to disclosure, including a review of the Company's internal QAQC sample analytical data. • Data capture utilizes MX Deposit software whereby core logging data is entered directly into the software for storage, including direct import of laboratory analytical certificates as they are received. The Company employs various on-site and post QAQC protocols to ensure data integrity and accuracy. • Adjustments to data include reporting lithium and tantalum in their oxide forms, as it is reported in elemental form in the assay certificates. Formulas used are Li2O = Li x 2.153, and Ta2O5 = Ta x 1.221. Location of data points • Accuracy and quality of surveys used to locate drill holes (collar and down-hole surveys), trenches, mine workings and other locations used in Mineral Resource estimation. • Specification of the grid system used. • Quality and adequacy of topographic control. • Each drill hole's collar has been surveyed with a RTK Trimble Zephyr 3 or RTK Topcon GR-5. • The coordinate system used is UTM NAD83 Zone 18. • The Company completed a property-wide LiDAR and orthophoto survey in August 2022, which provides high-quality topographic control. • The quality and accuracy of the topographic controls are considered adequate for advanced stage exploration and development, including mineral resource estimation. Data spacing and distribution • Data spacing for reporting of Exploration Results. • Whether the data spacing and distribution is sufficient to establish the degree of geological and grade continuity appropriate for the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimation procedure(s) and classifications applied. • Whether sample compositing has been applied. • At CV5, drill hole collar spacing is dominantly grid based at ~100 m; however, tightens to ~50 m in multiple areas, and widens to ~150 m in a small number of areas. Several collars are typically completed from the same pad at varied orientations resulting in more varied pegmatite pierce points at depth. • At CV13, drill hole spacing is dominantly grid based at ~100 m; however, collar locations and hole orientations may vary widely, which reflect the varied orientation of the pegmatite body along strike. • At CV9, drill hole collar spacing is irregular with varied hole orientations and multiple collars on the same pad. • It is interpreted that the large majority of the drill hole spacing is sufficient to support a mineral resource estimate. • Core sample lengths typically range from 0.5 to 1.5 m and average ~1 m. Sampling is continuous within all pegmatite encountered in the drill hole. Orientation of data in relation to geological structure • Whether the orientation of sampling achieves unbiased sampling of possible structures and the extent to which this is known, considering the deposit type. • If the relationship between the drilling orientation and the orientation of key mineralized structures is considered to have introduced a sampling bias, this should be assessed and reported if material. • No sampling bias is anticipated based on structure within the mineralized body. • The principal mineralized bodies are relatively undeformed and very competent, although have some meaningful structural control. • At CV5, the principal mineralized body and adjacent lenses are steeply dipping resulting in oblique angles of intersection with true widths varying based on drill hole angle and orientation of pegmatite at that particular intersection point. i.e., the dip of the mineralized pegmatite body has variations in a vertical sense and along strike, so the true widths are not always apparent until several holes have been drilled (at the appropriate spacing) in any particular drill-fence. • At CV13, the principal pegmatite body has a shallow varied strike and northerly dip. • At CV9, the orientation and geometry of the pegmatite is not well understood. The pegmatite is currently interpreted to be comprised of a single principal dyke, which outcrops at surface, has a steep northerly dip, and is moderately plunging to the east-southeast. Sample security • The measures taken to ensure sample security. • Samples were collected by Company staff or its consultants following specific protocols governing sample collection and handling. Core samples were bagged, placed in large supersacs for added security, palleted, and shipped directly to Val-d'Or, QC, being tracked during shipment along with Chain of Custody. Upon arrival at the laboratory, the samples were cross-referenced with the shipping manifest to confirm all samples were accounted for. At the laboratory, sample bags are evaluated for tampering. Audits or reviews • The results of any audits or reviews of sampling techniques and data. • A review of the sample procedures for the Company's 2021 fall drill program (CF21-001 to 004) and 2022 winter drill program (CV22-015 to 034) was completed by an Independent Competent Person and deemed adequate and acceptable to industry best practices (discussed in a technical report titled ""NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Corvette Property, Quebec, Canada"", by Alex Knox, M.Sc., P.Geol., Issue Date of June 27th, 2022.) • A review of the sample procedures through the Company's 2023 winter drill program (through CV23-190) was completed by an independent Competent Person with respect to the CV5 Pegmatite's maiden mineral resource estimate and deemed adequate and acceptable to industry best practices (discussed in a technical report titled "" NI 43–101 Technical Report, Mineral Resource Estimate for the CV5 Pegmatite, Corvette Property"" by Todd McCracken, P.Geo., of BBA Engineering Ltd., and Ryan Cunningham, M.Eng., P.Eng., of Primero Group Americas Inc., Effective Date of June 25, 2023, and Issue Date of September 8, 2023. • Additionally, the Company continually reviews and evaluates its procedures in order to optimize and ensure compliance at all levels of sample data collection and handling. Section 2 – Reporting of Exploration ResultsCriteria JORC Code explanation Commentary Mineral tenement and land tenure status • Type, reference name/number, location and ownership including agreements or material issues with third parties such as joint ventures, partnerships, overriding royalties, native title interests, historical sites, wilderness or national park and environmental settings. • The security of the tenure held at the time of reporting along with any known impediments to obtaining a licence to operate in the area. • The Corvette Property is comprised of 424 CDC claims located in the James Bay Region of Quebec, with Patriot Battery Metals Inc. being the registered title holder for all of the claims. The northern border of the Property's primary claim block is located within approximately 6 km to the south of the Trans-Taiga Road and powerline infrastructure corridor. The CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite is situated approximately 13.5 km south of the regional and all–weather Trans-Taiga Road and powerline infrastructure. The CV13 and CV9 spodumene pegmatites are located approximately 3 km west-southwest and 14 km west of CV5, respectively. • The Company holds 100% interest in the Property subject to various royalty obligations depending on original acquisition agreements. DG Resources Management holds a 2% NSR (no buyback) on 76 claims, D.B.A. Canadian Mining House holds a 2% NSR on 50 claims (half buyback for $2M) and Osisko Gold Royalties holds a sliding scale NSR of 1.5-3.5% on precious metals, and 2% on all other products, over 111 claims. The vast majority of the CV13 Spodumene Pegmatite, as is currently delineated, is not subject to a royalty. • The Property does not overlap any atypically sensitive environmental areas or parks, or historical sites to the knowledge of the Company. There are no known hinderances to operating at the Property, apart from the goose harvesting season (typically mid-April to mid-May) where the communities request helicopter flying not be completed, and potentially wildfires depending on the season, scale, and location. • Claim expiry dates range from February 2025 to November 2026. Exploration done by other parties • Acknowledgment and appraisal of exploration by other parties. • No core assay results from other parties are disclosed herein. • The most recent independent Property review was a technical report titled ""NI 43-101 Technical Report, Mineral Resource Estimate for the CV5 Pegmatite, Corvette Property, James Bay Region, Québec, Canada"", by Todd McCracken, P.Geo., of BBA Engineering Ltd., and Ryan Cunningham, M.Eng., P.Eng., of Primero Group Americas Inc., Effective Date of June 25, 2023, and Issue Date of September 8, 2023. Geology • Deposit type, geological setting and style of mineralization. • The Property overlies a large portion of the Lac Guyer Greenstone Belt, considered part of the larger La Grande River Greenstone Belt and is dominated by volcanic rocks metamorphosed to amphibolite facies. The claim block is dominantly host to rocks of the Guyer Group (amphibolite, iron formation, intermediate to mafic volcanics, peridotite, pyroxenite, komatiite, as well as felsic volcanics). The amphibolite rocks that trend east-west (generally steeply south dipping) through this region are bordered to the north by the Magin Formation (conglomerate and wacke) and to the south by an assemblage of tonalite, granodiorite, and diorite, in addition to metasediments of the Marbot Group (conglomerate, wacke). Several regional-scale Proterozoic gabbroic dykes also cut through portions of the Property (Lac Spirt Dykes, Senneterre Dykes). • The geological setting is prospective for gold, silver, base metals, platinum group elements, and lithium over several different deposit styles including orogenic gold (Au), volcanogenic massive sulfide (Cu, Au, Ag), komatiite-ultramafic (Au, Ag, PGE, Ni, Cu, Co), and pegmatite (Li, Ta). • Exploration of the Property has outlined three primary mineral exploration trends crossing dominantly east-west over large portions of the Property – Golden Trend (gold), Maven Trend (copper, gold, silver), and CV Trend (lithium, tantalum). The CV5 and CV13 spodumene pegmatites are situated within the CV Trend. Lithium mineralization at the Property, including at CV5, CV13, and CV9, is observed to occur within quartz-feldspar pegmatite, which may be exposed at surface as high relief 'whale-back' landforms. The pegmatite is often very coarse-grained and off-white in appearance, with darker sections commonly composed of mica and smoky quartz, and occasional tourmaline. • The lithium pegmatites at Corvette are categorized as LCT Pegmatites. Core assays and ongoing mineralogical studies, coupled with field mineral identification and assays, indicate spodumene as the dominant lithium-bearing mineral on the Property, with no significant petalite, lepidolite, lithium-phosphate minerals, or apatite present. The pegmatites also carry significant tantalum values with tantalite indicated to be the mineral phase. Drill hole Information • A summary of all information material to the understanding of the exploration results including a tabulation of the following information for all Material drill holes: o easting and northing of the drill hole collar o elevation or RL (Reduced Level – elevation above sea level in metres) of the drill hole collar o dip and azimuth of the hole o down hole length and interception depth o hole length. • If the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis that the information is not Material and this exclusion does not detract from the understanding of the report, the Competent Person should clearly explain why this is the case. • Drill hole attribute information is included in a table herein. • Pegmatite intersections of <2 m are not typically presented as they are considered insignificant. Data aggregation methods • In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques, maximum and/or minimum grade truncations (eg cutting of high grades) and cut-off grades are usually Material and should be stated. • Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high grade results and longer lengths of low grade results, the procedure used for such aggregation should be stated and some typical examples of such aggregations should be shown in detail. • The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values should be clearly stated. • Length weighted averages were used to calculate grade over width. • No specific grade cap or cut-off was used during grade width calculations. The lithium and tantalum length weighted average grade of the entire pegmatite interval is calculated for all pegmatite intervals over 2 m core length, as well as higher grade zones at the discretion of the geologist. Pegmatites have inconsistent mineralization by nature, resulting in some intervals having a small number of poorly mineralized samples included in the calculation. Non-pegmatite internal dilution is limited to typically <3 m where relevant and intervals indicated when assays are reported. • No metal equivalents have been reported. Relationship between mineralization widths and intercept lengths • These relationships are particularly important in the reporting of Exploration Results. • If the geometry of the mineralization with respect to the drill hole angle is known, its nature should be reported. • If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there should be a clear statement to this effect (eg 'down hole length, true width not known'). • At CV5, geological modelling is ongoing on a hole-by-hole basis and as assays are received. However, current interpretation supports a principal, large pegmatite body of near vertical to steeply dipping orientation, flanked by several subordinate pegmatite lenses (collectively, the 'CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite') • At CV13, geological modelling is ongoing on a hole-by-hole basis and as assays are received. However, current interpretation supports an upper and lower pegmatite body, each trending sub-parallel to each other with a shallow northerly dip (collectively, the 'CV13 Spodumene Pegmatite') • At CV9, geological modelling is ongoing on a hole-by-hole basis and as assays are received. However, current interpretation indicates CV9 is comprised of a single principal dyke, which outcrops at surface, has a steep northerly dip, and is moderately plunging to the east-southeast. A strike length of 450 m has been delineated through drilling and outcrop. • All reported widths are core length. True widths are not calculated for each hole due to the relatively wide drill spacing at this stage of delineation and the typical irregular nature of pegmatite, as well as the varied drill hole orientations. As such, true widths may vary widely from hole to hole. Diagrams • Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of intercepts should be included for any significant discovery being reported These should include, but not be limited to a plan view of drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views. • Please refer to the figures included herein as well as those posted on the Company's website. Balanced reporting • Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not practicable, representative reporting of both low and high grades and/or widths should be practiced to avoid misleading reporting of Exploration Results. • Please refer to the table(s) included herein as well as those posted on the Company's website. • Results for pegmatite intervals <2 m are not reported. Other substantive exploration data • Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be reported including (but not limited to): geological observations; geophysical survey results; geochemical survey results; bulk samples – size and method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics; potential deleterious or contaminating substances. • The Company is currently completing site environmental work over the CV5 and CV13 pegmatite area. No endangered flora or fauna have been documented over the Property to date, and several sites have been identified as potentially suitable for mine infrastructure. • The Company has completed a bathymetric survey over the shallow glacial lake which overlies a portion of the CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite. The lake depth ranges from <2 m to approximately 18 m, although the majority of the CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite, as delineated to date, is overlain by typically <2 to 10 m of water. • The Company has completed preliminary metallurgical testing comprised of HLS and magnetic testing, which has produced 6+% Li2O spodumene concentrates at >70% recovery on both CV5 and CV13 pegmatite material, indicating DMS as a viable primary process approach, and that both CV5 and CV13 could potentially feed the same process plant. A DMS test on CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite material returned a spodumene concentrate grading 5.8% Li2O at 79% recovery, strongly indicating potential for a DMS only operation to be applicable. • Various mandates required for advancing the Project towards economic studies have been initiated, including but not limited to, environmental baseline, metallurgy, geomechanics, hydrogeology, hydrology, stakeholder engagement, geochemical characterization, as well as transportation and logistical studies. Further work • The nature and scale of planned further work (eg tests for lateral extensions or depth extensions or large-scale step-out drilling). • Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible extensions, including the main geological interpretations and future drilling areas, provided this information is not commercially sensitive. • The Company intends to continue drilling the pegmatites of the Corvette Property, focused on the CV5 Pegmatite and adjacent subordinate lenses, as well as the CV13 Pegmatite. A follow-up drill program at the CV9 Spodumene Pegmatite is also anticipated.

Energy Sector Analyst The Final Investment Decision (FID) for the Marsa LNG project carries strategic significance. It secures TotalEnergies' presence in the LNG market and strengthens its integration across the value chain, from upstream gas production to LNG liquefaction and ultimately providing an LNG bunkering solution. The project's alignment with greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction goals through the use of 100% renewable power is particularly notable. It marks a shift towards cleaner energy practices in the industry, potentially setting a new benchmark for emissions intensity in LNG plants. This foresight may give TotalEnergies a competitive edge in a market increasingly sensitive to environmental impact. The long-term off-take agreement with Oman LNG ensures a stable revenue stream, reinforcing TotalEnergies' position within the global LNG market rankings. Investors should monitor the project's progress and the broader implications for the LNG market's supply dynamics and pricing. Renewable Energy Expert TotalEnergies' investment in a 300 MWp solar project as part of the integrated Marsa LNG project signifies an important precedent for renewable energy integration within the oil and gas sector. The solar plant is anticipated to offset the annual power consumption of the Marsa LNG plant, positioning it as a low-carbon energy source. This demonstrates a strategic move towards sustainable operations and can be seen as aligning with global carbon reduction commitments. For investors, this integration could signal long-term cost savings on energy, hedging against volatile fossil fuel prices and potentially providing a more compelling corporate sustainability profile that could attract socially responsible investment. Environmental Policy Analyst The environmental implications of the Marsa LNG project are noteworthy. By positioning the new LNG plant to have a GHG intensity below 3 kg CO2e/boe, TotalEnergies is responding to increasingly stringent global environmental standards and consumer demands for cleaner energy. This development could influence policy discussions around the role of natural gas as a transition fuel. Moreover, the LNG produced is intended for marine fuel markets, aligning with international maritime regulations aiming to reduce emissions from shipping. For investors, this may indicate forward-looking compliance with expected regulatory tightening and could represent a reputational advantage in the energy transition narrative. 04/22/2024 - 02:48 AM PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News: During a visit in Muscat on April 21st, Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies (Paris:TTE) (LSE:TTE) (NYSE:TTE) met with His Majesty Sultan Haitham bin Tariq Al Said and His Excellency Eng. Salim bin Nasser Al Aufi, Minister of Energy & Minerals, to reaffirm the long-term partnership between TotalEnergies and the Sultanate of Oman. On the occasion of this visit, Patrick Pouyanné and Mr. Mulham Basheer Al Jarf, Chairman of OQ, the Oman National Oil Company, announced the Final Investment Decision (FID) of the Marsa LNG project. TotalEnergies had signed a Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA) with Oman LNG to offtake 0.8 Mtpa of LNG for ten years from 2025, making the Company one of the main offtaker of Oman LNG's production. Finally, TotalEnergies (49%) and OQ Alternative Energy (51%), the national renewable energy champion, have confirmed being at an advanced stage of discussions to jointly develop a portfolio of up to 800 MW, including the 300 MWp solar project that will supply Marsa LNG Marsa LNG, an innovative integrated project Through their joint company Marsa Liquefied Natural Gas (“Marsa”), TotalEnergies (80%) and OQ (20%) launch the integrated Marsa LNG project which combines: upstream gas production: 150 Mcf/d of natural gas, coming from the 33.19% interest held by Marsa in the Mabrouk North-East field on onshore Block 10, which will provide the required feedstock for the LNG plant. Block 10 production started in January 2023 and reached plateau in April 2024. The FID allows Marsa LNG to extend its rights in Block 10 until its term in 2050. downstream gas liquefaction: a 1 Mt/y capacity LNG liquefaction plant will be built in the port of Sohar. The LNG production is expected to start by first quarter 2028 and is primarily intended to serve the marine fuel market (LNG bunkering) in the Gulf. LNG quantities not sold as bunker fuel will be off-taken by TotalEnergies (80%) and OQ (20%). renewable power generation: a dedicated 300 MWp PV solar plant will be built to cover 100% of the annual power consumption of the LNG plant, allowing a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Setting very low carbon intensity standards for the next generation of LNG plants The Marsa LNG plant will be 100% electrically driven and supplied with solar power, positioning the site as one of the lowest GHG emissions intensity LNG plants ever built worldwide, with a GHG intensity below 3 kg CO2e/boe. (for reference, the average emission intensity of LNG plants is around 35 kg CO2e/boe - this represents a reduction in emissions of more than 90%). The main Engineering, Procurement and Construction contracts have been awarded to Technip Energies for the LNG plant and to CB&I for the 165,000 m3 LNG tank. The Marsa LNG project will generate long-term employment opportunities and significant socio-economic benefits for the city of Sohar and the region. The first LNG bunkering hub in the Middle East The ambition of the Marsa LNG project is to serve as the first LNG bunkering hub in the Middle East, showcasing an available and competitive alternative marine fuel to reduce the shipping industry's emissions. Compared to conventional marine fuel, LNG helps to cut: Greenhouse gas emissions by up to 23%, Nitrogen oxide emissions by up to 85%. Sulfur emissions by 99%, Fine particle emissions by 99%. “We are proud to open a new chapter in our history in the Sultanate of Oman with the launch of the Marsa LNG project, together with our partner OQ, demonstrating our long-term commitment to the country. We are especially pleased to deploy the two pillars of our transition strategy, LNG and renewables, and thus support the Sultanate on a new scale in the sustainable development of its energy resources”, said Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies. “This very innovative project illustrates our pioneer spirit and showcases the relevance of our integrated multi-energy strategy, with the ambition of being a responsible player in the energy transition. By paving the way for the next generation of very low emission LNG plants, Marsa LNG is contributing to making gas a long-term transition energy.” *** TotalEnergies in Oman TotalEnergies has been present in Oman since 1937. In the first quarter 2024, TotalEnergies’ production in Oman was 61 kboe/d. TotalEnergies produces oil in Block 6 (4%), natural gas in Block 10 (26.55% via Marsa LNG LLC) as well as LNG through its participation in the Oman LNG (5.54%)/Qalhat LNG (2.04% via Oman LNG) liquefaction complex with an overall capacity of 11.4 Mtpa. TotalEnergies is currently conducting exploration activities in Block 12 (50%, operator), and is appraising Block 11 (22.5%). TotalEnergies also contributes to the development of renewables in the country, such as the largest solar photovoltaic system built to provide power for a desalination plant in Oman (17 MWp – 30,000 MWh/y), in a joint-venture with Veolia, which began commercial operation in April 2023. TotalEnergies, the world’s third largest LNG player TotalEnergies is the world’s third largest LNG player with a global portfolio of 44 Mt/y in 2023 thanks to its interests in liquefaction plants in all geographies. The Company benefits from an integrated position across the LNG value chain, including production, transportation, access to more than 20 Mt/y of regasification capacity in Europe, trading, and LNG bunkering. TotalEnergies’ ambition is to increase the share of natural gas in its sales mix to close to 50% by 2030, to reduce carbon emissions and eliminate methane emissions associated with the gas value chain, and to work with local partners to promote the transition from coal to natural gas. TotalEnergies supports the role of LNG in shipping’s energy transition Marine LNG sharply reduces emissions from ships and significantly improves air quality, in particular when at berth, for the benefit of port cities and communities in coastal areas. Used as a marine fuel, LNG helps to cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 23% compared to conventional marine fuel and has the potential to reduce emissions significantly more if bio or synthetic LNG is used. As such, marine LNG is a sustainable, affordable and immediately available way of reducing emissions in the shipping sector. TotalEnergies has actively invested in LNG bunkering infrastructure, critical to supporting its shipping customers' adoption of LNG as a marine fuel. The Company currently deploys three LNG bunker vessels: the Gas Agility at the Port of Rotterdam, Netherlands, the Gas Vitality at the Port of Marseille-Fos, France, and the Brassavola at the Port of Singapore.

The new family consists of the BG22E, MG22E, and FG22E. As Silicon Labs' most energy-efficient SoCs to date, all three SoCs will enable IoT device makers to build high-performance, Bluetooth Low Energy (LE), 802.15.4-based, or Sub-Ghz wireless devices for battery-optimized and battery-free devices that can harvest energy from external sources in their environments like indoor or outdoor ambient light, ambient radio waves, and kinetic motion. To help device manufacturers build a complete energy harvesting solution, Silicon Labs is also announcing their partnership with e-peas, a provider of industry-leading Power Managed Integrated Circuits (PMICs) designed for energy harvesting. Through this partnership, Silicon Labs and e-peas co-developed two energy harvesting shields for Silicon Labs' new, energy-optimized xG22E Explorer Kit. To better develop within the tight constraints that energy harvesting requires, the new xG22E Explorer Kit allows developers to customize the peripherals and debugging options that best match their application and get highly accurate measurements to better build their applications and devices with the energy harvesting shields. The energy harvesting shields are each tuned and optimized for different energy sources and energy storage technologies. They are custom-fit to slot onto the Explorer Kit. Notably, one of the shields uses e-peas' latest AEM13920 dual-harvester, which allows it to pull energy simultaneously from two distinct energy sources, like indoor or outdoor light, thermal gradients, and electromagnetic waves without sacrificing on energy conversion efficiency. The second co-developed shield is based on e-peas' AEM00300 shield, and is dedicated to harvesting power from random pulsed energy sources. ""As the market for energy harvesting and low-power solutions grows, Silicon Labs remains dedicated to enhancing our wireless MCU and radio stack capabilities to advance the development of battery-free IoT solutions,"" said Ross Sabolcik, Senior Vice President for the Industrial and Commercial Business Unit at Silicon Labs. ""Our efforts to prioritize energy efficiency and increase device longevity underscore our commitment to fostering a more sustainable IoT ecosystem."" xG22E Designed to Address Energy Efficiency Challenges for the IoTThe evolution and widespread deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) faces a significant challenge related to powering low-complexity, small-form-factor devices. Traditional sources like mains power or batteries pose scalability and maintenance issues. The emergence of the Ambient IoT addresses this challenge by introducing a class of connected devices primarily powered through energy harvesting from ambient sources like radio waves, light, motion, and heat. Silicon Labs aims to build a device that can address one of the significant challenges in Ambient IoT: creating a platform that can optimize its energy consumption and prolong its lifespan. The xG22E family comes equipped with several features designed to minimize energy use and make it the platform of choice for energy harvesting, including: Ultra-fast, low-energy cold start for applications starting from a zero-energy state to transmit packets and then rapidly return to sleep. An xG22E device wakes up in only eight milliseconds and uses only 150 micro-Joules, or roughly 0.003% of the energy needed to power a 60-watt equivalent LED lightbulb for one second.Energy conserving deep sleep swift wake-up reduces wake-up energy by 78% compared to other Silicon Labs devices.Power-efficient energy mode transition to smoothly transition in and out of energy modes by mitigating current spikes or inrush, which can harm energy storage capacity.Multiple deep sleep wake-up options, such as RFSense, GPIO, and RTC wake-up sources from the deepest EM4 sleep mode, are ideal for extended storage.Energy Harvesting Applications Enable a More Sustainable IoTEnergy harvesting and conservation technologies offer significant benefits across industries, including reduced energy costs, elimination of battery dependence, and reduced operational carbon footprint by changing energy consumption sources and minimizing battery waste. It also complements many existing IoT applications. For example, electronic shelf labels are being rapidly adopted by retailers across the globe to allow for more accurate pricing, inventory management, and even loss prevention. However, with a single location having as many as thousands of labels, they require a lot of batteries. Fortunately, electronic shelf labels do not need a lot of power, nor do they require always-on connectivity, making them an excellent fit for energy harvesting. By using Ambient IoT energy sources, retailers can reduce or eliminate their need for batteries for shelf labels. Other examples in the consumer space include television remote controls that use solar energy and movable, wireless light or appliance switches. Silicon Labs actively supports companies developing successful low-power devices and pursuing battery-free designs, fostering an environmentally sustainable leadership within their respective fields.

Positive The next-generation pancreatic cancer test by Immunovia achieved a specificity of 98% and a sensitivity of 75% in detecting early-stage pancreatic cancer. The test outperformed CA19-9, the commonly used biomarker, making it significantly more accurate. The new test includes high-performing protein biomarkers, reducing reliance on CA19-9 and providing definitive positive or negative results for all patients. The results confirm the technical advancement of the next-generation test over Immunovia's first-generation test, IMMray PanCan-d. The new test overcomes the limitations of the first-generation test, allowing for testing in patients who do not produce CA19-9, including those of African ancestry. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst Immunovia's advancement from IMMray PanCan-d to its next-generation pancreatic cancer detection test holds substantial promise, particularly given the reported specificity of 98% and sensitivity of 75% for early-stage pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The enhancement in performance metrics not only signifies a potential breakthrough in oncology diagnostics but could also have meaningful implications for the company's market position. The inclusion of high-performing protein biomarkers that reduce reliance on CA19-9 is a strategic development, considering the limitations faced by a subset of patients unable to produce this biomarker.From an investor's perspective, this innovation might translate into an increased addressable market and potential revenue growth. Moreover, the absence of indeterminate results could bolster the test's clinical utility and adoption rate. As Immunovia moves closer to potential commercialization, it’s important for investors to consider the regulatory pathways and insurance reimbursements, which serve as critical factors for market penetration and ultimately impact the stock's performance. Oncology Doctor The next-generation test's ability to detect early-stage PDAC with such precision is a laudable milestone in oncological care. Sensitivity and specificity are cornerstone parameters in the effectiveness of any diagnostic tool. With a 75% sensitivity, the test is indicative of robust early-detection capabilities, which might lead to timelier interventions and potentially improve patient survival rates. This development is particularly significant for those with genetic predispositions or belonging to demographics traditionally challenged by existing tests, such as patients of African ancestry.Equipping clinicians with this test could reshape the diagnostic landscape for pancreatic cancer, traditionally fraught with late detection. As understanding deepens about the economic burden of late-stage cancer care versus early intervention, the value proposition of such a test can extend beyond patient outcomes and influence healthcare cost dynamics. This potential paradigm shift could be a pivotal consideration for investors gauging the long-term trajectory of Immunovia's stock. Financial Analyst Immunovia's announcement is indicative of a strategic move that could disrupt the current standard of care for pancreatic cancer and create a significant market opportunity. Beyond the biomedical implications, the financials of the diagnostics market are driven by product adoption, competitive advantage and the reimbursement environment.Investors should monitor the company's pipeline progress, engagement with the FDA for approval and strategies for health insurance coverage. These factors will influence the time-to-market and the financial impact. Typically, a product that addresses unmet medical needs and shows superiority over existing options, like the traditional CA19-9, tends to be well-positioned for market adoption, which could positively influence the company's valuation. While early in its commercialization journey, this product could be a catalyst for future earnings inflections, particularly if adoption rates and pricing strategies align with market expectations. 04/22/2024 - 02:49 AM LUND, Sweden, April 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Immunovia (NASDAQ Stockholm: IMMNOV), the diagnostics company with the mission to increase pancreatic cancer survival through early detection, today announces its next-generation pancreatic cancer test achieved both the primary and secondary endpoints in a model-development study. In the study, Immunovia's next-generation test demonstrated specificity of 98 percent and sensitivity of 75 percent in detecting early stage (1 and 2) pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a very aggressive and the most common form of pancreatic cancer. The Immunovia test was also significantly more accurate than CA19-9, the biomarker commonly used to detect pancreatic cancer. Importantly, these results confirm the technical advancement of the next-generation test over Immunovia's first-generation test, IMMray PanCan-d. The next-generation test includes high-performing protein biomarkers, making the test less reliant on CA19-9. This is a major achievement as around 10 percent of patients, including many patients of African ancestry, do not produce CA19-9, so the IMMray PanCan-d test could not be used in those patients. The results with the new test were achieved including PDAC patients with low CA19-9 values. Furthermore, the new test does not provide indeterminate or ""borderline"" results; all patients are classified as positive or negative for pancreatic cancer. With the first-generation Immunovia test, IMMray PanCan-d, about 10 percent of patients received a test result of ""borderline"", creating indecision for clinicians. The next-generation test is now established on a broadly used ELISA platform, resulting in more precise protein measurement, faster testing, and lower cost of goods sold. ""Pancreatic cancer is a brutal and lethal cancer. People at risk for pancreatic cancer need a simple, fast, and easy blood test to detect cancer early. We are very excited about the potential of our test to meet this need and increase survival rates for these patients,"" says Jeff Borcherding, CEO and President of Immunovia. The model development study was designed to select the highest performing biomarkers to include in the next-generation test, to define the algorithm to produce a diagnostic result, and to provide an initial assessment of the test's clinical performance. The study included 481 blood samples from the U.S. and Europe. Of these, 133 were samples from patients with stage 1 or 2 PDAC. The 348 control samples represented a wide range of subjects, including people at high-risk for hereditary and familial pancreatic cancer, diabetics, patients with benign pancreatic lesions worrisome for PDAC, and healthy individuals. Immunovia will now move to a second phase of the model development study, expected to be completed in 6 - 8 weeks, in which it will conduct additional statistical analyses to refine and assess the robustness of the test model. In addition, test performance will be evaluated in a more selective cohort of patients at high risk for pancreatic cancer. In the second and third quarters of 2024, Immunovia will perform several analytical validation steps to verify the accuracy and reproducibility of the protein biomarker measurements. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company will conduct a large clinical validation study to confirm the performance of the next-generation test, setting the stage for a U.S. launch in 2025. Immunovia estimates that there are at least 600,000 individuals in the U.S. at high risk of pancreatic cancer due to family history and genetic mutations. Many more are at risk due to other factors. The current standard of care for surveillance is annual imaging using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). High-risk individuals and clinicians at leading high-risk pancreatic cancer surveillance centers have expressed a very strong desire for a simple blood test to make surveillance faster, more convenient, and less invasive.

Market Research Analyst The acquisition between Quanex and Tyman signifies a strategic movement towards consolidation within the building products industry, which could lead to enhanced market presence and competitive edge. By combining product lines and leveraging Tyman's strong brand equity, Quanex may increase barriers to entry, potentially easing competitive pressures. Market analysts will be keen to monitor the integration process and how effectively Quanex can leverage Tyman's existing relationships to enhance cross-selling opportunities. Investors should be aware of execution risks during the integration phase, which could impact anticipated synergy realizations. Financial Analyst Quanex's acquisition of Tyman is projected to be immediately earnings accretive, enhancing shareholder value, with an expectation of cost synergies amounting to $30 million annually, post-integration. It's important to note that M&A activities often entail upfront costs before cost-saving synergies can be realized. A combined revenue of approximately $2 billion and an EBITDA margin improvement constitute a solid financial rationale, assuming successful synergy execution. The deal's financing is secured, which alleviates concerns about potential capital raising activities that could dilute existing shareholders. A modest net leverage post-acquisition suggests a conservative approach to financing this deal, which is favorable for risk-averse investors. Legal Expert The terms of the acquisition are set within a robust legal framework, adhering to the UK Takeover Code. For investors, it is important to recognize the importance of regulatory approvals and shareholder assent in such cross-border transactions, which could influence the timeline and successful conclusion of the deal. The irrevocable undertaking by Teleios, a major shareholder of Tyman, offers a degree of certainty regarding shareholder approval. Investors should, however, keep an eye on any potential antitrust considerations and closing conditions that could pose hurdles to finalizing the acquisition. 04/22/2024 - 02:07 AM Acquisition Accelerates Quanex’s “BIGGER” Strategic Roadmap, Expanding Quanex’s Product Offering with Addition of Tyman’s Complementary Portfolio Significantly Enhances Scale and Global Reach, Positioning Combined Company for Profitable Growth and Value Creation Delivers Material EPS Accretion in First Fiscal Year Post Close; Approximately $30 Million in Annual Run-Rate Cost Synergies Anticipated Investor Conference Call Scheduled for Today at 8:30 a.m. ET / 7:30 a.m. CT / 1:30 p.m. BST HOUSTON, April 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Quanex Building Products Corporation (NYSE:NX) (“Quanex” or the “Company”) today announced it has reached agreement with Tyman plc (LSE:TYMN) (“Tyman”) on the terms of a recommended cash and share offer (“the Acquisition”), under which Quanex will acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Tyman for approximately $1.1 billion1 in enterprise value.

Forward Looking Statements This document contains “forward-looking statements”. These statements are based on the current expectations of the management of Quanex and/or Tyman and are naturally subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. The forward-looking statements contained in this document include statements relating to the expected effects of the Acquisition on Tyman and/or Quanex, the expected timing and scope of the Acquisition, and other statements other than historical facts. Forward-looking statements include statements typically containing words such as “will”, “may”, “should”, “believe”, “intends”, “expects”, “anticipates”, “targets”, “estimates” and words of similar import and including statements relating to future capital expenditures, expenses, revenues, economic performance, financial conditions, dividend policy, losses and future prospects and business and management strategies and the expansion and growth of the operations of Quanex or Tyman. Although Tyman and/or Quanex believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, Tyman and/or Quanex can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. There are a number of factors that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. These factors include: the possibility that the Acquisition will not be completed on a timely basis or at all, whether due to the failure to satisfy the conditions of the Acquisition (including approvals or clearances from regulatory and other agencies and bodies) or otherwise, general business and economic conditions globally, industry trends, competition, changes in government and other regulation, changes in political and economic stability, disruptions in business operations due to reorganization activities, interest rate and currency fluctuations, the inability of the combined company to realize successfully any anticipated synergy benefits when (and if) the Acquisition is implemented, the inability of the combined company to integrate successfully Quanex’s and Tyman’s operations when (and if) the Acquisition is implemented and the combined company incurring and/or experiencing unanticipated costs and/or delays or difficulties relating to the Acquisition when (and if) it is implemented. Additional information concerning these and other risk factors is contained in the Risk Factors sections of Quanex’s most recent reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, the contents of which are not incorporated by reference into, nor do they form part of, this press release. These forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding the present and future business strategies of such persons and the environment in which each will operate in the future. By their nature, these forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, as well as uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. The factors described in the context of such forward-looking statements in this press release may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of any such person, or industry results and developments, to be materially different from any results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. No assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct and persons reading this press release are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as at the date of this press release. All subsequent oral or written forward-looking statements attributable to Quanex or Tyman or any persons acting on their behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statement above. Neither of Quanex or Tyman undertakes any obligation to update publicly or revise forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent required by applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rules. No Profit Forecasts or Estimates No statement in this press release is intended as a profit forecast or estimate for any period and no statement in this press release should be interpreted to mean that earnings or earnings per share for Quanex or Tyman, as appropriate, for the current or future fiscal years would necessarily match or exceed the historical published earnings or earnings per share for Quanex or Tyman, as appropriate.

Rounding Certain figures included in this press release have been subjected to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, figures shown for the same category presented in different tables may vary slightly and figures shown as totals in certain tables may not be an arithmetic aggregation of the figures that precede them. The directors of Quanex accept responsibility for the information contained in this presentation which relates to Quanex. To the best of the knowledge and belief of Quanex’s directors (who have taken all reasonable care to ensure that such is the case), the information contained in this presentation is in accordance with the facts and does not omit anything likely to affect the import of such information. This document contains statements of estimated cost savings and synergies (together, the “Quantified Financial Benefits Statement”) arising from the Acquisition. A copy of the Quantified Financial Benefits Statement is set out below: The Quanex Directors, having reviewed and analyzed the potential cost synergies of the Transaction, and taking into account the factors they can influence, believe that the Enlarged Group can deliver approximately $30 million of pre-tax recurring cost synergies on an annual run-rate basis, expected to be realized by the end of the second full year following completion of the Transaction. The quantified cost synergies, which are expected to originate from the cost bases of both Quanex and Tyman, are expected to be realized primarily from: approximately 30 per cent. in corporate and listing related costs, generated from de-duplication and rationalization of public company costs and of executive leadership; approximately 30 per cent. in procurement savings from scale economies and consolidation of overlapping spend categories; andapproximately 40 per cent. in savings from consolidation and de-duplication of overlapping administrative and commercial functions and activities. The Quanex Directors expect approximately 50 per cent. of these cost synergies to be achieved by the end of the first 12-month period following completion of the Transaction and the full run-rate by the second anniversary of completion of the Transaction. The Quanex Directors estimate that the realization of the identified cost synergies will result in one-off costs to achieve of approximately $35 million in aggregate over the first two years post completion of the Transaction. Potential areas of dis-synergy expected to arise in connection with the Transaction have been considered and were determined by the Quanex Directors to be immaterial for the analysis. The identified cost synergies will occur as a direct result of the success of the Transaction and would not be achieved on a standalone basis. The identified cost synergies reflect both the beneficial elements and relevant costs. Bases of Belief and Principal Assumptions for the Quantified Financial Benefits Statement In preparing the Quantified Financial Benefits Statement, Tyman has provided Quanex with certain operating and financial information to facilitate a detailed analysis in support of evaluating the potential synergies available from the Transaction. Where possible, estimated benefits and costs have been calculated on a bottom-up basis. In circumstances where data has been limited for commercial, regulatory, or other reasons, Quanex management has made estimates and assumptions to aid its development of individual synergy initiatives. The assessment and quantification of the potential synergies have, in turn, been informed by the Quanex management’s industry experience and knowledge of the existing businesses, together with consultation with Tyman. The synergy assumptions have been risk-adjusted. The cost bases used as the basis for the Quantified Financial Benefits Statement are Quanex last twelve months to 31 January 2024 (with adjustments made to reflect non-recurring items) and manpower costs and headcount data as of 25 March 2024, and Tyman audited financial results and headcount data for the year ending 31 December 2023 (with adjustments made to reflect non-recurring items and expected future changes in certain costs). In arriving at the Quantified Financial Benefits Statement, the Quanex Directors have assumed: No material change to macroeconomic, political, legal, or regulatory conditions in the markets or regions in which Quanex and Tyman operate;No material change in accounting standards;No material change in the underlying operations of either business from the Transaction;No material impact from divestments from either the Quanex or Tyman existing businesses;No material change in tax legislation, tax rates, or other legislation in the UK or US that could materially impact the ability to achieve any benefits;No material change in current foreign exchange rates;Foreign exchange conversions based on 3 April 2024 spot rates;The Enlarged Group will be publicly listed in the United States. In addition, the Quanex Directors have assumed that the cost synergies are substantively within Quanex’s control, albeit that certain elements are dependent in part on negotiations with third parties. Reports As required by Rule 28.1(a) of the Takeover Code, KPMG, as reporting accountants to Quanex, and UBS AG, London Branch, as financial adviser to Quanex, have provided the reports required under that Rule. Copies of these reports are included in the announcement made by Quanex Building Products Corporation and Tyman plc on or about the date of this document. Notes The Quantified Financial Benefits Statement relates to future actions and circumstances which, by their nature, involve risks, uncertainties and contingencies. In addition, due to the scale of the Enlarged Group, there may be additional changes to the Enlarged Group’s operations. As a result, the estimated synergies referred to may not be achieved, or may be achieved later or sooner than estimated, or those achieved could be materially different from those estimated. The Quantified Financial Benefits Statement should not be construed as a profit forecast or interpreted to mean that Quanex’s earnings in the first full year following completion of the Acquisition, or in any subsequent period, will necessarily match or be greater than or be less than those of Quanex or Tyman for the relevant preceding financial period or any other period. For the purposes of Rule 28 of the Takeover Code, the Quantified Financial Benefits Statement is the responsibility of Quanex and the Quanex Directors.

Negative None. 04/22/2024 - 01:54 AM STAVANGER, Norway, April 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Aker BP (OSE: AKRBP) (OTCQX: AKRBF) (OTCQX: AKRBY) is pleased to announce that production has started from Hanz in the North Sea. Hanz is operated by Aker BP, with Equinor and Sval Energy as partners. Hanz is a subsea field development tied into the Ivar Aasen platform about fifteen kilometres further south. Total investments are estimated at close to NOK 5 billion and total reserves are around 20 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe). ""This is yet another great example of what we can achieve working as one team with our suppliers towards a common goal and with shared incentives. In addition, innovative solutions with reuse of infrastructure and use of cross-flow well have contributed to lower costs and lower emissions,"" says Aker BP CEO, Karl Johnny Hersvik. ""Development of the Hanz discovery is important for the development of the Ivar Aasen area. Production start from Hanz in 2024 will help us maintain good production from the Ivar Aasen platform,"" Hersvik adds. Unique re-use of infrastructure and use of a cross-flow well Hanz was discovered in 1997. After the delivery of the Plan for development and operation (PDO) for the Ivar Aasen area, which included the Hanz development, the project matured an optimised development solution by re-using subsea production systems (SPS) from the Jette field. It is the first time that production equipment has been re-used in a new field development on the NCS. In addition, the strategy for how the oil and gas is to be recovered was changed to include use of a cross-flow well for water injection. This results in a substantial reduction of power consumption, less use of chemicals and less equipment on the seabed. ""This development solution will be more cost-efficient and have a smaller environmental footprint than originally planned for. This is in line with Aker BP's continuous search for improvements, where the goal is to produce with low costs and low emissions,"" says VP Projects Edvard Grieg and Ivar Aasen, Stine Kongshaug McIntosh. The change in the development solution for Hanz since the original PDO was submitted led the partnership to send a formal statement regarding the investment decision and the selected concept to the authorities in December 2021. Minimised CO2 emissions The Ivar Aasen field is located on the Utsira High in the northern part of the North Sea, around 175 km west of Karmøy. The field was discovered in 2008, and was joined with other discoveries in the area, including Hanz, which was proven in 1997. The first oil from Ivar Aasen was produced on 24 December 2016. Ivar Aasen receives power from the Edvard Grieg platform ten kilometres to the southeast. From 2022, the field will receive power from shore via the Johan Sverdrup field, thereby minimising CO2 emissions.
