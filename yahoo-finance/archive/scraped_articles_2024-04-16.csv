Yahoo Finance,Tesla stock slides as Musk pushes deeper into robotaxis,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-slides-as-musk-pushes-deeper-into-robotaxis-174408390.html,"Tesla stock slipped again on Tuesday, with shares now down nearly 9% since yesterday after the company announced a “more than 10%” staff reduction.","Tesla (TSLA) stock slipped again on Tuesday, with shares now down nearly 9% since yesterday when the company announced a ""more than 10%"" staff reduction. This follows new revelations of deeper cuts to certain divisions in the company that point to a riskier bet by CEO Elon Musk on robotaxis and autonomous software.While Musk said in a memo that the “duplication of roles and job functions in certain areas” due to rapid growth necessitated the layoffs, later reports from Tesla sources suggested the cuts were well over 10% and hit certain divisions harder. Reuters reported “heavy layoffs” in Tesla’s service center division, China sales team staff, and of at least 140 engineers in the US.EV blog Electrek reported that Tesla used the latest round of layoffs to dispatch several projects that Musk was no longer in favor of, including the lower-cost next-gen EV.Musk shut down a project known internally as “NV9,” which aimed to build a $25,000 next-gen EV — which some have dubbed the “Model 2” — at Giga Austin. “Instead, Musk asked for all resources to go into the Robotaxi program and, specifically, a new data center to be built in an ongoing expansion at the factory,” Electrek said.Concurrently, Tesla is building another data center, powered by its Dojo supercomputers, in New York to ramp up its AI efforts for developing its self-driving software, which would be the software backbone of the Tesla robotaxis.The departure of longtime Tesla exec Drew Baglino also indicates a pivot. As senior vice president of powertrain and energy engineering, Baglino led huge projects at Tesla, including the ""4680"" battery cell production and cathode facility at Giga Austin, Electrek said. Baglino likely had a hand in the development of the Model 2 as well.“Baglino is an absolute gut punch loss in our view as he was instrumental in the powertrain and energy initiatives at Tesla and was viewed by many as key to the Model 2 initiative over the next few years,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to investors, adding that the Baglino departure was “very unexpected.”Elon Musk and Drew Baglino at Tesla Investor Day (Tesla)Investors and analysts believed part of Tesla's big growth story would be its long-rumored next-gen vehicle that would start at around $25,000; however, reports last week suggested Tesla had canceled the vehicle. Musk responded to the report claiming it was false and revealed that a Tesla robotaxi debut would be coming on Aug. 8, though he did not officially address the status of the $25,000 next-gen vehicle. If new reporting is correct, the cheaper next-gen vehicle has been canceled, or at least delayed indefinitely.Story continuesFurthermore, Tesla recently cut the subscription price for its Full-Self Driving (FSD) software in its cars by half to $99 a month and started offering a 30-day free trial of FSD for new buyers, suggesting that Musk and Tesla want to showcase and increase the user base of its self-driving software.For Wall Street analysts, the focus on robotaxis and FSD to power the future growth of the company comes at considerable risk.“If Tesla were to confirm that its renewed robotaxi focus comes at the expense of Model 2, we believe this would introduce considerably higher risk profile for the stock, and remove a key reason many shareholders currently own it,” Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner wrote in a note to investors. “More critically, this change in strategy would also make any upside from here tied to Tesla cracking the code on full driverless autonomy, which represents a significant technological and regulatory challenge.”Tesla FSD beta in use (Tesla YouTube video) (Tesla YouTube page)Tesla’s focus on robotaxis and fully autonomous driving at the expense of near-term projects like the cheaper next-gen vehicle is a concern for Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas, even though his long-term bull thesis on the stock relies on Tesla solving the robotaxi and self-driving puzzle.“We anticipate it may be difficult for Tesla to convince investors of the ability to achieve commercial scale [for robotaxis] under a timeline relevant to most investors,” Jonas wrote in a note last week following Musk’s announcement of the robotaxi reveal. He added that he was also “concerned at the margin of the level of enthusiasm amongst some investors around the improvements of the FSD v12.”Despite this, over the long term, Jonas believes that business units like “Tesla Mobility” and “Tesla Network Services,” which include rideshare, robotaxis, and self-driving, among other initiatives, account for $165 of Morgan Stanley’s $310 price target, whereas the core automotive business is worth only $62.Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX), which touched 2024 highs on Monday, climbed about 3 basis points to trade around 4.66% on Tuesday.Meanwhile, earnings reports flooded in before the bell.

Friday and Monday’s market action brought the largest two day-decline in the S&P 500, 2.6%, in more than year.Truist Co-CIO Keith Lerner pointed out in a note to clients on Monday night that the pullback seen recently in the market is to be expected in any given year.“Periodic pullbacks are the admission price to the market,” Lerner wrote.The S&P 500's 4% intra-year fall in 2024 is still a far cry from the average 14% drawdown seen over the last forty years, per Lerner's analysis. And given this, the market's current direction could get worse before it gets better.“Our view remains that the primary stock market trend remains positive,” Lerner wrote. “We continue to expect a bumpier path forward relative to the abnormally-smooth first quarter ride.”Tue, April 16, 2024 at 11:50 AM PDTDani Romero'Interest rate volatility' could hit homebuilder forecasts this earnings season: UBSUncertainty over when the Fed will raise interest rates could hit homebuilders' outlooks in the upcoming earnings season, according to UBS analysts.“We expect solid 1Q homebuilder financial results, with upbeat industry demand commentary from management teams, consistent with Lennar (LEN) and KB Home (KBH),” John Lovallo, UBS analyst, wrote in a note to clients Tuesday morning. But he noted that ""interest rate volatility/uncertainty remains heightened, exacerbated by last week's CPI, which could result in conservative homebuilder gross margin outlooks.""Builders have been offering incentives like mortgage rate buydowns to sell homes in the high interest rate environment. Such deal sweeteners while effective hurt profit margins.The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has been hovering around 7% in recent weeks, a far cry from the below-5% rates that many homeowners are locked into already. That has kept more buyers and sellers on the sidelines.The prospect of the Federal Reserve’s rate cut looks murkier following recent higher than expected inflation prints, a factor likely to pressure builder stocks near term.As a result, UBS has been “ more cautious than consensus on '24/'25 homebuilding gross margins, although Street forecasts seem to have moderated to some extent,” Lovallo noted.DR Horton (DHI), the largest builder by market cap, is expected to report earnings before the market opens on Thursday.Tue, April 16, 2024 at 11:05 AM PDTAlexandra CanalPowell: Will take 'longer than expected' to reach confidence on inflation Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday it will likely take ""longer than expected"" for the central bank to be confident in its inflation fight, citing a ""lack of further progress"" this year when it comes to bringing inflation back down to the Fed's 2% target.Powell, who noted the US economy over the past year has been ""quite strong,"" pointed to hotter-than-expected inflation data over the past three months.“The recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence and instead indicate that it’s likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence,"" he said during a fireside chat with Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem in DC.The central bank leader suggested a higher-for-longer policy stance is here to stay, adding, ""We can maintain the current level of restriction for as long as needed.""Yields jumped on the heels of his comments with the 2-year note briefly touching above 5% — its highest level since November.

The index continued to hover at those levels on Tuesday.Citi's equity strategist Stuart Kaiser said the moves point to ""localized signs of stress"" in the market as rising yields continue to pressure stocks while investors also digest escalating tensions in the Middle East.Fundstrat head of research Tom Lee said the surging Vix means investors don't believe the worst is priced into stocks and to be extra cautious when buying any dip.""Investors are de-risking,"" he said in a video to subscribers uploaded early Tuesday.

Gold prices currently stand around $2,400 an ounce.A couple things from their note that caught my attention:On potential buying if gold prices pullback: ""We think gold is likely to remain on a strong footing as any profit-taking by early investors would be replaced by investment from those who have so far not participated in the move, but agree philosophically with its direction.""On the Fed's influence on gold: ""From an inflation and monetary policy standpoint, gold's strength stems from the ability to 'have it both ways' whereby inflation remains a significant concern, but at the same time, the FOMC judges rates as sufficiently restrictive and, hence, the next move (however much delayed) remains a cut.""Tue, April 16, 2024 at 9:59 AM PDTAlexandra CanalDow edges higherThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged higher in afternoon trading on Tuesday, up about 0.5%, as the index looked to snap a six-day losing streak.Both the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) reversed earlier losses to trade mostly flat.Meanwhile, bond yields remain at multi-month highs, with the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) climbing about 4 basis points to trade around 4.66%.Tue, April 16, 2024 at 9:07 AM PDTAlexandra CanalTrump Media stock tanks... againTrump Media & Technology Group (DJT), the parent company of Donald Trump's social media platform Truth Social, fell about 12% on Tuesday after the company announced it's launching a new live TV streaming platform.According to a press release, Trump Media will launch the live streaming service on phones, tablets, and TV through the Truth Social app.""The streaming content is expected to focus on live TV including news networks, religious channels, family-friendly content including films and documentaries; and other content that has been cancelled, is at risk of cancellation, or is being suppressed on other platforms and services,"" according to the release.Trump Media went public on the Nasdaq after merging with special purpose acquisition company Digital World Acquisition Corp. in a deal approved by shareholders late last month.

Single-family starts fell 12.4% month over month.According to LPL Financial’s chief economist, Jeffrey Roach, the data indicates how new home construction is ""starting to show cracks in the pace of growth.""“Housing construction is poised to slow as potential homebuyers indicate now is a poor time to buy a home. Investors should expect residential investment becoming a drag on GDP growth in the coming quarters. Housing activity may not fully stabilize until the Fed commences their easing cycle.""The fresh government data comes after builder sentiment in April was flat from the previous month, breaking four consecutive months of gains. The NAHB said, “Buyers are hesitating until they can better gauge where interest rates are headed.”“Looking ahead, we still think single-family starts stand to benefit from the lack of second-hand homes on the market, shifting demand to newbuilds,"" Thomas Ryan, property economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients following the release.""But that strength will be offset by weakness in multi-family starts, which we expect will remain around current levels, leaving total housing starts little higher than they currently are by the end of this year.""The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) was trading lower by more than 1% Tuesday morning.Tue, April 16, 2024 at 7:15 AM PDTAlexandra CanalLive Nation falls on antitrust probe reportShares of Live Nation (LYV), the parent company of Ticketmaster, fell about 7% early Tuesday after the Wall Street Journal reported the Department of Justice (DOJ) is preparing to file an antitrust lawsuit against the company as soon as next month.According to the report, the DOJ will allege that Live Nation has leveraged its dominance in the marketplace to harm competitors. The specific claims the department could allege are unknown at this time.The federal government approved the Live Nation-Ticketmaster merger in 2010. Since then, the company has been at the center of antitrust concerns, with critics taking aim at its sky-high ticket fees and accusing the entertainment giant of monopolistic practices and anti-competitive behavior.In 2020, the department updated the company's consent decree, an agreement that barred Live Nation from strong-arming venues into using TicketMaster for its tours, and extended it until 2025 after finding evidence the company repeatedly and over the course of several years engaged in conduct that violated its earlier agreement.In the face of Tuesday's stock declines, shares are down about 1% since the start of the year.Read more here.Tue, April 16, 2024 at 6:34 AM PDTAlexandra CanalStocks eye comeback The Dow rose about 200 points on Tuesday as markets eyed a broader comeback to snap a six-day losing streak.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) climbed around 0.6% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) hugged the flatline.

BNY Mellon reported its quarterly results this morning, and the stock is up 2% premarket.I appreciated his thoughts on rates and markets (below), and I took them as inflationary!“As I think about the path of interest rates, there are a few things that are going on in the world. Clearly, we've got geopolitical risks that are out there, and just today, the potential escalation of the ongoing [Israel/Iran] conflict — that's certainly a risk. We've got consistently, relatively high inflation in the US and that's clearly a bit of a risk. So that brings into some question the path of interest rates. We've got fiscal challenges in the US and the continued [high] amount of issuance of US Treasurys from a volumes point of view. That can be quite good for our business, but as a citizen and a taxpayer, you have to worry a little bit about the path of debt sustainability in the United States. So there's a lot going on.“Now, I'll give you the flip side as well because what we see is really strong, underlying underpinnings for the US economy, and it's not to say that we won't have a correction at some point in the stock market — that could well happen. It's not to say we couldn't have a recession at some point. That's kind of inevitable at some point in time. But when you look at the advantages that the US has right now, it's got a lot of significant advantages on a relative basis in the world. It's a great destination for investment. You can hear that from CEOs internationally. You can see it from investors putting their money into the United States, you can see the performance of the stock market, and there are a lot of tailwinds that are coming into the markets right now. So I would say it's a place you have to be prepared for all eventualities. Could we see the Fed stay on hold, maybe. Could we see the Fed cut rates this year? Probably. Could we see the Fed hike rates? Not impossible. You got to be prepared, but at the same time, the underlying direction of travel for the US is pretty positive.”Tue, April 16, 2024 at 4:02 AM PDTBrian SozziBring on those Starbucks earningsStarbucks (SBUX) earnings will be out in a few weeks, and I have consumed note upon note suggesting the report could be ugly.Most of the concern on Starbucks at the moment stems from falling store traffic in the US, in part because prices for what Starbucks sells have gone through the roof.

Inflation risks are also compounded by upside risks to oil due to geopolitical developments related to Russia and risk of further escalation in the Middle East.

Powell also said it’s appropriate to give the Fed’s restrictive policy further time to work. Treasury yields climbed to fresh 2024 highs — with those on two-year notes briefly hit the 5% mark. Equities struggled after their worst back-to-back selloff in more than a year.“Powell speaking hawkishly... moving rate cuts further out the curve,” said Andrew Brenner at NatAlliance Securities. “He needs to see the data.”The S&P 500 hovered near 5,050. Bank of America Corp. sank as charge-off for soured loans topped estimates, while Morgan Stanley climbed as traders delivered solid revenue. UnitedHealth Group Inc. led gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average after its results.Treasury 10-year yields climbed seven basis points to 4.67%. The greenback rose against all of its developed-market counterparts.Policymakers around the world are struggling to confront a surging greenback and lofty US interest rates, according to Mohamed El-Erian.“Authorities are a little bit frozen around the world as to how do you react to a generalized dollar strengthening?” El-Erian, the president of Queens’ College, Cambridge and a Bloomberg Opinion columnist, told Bloomberg Television Tuesday. “How do you react to a generalized increase in interest rates in the US?”Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson said Tuesday that while there has been considerable progress in lowering inflation, the Fed’s task of sustainably restoring 2% inflation is “not yet done.” His San Francisco counterpart Mary Daly reiterated late Monday there’s no urgency to adjust interest rates, pointing to solid economic growth, a strong labor market and still-elevated inflation.After starting the year by pricing in as many as six rate cuts in 2024, or 1.5 percentage points of easing, traders are now doubtful there will even be a half point of reductions. Most Wall Street economists have dialed back forecasts as well, setting up a dour scenario for US yields including a possible repeat of maturities breaching 5% as they did last October.Story continuesAmid all the anxiety, the widely watched MOVE index, an options-based measure of expected volatility in Treasuries, spiked to the highest since January.State Street Global Advisors is standing by a contrarian call for the Fed to cut interest rate as soon as June despite a string of hot economic data that has spurred most traders to push back bets to later in the year.The asset manager remains convinced the central bank will start monetary easing well before the US presidential election in November to avoid being seen influencing the result, according to Chief Investment Officer Lori Heinel. The inflation backdrop still supports this move given policy works with a long lag and the quality of recent data prints has been low, she said.Exposure to stocks is now so high that any weakness is likely to set off a bigger slump once investors start to cut back on their long positions, according to top Wall Street strategists.There are $52 billion of long positions on the S&P 500 and 88% of them are in a loss, a situation that Citigroup strategist Chris Montagu sees as a risk for the market.A BofA survey showed that investors have raised their allocation to equities to net 34% overweight — the biggest since January 2022 — in a poll conducted from April 5-11 among 224 participants with $638 billion in assets under management.A separate note showed BofA clients were net sellers of US equities for a third consecutive week.Clients pulled a net $800 million from US stocks in the five-day period through April 12 as the S&P 500 Index slumped for the week, quantitative strategists led by Jill Carey Hall said Tuesday in a note.“A stock-market correction is unfolding right now triggered by Middle East tensions, rising bond yields and worries about delayed Fed rate cuts,” said James Demmert at Main Street Research. “Stocks have been due for a pullback for quite some time.”BlackRock Inc.’s Robert Kapito says the stock market is poised to benefit as investors deploy their outsized holdings of cash.There’s almost $9 trillion sitting in money market funds and the same amount in cash alternatives at banks, Kapito, president of the world’s largest asset manager, said at the Asia Pacific Financial and Innovation Symposium in Melbourne on Tuesday.“Rising bond yields are a sign that the global economy and corporate profits are strong and resilient,” said Demmert at Main Street Research. “While this economic and corporate strength may result in fewer than expected or even no rate cuts for the foreseeable future, that isn’t something that will ruin this new bull market.”“In the early phase of a new business cycle, it’s earnings — not the Fed - that drive stocks. Earnings have been far better than expected and we envision a similar outcome as earnings season is once again in full swing,” he concluded.Corporate Highlights:PNC Financial Services Group Inc. missed estimates for net interest income in the first quarter, a sign that the Pittsburgh-based lender has continued to grapple with muted loan growth.The Bank of New York Mellon Corp. reported first-quarter revenue that topped estimates as the oldest US lender benefited from higher market values and increased client activity.UnitedHealth Group Inc. beat Wall Street’s profit expectations and affirmed its outlook for the year, despite the costs associated with a cyberattack on one of its subsidiaries that has roiled the health-care industry.Johnson & Johnson’s first-quarter drug sales narrowly outpaced Wall Street expectations as the company beat profit estimates, a step towards boosting profitability after the spinoff of its consumer division.LVMH sales growth slowed at the start of the year as wealthy consumers reined in spending on costly Louis Vuitton handbags and Hennessy Cognac.Adidas AG raised its profit target for the year amid strong demand for classic sneakers like the Samba and a boost from sales of its diminishing stockpile of Yeezy footwearKey events this week:Eurozone CPI, WednesdayFed issues its Beige Book, WednesdayCleveland Fed President Loretta Mester speaks, WednesdayFed Governor Michelle Bowman speaks, WednesdayBOE Governor Andrew Bailey speaks, WednesdayTaiwan Semiconductor earnings, ThursdayUS Conf.

Put into context, just counting the Great Lakes region… (it) would be the world’s third largest economy, nearly equal to that of Japan and Germany combined, and the region employs about a third of the U.S.-Canadian combined workforce,"" he said.""Then add in California, an economy almost twice the size of Canada's, and you can see the global impact this North-South partnership has.""Canadian banks are increasingly looking to expand south of the border or in other parts of the world as opportunities at home are limited in a saturated market.White cautioned about a higher-for-longer interest rate environment as borrowing costs remain high and demand weakens. But when rates begin to ease, the market could see a ""new normal, an environment with fundamentally different characteristics than that of the past two decades,"" he said.(Reporting by Nivedita Balu in Toronto; Editing by Aurora Ellis)View comments"
Bankrate,The great Demotech scare of 2022: a catalyst for change in the Florida insurance market,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/great-demotech-scare-2022-catalyst-191155013.html,Here’s what’s changed in FL’s insurance market since the 2022 Demotech scare.,"In 2022, news that 27 of Florida’s property insurance companies were potentially facing a financial rating downgrade from Demotech, the state’s primary financial rating firm, created panic in the already shaky Florida insurance market. Since then, there has been a flurry of activity from Florida lawmakers to stop private insurance companies from exiting the state and to keep Citizens Insurance solvent while trying to make it through another active hurricane season. It has been over a year and a half since Demotech’s announcement and while there have been significant changes regarding Florida homeowners insurance, Demotech only downgraded a handful of carriers.Insurance HomeOver the past two years, only nine of the 27 Florida property insurers projected to face potential downgrades had rating downgrades or withdrawals.Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae now accept a financial stability rating of BBB from Kroll Bond Rating Agency in addition to Demotechs A rating.Florida has passed a total of 10 new laws in an effort to make the Florida insurance market more desirable for private insurance companies.What is a financial stability rating and why does it matter?A financial stability rating (FSR) is a score or grade assigned to an insurance company that indicates its historical financial strength and ability to honor claims. The better the score, the more financially sound the carrier has historically been.Homeowners in Florida have limited choices regarding the carriers they have access to for home insurance. Financial analyses and rating agencies like AM Best and Demotech provide a valuable service that helps homeowners feel more confident that an insurance company will have the funds available when a catastrophic loss occurs.Mortgage companies also rely on financial strength ratings to protect their financial interest in your home. If you have a federally-backed mortgage, like Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae, your insurance company must have an acceptable FSR rating to meet the requirements on your mortgage contract. An FSR downgrade could put you at risk of force-placed insurance, which is much more expensive than standard home insurance. In a state like Florida where carrier availability is already limited, the news of 27 potential insurance company downgrades was terrifying to homeowners.Did Demotech downgrade 27 insurance companies?In late July 2022, Demotech sent preliminary letters to 27 Florida-based insurance companies warning that its FSR could drop from an A (Excellent) rating to S (Substantial) or M (Moderate). One month later, three companies had rating changes and as of 2024, several more carriers have had ratings withdrawn.Story continuesOn August 1, 2022, Demotech downgraded the FSR for United Property and Casualty Insurance (UPC) from an A to M and subsequently, UPC was declared insolvent on February 6, 2023. Demotech downgraded FedNat’s FSR from A to S in April 2022 and withdrew its rating in August — this company was also declared insolvent by the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation on September 27, 2022.Additionally, Weston Property & Casualty Insurance was declared insolvent on August 4, 2022, after its FSR was withdrawn by Demotech. A rating withdrawal can often be the first step toward bankruptcy, but not always. Rating withdrawals can be initiated by Demotech or the entity under review, which happened with a few other insurance providers. See the table below for a list of insurance companies with Demotech FSR downgrades or rating withdrawals between April 2022 and the present.Company NameFSR status changeCompany statusBankers Specialty InsuranceFSR withdrawnSolvent – pulled business from FloridaFedNat Insurance CompanyFSR downgrade from A to S, FSR withdrawnDeclared insolvent on September 27, 2022First Community InsuranceFSR withdrawnSolvent – pulled business from FloridaFrontline Insurance Unlimited Co. and First Protective Insurance Company (FPIC)FSR withdrawnSolvent – still active in FloridaLighthouse Property Insurance Corporation and Lighthouse Excalibur Insurance CompanyFSR withdrawnDeclared insolvent on April 28, 2022Olympus InsuranceFSR withdrawnSolvent – still active in FloridaSouthern Fidelity Insurance CompanyFSR withdrawnDeclared insolvent on June 15, 2022United Property and Casualty Insurance (UPC)FSR downgrade from A to M, FSR withdrawnDeclared insolvent on February 27, 2023Weston Property & Casualty InsuranceFSR withdrawnDeclared insolvent on August 4, 2022FSR downgrades and carrier insolvencies impacts all Florida homeownersSince Citizens is a not-for-profit insurance company backed by the state, the goal is to serve as a safety net for homeowners who cannot secure coverage in the standard market. Florida has been struggling to keep private insurance companies in the state for years, and as more carriers exit the state and become insolvent, the “carrier of last resort” has been left to absorb a staggering amount of policies.Between February 2022 and September 2023, Citizens took on an additional 615,189 new policies. The carriers that remain in the state have had significant rate increases due to rising inflation, increased costs from extreme weather and assumption of higher risk due to fewer carriers available to share the financial burden from potential loss.Citizens hurricane taxState law allows Citizens to obtain funding through policyholder premiums and in some circumstances, a statewide assessment, as a way to keep Citizens solvent.If Citizens experiences a deficit, Florida law requires a Citizens Policyholder Surcharge, sometimes called the “hurricane tax”, to be imposed on policyholders in addition to their standard premium. This fee caps at 15 percent per policy for Citizens policyholders, and a statewide fee up to 2 percent can be assessed for policyholders with private carriers on all auto, condo, renters and homeowners policies in Florida. Additionally, an emergency assessment of up to 10 percent per year can be levied on both Citizens and private policyholders if the surcharge and assessments are not sufficient.Demotech downgrade scare prompts massive changesEven though only a few insurance companies were initially impacted by rating changes, Demotech had sounded the alarm on how problematic and fragile the Florida insurance industry truly is in the course of its standard rating practices.The Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (OIR) originally stated that Citizens, Florida’s state-backed insurer, would serve as reinsurance for companies downgraded by Demotech. This temporary arrangement met Freddie Mac’s and Fannie Mae’s insurance requirements and put homeowners at ease. However, this is not a sustainable solution and the measure expired on June 1, 2023.In May 2022, a special legislative session was called to specifically address property insurance concerns. However, after Demotech’s final FSR reports were announced, this prompted another special session in December 2022. The Florida legislature passed 10 additional laws impacting property insurance, two of which involved reinsurance.RAP, the Reinsurance to Assist Policyholders fund, is available to financially sound insurers participating in the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (FHCF) and Citizens. This program reimburses up to 90 percent of an insurer’s covered losses at no additional cost. RAP is set to expire on July 1, 2025, if General Revenue funds are not transferred to the program, or on July 1, 2029, if the program is refunded.The Florida Optional Reinsurance Assistance (FORA) Program enhances the coverage offered by RAP at premiums set drastically lower than the current reinsurance market rates. This program is set to expire on July 1, 2026, without further funding. If the program receives funding by June 30, 2026, it will continue until July 1, 2030.Currently, only three insurance companies have elected to participate in the FORA program.Cautious optimismFlorida’s insurance market is still uncertain, but legislators continue to push for change. On March 8, 2024, the state approved three additional bills that may save homeowners money by eliminating certain taxes and providing funds for improvement grants. While Governor Ron DeSantis has yet to sign or veto these bills, the expectation is that he will soon.Due to some of the new laws Florida legislatures enacted in prior legislative sessions, several new insurance companies have been authorized to write home insurance in Florida. With the influx of new carriers, Citizens is working to depopulate and move about 300,000 policies back to private insurers.Ultimately the goal is to move as many policies back into the private insurance market, which will reduce the amount of risk Citizens assumes, lower Florida home insurance premiums through increased competition and create a more stable insurance market. While it is still too soon to see if these changes create a significant reduction in premiums, homeowners in the Sunshine State have reasons to be hopeful.“Citizens is in a much stronger financial position heading into the 2024 hurricane season compared to a year ago,” says Mark Friedlander, Director of Corporate Communication for the Insurance Information Institute (Triple-I). ”This is due to the successful depopulation of the state-backed insurer, which has moved several hundred thousand policies to the private market, reducing its risk exposure. The company has a surplus of nearly $5 billion and is forecast to grow its surplus in 2024.”Demotech stands behind its rating processWhen speaking with Bankrate in 2022, Demotech President Joe Petrelli stated that the media frenzy surrounding the rating process was unfair and misleading. “These characterizations were an inaccurate depiction of our published process and rating methodology, most significantly because they portrayed preliminary letters as if they were final, when our process — the same comprehensive process we have used for years — involves a continual review of relevant data.”Demotech moved into the Florida insurance market in 1996 after over two dozen insurance companies became insolvent after Hurricane Andrew. Demotech’s Financial Stability Rating Methodology goes through six stages, which include reviews of a company business model, line of business risk analysis, reinsurance review and more.Reviews can be done quarterly and annually, and if Demotech sees significant changes in operating performance, a carrier’s score can be upgraded, downgraded or withdrawn. It is standard practice for Demotech to provide the company under review with a confidential preliminary assessment before a final FSR is announced. This gives the company time to provide any additional information needed for an accurate assessment.KBRA expands its Florida rating presenceIn September 2022, the Florida legislature approved a $1.5 million plan to research financial strength rating agencies in an attempt to replace Demotech. As of yet, there have not been any changes in how Demotech is operating and it has even rated some of the new carriers to enter the Florida market, like Manatee Insurance Exchange.However, another credit rating agency, Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) which was already providing financial strength ratings for several Florida insurance companies, is making its presence known. A few companies that withdrew from Demotch have moved to KBRA. In total, KBRA is rating 11 Florida carriers including ones entering the Florida market for 2024. “We have been in the insurance market since 2017 and I would say over the last couple of years our business has doubled, if not tripled in the amount of Florida companies we rate,” says Peter Giacone, senior managing director and head of insurance ratings at KBRA. “Some companies, like Tower Hill and Heritage, we have been rating for a while, but recently we have picked up quite a few more entities.”In a major win for potential Florida homeowners, Freddie Mac recently joined Fannie Mae in accepting a minimal financial strength rating of BBB from KBRA — the first rating agency added to the list of accepted financial strength rating companies in 28 years. A financial strength rating of B+ from AM Best is also accepted by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. In a matchup of Demotech vs. AM Best and KBRA, Demotech historically rates more Florida insurance companies, but in light of Florida’s search for a different agency, that may change.According to Giacone, homeowners benefit from there being more than one major rating agency on the scene in Florida. Oftentimes, insurance companies have ratings from more than one company, which allows homeowners to have more options — something that has been lacking in the Florida market for years. “One way we are helping the market is with start-up entities,” says Giacone. “Other rating agencies struggle with a company that doesn’t have historical data and that is not a limitation for us.”— Peter Giacone, Senior managing director and Head of insurance ratings, KBRAThe bottom lineFlorida homeowners and insurers are both eager and leery to see how all of these changes will pan out. While there was an understandable amount of concern regarding potential Demotech downgrades, the FSR changes were not what caused the carriers that became insolvent to fail — those companies were already in financial trouble and the rating changes simply reflected this. Inadvertently, the Demotech scare prompted some much-needed action from Florida lawmakers, mortgage companies and insurance companies that will hopefully pay off in the long run.View comments"

Now a niche market is springing up for investors who are looking to target their dollars toward projects aimed at mitigating those risks.Most Read from BloombergChina Tells Iran Cooperation Will Last After Attack on IsraelBeyond the Ivies: Surprise Winners in the List of Colleges With the Highest ROITreasury Yields Hit 2024 Highs as Powell in Focus: Markets WrapIMF Steps Up Its Warning to US Over Spending and Ballooning DebtIran’s Conflict With Israel Puts US Ally Jordan on EdgeA growing cadre of investors is turning to separately managed accounts, or SMAs, working with advisers to design individualized portfolios that allow them put their money toward projects aimed at abating flooding and other potential hazards.“A lot of the strategies are newer in the grand scheme of things relative to standard funds or vehicles,” Lauren Kashmanian, director of portfolio management and responsible investing at Parametric Portfolio Associates, an advisory firm specializing in customization. She’s seen increased demand from clients interested in investing in projects like clean drinking water and renewable energy.The heightened interest in the funds is coming at a time when ESG — an investing approach that leans into environmental, social and governance issues — has come under attack from conservative lawmakers, including in the state of Texas. But the need to spend on projects to adapt to climate change is only growing.Municipal Market Analytics says borrowing in the municipal bond market could double in the next decade as entities spend to guard against climate change and resume deferred maintenance and infrastructure projects.Extreme weather cost the US more than $400 billion last year, according to Bloomberg Intelligence’s Climate Damages Tracker. And BI’s Andrew John Stevenson says more of the costs to address the impacts will likely shift from the federal to state and local governments.Breckinridge Capital Advisors started offering what it calls values-aligned customization in response to client requests, said Ruth Ducret, a senior research analyst who’s also a member of the firm’s sustainability committee. The firm now has $5.3 billion in sustainable muni investments under management.Breckenridge says it’s “agnostic” in terms of the use of proceeds or issuers’ ESG profiles. Instead, it screens for projects in communities that are underserved and need funds to mitigate climate effects.Story continuesIn September, the Boston-based firm, which specializes in SMAs, introduced three new customized funds, including one addressing climate risk. The others focus on essential-service infrastructure in underserved communities and on “net-zero” emissions.“We’d been hearing for years that clients were interested in a product more aligned with their values,” Ducret said in an interview. “Our challenge being a high-grade muni asset manager is that we invest in an average credit quality that’s AA.”SMAs of all types have been growing in popularity, though most have high minimums that limit them to wealthy investors. Assets in these accounts have more than doubled in the past decade, to roughly $790 billion last year from around $300 billion in 2013, according to Vikram Rai, head of municipal markets strategy at Wells Fargo & Co.Read More: Fast-Growing Force in Muni Market Is Upending Mutual Funds’ GripThe performance of the so-called green-bond sector has roughly matched the broader muni market, an important consideration as money managers “have a fiduciary duty to maximize profits and they (including clients) would want to invest in projects that benefit the broader community as long as the performance penalty is reasonable,” Rai said via email.Widespread Investment NeedsThe US Municipal Green Impact index is down about 1.5% year to date, compared with a decline of approximately 1.3% for the broader muni index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“Over the last four or five years, we’ve seen some pretty good growth in this space,” Marc Uy, fixed income portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein, said in an interview. “The reality is that there’s opportunities and there’s communities in every single state across this country in need of investment.”Investment managers tout the ability to drill down into risks more deeply as another advantage of SMAs.“The level of disclosure is limited and uneven,” said Jonathan Bailey, global head of ESG and impact investing at Neuberger Berman. “That means that it is possible to identify two issuances that have similar pricing but have different levels of climate risk exposure.”Neuberger helps to assess this exposure by tapping into an insurance-linked securities unit that underwrites physical climate risk. Neuberger’s municipal-impact SMA, which includes projects in renewable energy and water and sewer projects, has matched benchmark performance over the past five years, said James Iselin, its head of municipal fixed income.Breckinridge uses an outside data provider to supplement its own research, while AllianceBernstein has a partnership with Columbia Univeristy’s Climate School.Investors are also becoming more aware as they observe extreme weather in their own communities, Bailey said. With muni yields at attractive levels, they’re asking: “Can I get a competitive yield, and then get that positive sort of tilt as well?”--With assistance from Eric Kane.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekA Resilient Global Economy Masks Growing Debt and InequalityCities Use AI to Help Ambulances and Firetrucks Arrive FasterThe Shadow Swiftie Economy Booms With Bootleg Bracelets and $1,150 BodysuitsTop Takeaways From Businessweek’s Investigation of Teenage SextortionHow a Pioneering Blackjack Master Beats the Odds of Aging©2024 Bloomberg L.P.View comments"
