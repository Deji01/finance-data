The Challenge searches the globe for entrepreneurs, startups, and companies to help accelerate the development of more sustainable products within the consumer electronics industry. Logitech’s ongoing collaborative efforts to identify and scale real-world solutions not only help accelerate the company’s Design for Sustainability capabilities but also help diminish current obstacles the industry faces in fast-tracking lower carbon solutions. “Breakthrough, disruptive innovation is integral to advancing lower carbon impact technologies in the consumer electronics sector,” said Prakash Arunkundrum, Chief Operating Officer at Logitech. “By harnessing a global community of entrepreneurs and changemakers who defy what is possible today, Logitech’s Future Positive Challenge aims to reshape the way electronic devices will be manufactured in the future.” Logitech continually seeks next-generation materials, components, and processes to accelerate its Design for Sustainability capabilities. Still, the solutions needed to further drive down carbon reductions are either not available at scale today or require investment to become the breakthroughs needed in the future. In the consumer electronics industry, there is a need to optimize printed circuit boards, find alternative energy storage solutions, and develop alternative materials that minimize waste and are sourced renewably to support both circularity and carbon reduction goals. The 2024 Future Positive Challenge encompasses six categories to drive the biggest impact in the consumer electronics industry: Printed Circuit Boards: new solutions that use lower-impact materials and energy-efficient processes in the design and production of circuit boards which have traditionally taken a toll on the environment. Batteries: new solutions such as those featuring alternative materials to lithium or cobalt and techniques for battery recycling. Integrated Circuits: improvements on the semiconductor wafer manufacturing process or improving production yields resulting in carbon emissions reduction. Materials: alternatives that reduce weight, increase strength, reduce carbon footprint, and are renewable or biodegradable. Packaging: solutions that aim to protect products but minimize environmental impact such as moldable materials, renewable or recyclable materials, and alternatives to foil printing. Business Models: ideas for better structuring supply chains or programs that encourage the circular economy or collaborative economy specific to the technology device industry. Applications are now open through March 31, 2024. Startups wanting to scale their businesses while driving change in a multi-billion dollar industry are encouraged to apply on the portal designed in partnership with Tech Tour. This year’s distinguished panel of judges includes leaders in sustainability and manufacturing, including experts from Logitech, BASF, Sony, Samsung, Swatch Group, and others.

The Offer and Consent Solicitation have expired for certain series and extended for others, with amended purchase prices. Noteholders will receive the Purchase Price on the Settlement Date. The Issuer intends to effectuate the Proposed Amendment for expired series promptly after the Expiration Date. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst An analysis of Barclays Bank PLC's tender offers and consent solicitations reveals a strategic maneuver potentially aimed at managing the bank's liabilities and optimizing its capital structure. This move could have implications for the bank's financial health and creditworthiness, which are critical factors that credit rating agencies and investors closely monitor.The tender offers allow the bank to repurchase outstanding exchange-traded notes (ETNs) before maturity, possibly at a price favorable to the bank. This could reduce interest expenses and improve debt ratios, signaling financial prudence to stakeholders. However, the repurchase could also impact the liquidity of these ETNs in the market, potentially affecting investors holding them for diversification or hedging purposes.Furthermore, the consent solicitations to amend certain provisions of the ETNs suggest a proactive approach to covenant management. The amendments could provide Barclays with greater flexibility in managing these financial instruments, but the implications for note holders depend on the specific nature of the proposed changes. Market Research Analyst The tender offer announcement by Barclays can influence market perceptions and the trading dynamics of the affected ETNs. The tender offer prices, particularly for fixed price series, are set above the closing indicative note value as of a recent date, which could be enticing for investors seeking immediate liquidity, especially if they anticipate the value of the underlying index to remain stagnant or decline.However, the market's reaction to such offers can be mixed. While some investors may view the premium as an exit opportunity, others might speculate on potential future appreciation of the underlying assets, choosing to hold their positions. This can affect trading volumes and the bid-ask spread of the ETNs in the secondary market.The extension of the expiration deadline for certain series and the amendment of purchase prices reflect the dynamic nature of these offers. Investors and market participants must stay informed about such changes, as they can influence investment strategies and decisions regarding the ETNs in question. Legal Expert The legal implications of the consent solicitations are particularly noteworthy. Obtaining the requisite consents for the proposed amendments to the notes could alter the terms of the agreement between the issuer and the note holders. This process requires a thorough understanding of the rights being amended and the potential legal ramifications for both parties.For example, amendments might affect the redemption features, covenants, or interest rate calculations of the ETNs, which could have significant consequences for the rights and expectations of the note holders. It is crucial for note holders to carefully review the proposed amendments and consider their legal rights before providing consent.Additionally, the issuer's ability to redeem outstanding notes after the proposed amendments take effect could alter the investment's return profile. Note holders should be aware of the legal framework governing such redemptions, including any notice requirements and the calculation of the redemption price. 03/07/2024 - 12:38 AM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Barclays Bank PLC (the “Issuer”) announced today that, in connection with its previously announced cash tender offers (each, an “Offer”) to purchase any and all of its outstanding exchange-traded notes (the “Notes” or the “ETNs”) of the twenty-four separate series listed in tables below (each, a “Series”) and the solicitation of consents (each, a “Consent Solicitation”) from holders of the Notes (the “Noteholders”) to amend certain provisions of the Notes with respect to each Series, it has: determined the results of the Offer and Consent Solicitation for each Series included in Table 1 below (each, an “Expired Series”); and extended the expiration deadline for the Offer and Consent Solicitation with respect to each Series included in Table 2 below (each, an “Extended Series”) and amended the purchase price per Note (the “Purchase Price”) for certain Extended Series as set forth in Table 2 below.

If a Noteholder has already validly tendered and not withdrawn its Notes of an Extended Series pursuant to an Offer set forth in the Initial Statement, such Noteholder is not required to take any further action with respect to such Notes and such tender constitutes a valid tender for purposes of the relevant Offer, as amended hereby. As of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on March 6, 2024, Noteholders have validly tendered the number of Notes specified in Table 2 above. Any amendment to the Purchase Price per Note set forth above will be applicable to such Notes and may result in a lower Purchase Price than would have resulted under the terms set forth in the Initial Statement. The Purchase Price is payable on April 10, 2024, unless the relevant Offer is further extended or early terminated by the Issuer. Because the Closing Indicative Note Value for each Fixed Price Series is calculated based on the applicable Closing Index Level, if the applicable Closing Index Level has increased as of the Expiration Date, the Purchase Price of that Series may be significantly less than the Closing Indicative Note Value on the Expiration Date. In addition, the Notes of any Fixed Price Series may trade at a substantial premium to or discount from the applicable Closing Indicative Note Value. Accordingly, the Purchase Price for any Fixed Price Series may be lower than the trading price of the Notes of that Series on the Expiration Date. If on or prior to the Expiration Date, the applicable Closing Index Level with respect to any Fixed Price Series set forth in Table 2 above has increased or decreased from its level on March 6, 2024, the Issuer may amend the Offer and Consent Solicitation with respect to that Series, including by increasing or decreasing the Purchase Price of that Series, or in its sole and absolute discretion, to further extend, withdraw or terminate such Offer or Consent Solicitation. On each Trading Day while an Offer remains open, the indicative Purchase Price for the relevant Series, as well as the Closing Index Level and the Closing Indicative Note Value for that Trading Day for the relevant Series, will be published for that Series by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, at http://ipathetn.barclays/static/tenderoffers.app. In the event that publication of the Closing Index Level for any Series on any Trading Day is delayed, the Issuer will publish such information as soon as practicable following the publication of that Closing Index Level. Subject to applicable law, the Offer and Consent Solicitation for each Series is being made independently of the Offer and Consent Solicitation for each other Series, and the Issuer reserves the right, subject to applicable law, to withdraw or terminate the Offer and Consent Solicitation for any Series if any of the conditions described in the Statement have not been satisfied or waived without also withdrawing or terminating any other Offer or Consent Solicitation. In addition, the Issuer reserves the right, subject to applicable law, to extend or amend the Offer and Consent Solicitation for any Series at any time and for any reason without also extending or amending any other Offer or Consent Solicitation.

Our businesses include consumer banking and payments operations around the world, as well as a full-service corporate and investment bank. For further information about Barclays, please visit our website www.barclays.com. Selected Risk Considerations An investment in the ETNs described herein involves risks. Selected risks are summarized here, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks described under “Risk Factors” in the applicable prospectus supplement and pricing supplement. You May Lose Some or All of Your Principal: The ETNs are exposed to any change in the level of the underlying index or exchange rate, as applicable (the “index”) between the inception date and the applicable valuation date. Additionally, if the level of the index is insufficient to offset the negative effect of the investor fee and other applicable costs, you will lose some or all of your investment at maturity or upon redemption, even if the level of such index has increased or decreased, as the case may be. The ETNs are riskier than ordinary unsecured debt securities and have no principal protection. Credit of Barclays Bank PLC: The ETNs are unsecured debt obligations of Barclays Bank PLC and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of or guaranteed by any third party. Any payment to be made on the ETNs, including any payment at maturity or upon redemption, depends on the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC will affect the market value, if any, of the ETNs prior to maturity or redemption. In addition, if Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the ETNs. Market and Volatility Risk: The market value of the ETNs may be influenced by many unpredictable factors and may fluctuate between the date you purchase them and the maturity date or redemption date. You may also sustain a significant loss if you sell your ETNs in the secondary market. Factors that may influence the market value of the ETNs include prevailing market prices of the commodity markets, the U.S. stock markets or the U.S. Treasury market, the index components included in the underlying index, and prevailing market prices of options on such index or any other financial instruments related to such index; and supply and demand for the ETNs, including economic, financial, political, regulatory, geographical or judicial events that affect the level of such index or other financial instruments related to such index. Concentration Risk: Because the ETNs are linked to an index composed of futures contracts on a single commodity or in only one commodity sector, the ETNs are less diversified than other funds. The ETNs can therefore experience greater volatility than other funds or investments. A Trading Market for the ETNs May Not Develop: The ETNs are not listed on any securities exchange. A trading market for the ETNs may not develop and the liquidity of the ETNs may be limited. No Interest Payments from the ETNs: You may not receive any interest payments on the ETNs. Uncertain Tax Treatment: Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the ETNs are uncertain. You should consult your own tax advisor about your own tax situation. The ETNs may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage account. Commissions may apply and there are tax consequences in the event of sale, redemption or maturity of ETNs. Sales in the secondary market may result in significant losses. © 2024 Barclays Bank PLC. All rights reserved. iPath, iPath ETNs and the iPath logo are registered trademarks of Barclays Bank PLC.

The report challenges misconceptions with data-driven insights.","2024 Hamilton Lane Market Overview: New Data Debunks Private Markets Myths Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Hamilton Lane (HLNE) releases its 2024 Market Overview highlighting valuations, fundraising, GP-leds, and sustainable investment returns. The report challenges misconceptions with data-driven insights. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The Hamilton Lane report sheds light on the private markets, which are often less transparent than public markets, providing valuable information for investors and businesses alike. The focus on valuations, fundraising, GP-leds (General Partner-led secondary transactions) and sustainable investment returns is particularly crucial in today's investment landscape. With ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) factors becoming increasingly important, sustainable investment returns are not just a trend but a paradigm shift in investment strategies.From a market research perspective, the data provided can influence asset allocation decisions and risk assessments. The insights on GP-leds are especially pertinent given the rise in secondary market transactions, which offer liquidity solutions in a market known for its illiquidity. This could indicate a maturing market with more sophisticated mechanisms for managing private investment portfolios. Financial Analyst Investors and analysts closely monitor reports like Hamilton Lane's for signals about the health of the private markets. The findings could have implications for asset pricing and investor sentiment, potentially affecting the flow of capital into private equity and related asset classes. A reassessment of valuations, if indicated by the report, could lead to a revaluation of assets in investor portfolios, influencing both current and future investment strategies.Furthermore, the fundraising aspect touches upon the availability of capital and investor confidence. If the report suggests a robust fundraising environment, this could signal a bullish outlook for private markets, which may, in turn, impact public markets as the lines between private and public investments continue to blur. Sustainable Investment Analyst The inclusion of sustainable investment returns in the report is a testament to the growing importance of ESG considerations in investment decisions. An analysis of these returns could provide insights into the performance differential between sustainable and traditional investments. If the report indicates that sustainable investments are outperforming their traditional counterparts, it could lead to a reallocation of funds towards ESG-focused funds and businesses, influencing stock market dynamics, particularly for companies with strong ESG profiles.Moreover, the data could serve as a benchmark for investors looking to measure the impact of their ESG investments, offering a more nuanced understanding of the risk-return profile associated with sustainable investing. 03/07/2024 - 03:00 AM Report highlights findings around valuations, fundraising, GP-leds and sustainable investment returns CONSHOHOCKEN, Pa., March 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Hamilton Lane (Nasdaq: HLNE), a leading global private markets investment management firm, published its 2024 Market Overview today. This year's report offers a data-backed counter narrative to several commonly held misconceptions about the private markets asset class. The firm's annual Market Overview is a comprehensive, data-driven review and analysis of private markets investment activity over the prior year, featuring predictions for the year ahead, underscored by Hamilton Lane's industry-leading database encompassing $18.9 trillion in assets and 52 vintage years. The 2024 Market Overview addressed the following myths: MYTH: Private market valuations are inaccurate: It's not the first time private market valuations have been criticized, but this past year's skepticism toward how private markets value their holdings has been notable. There are a few reasons why we believe both the valuations are realistic and there is unlikely to be a downturn driven solely by inflated valuations today.MYTH: The fundraising market is bleak: To be clear, private markets fundraising indeed remains challenged, however, the overall picture is more nuanced, with 2023 shaping up to be the seventh-largest fundraising year in history. Also, Hamilton Lane's Private Wealth Survey showed that nearly 75% of respondents plan to increase their allocation from the prior year.MYTH: GP-led secondaries are terrible, and/or are just like co-investments (especially single-asset deals): Using a buyout index as a proxy for co-investments (CI), the data shows that while returns between single-asset GP-leds and co-investments are similar (with a slight advantage to CI), the risk profile is quite different. Single-asset GP-led secondaries historically have a tighter return band, and much lower loss ratios than co-investments.(See chart: ""Co-Investment"" vs. Single Asset Continuation Vehicles)MYTH: A focus on sustainability will ruin future returns: One of the most hotly-debated myths is that sustainable investments sacrifice performance, which at one point in time might have been a justified stance. As illustrated below, sustainable investment trailed behind non-sustainable investment for much of the aughts and early teens, but the last five or six years have seen that trend change meaningfully. (See chart: Rolling Fund Performance)Mario Giannini, Executive Co-Chairman and author of the Market Overview, commented: ""As new investors enter the asset class and we continue to navigate a broadly challenging economic climate in 2024, the need for data-oriented analysis becomes even more important. This year's Market Overview finds that overall, private markets remain resilient, despite skepticism and nerves driven by slow fundraising. In our view, investors must get comfortable making hard decisions, and must be able to separate fact from fiction. That matters today more than ever.""

WMG awaits due diligence information to proceed with a formal offer.","Warner Music Group Confirms Its Indication of Interest in Relation to French Digital Music Company Believe SA Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Warner Music Group (WMG) confirms its approach to Believe SA for a potential combination, valuing Believe at €17/share. WMG aims to provide strategic support and financial stability to accelerate Believe's growth. The Consortium waives conditions after WMG's proposal, raising concerns over French securities regulations. WMG awaits due diligence information to proceed with a formal offer. Positive None. Negative Concerns over the Consortium waiving conditions set by French securities regulations, which could be challenged. Financial Analyst The approach by Warner Music Group (WMG) to potentially combine with Believe SA represents a strategic move that could reshape the competitive landscape of the digital music industry. A combination of this nature typically aims to leverage synergies, enhance market share and improve negotiating power with music distributors and artists. The offer of €17/share indicates a valuation that could impact Believe's stock performance, potentially leading to an increase in share price due to anticipated growth and financial stability. The mention of cash and/or share components in the transaction suggests flexibility in financing the deal, which could appeal to Believe's shareholders.WMG's proposal, which appears to offer more attractive financial terms than the Consortium's, highlights the competitive nature of the acquisition process. The waiver of conditions precedent by the Consortium raises questions about the fairness and regulatory compliance of their actions, which could lead to legal challenges and affect the transaction timeline. WMG's interest in strategic support rather than a purely financial investment could signal a commitment to long-term growth, which may be favorable to Believe's stakeholders, including employees and artists. Market Research Analyst WMG's potential acquisition of Believe SA could signal a consolidation trend within the music industry, driven by the need to adapt to the rapidly changing digital landscape. The strategic support WMG offers could enhance Believe's capabilities to expand into new geographies, a critical factor given the global nature of music consumption. Accelerating expansion not only offers revenue growth opportunities but also diversification of market risk.Investors and stakeholders should consider the implications of this transaction on the competitive dynamics of the industry. A successful acquisition could give WMG a stronger foothold in Europe, particularly in the French market where Believe is headquartered. This could potentially lead to increased market concentration, which might draw regulatory scrutiny. The outcome of such scrutiny could have significant implications for the deal's completion and the future operational strategy of the combined entity. Legal Expert The legal aspects of the potential transaction between WMG and Believe SA are complex, particularly in light of the waiver of conditions precedent by the Consortium. This waiver could be construed as a deviation from standard practices designed to protect shareholders and ensure a fair transaction process. If the waiver is found to violate French securities regulations, it could lead to legal disputes that may delay or even derail the acquisition.Furthermore, WMG's mention of obtaining authorizations from competition authorities indicates an awareness of potential antitrust concerns. The consolidation of major players in the music industry could lead to a reduction in competition, which is typically a focal point for regulatory bodies. The due diligence process and subsequent formal proposal by WMG will need to address these regulatory concerns comprehensively to avoid legal complications that could affect the transaction's viability. 03/07/2024 - 02:30 AM NEW YORK, March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Warner Music Group (“Warner Music Group” or WMG”) confirms that on February 21, 2024 it approached Believe SA, a global digital music company headquartered in France and listed on the regulated market of Euronext Paris (“Believe” or the “Company”) to initiate discussions with respect to a potential combination of Believe with WMG (the “Transaction”) and that it indicated on February 27, 2024 that, at this stage, WMG thought it could value Believe at a price of at least €17/share (coupon attached) based on currently available public information. WMG hereby confirms the indications contained in the press release of the ad hoc committee of the Board of Directors of Believe published on March 1, 2024, which reiterates, in particular that WMG’s approach was made to the Company on a confidential, exploratory and non-binding basis and that WMG has requested access to a limited list of key due diligence information with a view to possibly submitting a formal offer relating to the Transaction (as the case may be, by applying usual measures to protect such information). WMG reaffirms its interest in the potential Transaction and considers that such a combination would be beneficial to the Company and all of its other stakeholders (shareholders, employees, artists and labels). As opposed to the purely financial transaction contemplated by the consortium formed by EQT, TCV, and Denis Ladegaillerie (the “Consortium”) announced on February 12, 2024, WMG would provide Believe with strategic support and financial stability to help the development and growth of the Company, including by accelerating its expansion into new geographies. In addition, WMG envisages financial terms that would be more attractive than those announced by the Consortium. Although no decision has been taken at this stage, the Transaction could be for cash only, without WMG excluding the possibility of a share component, and without any financing conditions. If necessary, and depending on the information provided by the Company, the filing of the offer could be subject to obtaining authorizations from relevant competition authorities. WMG notes that the Consortium, after having been made aware of WMG’s proposal, has decided to waive the conditions precedent relating to the block acquisitions (related to the issuance of a fairness opinion by the independent expert appointed by the ad hoc committee and the issuance by the Company’s board of directors of its recommendation with respect to the offer, following consultation of the Company’s works council) included in the agreements transferring to it c.72% of Believe’s share capital. WMG considers that such a waiver violates a number of rules of French securities regulations which are meant to protect shareholders (including the sellers and their investors) and the Company, and that the validity of such waiver could be challenged. WMG is currently awaiting access to the due diligence information requested on February 27, 2024, and which it considers key to allow it to submit a formal proposal, as the case may be, with respect to the Transaction and confirm its indicative price of at least €17/share (coupon attached) based on the elements mentioned above. WMG will keep the market updated on any further material developments relating to the above situation. DISCLAIMERThis press release has been prepared for information purposes only.

Accordingly, persons who come into possession of this press release should inform themselves of and observe these local restrictions.

The Company bought 159,621 ordinary shares at an average price of £83.4217 per share, intending to cancel them. After the transaction, the Company has 164,374,035 ordinary shares in issue. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Share buybacks, such as the one executed by the Company, are strategic financial transactions with direct implications for shareholder value and market perception. By repurchasing shares, the Company is effectively reducing the number of shares available in the market, which can lead to an increase in earnings per share (EPS) due to the reduced share count. This action typically signals management's confidence in the company's financial health and future prospects, often resulting in a positive reaction in the stock price.Moreover, the share buyback was conducted through a well-known investment firm, Goldman Sachs International, which adds a layer of credibility to the transaction. The cancellation of the purchased shares will further consolidate share value. However, it is essential to consider the opportunity cost of the buyback; funds used for this purpose are not being invested in business expansion or other potentially value-adding activities. Investors should assess the company's long-term strategy to determine if the buyback aligns with sustainable growth objectives. Market Research Analyst The buyback announcement provides insights into the Company's capital allocation strategy. By analyzing the timing and price range of the share purchases, one can infer market conditions and the company's assessment of its intrinsic value. The average price paid per share, compared to historical stock performance, can indicate whether the company believes its stock is undervalued.It is also noteworthy to consider the broader market implications. Share buybacks can support stock market performance by providing a floor for the stock price. They often occur during market downturns when companies want to stabilize their stock price or take advantage of lower valuations. The disclosed information regarding the volume and prices on different exchanges could help in understanding liquidity and price variations across trading venues. Economist From an economic perspective, share buybacks can be reflective of broader economic trends. In periods of economic growth, companies may have excess cash that they choose to return to shareholders through buybacks. Conversely, during economic downturns, buybacks could be a tool to manage market sentiment and shareholder value amidst declining profits.The decision to buy back shares also has implications for the company's capital structure. It can affect leverage ratios and the cost of capital. A reduction in equity can lead to a higher return on equity (ROE), provided the cost of debt does not outweigh the earnings yield of the repurchased equity. The economic context and interest rate environment are crucial factors in assessing the timing and impact of such financial decisions. 03/07/2024 - 02:30 AM Purchase of own sharesLONDON, UK / ACCESSWIRE / March 7, 2024 / The Company announces that on 06 March 2024 it purchased the following number of its ordinary shares of 20340/399 pence each through Goldman Sachs International (""GSI"") on the London Stock Exchange in accordance with the authority granted by shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2023 (the ""Purchase"").

The investment in generative AI (gen AI) signifies a commitment to advancing the company's capabilities in a field that is expected to contribute significantly to the U.S. economy. The lab's collaboration with research institutions and startups is indicative of an ecosystem approach, which could lead to synergistic advancements in AI technology.From a market perspective, Cognizant's emphasis on AI research and development is likely to be viewed favorably by investors, as it suggests a forward-looking approach to addressing the ambivalence expressed by executives regarding AI progress. The lab's potential to create AI systems that optimize business outcomes could translate into improved efficiency and profitability for Cognizant's clients, thereby increasing the company's value proposition. Financial Analyst The announcement of the Advanced AI Lab is a significant development for Cognizant's financial outlook. The company's $1 billion investment in generative AI over the next three years underlines a substantial financial commitment to this emerging technology. This investment could lead to the development of proprietary technologies and patents, which can be monetized through licensing or direct application in client projects. The potential economic impact of gen AI, as highlighted by the study with Oxford Economics, suggests that Cognizant is positioning itself to capitalize on a market that could see substantial growth in the coming decade.It is important for stakeholders to monitor the lab's progress and the translation of its research into marketable products and services. The success of this initiative could have a positive impact on Cognizant's revenue streams and stock performance, particularly if the lab's outputs are in high demand.

This move is reflective of the industry's trend towards more sophisticated AI systems that go beyond simple task automation.

Xerox Holdings Corporation Announces Pricing of Upsized Convertible Notes Offering,2024-03-07T05:39:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,Xerox Holdings Corporation announced the pricing of $350 million convertible senior notes due 2030 in a private placement to fund various corporate purposes. The offering size was increased by $50 million post-announcement.,"Xerox Holdings Corporation Announces Pricing of Upsized Convertible Notes Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Xerox Holdings Corporation announced the pricing of $350 million convertible senior notes due 2030 in a private placement to fund various corporate purposes. The offering size was increased by $50 million post-announcement. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The issuance of $350 million in 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes by Xerox Holdings Corporation represents a strategic financing move to refinance existing debt and for general corporate purposes. The decision to increase the offering size by $50 million suggests a favorable reception from institutional investors. The convertible nature of the notes provides potential upside for investors, with the initial conversion rate set at a 25% premium over the closing stock price on a specified date, which could be attractive to investors betting on the company's future growth.However, the potential dilution of shares upon conversion could be a concern for current shareholders, although the capped call transactions aim to mitigate this impact to a certain extent. The cap price of these transactions at a 70% premium further suggests a controlled dilution process. The timing of the closing, set for March 11, 2024, indicates a near-term liquidity event that will provide the company with funds to address its immediate financial obligations.The note's redeemability feature after September 20, 2027, adds flexibility for the company to manage its debt portfolio in response to market conditions and its stock price performance. Overall, while this move indicates proactive debt management, it also underscores the importance of monitoring the company's leverage and interest coverage ratios post-transaction. Market Research Analyst Xerox's entry into capped call transactions in conjunction with the convertible notes offering is indicative of a hedging strategy designed to minimize the equity dilution and cash payment impacts typically associated with convertible securities. The initial hedge setup by the counterparties, involving the purchase of Xerox's common stock and derivative transactions, could temporarily influence the stock price.Investors should be aware that the counterparties' ongoing adjustments to their hedge positions, through market activities, might introduce volatility to Xerox’s stock price over the life of the notes. This could affect not only the conversion value for note holders but also the stock's market perception. It is important to consider that while these financial maneuvers aim to optimize the company's capital structure, they also introduce complexities that require careful analysis of the potential market implications. Legal Expert The offering of Convertible Senior Notes and capped call transactions are subject to specific legal frameworks, such as Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, which limits the sale to qualified institutional buyers. This restriction reflects the regulatory environment's focus on investor qualification and the protection of less sophisticated market participants.Furthermore, the absence of registration under the Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction for the notes, the related guarantees and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion signifies that the securities will be traded in a more private, less liquid market. This limitation may influence the risk profile of the investment. Prospective investors should be cognizant of these legal nuances, as they delineate the scope of the offering and the rights of the securities holders. 03/07/2024 - 12:39 AM NORWALK, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Xerox Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ: XRX) (the “Company” or “Xerox”) announced today the pricing of $350,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2030 (the “Notes”) in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”). The size of the offering was increased by $50 million subsequent to the initial announcement of the offering. The Company also granted the initial purchasers of the Notes a 13-day option to purchase up to $50,000,000 aggregate principal amount of additional notes. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to fund the cost of the capped call transactions described below, with any remaining net proceeds of the Notes, together with the net proceeds from the concurrent offering of 8.875% Senior Notes due 2029 of the Company which also priced today, to be used (i) to refinance all of its outstanding 3.800% Senior Notes due 2024 (“2024 Notes”) and a portion of its 5.000% Senior Notes due 2025 (“2025 Notes”), (ii) to repay, repurchase or redeem a portion of its other outstanding indebtedness, (iii) to pay related fees and expenses and (iv) for general corporate purposes. The sale of the Notes is expected to close on March 11, 2024, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions. The Notes and the related guarantees will be senior, unsecured obligations of the Company, and interest will be payable semi-annually in arrears. The Notes will be convertible into cash, up to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be converted, and into cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination thereof, at the Company’s election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of the Company’s conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being converted. The initial conversion rate for the Notes is 47.9904 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $20.84 per share). The initial conversion price represents a premium of approximately 25% to the $16.67 per share closing price of Xerox’s common stock on NASDAQ on March 6, 2024. The Notes also will be redeemable at the option of the Company on or after September 20, 2027, if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive), including the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption, during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption. The Notes will mature on March 15, 2030. In connection with the pricing of the Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain financial institutions, which include certain initial purchasers or their respective affiliates and/or other financial institutions or their respective affiliates (collectively, the “Counterparties”). The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon any conversion of the Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap based on the cap price. The cap price of the capped call transactions will initially be approximately $28.34 per share, which represents a premium of 70% over the last reported sale price of Xerox’s common stock of $16.67 per share on March 6, 2024, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional Notes, the Company expects to enter into additional capped call transactions with the Counterparties. The Company has been advised that, in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the Counterparties or their respective affiliates expect to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock and/or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the Company’s common stock concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the Notes and may unwind these various derivative transactions and purchase the Company’s common stock in open market transactions shortly following the pricing of the Notes. These activities could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of the Company’s common stock or the Notes at that time. In addition, the Company has been advised that the Counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to the Company’s common stock and/or by purchasing or selling shares of the Company’s common stock or other securities of the Company in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the Notes and from time to time prior to the maturity of the Notes (and are likely to do so following any conversion of the Notes, any repurchase of the Notes by the Company on a fundamental change repurchase date, any redemption date, or any other date on which the notes are retired by the Company in each case if the Company exercises its option to terminate the relevant portion of the capped call transactions). These activities could cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of the Company’s common stock or the Notes, which could affect the ability of holders of Notes to convert the Notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the Notes, could affect the number of shares of the Company’s common stock, if any, and value of the consideration that holders of Notes will receive upon conversion of the Notes. The Notes and the related guarantees will be offered only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Act. Neither the Notes, the related guarantees nor the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, if any, have been, nor will be, registered under the Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, the Notes, the related guarantees or any other security, and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale of any securities in any state or jurisdiction in which, or to any persons to whom, such offering, solicitation or sale would be unlawful. In addition, this press release shall not constitute an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to purchase the 2024 Notes or the 2025 Notes. Any tender offer will be made solely pursuant to an offer to purchase to the holders of the 2024 Notes and the 2025 Notes.

The offering includes a 30-day option for additional shares and a Share Repurchase of 15,000,000 shares as part of a $350 million program. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The secondary public offering by ADT Inc. represents a significant liquidity event for the entities managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management. As a financial analyst, it's important to note that the pricing of shares at $6.50 can be indicative of market sentiment towards the company and its valuation. The fact that the company is not selling any shares and will not receive proceeds suggests a reallocation of ownership rather than capital raising for corporate activities, which is a neutral event for the company's balance sheet.Investors should closely monitor the market's reaction to this offering, as it could influence ADT's stock price in the short-term. The additional 30-day option for underwriters to purchase up to 9,750,000 shares could also introduce volatility or support the stock price depending on the demand. The Share Repurchase is a strategic move that indicates management's confidence in the company's value, potentially signaling to the market that the stock is undervalued at the offering price. Market Research Analyst From a market research perspective, the involvement of top-tier investment banks as book-running managers and joint book-runners, such as Morgan Stanley and Barclays, adds credibility to the offering. It may also facilitate a broader distribution of shares, potentially increasing the stock's liquidity in the market.The share repurchase program, part of which is being executed concurrently with the secondary offering, is a tactic often used to return value to shareholders and could be perceived positively by the market. However, it is essential to assess the impact of such repurchases on the company's future growth potential and whether the capital could be better deployed for business expansion. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the effectiveness of the shelf registration statement and the filing of a preliminary prospectus supplement with the Securities and Exchange Commission are standard procedures for secondary offerings. Prospective investors should examine these documents for risk factors and detailed information about the offering. The absence of underwriting fees for the shares being repurchased is a notable point, as it eliminates potential conflicts of interest and could be seen as a cost-saving move by the company. 03/06/2024 - 11:22 PM BOCA RATON, Fla., March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ADT Inc.

The offering is expected to close on March 11, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent public offering by REGENXBIO Inc. represents a significant influx of capital, anticipated to be around $140 million. This capital injection is critical for a clinical-stage biotech company, as it provides the necessary funds to continue research and development, particularly in the expensive field of gene therapy. The pricing of the shares and pre-funded warrants suggests a strategic move to attract investment without a substantial discount, which could potentially maintain shareholder value while still expanding the capital base.Investors should note the involvement of high-profile financial institutions such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which often indicates confidence in the offering's success. The 30-day option for underwriters to purchase additional shares provides a buffer that could lead to further capital if the offering is well-received, indicating potential for stock price stabilization post-offering. Biotech Market Analyst REGENXBIO's focus on gene therapy is situated in a high-growth potential market but comes with considerable risk due to the complex nature of clinical trials and regulatory approvals. The capital raised could accelerate the company's pipeline projects towards commercialization, which is a critical factor for long-term success in the biotech industry. However, the dilutive effect of increasing the number of shares could be a concern for existing shareholders, as it may affect earnings per share.Market trends show that biotech firms with innovative platforms and a robust pipeline are attractive for long-term investment, despite the inherent risks. The timing and pricing of this offering may reflect the company's strategic positioning and confidence in its technology, which could be a positive signal for investors looking at the growth prospects of the gene therapy sector. Legal Expert in Securities REGENXBIO's offering is conducted under a shelf registration statement, which allows the company to prepare the offering documents ahead of time and go to market quickly when conditions are favorable. This method is often used by companies to have flexibility in timing the market and ensuring capital is raised efficiently. The fact that the offering is upsized suggests strong investor interest or a greater need for funds than initially anticipated.It's important to note that the offering's successful closure is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory compliance. The company's adherence to SEC regulations, including the filing of a preliminary prospectus supplement, is crucial in maintaining transparency with investors and avoiding legal complications that could arise from securities offerings. 03/06/2024 - 11:20 PM ROCKVILLE, Md., March 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- REGENXBIO Inc.

Financial Analyst The issuance of $160 million in 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes by Avid Bioservices is a significant financial maneuver that warrants a multi-dimensional analysis. From a financial perspective, the pricing of convertible notes indicates a strategic capital raising effort. The 7.00% interest rate is notably higher than the average corporate bond yield, suggesting a risk premium associated with the company's creditworthiness. Furthermore, the initial conversion price set at a 12.5% premium to the current stock price is designed to minimize immediate dilution of existing shareholders while offering potential upside to note holders.The intended use of proceeds to repurchase a portion of the existing 1.250% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2026 and to repay any remaining notes suggests an active liability management strategy. This could be seen as an attempt to manage debt maturities and reduce interest expenses in the long run. However, the move to higher interest-bearing notes may increase short-term cash outflows, which could impact the company's liquidity profile.Investors would need to consider the potential dilutive effect of the conversion option on future earnings per share, as well as the implications of the 'fundamental change' clause, which could trigger repurchases at unfavorable times for the company. The lack of a sinking fund provision indicates that the company is not obligated to set aside funds to repay the notes, which could raise concerns about the company's long-term ability to meet its debt obligations. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the announcement of Avid Bioservices' convertible note offering provides insight into the company's strategic positioning within the biologics CDMO sector. The decision to issue convertible notes rather than traditional debt or equity could be indicative of the company's confidence in its future growth prospects, as conversion to equity would be beneficial to investors if the company's stock price appreciates.The biologics CDMO market is highly competitive and Avid Bioservices' move to restructure its debt could be aimed at freeing up capital for investment in technology, capacity expansion, or potential acquisitions to enhance its service offerings and competitive edge. However, the market will also be observing how the increased debt servicing costs affect the company's financial flexibility and ability to invest in growth opportunities.It is also important to note the private placement to 'qualified institutional buyers' under Rule 144A, which suggests a targeted approach to fundraising, potentially providing more favorable terms than a public offering and reflecting the company's relationships with institutional investors. Legal Expert The legal intricacies of Avid Bioservices' convertible notes offering involve several key regulatory considerations. The notes have been structured to comply with Rule 144A, allowing for a private placement to qualified institutional buyers, which streamlines the issuance process compared to a public offering. This approach bypasses the need for a public registration statement, thereby expediting access to capital, although it limits the notes' marketability to a broader investor base.The notes are described as senior unsecured obligations, ranking them above subordinated debt in case of liquidation, yet they are not secured by any assets, which could affect their attractiveness to risk-averse investors. The 'fundamental change' provision is a standard protective measure for investors, offering a potential exit strategy in the event of significant corporate restructuring or acquisition, which could impact the company's creditworthiness.Finally, the lack of registration under the Securities Act for the notes and any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion means that resale is restricted, which could impact liquidity for note holders. This is a standard limitation for securities issued in private placements, but it is an important consideration for investors who may seek to exit their positions before maturity. 03/06/2024 - 11:58 PM TUSTIN, Calif., March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Avid Bioservices, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDMO), a dedicated biologics contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO), announced today the pricing of $160 million aggregate principal amount of 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes”). In connection with the offering, the company entered into private placement purchase agreements with the several purchasers, each of whom is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The closing of the offering is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to take place on March 12, 2024. The 2029 Notes will represent senior unsecured obligations of the company and will accrue interest payable semiannually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2024. The notes will mature on March 1, 2029, unless earlier converted or repurchased. Before September 1, 2028, holders will have the right to convert their 2029 Notes only upon the satisfaction of specified conditions and during certain periods. On or after September 1, 2028 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their 2029 Notes at any time. Upon conversion, the company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at its election. The conversion rate for the 2029 Notes will initially be 101.1250 shares of the company’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $9.89 per share of the company’s common stock). The initial conversion price represents a premium of approximately 12.5% over the last reported sale price of $8.79 per share of the company’s common stock on March 6, 2024. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued or unpaid interest. The 2029 Notes are not redeemable and no sinking fund is provided for the 2029 Notes. If the company undergoes a “fundamental change” (as defined in the indenture that will govern the 2029 Notes), then, subject to certain conditions and limited exceptions, holders may require the company to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2029 Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2029 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date, the company will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its 2029 Notes in connection with such a corporate event. The company expects to use the net proceeds from the Offering (i) to repurchase for cash a portion of its 1.250% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) in privately negotiated transactions from certain noteholders and (ii) to the extent there are 2026 Notes outstanding after such repurchase, to repay in full any remaining outstanding 2026 Notes by depositing the required payoff amount with the trustee under the indenture of the 2026 Notes. The 2029 Notes and any shares of the company’s common stock issuable upon conversion of the 2029 Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, any state securities laws or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and other applicable securities laws. This press release is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any of these securities nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification thereof under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.

Trust account proceeds to be disbursed to shareholders. NASDAQ to delist Company's securities. Positive None. Negative The termination of the business combination agreement may lead to loss of potential growth opportunities for the Company and its shareholders. The dissolution and liquidation of the Company could result in financial losses for investors who were expecting a successful merger outcome. Financial Analyst The termination of a business combination agreement and subsequent dissolution of Edify Acquisition Corp. represents a significant event for shareholders and the market. The redemption of public shares at approximately $10.61 per share suggests a return of capital to shareholders, which is typically at or near the initial public offering (IPO) price for special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). The liquidation of securities held in the trust account indicates that the SPAC was unable to fulfill its purpose of acquiring a business within the specified timeframe, a risk inherent to SPAC investments. Shareholders should consider the tax implications of the redemption and the timing of the cash distribution. Legal Expert The formal process of delisting securities from NASDAQ and terminating registration under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as indicated by the expected filings of Form 25 and Form 15, respectively, is a clear move towards the completion of the corporate wind-down. This process involves regulatory compliance and legal finality, ensuring that the company's obligations to its shareholders and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are met. It is important for investors to understand that following these filings, the company's securities will no longer be publicly traded and the company will no longer be subject to the same reporting requirements as before. Market Research Analyst The dissolution of a SPAC such as Edify Acquisition Corp. can have broader implications for the SPAC market and investor sentiment. The inability to complete a business combination may reflect on the quality of available targets or market conditions that are not conducive to successful mergers and acquisitions. This event might influence future SPAC launches and investor confidence in such vehicles, potentially leading to more stringent due diligence and a reevaluation of the SPAC structure's viability in the current market environment. 03/06/2024 - 09:56 PM NEW YORK, March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Edify Acquisition Corp. (NASDAQ: EAC) (the “Company”) announced that the Company and Unique Logistics International, Inc. (“UNQL”) have mutually agreed to terminate the previously announced business combination agreement between the Company and UNQL, and pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Company intends to dissolve and liquidate promptly after March 12, 2024. The Company will redeem all of the outstanding public shares of common stock (the “Public Shares”) at an expected per-share redemption price of approximately $10.61. As of the close of business on March 12, 2024, the Public Shares will be deemed cancelled and will represent only the right to receive the expected per-share redemption price. In order to provide for the disbursement of funds from the trust account, the Company has instructed the trustee of the trust account to take all necessary actions to liquidate the securities held in the trust account. The proceeds of the trust account will be held in a non-interest bearing account while awaiting disbursement to the holders of the Public Shares. Record holders will receive their pro rata portion of the proceeds of the trust account by delivering their Public Shares to Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the Company’s transfer agent. Beneficial owners of Public Shares held in “street name,” however, will not need to take any action in order to receive the expected per-share redemption price. The Company expects that NASDAQ will file a Form 25 with the SEC to delist the Company’s securities. The Company thereafter expects to file a Form 15 with the SEC to terminate the registration of its securities under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The collaboration between Unity and Mazda represents a strategic move to enhance the in-car experience through advanced human machine interface (HMI) and graphic user interface (GUI) technologies. This partnership is indicative of broader industry trends where automotive companies are increasingly investing in digital interfaces to differentiate their offerings and improve user experience.From a market perspective, the integration of Unity's real-time 3D platform could potentially position Mazda as an innovator in the automotive sector. The focus on a 'human-centric' development concept aligns with consumer preferences for intuitive and personalized technology in vehicles. The anticipated improvements in operational efficiency and reduction in rework through Unity's platform could also translate into cost savings for Mazda, potentially impacting their profit margins positively.However, the implementation timeline suggests that the benefits of this partnership will materialize in the medium to long term, with GUIs expected in models from 2025-2027. Investors should monitor Mazda's progress in this area, as successful integration could enhance the brand's appeal and market share, while any setbacks could delay anticipated benefits. Automotive Industry Expert Mazda's partnership with Unity to develop advanced HMI and GUI for its future car models reflects a significant shift towards digitalization in the automotive industry. This move is not just about enhancing aesthetic appeal but also about improving safety and convenience through intuitive operation. The automotive industry has been witnessing a surge in the integration of gaming technology to create more immersive in-car experiences and Unity's expertise in real-time 3D content creation positions it as a suitable partner for Mazda's ambitions.Unity's involvement in the automotive sector over the past five years has shown potential for the game development platform to transcend its traditional entertainment boundaries. The application of gaming technology in car interfaces can lead to more responsive and adaptable systems, which could become a new industry standard if proven successful. Such advancements could also pave the way for further innovations, such as integration with autonomous driving technologies, adding another layer of complexity and potential to the evolving relationship between drivers and their vehicles. Financial Analyst The announcement of Unity's partnership with Mazda may have implications for the stock performance of both companies. Unity, traditionally associated with the gaming industry, is diversifying its revenue streams by venturing into the automotive sector, which could be received positively by investors as a sign of growth and innovation. For Mazda, leveraging Unity's technology is a forward-looking strategy that could enhance the company's competitive edge in an industry that is increasingly prioritizing digital and user experience innovation.Investors should consider the R&D costs associated with this co-development deal and the potential ROI based on the projected timeline for implementation. Unity's stock (NYSE:U) may see fluctuations based on the perceived success of this partnership and its ability to replicate its gaming industry success in the automotive sector. Meanwhile, Mazda's investment in digital transformation is a long-term play that could yield significant benefits, but with an impact that is likely several years away. As such, the immediate stock market reaction may be muted, with more significant movements expected as the partnership progresses and tangible results become evident. 03/06/2024 - 09:00 PM Co-development deal aims to create a more seamless, intuitive experience for 2025-2027 Mazda car models and beyond TOKYO & SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Unity (NYSE:U), the world’s leading platform of tools for creators to build and grow real-time games, apps, and experiences across multiple platforms, announced today a new partnership with Mazda Motor Corporation (“Mazda”) to develop a next-generation in-cabin car experience that will deliver a more seamless on-road experience for drivers.

Xerox Holdings Corporation Announces Pricing of Upsized Senior Notes Offering,2024-03-07T01:46:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Xerox Holdings Corporation announces the pricing of $500 million Senior Notes offering to refinance existing debt and pay related expenses. The offering size was increased by $100 million, with expected closing on March 20, 2024.","Xerox Holdings Corporation Announces Pricing of Upsized Senior Notes Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Xerox Holdings Corporation announces the pricing of $500 million Senior Notes offering to refinance existing debt and pay related expenses. The offering size was increased by $100 million, with expected closing on March 20, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Xerox Holdings Corporation's recent pricing of $500 million in Senior Notes at an 8.875% interest rate, due in 2029, indicates a strategic financial maneuver to refinance existing debt with more favorable terms. The increase in the offering size by $100 million suggests a strong demand from investors, which could imply confidence in the company's creditworthiness and future prospects. However, the high-interest rate compared to the notes being refinanced suggests a potentially increased cost of capital, which may affect the company's future interest expense and net income margins.Investors should consider the implications of this debt restructuring on the company's balance sheet. While it could lead to improved financial flexibility in the short term, the higher interest payments associated with the new notes could impact cash flows. It is also essential to monitor the company's future earnings reports for any changes in interest expenses and the overall impact on profitability. Legal Expert The offering's restriction to 'qualified institutional buyers' and non-U.S. persons outside the United States, in accordance with Rule 144A and Regulation S, is a common practice designed to streamline the issuance process while complying with the Securities Act of 1933. This limits the pool of potential investors but simplifies the regulatory burden. The absence of registration under the Securities Act or any state securities laws means these notes cannot be sold in the U.S. to the general public without an exemption, which is a typical approach for private placements.Stakeholders should be aware that the legal framework surrounding these transactions is complex and designed to protect both the issuer and investors. The company's adherence to these regulations suggests a cautious approach to compliance and risk management, which is a positive signal for investors looking for responsible corporate governance. Market Research Analyst The high yield of 8.875% on the new Senior Notes reflects current market conditions, where rising interest rates and economic uncertainty have pushed corporate borrowing costs higher. This yield is particularly notable when contrasted with the lower rates of the notes being refinanced. For Xerox, this move could be seen as proactive in locking in long-term financing before potential further rate hikes. Market trends should be analyzed to understand the broader implications of such high-yield offerings and investor appetite for corporate debt in this interest rate environment.Additionally, the success of this offering could set a precedent for similar companies considering refinancing options. The market's response to Xerox's offering may influence other corporations' strategies, potentially leading to a wave of refinancing activities in the sector. Monitoring peer responses and market reactions will be crucial for understanding the broader impact on the industry. 03/06/2024 - 08:46 PM NORWALK, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Xerox Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ: XRX) (the “Company”) announced today that it has priced an offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 8.875% Senior Notes due 2029 (“Notes”).

(""Innovent"") (HKEX: 01801), a world-class biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of cancer, metabolic, autoimmune, ophthalmology and other major diseases, today announced that the results of two clinical studies of IBI311 (anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody),a Phase I trial in healthy subjects and a Phase II trial in patients with thyroid eye disease (TED), in the form of oral presentation at the 39th Asia Pacific Academy of Ophthalmology (APAO) Congress and the 21st International Congress of Endocrinology (ICE), respectively. A Phase I Study of IBI311 (Anti-IGF-1R Monoclonal Antibody) in Chinese Healthy VolunteersAbstract No.: 200683 The oral presentation at the 39th APAO annual meeting was based on a single dose escalation Phase 1 clinical study (NCT05480597) to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single intravenous infusion of IBI311 in Chinese healthy volunteers. The primary endpoint of the study was safety variables, and secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and immunogenicity results. The results showed that IBI311 was safe and well tolerated, with the most common treatment-emergent AEs being Grade 1 or 2, transient, and most resolving without treatment. All IBI311 dose groups were tested negative for anti-drug antibodies during the study. These indicated that a single intravenous administration of IBI311 at various dose levels in healthy subjects is safe and well tolerated, and the PK profile supports dose selection for subsequent clinical development. A Phase II Study of IBI311 for the Treatment of Thyroid Eye DiseaseAbstract No.: # 792 The oral presentation at the 21st International Congress of Endocrinology was based on a multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled Phase II study (NCT05795621) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IBI311 in subjects with moderately to severely active TED. A total of 33 eligible subjects were randomized in a 2: 1 ratio to receive either IBI311 or placebo. The primary endpoint was the proptosis response rate at Week 12 of the study eye (defined as the percentage of subjects with a reduction in proptosis of ≥2 mm from baseline in the study eye without deterioration ≥ 2 mm increase of proptosis in the fellow eye). After 12 weeks, all subjects received IBI311 until Week 21. The results of the study showed: The primary endpoint was achieved: at Week 12, the proptosis responder rate in the study eye was significantly higher in the IBI311 group than in the placebo group (59.1% vs 18.2%, OR=11. 55, P=0. 0309).With continued treatment and follow-up to week 24, the IBI311 treatment group achieved up to 72.7% proptosis responder rate, 3.37 mm reduction in proptosis from baseline, 88.2% diplopia responder rate (defined as diplopia improvement ≥ grade 1).Safety: The overall safety profile of IBI311 was favorable, with the majority of AE being mild or moderate in severity, and no treatment-emergent AE leading to drug discontinuation/interruption in the IBI311 group.These results suggested that IBI311 significantly improves the proptosis in patients with TED in 12 weeks of treatment, and can lead to clinical benefits such as further improvement of proptosis and improvement of diplopia after continuation of treatment, with a favorable safety profile. Professor Xianqun Fan, the leading principal investigator of the study, the Academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and professor of ophthalmology at the Ninth People's Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, stated, "" As an organ-specific autoimmune disease closely related to thyroid disease, TED is one of the most common orbital diseases in adults, and seriously affects the visual function and appearance of patients. At present, there is no targeted therapy approved for the treatment of thyroid ophthalmopathy in China, and the options for therapeutic interventions are limited. IBI311 is currently the most advanced candidate in the clinical development in the TED therapeutic area. As the Principal Investigator of the IBI311 series of studies, I am very pleased to see the progress of IBI311 in TED presented in an oral presentation at the ophthalmology and endocrinology Congress. This is an academic recognition of Chinese studies. I also wish that IBI311 will be approved and available in the clinic in the near future to alleviate the disease burden of Chinese TED patients. "" Dr. Lei Qian, Vice President of Clinical Development of Innovent, stated, ""We are pleased to present the clinical development progress of IBI311 in thyroid eye disease at APAO Congress and ICE. This is another achievement of in-depth collaboration between Innovent and academia. It is also a prestigious recognition by the international ophthalmology and endocrinology academic community to Innovent IBI311's progress in the treatment of thyroid eye disease. We look forward to the approval of IBI311in the near future, providing treatments to TED patients. We will continue to make efforts to facilitate people's pursuit of a happy life and serve more patients."" About Thyroid Eye Disease (TED) TED, the most common orbit-related disease in adults, is an autoimmune disease involving ocular tissues and usually associated with Graves' disease (GD) and is the most common orbit-related disease in adults. TED occurs in approximately 25 to 50% of GD patients and can also be seen in other thyroid diseases, even in euthyroidism[1]. The annual incidence of TED is estimated to be 16/100,000 in women and 2.9/100,000 in men[2]，and the estimated prevalence of clinically relevant TED ranges from 0.1% to 0.3%[3]. According to disease severity, it can be classified into mild, moderate and severe. Although TED appears to affect women more often, severe cases occur more frequently in men. Patients aged 30 to 50 years are most commonly affected, and severe cases occur more frequently in patients over 50 years[4]. At present, the pathogenesis of TED is not fully understood, but several studies have shown that OFs present in muscle fibers, orbital fibrous connective tissue space are key factors leading to orbital soft tissue enlargement in TED[5]. The natural history of TED is classified into active and inactive phases[6]. The most common symptoms are dry eye, ocular gritty, photophobia, lacrimation, diplopia, and pressure behind the eye, while typical signs include upper eyelid retraction, eyelid edema, periorbital and conjunctival edema, and proptosis. TED is usually mild to moderate, and about 3–5% of patients with TED are severe, manifesting as severe pain, vision-threatening corneal ulcers, or compressive optic neuropathy[7]. In addition to potentially affecting vision, TED can have an extremely severe impact on the patient's appearance and social functioning as well as quality of life. Currently, the first-line treatment for moderately severe active TED is intravenous glucocorticoid therapy, which suffers from unsatisfactory improvement of proptosis and systemic side effects. The second-line treatment includes other immunomodulators, which also have risks related to unclear improvement of proptosis and treatment. Teprotumumab, Tocilizumab and Rituximab are recommended by the Chinese Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for Thyroid Eye Disease (2022)[8], the European Group on Graves' orbitopathy (EUGOGO)[9] and the consensus on thyroid eye disease of the American Thyroid Society and the European Thyroid Society[10] as the second-line treatment options for moderate to severe active TED. Teprotumumab targeting IGF-1R is recommended as first-line therapy for patients with clinically significant proptosis. About IBI311 IBI311 is a recombinant anti-IGF-1R antibody developed by Innovent Biopharmaceuticals for the treatment of TED. IGF-1R, a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that plays a role in development, metabolism, and immune regulation, is overexpressed in OFs, B, and T cells of TED patients[11]. IBI311 can bind IGF-1R, block IGF-1R signaling pathway activation mediated by IGF-1 and other related ligands or agonistic antibodies, thus reducing the expression of downstream inflammatory factors, inhibiting the synthesis of hyaluronic acid and other glycosaminoglycan caused by OFs activation, as well as related inflammatory reactions including tissue congestion and edema. IBI311 can inhibit adipocyte cellularization of OFs, thereby reducing the disease activity of patients with TED and improving proptosis, diplopia, ocular congestion and edema and other symptoms and signs.

Crescent Energy Company Announces Pricing of Secondary Public Offering of Common Stock and Agreement to Repurchase OpCo Units,2024-03-07T01:52:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Crescent Energy Company (CRGY) announces the pricing of an underwritten public offering of 12,000,000 shares of its Class A common stock at $10.50 per share. The offering is made by the Selling Stockholder, with an option for underwriters to purchase additional shares. The Company will not sell any shares in the offering.

The offering is made by the Selling Stockholder, with an option for underwriters to purchase additional shares. The Company will not sell any shares in the offering. The offering is expected to close on March 11, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Crescent Energy Company regarding the pricing of its public offering at $10.50 per share is a significant event with potential implications for the company's market capitalization and investor sentiment. A key aspect for consideration is the public offering price in relation to the current trading price of Crescent's stock. If the offering price is at a discount, this could indicate a potential dilution of value for existing shareholders, whereas a premium could suggest confidence in the company's future prospects.Another factor to consider is the volume of shares being offered. An offering of 12,000,000 shares, with an additional 1,800,000 shares potentially available through the underwriters' option, represents a substantial increase in the company's public float. This could lead to increased liquidity but may also result in downward pressure on the stock price if demand doesn't meet the new supply. The involvement of prominent financial institutions as joint book-running managers and co-managers could be seen as a vote of confidence in the offering's success.The OpCo Unit Purchase concurrent with the offering is a strategic move that requires careful analysis. By purchasing OpCo Units and canceling corresponding Class B common stock, the company is effectively managing its capital structure and could be aiming to consolidate voting power or streamline its subsidiary's ownership structure. The financial implications of this transaction, including any impact on earnings per share or return on equity, should be scrutinized. Market Research Analyst Understanding the context of Crescent Energy's public offering within the broader energy market is crucial. The sector has been subject to volatility due to fluctuating commodity prices, regulatory changes and shifts in energy demand. The company's decision to price its offering at a particular point may reflect its positioning in response to these market forces and its capital needs for potential growth opportunities or operational enhancements.It's also important to assess the market's reception of the offering. The success of such a large offering will depend on investors' appetite for energy stocks, which is influenced by current market trends, including the transition to renewable energy sources and the stability of oil and gas markets. The timing of the offering, in this case, might be aligned with favorable market conditions or strategic company developments that Crescent aims to capitalize on.The role of the Selling Stockholder, Independence Energy Aggregator L.P., is not to be overlooked. Their decision to offload a significant portion of Crescent stock could be interpreted in various ways by the market. Whether this is a routine portfolio rebalancing, a strategic divestment, or a response to company-specific factors could affect investor perception and, subsequently, the success of the offering. Legal Expert From a legal perspective, the offering's adherence to SEC regulations is paramount. The fact that the offering is being made through a registration statement on Form S-3 that became automatically effective upon filing suggests that Crescent is a well-established issuer with a track record of compliance. This could provide a level of assurance to potential investors regarding the company's regulatory diligence.Additionally, the conditional nature of the OpCo Unit Purchase upon the completion of the offering is a nuanced legal arrangement that warrants attention. It reflects a structured approach to the transaction that could mitigate certain risks associated with the offering. The terms and conditions set forth in the prospectus and prospectus supplement will be critical in understanding the rights and obligations of the parties involved and the potential impact on the company's financial and ownership structure.Moreover, the clear statement that this press release does not constitute an offer to sell securities is a standard disclaimer to prevent any misinterpretation of the communication as an offer, which would be subject to further legal and regulatory requirements. 03/06/2024 - 08:52 PM HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Crescent Energy Company (“Crescent” or the “Company”) (NYSE: CRGY) today announced the pricing of an underwritten public offering of 12,000,000 shares of its Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“common stock”), at a price to the public of $10.50 per share, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (the “Registration Statement”) filed on March 6, 2024 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

Financial Analyst The reported financial and operating results from Fortuna Silver Mines Inc. for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 reveal several critical data points. The company experienced an attributable net loss of $92.3 million for the quarter and $50.8 million for the full year, largely due to non-cash impairment charges of $90.6 million related to the anticipated closure of the San Jose Mine. However, when adjusted for non-recurring items, the company shows an attributable adjusted net income of $20.6 million for Q4 and $64.9 million for the full year, indicating underlying profitability despite the impairment charges.From a liquidity standpoint, the company's position appears robust, with $213.1 million available as of December 31, 2023. This strength is further underscored by the repayment of $41.0 million of its corporate credit facility in Q4 and an additional $25.0 million post-year-end. The net cash generated by operations of $105.1 million for the quarter and $296.3 million for the year reflect healthy cash flow generation capabilities.Investors should note the significant free cash flow from ongoing operations, amounting to $66.2 million in Q4 and $153.5 million for the full year, which is indicative of the company's ability to generate cash after accounting for capital expenditures and working capital requirements. The record gold equivalent production and increased sales by 24% year-over-year suggest operational scalability and efficiency gains.However, the all-in sustaining costs (AISC) per gold equivalent ounce have risen year-over-year, which could be a concern for margin sustainability, especially if gold prices face downward pressure. The company's strategy of aggressive debt reduction and exploration drilling could be a double-edged sword, potentially positioning it for future growth while also bearing the risk of increased leverage and exploration costs. Market Research Analyst The mining sector is sensitive to commodity price fluctuations and operational efficiency. Fortuna's increase in gold equivalent production and sales revenue is a positive signal for its competitive positioning in the market. The company's focus on organic growth through exploration, as seen with the 45,000-meter drill program at Diamba Sud and the planned Preliminary Economic Assessment by the end of 2024, suggests a forward-looking strategy aimed at resource expansion and diversification.Moreover, the performance of the Séguéla Mine processing facility at 26% above nameplate capacity indicates operational excellence which could attract investor interest. However, the short life of reserves at the San Jose Mine and the associated impairment charges raise concerns about the sustainability of production levels and the necessity for successful exploration outcomes to replace depleted reserves.The company's proactive capital allocation towards debt reduction and growth initiatives may resonate well with investors seeking companies with a disciplined financial approach. Yet, the illegal blockade at the San Jose Mine earlier in the year and the write-downs at various operations highlight the geopolitical and operational risks inherent in the mining industry. These factors must be weighed against the company's overall performance and growth prospects. Economist The mining industry plays a crucial role in the macroeconomic landscape, contributing to export earnings, employment and investment. Fortuna Silver Mines' financial results and operational achievements can have broader economic implications, particularly in the regions where it operates. The company's record production levels and sales growth contribute positively to the sector's economic output and can be seen as a barometer for the health of the commodity markets, especially precious metals like gold and silver.However, the impairment charges related to the San Jose Mine closure reflect the volatility and finite nature of mineral resources, which can impact local economies dependent on mining operations. Fortuna's strategic investments in exploration and development projects, such as those in Senegal and Côte d'Ivoire, underscore the importance of continuous investment in resource development to sustain economic contributions over time.The company's ability to generate significant free cash flow provides it with the financial flexibility to navigate economic cycles and invest in growth opportunities. This is particularly relevant in an environment where interest rates are rising, as higher financing costs can constrain capital investment and economic expansion. Fortuna's focus on debt reduction is a prudent measure in such a fiscal climate, potentially enhancing its resilience against economic downturns and market volatility. 03/06/2024 - 11:04 PM (All amounts expressed in US dollars, tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise stated) VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fortuna Silver Mines Inc.

Ganoza, President and CEO, commented, “In the fourth quarter Fortuna delivered strong free cash-flow from ongoing operations of $65 million compared to $70 million in the third quarter. The Company also achieved record gold equivalent production of 136,154 ounces and record sales of $265.3 million, representing increases of 6% and 9% respectively compared to Q3.” Mr. Ganoza added, “Fourth quarter net earnings were impacted by non-cash write-downs and the remaining short life of reserves at San Jose, where we have recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $90.6 million. At San Jose our exploration continues pursuing the discovery of new resources with the aim of extending production beyond 2024.” Mr. Ganoza continued, “Fortuna had a strong close to 2023, with record annual gold production exceeding guidance and silver falling short by 7%. Gold equivalent production increased 13% to a record 452,389 gold equivalent ounces compared to 2022, and we have guided further growth in 2024. Record annual sales of $842.4 million were 24% above 2022. All our mines met or improved site AISC guidance for the year with the only exception being the San Jose Mine, which is operating on the tail end of reserves and had to contest with an illegal blockade at the beginning of the year. Mr. Ganoza concluded, “For 2024 our capital allocation priorities continue to be centered on providing maximum balance sheet flexibility through further debt reduction, and funding of aggressive organic growth programs with approximately 200,000 meters of exploration drilling planned across the portfolio. The Diamba Sud project in Senegal and the Séguéla Mine in Côte d´Ivoire are priorities for our exploration programs during the year.” Fourth Quarter 2023 and Full Year 2023 Consolidated Results Three months ended December 31, Years ended December 31,(Expressed in millions) 2023 2022 % Change 2023 2022 % ChangeSales 265.3 164.7 61% 842.4 681.5 24%Mine operating income 51.9 26.0 100% 190.0 146.8 29%Operating loss (77.4) (173.1) 55% (0.4) (113.6) 100%Attributable net loss (92.3) (152.8) 40% (50.8) (128.1) 60%Attributable loss per share - basic (0.30) (0.52) 43% (0.17) (0.44) 61%Adjusted attributable net income1 20.6 6.4 222% 64.9 41.4 57%Adjusted EBITDA1 120.3 55.8 116% 335.1 245.5 36%Net cash provided by operating activities 105.1 49.6 112% 296.9 194.2 53%Free cash flow from ongoing operations1 66.2 4.4 1,405% 153.5 69.2 122%Production cash cost ($/oz Au Eq) 840 873 (4%) 874 849 3%All-in sustaining cash cost ($/oz Au Eq) 1,509 1,579 (4%) 1,508 1,431 5%Capital expenditures2 Sustaining 46.8 33.9 38% 136.1 98.1 39%Non-sustaining3 1.8 (2.3) 178% 5.2 8.2 (37%)Séguéla construction - 23.5 (100%) 50.0 107.7 (54%)Brownfields 5.5 6.5 (15%) 16.1 23.3 (31%)As at December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 % ChangeCash and cash equivalents 128.1 80.5 59%Net liquidity position (excluding letters of credit) 213.1 150.5 42%Shareholder's equity attributable to Fortuna shareholders 1,238.4 1,244.8 (1%)1 Refer to Non-IFRS Financial Measures section at the end of this news release and to the MD&A accompanying the Company’s financial statements filed on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca for a description of the calculation of these measures.2 Capital expenditures are presented on a cash basis 3 Non-sustaining expenditures include greenfields exploration Figures may not add due to rounding Fourth Quarter 2023 Results Attributable Net Loss and Adjusted Net IncomeAttributable net loss for the period was $92.3 million compared to an attributable net loss of $152.8 million in Q4 2022 The loss in the quarter is explained by the following items: An impairment charge of $90.6 million related to the anticipated closure of the San Jose Mine in late 2024, as the updated mine plan is scheduled to exhaust Mineral Reserves by the end of the year compared to mid-2025 as previously plannedA write-down of materials inventory of $10.1 million at the San Jose, Yaramoko and Lindero MinesA write-down of low-grade ore stockpiles of $5.4 million at the Lindero MineA $6.4 million severance provision associated with the scheduled closure of the San Jose MineA write-down of $5.9 million related to greenfield exploration projects in Mexico and Argentina After adjusting for impairment charges and other non-recurring items, adjusted attributable net income was $20.6 million or $0.07 per share compared to $6.4 million or $0.02 per share in Q4 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher gold sales volume and higher gold prices. Higher gold sales volume was mainly due to the contribution of Séguéla in its second full quarter of production. This was combined with 7% higher sales at Yaramoko from higher processed head grade. This was partially offset by lower sales at San Jose related to lower head grades consistent with the Mineral Reserve and a reduction in mined tonnage related to operational challenges in backfilling and blasting activities. The realized gold price was $1,990 per ounce in Q4 2023 compared to $1,737 per ounce in Q4 2022. Other items impacting the adjusted net income for the quarter compared to Q4 2022 were higher G&A of $3.3 million, mostly related to the addition of Séguéla G&A and timing of execution on certain corporate G&A items; higher foreign exchange loss of $2.4 million primarily related to 118% devaluation of the official exchange rate in Argentina as part of the measures taken by the new elected government to achieve a more sustainable real exchange rate in the short term; Other expenses of $2.7 million related to administrative penalties at Yaramoko, and a higher interest expense of $4.0 million as a result of higher interest rates and $1.4 million of interest charges capitalized in Q4 2022 vs nil in Q4 2023. This was partially offset by $12.4 million of investment income related to cross-border, Argentine pesos denominated bond trades. Depreciation and DepletionDepreciation and depletion increased $27.1 million to $71.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $44.5 million in the comparable period of 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in ounces sold as well as higher depletion per ounce at Séguéla due to the depletion of the purchase price allocation from the Roxgold acquisition of $17.1 million. Adjusted EBITDA and Cash FlowAdjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $120.3 million, a margin of 45% over sales, compared to $55.8 million and margin over sales of 34%, reported in the same period in 2022. The main driver for the increase in EBITDA was the contribution from Séguéla with EBITDA margin of 73% in Q4 2023, combined with higher EBITDA from Yaramoko related to higher gold output. In addition, adjusted EBITDA reflects the positive impact from the inclusion of $12.4 million of investment income at our Argentine operations. The trade associated with the investment income was a one-off event executed under a time limited waiver granted by the government of Argentina in Q4 to allow exporters a partial recovery of economic losses incurred from the accumulated lag of the nominal exchange rate with respect to inflation. Net cash generated by operations for the quarter was $105.1 million or $0.34 per share compared to $49.6 million or $0.17 per share in Q4 2022. The increase of $54.8 million reflects higher EBITDA of $61.8 million. Free cash flow from ongoing operations for the quarter was $66.2 million compared to $4.4 million in Q4 2022. The increase reflects higher net cash generated by operations. Cash cost per ounce and AISC Cash cost per gold equivalent ounce was $840, a decrease from the $873 reported in Q4 2022 as the contribution of lower cost ounces from Séguéla in Q4 2023 was offset by partially offset by higher cost per ounce at San Jose, which increased by over 64% due to lower production and higher costs year over year. This combined with higher cost per gold ounce at Lindero and Yaramoko of $120 and $131 respectively associated with lower head grades at Lindero and higher costs in Q4 2023 at Yaramoko. AISC per gold equivalent ounce was $1,509 in Q4, slightly below the $1,579 recorded the prior year due to lower capex on a per ounce basis, partially offset by higher royalties related to the higher realized gold price. Full Year 2023 Results Attributable Net Loss and Adjusted Net IncomeAttributable net loss for the year was $50.8 million, compared to an attributable net loss of $128.1 million in 2022. The loss in 2023 is explained by impairment charges of $90.6 million at the San Jose Mine explained above. After adjusting for impairment charges and other non-recurring items, attributable adjusted net income for 2023 was $64.9 million or $0.22 per share, compared to $41.4 million or $0.14 per share in 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher gold sales volume and higher gold prices. Higher gold sales volume was mainly due to the contribution of Séguéla in the second half of the year upon successful commissioning and ramp-up in Q2 2023, and higher sales volume at Yaramoko explained by higher processed head grades in 2023. This was partially offset by lower production at Lindero, aligned with the grade profile in the mine plan, and lower head grades and processed ore at San Jose, explained by declining head grades in reserves and the impact of the 15 day mine stoppage in Q2 and related lingering operational challenges during the year. The realized gold price was $1,948 per ounce in 2023 compared to $1,802 per ounce in 2022. Other items impacting the adjusted net income compared to 2022 were higher G&A of $2.7 million, mostly related to the addition of Séguéla G&A; higher foreign exchange loss of $4.6 million mostly related to the devaluation of the Argentine peso as described above; higher other expenses of $9.7 million related to $3.5 million of stand-by charges at San Jose and Yaramoko in Q2 2023, $2.8 million related to a new agreement with the worker´s union at San Jose in Q2 2023, and $3.7 million of administrative penalties at Yaramoko payable to the Ministry of Mines recorded in Q2 and Q4 2023, and a higher interest expense of $7.5 million as a result of an increased debt balance outstanding, higher interest rates and discontinued capitalized interest charges in the second half of the year. This was partially offset by $12.4 million of investment income related to cross-border, Argentine pesos denominated bond trades. Depreciation and DepletionDepreciation and depletion for 2023 increased $46.8 million to $219.7 million compared to $172.8 million in 2022. The increase was primarily due an increase in ounces sold, the start of depletion at Séguéla, including $25.3 million related to the purchase price allocation from Roxgold, and higher depletion at Yaramoko due to declining reserves which increased the depletion rate of new capital additions underground. Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash FlowAdjusted EBITDA for the year was $335.1 million, a margin of 40% over sales, compared to $245.5 million reported in 2022, representing a margin of 36% over sales. The main drivers for the increase were the contribution of Séguéla with EBITDA margin of 69%, and higher production and improved margins at Yaramoko. In addition, adjusted EBITDA reflects the positive impact from the inclusion of $12.4 million of investment income at our Argentine operations as described above. Net cash generated by operations for 2023 was $296.9 million or $1.00 per share compared to $194.2 million or $0.67 per share in 2022. The increase of $102.7 million is explained by higher EBITDA of $89.6 million combined with lower income tax paid of $16.3 million in 2023 primarily due to lower taxes paid at the San Jose Mine, no taxes paid at the Séguéla Mine in 2023 and higher repatriation withholding taxes incurred in 2022. Free cash flow from ongoing operations for 2023 was $153.5 million compared to $69.2 million in 2022. The increase of $84.3 million reflects higher net cash generated by operations, partially offset by higher sustaining capital expenditures, including brownfields explorations. Sustaining capital expenditures on a cash basis increased by $27.6 million to $143.6 million explained by higher CAPEX at Lindero related to the leach-pad expansion and capex incurred at Séguéla in the second half of 2023. Cash cost per ounce and AISC Cash cost per equivalent gold ounce was $874, slightly above the $849 reported in 2022 as the contribution of lower cost ounces from Séguéla in the second half of 2023 was offset by higher cost per gold ounce at Lindero of $182 related mainly to lower planned head grades in 2023, and higher cost per equivalent gold ounce at San Jose of $379 explained primarily by lower processed ore and lower head grades. AISC per ounce of gold equivalent of $1,508 in 2023 was $77 above the $1,431 recorded the prior year due mainly to higher cash cost per gold equivalent ounce and higher capex at Lindero related to the leach pad expansion. Liquidity Total liquidity available to the Company as at December 31, 2023 was $213.1 million, comprised of $128.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and $85.0 million undrawn (excluding letters of credit) on the Company’s revolving $250.0 million credit facility. Total net debt as of the end of the quarter was $83.2 million. Subsequent to the year end the Company paid down an additional $25.0 million on its corporate credit facility, taking the outstanding debt amount to $140.0 million.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, a total of 1,556,000 tonnes of ore were placed on the heap leach pad, with an average gold grade of 0.63 g/t, containing an estimated 31,665 ounces of gold. Gold production for Q4 2023 totaled 29,591 ounces. This represents a 1% increase in total ounces, from the previous quarter. Gold production was comprised of 24,977 ounces in doré bars, 4,443 ounces of gold contained in fine carbon, and 171 ounces contained in copper concentrate. Ore mined was 2.1 million tonnes, with a stripping ratio of 0.6:1. The stripping ratio in the fourth quarter was 45 percent lower than the third quarter of 2023. For the full year 2023 gold production totaled 101,238 ounces, achieving midpoint of annual production guidance. Gold production comprised of 94,905 ounces in doré bars, 6,015 ounces in gold contained in fine carbon, and 319 ounces contained in copper concentrate. The stripping ratio for 2023 was 1.14:1, aligned with the mining plan for the year. The cash cost per ounce of gold for the quarter ending December 31, 2023, was $934 compared to $814 in the same period of 2022. For the year ending December 31, 2023, the cash cost per ounce was $920, an increase from $739 in 2022. The increase in cash cost per ounce of gold for both the quarter and for the full year was primarily due to lower processed gold grades in accordance with the mine plan. The all-in sustaining cash cost per gold ounce sold during Q4 2023 was $1,557, up from $1,219 in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year of 2023, the all-in sustaining cash cost was $1,565, compared to $1,140 in 2022. The increase both for the quarter and the year was driven by higher cash costs, along with increased sustaining capital expenditures related to the leach pad expansion. This was partially mitigated by higher copper by-product credits. As of December 31, 2023, the leach pad expansion project is approximately 23% complete. Mobilization of the civil contractor’s personnel and equipment has advanced with earth moving activities having commenced in January. Deliveries of geomembrane and geosynthetic clay liner are on-track, with the remaining materials expected to arrive on site in the first quarter of 2024. The leach pad expansion remains on schedule for completion during the second half of 2024.

Refer to Non-IFRS Financial Measures section at the end of this news release and to the MD&A accompanying the Company’s financial statements filed on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca for a description of the calculation of these measures.2 Capital expenditures are presented on a cash basis. The Yaramoko Mine produced 28,235 ounces of gold in the fourth quarter of 2023 with an average gold head grade of 7.16 g/t, 8% and 11% increases when compared to the same period in 2022. Higher production was due to higher grades partially offset by lower mill throughput in the fourth quarter and a planned maintenance shutdown in December. Gold production in 2023 totaled 117,711 ounces, achieving the higher end of the annual guidance range. The cash cost per ounce of gold sold for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, was $949 compared to $818 in the same period in 2022. The increase for the quarter is mainly attributed to higher mining costs, particularly due to equipment, energy, and overhead expenses, but was partially offset by higher gold production. For the year ending December 31, 2023, the cash cost per ounce of gold sold was $809, a decrease from $840 in 2022. The full year decrease is mainly due to increased production and lower mining costs during prior quarters. The all-in sustaining cash cost per gold ounce sold was $1,720 for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to $1,829 in the same period of 2022. The change in the quarter was primarily due to the increased cash cost described above, increased royalties and an administrative penalty in Q4, offset by reduced capital expenditures. For the full year, the all-in sustaining cash cost per gold ounces sold was $1,499 in 2023, compared to $1,529 in 2022. The increased royalties and administrative penalty costs in Q4 2023 were offset by increased production and decreased costs earlier in the year. Exploration and grade control drilling success in conjunction with underground development extended mineralization on the western side of the Zone 55 mineralized structure. This provided additional mining areas which demonstrated wider and higher-grade extensions of mineralization within and beyond the existing resource boundary.

Refer to Non-IFRS Financial Measures.2 Capital expenditures are presented on a cash basis In the fourth quarter of 2023, mined material totaled 387,624 tonnes of ore, averaging 3.62 g/t Au, and containing an estimated 43,096 ounces of gold from the Antenna Pit. Movement of waste during the quarter totaled 2,110,209 tonnes, for a strip ratio of 5.4:1. Séguéla produced 43,096 ounces of gold, a 37% increase and a 5% decrease, respectively, compared to the third quarter of 2023. The increase in gold production is directly related to the mill achieving consistently higher throughput, processing 387,624 tonnes, a 25% increase over the previous quarter. Gold production in 2023 totaled 78,617 ounces, exceeding the higher end of the annual guidance range. Reconciliation of tonnes, grade, and gold ounces mined for the fourth quarter from Antenna show a positive correlation when compared to the long-term reserve model with 6% higher ore tonnes mined at 16% higher grades resulting in 24% more gold ounces extracted than predicted in the model. Process plant performance continued to improve as feed characteristics were stabilized and initial bottlenecks addressed. Recovery in the fourth quarter increased to 94.9%, ahead of feasibility study assumptions. Plant productivity also continued to improve with throughput in the fourth quarter being 186 tonnes/hour, a 20% increase on the 154 tonnes/hour nameplate capacity. Cash cost per gold ounce sold was $323 for Q4 2023 and $357 for the full year, which was below plan and guidance, primarily due to higher production, higher head grades, lower consumable consumption, and lower service costs. All-in sustaining cash cost per gold ounce sold was $737 for Q4 2023 and $760 for the full year, which was below plan and guidance, primarily due to lower cash cost and higher sales volume, partially offset by higher capital expenditures.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, San Jose produced 1,023,525 ounces of silver and 6,345 ounces of gold, 31% and 25% decreases respectively, at average head grades for silver and gold of 145 g/t and 0.91 g/t, 25% and 20% decreases respectively, when compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease in silver and gold production for the quarter is explained by the declining grade profile of Mineral Reserves in the mine plan, as well as lower tonnage extracted from the mine. The reduction in tonnage is due to operational challenges leading to delays in backfilling and blasting operations in stopes P and Q during December 2023. During the fourth quarter, the processing plant milled 241,035 tonnes at an average of 2,678 tonnes per day. Production in 2023 totaled 4,656,631 ounces of silver and 28,559 ounces of gold, 12% and 16% below annual guidance range, respectively. The decrease in production is attributed primarily to the 15-day illegal union blockade in the second quarter, the associated disruption to operations thereafter, and a silver and gold head grade reconciliation to reserves at the lower end of guidance range. The cash cost per silver equivalent ounce for the three months ending December 31, 2023, was $17.57, an increase from $11.16 in the same period of 2022. This increase was primarily attributed to lower head grades, as discussed above, and higher cash costs per tonne primarily related to the appreciation of the Mexican peso, higher mining contractor tariffs, and a 7% decrease in processed ore. For the year ending December 31, 2023 the cash cost per silver equivalent ounce sold was $14.40 compared to $10.56. The full year increase was driven by lower head grades, and higher cash cost per tonne, which was similarly influenced by the appreciation of the Mexican Peso and 10% lower tonnes processed. The all-in sustaining cash cost of payable silver equivalent for the three months ended December 31, 2023 increased by 42% to $21.98 per ounce, and full year 2023 increased by 28% to $19.40 per ounce. This compares to $15.53 per ounce and $15.11 per ounce for the same periods in 2022. These increases were mainly driven by higher cash costs and lower production, slightly mitigated by lower workers' participation costs. The decrease in Brownfields expenditures is primarily attributable to reduced drilling activity in 2023. Drilling in 2023 was however higher than initially anticipated, owing to the emergent drilling campaign at the Yessi vein, discovered in the third quarter of the year. Exploration at the Yessi vein continues.

In the fourth quarter, the Caylloma Mine produced 330,478 ounces of silver at an average head grade of 88 g/t, a 21% and 17% increase, respectively, when compared to the previous quarter. Silver production for 2023 totaled 1,227,060 ounces, exceeding the upper end of annual guidance range by 10%. Lead and zinc production for the quarter was 10.8 million pounds of lead, and 13.9 million pounds of zinc. Lead and zinc production rose by 24% and 11%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2022. Head grades averaged 3.84%, and 5.00%, a 19% and 8% increase, respectively, when compared to the previous quarter. Record lead and zinc production for 2023 totaled 40.9 and 55.1 million pounds, respectively. Increased production is the result of positive grade reconciliation to the reserve model in levels 16 and 18 of the Animas vein. Gold production for the quarter totaled 109 ounces with an average head grade of 0.11 g/t. The cash cost per silver equivalent ounce sold for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, was $13.67 compared to $12.46 in the same period in 2022. The increase for the quarter is attributed primarily due to higher cash cost per tonne, higher treatment charges and the impact of higher silver prices on the calculation of silver equivalent ounces . For the year ended December 31, 2023, the cash cost per ounce of gold sold was $14.3, compared to $12.3 in 2022. The full year increase was driven mainly by the same factors explained above for the quarter. The all-in sustaining cash cost per ounce of payable silver equivalent for the three months ended December 31, 2023, increased 10% to $22.34, compared to $20.30 for the same period in 2022. The all-in sustaining cash cost per ounce of payable silver equivalent for the full year 2023 increased 11% to $19.90, compared to $17.97 in 2022. The increases were mainly driven by the impact of higher silver prices on the calculation of silver equivalent ounces, higher cash costs per ounce and higher capital costs. Underground development for the quarter was mainly focused on mine levels 15, 16, and 18. The increase in Brownfields expenditures is primarily attributable to greater meterage and additional diamond drilling.

The internal review did not impact 2023 financial estimates, but revealed efforts to delay payments and accelerate receivables to meet targets. Potential material weaknesses in internal controls were identified, impacting the company's reporting and remediation plans. Positive None. Negative Lack of transparency in senior management's actions affecting free cash flow targets Potential material weaknesses in internal controls impacting reporting and remediation plans Financial Analyst The disclosure of internal financial mismanagement at The Chemours Company, including the manipulation of cash flow measures to meet targets, is a critical concern for stakeholders. Such actions can distort the financial health of a company and mislead investors. The deliberate delay of payables and acceleration of receivables to artificially meet free cash flow targets not only violates ethical standards but may also lead to legal repercussions and loss of investor trust. The acknowledgment of potential material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting suggests that the company's financial statements may not be reliable, which could result in stock price volatility and reevaluation of the company's creditworthiness by lenders. Legal Expert The revelation of ethical code violations by senior management raises significant legal concerns. The lack of transparency and inadequate controls in handling the Ethics Hotline reports may lead to regulatory scrutiny, including potential investigations by the SEC. The situation underscores the importance of robust internal controls and the legal implications of their absence. If material weaknesses are confirmed, it could result in restatements of prior financial results and impact ongoing and future litigation, with associated costs and potential penalties affecting the company's financial position. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Chemours' situation illustrates the sensitivity of the market to corporate governance issues. The company's stock could face downward pressure as the market reacts to the perceived increase in risk. The incident may also trigger a broader industry review of practices related to financial reporting and internal controls. Competitors with stronger governance frameworks may benefit in terms of investor confidence. The company's efforts to address the identified issues and improve its controls will be closely monitored by the market and could influence long-term investor sentiment. 03/06/2024 - 08:30 PM WILMINGTON, Del.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- As previously disclosed, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of The Chemours Company (“Chemours” or “the Company”) (NYSE: CC), with the assistance of independent outside counsel, has been overseeing an internal review. The review relates to an anonymous report made to the Chemours Ethics Hotline regarding the matters described below. A substantially complete report of the findings of the internal review was delivered to the full Board on March 5, 2024. Chair Dawn Farrell said “The Chemours Board of Directors takes these issues very seriously and appreciates the diligent efforts by the Audit Committee, with support from its counsel and Company management, to review these matters. We are also grateful for the leadership and dedication of our interim CEO and CFO, their senior management team and all our employees at our business units for their work every day to serve our valued customers.” The Audit Committee review determined that there was a lack of transparency with the Company’s Board of Directors by the members of senior management who were placed on administrative leave last week due to the payables and receivables timing actions described below, and their effect on free cash flow targets at the end of the relevant periods. As a result, the Audit Committee concluded that, in connection with the actions described below, the members of senior management who were placed on administrative leave last week violated the Company’s Code of Ethics applicable to the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, and the Controller relating to the ”promot[ion of] full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure.” The findings of the internal review do not affect the preliminary, unaudited estimates of operating results and other financial measures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 as disclosed in the Company’s press release dated February 29, 2024. The Audit Committee’s determinations, based on the review conducted with the assistance of independent outside counsel, included, among other things, that the members of senior management who were placed on administrative leave last week engaged in efforts in the fourth quarter of 2023 to delay payments to certain vendors that were originally due to be paid in the fourth quarter of 2023 until the first quarter of 2024, and to accelerate the collection of receivables into the fourth quarter of 2023 that were originally not due to be received until the first quarter of 2024. The Audit Committee found that these individuals engaged in these efforts in part to meet free cash flow targets that the Company had communicated publicly, and which also would be part of a key metric for determining incentive compensation applicable to executive officers. As noted above, there was a lack of transparency with the Company’s Board of Directors by the members of senior management who were placed on administrative leave with respect to these actions. As previously disclosed, as of December 31, 2023, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents totaled approximately $1.8 billion, of which $1.2 billion was unrestricted. The Audit Committee and Company management continue to work on assessing the net impact on cash flow measures of the working capital timing actions detailed above, which had the effect of significantly increasing the cash flow measures, including free cash flow, for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, with a corresponding anticipated decrease in these measures in the first quarter of 2024. The Audit Committee review also determined that similar actions, though to a lesser extent, were taken in the fourth quarter of 2022, resulting in a significant increase in these cash flow measures for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, and a decrease in these measures in the first quarter of 2023. The Company is working diligently to complete its year-end reporting process, including its review of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, and to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC as promptly as practicable. As noted above, the Audit Committee review relates to an anonymous report made to the Chemours Ethics Hotline that was not elevated to the General Counsel or the Audit Committee, until the matter was identified in connection with the Company’s year-end 2023 external audit process. The Audit Committee determined that the failure resulted from inadequate controls and procedures regarding the evaluation and escalation of hotline reports and poor judgment by certain employees who handle the intake of such reports. As a result of the foregoing, the Company is evaluating one or more potential material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 with respect to maintaining effective controls related to the control environment, including the effectiveness of the “tone at the top” set by certain members of senior management and the information and communication components of the COSO internal control framework, including controls over the Chemours Ethics Hotline program. Accordingly, the Company expects to report on material weaknesses as of December 31, 2023 and its related remediation plans in its Annual Report on Form 10-K.

GWRS aims for continued growth through organic and acquisitive opportunities. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results by Global Water Resources, Inc. exhibit a robust growth pattern, with significant increases in both quarterly and annual revenues. The 11.4% and 18.6% revenue growth rates for the respective periods are substantial, outpacing general utility sector average growth rates. The deployment of $22.3 million into infrastructure investments is a strategic move to bolster long-term asset value and operational efficiency. The company's ability to secure a $20 million note issuance at a 6.91% interest rate reflects investor confidence despite the current interest rate environment. However, the increase in operating expenses, although partially offset by lower professional fees, warrants attention as it could impact future margins.From a shareholder perspective, the dividend increase to $0.30096 per share is a positive signal of the company's financial health and commitment to returning value. The company's capital resource position, including cash and equivalents and the availability of a revolving line of credit, suggests a strong liquidity status to support ongoing operations and growth initiatives. The settlement agreement with the Arizona Corporation Commission, if approved, could provide a stable revenue stream and facilitate the consolidation of utilities, which is often a catalyst for operational synergies and cost savings. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of Farmers Water Co. and the reported organic growth in service connections indicate Global Water Resources, Inc.'s aggressive expansion strategy within the Arizona market. This strategy aligns with Arizona’s positive population and economic trends, especially within the Phoenix metropolitan statistical area (MSA). The company's focus on both organic and acquisitive growth is well-supported by the state's economic indicators, such as the 3.5% increase in population and the 2.0% increase in employment rate.While the company notes a weakness in the single-family housing market, the upward trend in multi-family permits suggests diversification in the housing sector, which could mitigate risks associated with market fluctuations. The significant capital investments in Arizona, including those by major manufacturers, are likely to contribute to sustained demand for water and wastewater services, providing a favorable outlook for the company's growth trajectory. The anticipated rate case activities and potential for new acquisitions are also key factors that could influence the company's performance and market positioning in the near future. Economist The financial performance of Global Water Resources, Inc. reflects broader economic trends, such as the impact of climate on water consumption. The reported 14.8% increase in water consumption for the year is likely influenced by higher-than-average temperatures and lower-than-average precipitation, which could be indicative of longer-term climate trends affecting water resource management companies. This could have implications for future pricing strategies and conservation initiatives.Moreover, the economic growth within the Phoenix MSA, including substantial capital investments and job growth in manufacturing, suggests a favorable business climate for utility companies. However, the potential volatility in housing markets due to macroeconomic factors like inflation and interest rates could impact the rate of new service connections and, consequently, revenue growth. The company's proactive approach to filing rate cases indicates a strategic management of regulatory environments to ensure revenue stability amidst economic uncertainties. 03/06/2024 - 09:00 PM PHOENIX, March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global Water Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ: GWRS), a pure-play water resource management company, reported results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. All comparisons are to the same year-ago period unless otherwise noted.

The first monthly dividend payment at the new rate was paid on December 28, 2023 to holders of record on December 14, 2023. Operational Highlights Active service connections increased 9.8% to 61,791 at December 31, 2023 as compared to year-end 2022. The increase was due to the acquisition of Farmers Water Co. (Farmers Water) completed in February 2023, and organic growth. Excluding Farmers Water, active service connections increased 3.7%.Water consumption increased 19.4% to 0.90 billion gallons in the fourth quarter of 2023. For the full year, water consumption increased 14.8% to 3.97 billion gallons.Recycled water volume increased 12.6% to 818 million gallons in the fourth quarter of 2023. For the full year, recycled water volume increased 6.2% to 1.4 billion gallons.Invested $3.7 million in infrastructure projects to support existing utilities and continued growth during the fourth quarter of 2023. For the full year, invested $22.3 million in infrastructure projects. Subsequent Events On October 26, 2023, the company entered into a note purchase agreement for the issuance of an aggregate principal amount of $20 million of 6.91% Senior Secured Notes due on January 3, 2034. Pursuant to the terms of the note purchase agreement, the company issued the notes on January 3, 2024. On February 29, 2024, the company entered into a settlement agreement with the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) Utilities Division Staff regarding the Saguaro District rate case application for seven of the company’s regulated utilities, which will be considered by an Administrative Law Judge and the ACC for approval. The agreement includes, among other things, a recommended annual revenue increase of approximately $351,000, acquisition premiums for six of the company’s utilities, a capital structure matching the company’s previous rate of 55% equity with a 9.6% return on equity, consolidation of the seven utilities, and an accounting deferral for Rincon. There can be no assurance that the ACC will approve the settlement agreement and the ACC could take other actions as a result of the rate case. Further, it is possible that the ACC may determine to decrease future rates. There can also be no assurance as to the timing of when an approved rate increase (if any) would go into effect. Management Commentary “2023 was another year of strong progress across our business, including safety and compliance, business development, and top-line growth with increased profitability,” commented Global Water Resources president and CEO, Ron Fleming. “Our strong financial results were primarily driven by increased rates, and organic growth in connections along with the addition of new connections from the acquisition of Farmers Water. “In 2022 and 2023, multi-family permits trended upwards, adding stability to the housing market. While we saw an overall weakness in the market for single-family housing in 2023, according to the W.P. Carey School of Business Greater Phoenix Blue Chip Panel Real Estate Consensus the outlook is improving. They anticipate permitting to increase in 2024 due to the improvement in the second half of 2023 combined with the expectations of modestly declining mortgage rates in 2024. “According to the Arizona Commerce Authority, $76.3 billion of capital has been invested in Arizona for the years 2021 through 2023, which reflects an increase of 274% over the preceding three years. This has recently included major new manufacturing facility announcements by Taiwan Semiconductor, Intel, and Proctor & Gamble.” Global Water Resources CFO, Mike Liebman, commented: “Our current capital resources of approximately $35 million reflects cash and cash equivalents, including $20 million from our recent issuance of new senior secured notes in January 2024, and the amount available for borrowing under our revolving line of credit. We believe our capital resources enable us to be a strong utility partner for the communities we have the privilege to serve and allow us to continue our growth initiatives. “In addition to all of this increased growth, we anticipate the next few years to include various rate case activity at the Arizona Corporation Commission. During the fourth quarter 2023, the Company notified the Arizona Corporation Commission of its intention to file a rate case for Farmers during 2024 and for Santa Cruz and Palo Verde, where most of our customers reside, in 2025.” Fleming concluded: “We continue to see organic and acquisitive growth opportunities, as the demand for innovative water and wastewater services continues to increase in the fast-growing Metropolitan Phoenix area. We expect the demand to drive growth across our business, which is supported by the outlook for continued population and job growth throughout metro-Phoenix and our other service areas. Finally, we continue to search for opportunities on the acquisition front and hope to have an announcement in the next quarter. Financial Summary Revenues Revenues in the fourth quarter of 2023 increased $1.3 million or 11.4% to $12.4 million compared to $11.1 million in the same period in 2022. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to the increase in rates related to Rate Decision No. 78644, new connections associated with the acquisition of Farmers Water in February 2023, and year-over-year organic growth in connections. Revenues for the full year 2023 increased $8.3 million or 18.6% to $53.0 million. The increase was primarily due to elevated water consumption, revenue from infrastructure coordination and financing arrangements (ICFA) earned during 2023 that did not occur in the prior year, increased rates related to Rate Decision No. 78644, new connections associated with the acquisition of Farmers Water in February 2023, and organic connection growth. The elevated water consumption related to higher-than-average temperatures and lower-than-average precipitation also contributed to the top-line growth. Operating Expenses Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 increased approximately $0.8 million or 8.5% to $10.7 million compared to $9.9 million in the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily related to the acquisition of Farmers Water in February 2023, higher salaries and wages and employee related expenses due to an increase in head count, and increased depreciation expense as a direct result of the increase in fixed assets. Operating expenses for the full year 2023 increased approximately $3.8 million or 10.4% to $40.7 million compared to $36.9 million in the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily related to the acquisition of Farmers Water in February 2023, higher salaries and wages and employee related expenses due to an increase in head count and a cost of living adjustment that impacted five months of 2022 as compared to all months of 2023. The increase in operating expenses was also due to higher power costs attributable to increased pump usage related to escalated consumption and additional connections, increased chemicals and supplies from both higher consumption and rising costs, and increased depreciation expense as a direct result of the increase in fixed assets. The increased operating expenses were partially offset by lower professional fees and regulatory expenses that were directly related to the rate case activity and acquisition-related matters in 2022. Other Expense Total other expense was $0.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $0.3 million in the same period in 2022. Total other expense during the full year 2023 increased $0.1 million or 3.8% to $1.4 million compared to $1.4 million for the same period in 2022. The increase was related to a $0.1 million decrease in income associated with Buckeye growth premiums as a result of fewer new meter connections in the area, an increase in interest expense of $0.1 million, and a $0.1 million increase in other expenses, partially offset by an increase in the equity portion of allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Net Income Net income totaled $1.1 million or $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $0.8 million or $0.03 per share in the same period in 2022. Net income increased $2.5 million to $8.0 million or $0.33 per share in 2023, as compared to net income of $5.5 million or $0.24 per share in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA increased $0.3 million or 5.9% to $5.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, as compared to $5.5 million in the same period in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA increased $2.5 million or 10.8% to $25.3 million in 2023, as compared to $22.9 million in the same period in 2022. Capital Resources Cash and cash equivalents totaled $3.1 million at December 31, 2023, as compared to $6.6 million at December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to the company’s expansion efforts and investment in infrastructure to support its growth within its service areas. As of December 31, 2023, the company had no notable near-term cash expenditures other than semiannual principal payments on its Series A and Series B senior secured notes in the amount of $1.9 million due in both June and December 2024. Dividend Policy In November 2023, the company announced that it increased its dividend to $0.30096 per share on an annualized basis. It recently declared a monthly cash dividend of $0.02508 per common share (or $0.30096 per share on an annualized basis), which will be payable on March 29, 2024 to holders of record at the close of business on March 14, 2024. Business Strategy Global Water's near-term growth strategy involves increasing service connections, improving operating efficiencies, and increasing utility rates as approved by the ACC. The company plans to continue to aggregate water and wastewater utilities, enabling the company and its customers to realize the benefits of consolidation, regionalization, and environmental stewardship. Connection Rates As of December 31, 2023, active service connections increased by 5,521 or 9.8% to 61,791, compared to 56,270 at December 31, 2022. The increase in active service connections was primarily due to new connections associated with the acquisition of Farmers and organic growth in connections. Arizona’s Growth Corridor: Positive Population and Economic Trends There was a trend of positive growth in new connections during 2022. For 2023, growth continued at a moderate rate during the first half of the year with the second half exhibiting increases in the rate of connection growth. According to the most recent U.S. Census estimates, the Phoenix metropolitan statistical area (MSA) is the 11th largest MSA in the U.S. and had an estimated population of 5.0 million, an increase of 3.5% over the 4.8 million people reported in the 2020 Census. Metropolitan Phoenix continues to grow due to its comparatively affordable housing, excellent weather, large and growing universities, a diverse employment base, and low taxes. The Employment and Population Statistics Department of the State of Arizona predicts that the Phoenix metropolitan area will have a population of 5.8 million people by 2030 and 6.5 million by 2040. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, Arizona’s employment rate increased by 2.0%, ranking the state in the top twenty nationally for job growth. Phoenix is being recognized as the top market for manufacturing growth and was ranked number one out of the top 15 growth markets for largest projected job gains by global real estate firm Newmark Group. According to the Newmark Group, the jobs promised as part of the major manufacturing developments topped the nation for both projected jobs added and manufacturing announcements in excess of $100 million. Despite a slowdown in housing for the Phoenix metropolitan area primarily due to inflation and increased interest rates, management believes that Global Water is well-positioned to benefit from the growth expected in the Phoenix metropolitan area due to the availability of lots, existing infrastructure in place within the company’s services areas, and increased activity related to multi-family developments.

Use of Non-GAAP Measures This press release contains certain financial measures that are not recognized measures under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), including, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted basic earnings per common share and adjusted diluted earnings per common share. EBITDA is defined for the purposes of this press release as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding the gain or loss related to (i) nonrecurring events; (ii) option expense related to awards made to the board of directors and management; (iii) restricted stock expense related to awards made to executive officers; (iv) disposal of assets; and (v) ICFA revenue recognition. Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per common share reflect net income and earnings per common share excluding (i) ICFA revenue and (ii) the amortization related to ICFA intangible assets. Management believes that EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per common share, and adjusted diluted earnings per common share are useful supplemental measures of our operating performance and provide our investors meaningful measures of overall corporate performance. EBITDA is also presented because management believes that it is frequently used by investment analysts, investors, and other interested parties as a measure of financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per common share, and adjusted diluted earnings per common share is also presented because management believes that it provides our investors a measure of our recurring core business. However, non-GAAP measures do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP, and investors are cautioned that non-GAAP measures, such as EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per common share, and adjusted diluted earnings per common share, should not be construed as an alternative to net income or loss or other income statement data (which are determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity and cash flows. Management's method of calculating EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per common share, and adjusted diluted earnings per common share may differ materially from the method used by other companies and accordingly, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per common share, and adjusted diluted earnings per common share to net income and earnings per common share, the most comparable GAAP measure, is included in the schedules attached to this press release.

The move aims to modernize the bank's tech stack, improve performance, and enhance security. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The transition of Kiwibank to ACI Worldwide's Enterprise Payments Platform represents a strategic investment in technology infrastructure that could potentially enhance the bank's operational efficiency and customer experience. By adopting a cloud-hosted solution, Kiwibank is likely aiming to reduce costs associated with maintaining and updating its own payment processing systems. This could lead to improved margins and a stronger competitive position in the New Zealand banking sector.The move to a managed service model also suggests a shift in the bank's focus towards core competencies, outsourcing technical operations to specialized providers. This could result in a more agile business model, allowing Kiwibank to adapt more rapidly to market changes and customer needs. Investors may view this as a positive development, anticipating future growth and a possible increase in market share. Cybersecurity Expert Migrating to a cloud-based payments platform could significantly enhance Kiwibank's security posture. ACI Worldwide is known for its robust security measures, which can offer banks like Kiwibank advanced protection against cyber threats. The enhancement of security features is crucial as the financial sector is a prime target for cyber-attacks. This proactive approach to cybersecurity can mitigate potential risks and protect customer data, thereby potentially reducing the likelihood of costly data breaches and the associated reputational damage.Investors should note that while cloud services generally offer strong security, the responsibility for protecting customer data is shared with the service provider. Therefore, the bank's due diligence in managing this partnership and maintaining internal controls will be critical in ensuring the security of its payment systems. Technology Transformation Expert The adoption of a managed cloud solution for payment processing is indicative of Kiwibank's commitment to digital transformation. By replacing over 50% of its underlying banking technology, Kiwibank is positioning itself to rapidly integrate new technologies and services. This could lead to the development of innovative banking products and services, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty.For stakeholders, the long-term benefits of this transformation could include increased agility in responding to market demands and the ability to leverage data analytics for personalized customer offerings. However, the transition also involves risks, such as potential service disruptions during the migration phase and the challenge of upskilling employees to work with the new system. The bank's ability to manage these risks will be crucial to the success of the platform's implementation. 03/06/2024 - 08:00 PM Bank becomes the first financial provider in New Zealand to shift to a cloud-hosted solution and managed service for payment processing OMAHA, Neb. & SINGAPORE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Kiwibank has successfully gone live with ACI Worldwide’s Enterprise Payments Platform, a managed cloud solution that will process all of Kiwibank’s account-to-account real-time payments. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240306222382/en/ “Aligned with our vision for transformation and to build a new, modern, flexible tech stack, the ACI Enterprise Payments Platform is vital for future-proofing our payments system. By moving everything to ACI’s platform, we’ve replaced over 50% of the tech underpinning our banking solutions and opened our business up to embrace technology faster, while maximising performance and enhancing security,” said Mark Stephen, Kiwibank Chief Customer Officer. “We’re the first bank in New Zealand to do this, and we’re really excited about what it means for our customers. Future phases of our migration will include moving domestic and international payment functionality out of our old systems and onto ACI Enterprise Payments Platform as well as offering services like real-time payments,” said Stephen. Working with ACI to move its infrastructure to the cloud provides Kiwibank access to cutting-edge technology at scale to streamline operation of multiple, and growing, payments services. “This significantly improves our readiness for future innovation. It also means we will be able to implement change at lower cost and lower risk, not having to work around multiple systems, utilising the expertise of the ACI managed service model,” commented Stephen. “We’re always working to improve our offer of being simple, easy, accessible and providing expertise for our customers, this move will help us deliver on that promise. ACI has helped us provide the tools our customers need in today’s fast-moving society.

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand has urged local banks to pick up the pace in New Zealand's journey towards real-time payments.

Negative None. 03/06/2024 - 07:36 PM Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - March 6, 2024) - Atomic Minerals Corporation (TSXV: ATOM) (""Atomic"" or the ""Company"") - Further to the Company's news release on February 5, 2024 in which it entered into a letter of intent to acquire an extensive uranium land package, consisting of nine properties totaling just under 6,500 hectares within very close proximity to the Athabasca Basin in Northern Saskatchewan (the ""Property""), the Company is pleased to announce it has signed an Asset Purchase Agreement (the ""Purchase Agreement"") with the vendors of the Property. The Purchase Agreement remains subject to approval of the TSX Venture Exchange (the ""Exchange"").Terms of the AcquisitionThe Company purchased the Property from arm's length vendors in exchange for the following:a payment of $100,000 due within five days of Exchange approval;issuance of 6,000,000 common shares in the capital of the Company (the ""Shares"") within five days of Exchange approval; anda second payment of $100,000 due on the 6-month anniversary of Exchange approval.There is a 2% NSR on any future production. The Company can reduce the NSR to 1% through a $1,000,000 cash payment. All Shares issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement will be restricted from trading for four months and one day after issuance.Two of the Project properties lie proximally or close to known deposits and a third hosts a 1957 historic resource. Highlights from the property package include:Bleasdell Lake - host to a 1957 historic resource of 620,700 pounds of U3O8 contained within two zones.Parks Lake - 3 km to SE of historic Rabbit Lake Mine and 2 km to 4km E to NE of Uranium Energy Corp.'s Horseshoe and Raven deposits.Pistol Lake - completely surrounded by Cameco and 600 metres north of their Sand Lake deposit.The 1957 Bleasdell Lake historic resource was disclosed in a shareholder report for Columbia Metals Exploration Co. Ltd. dated November 9, 1957 (the ""Shareholder Report""). There is no technical report. The historic resource is relevant to the potential of the Bleasdell Lake property and is reliable as it was calculated to the standards of the day. The estimate was based on closely spaced shallow drill holes and more widely spaced deeper drill holes. The calculations, methods or parameters were not disclosed in the Shareholder Report. The resource would be comparable to a current inferred resource. There are no more recent estimates though subsequent geologists visited the Property in the 1960's and 1970's, confirming the showings and the drilling was completed. The Company will need to twin a significant number of the historic drill holes to upgrade or verify the historical estimate as current mineral resources.A qualified person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as a current mineral resource. Therefore, Atomic is not treating the historical estimate as a current mineral resource.Atomic CEO Clive Massey commented: ""With this Saskatchewan acquisition, Atomic now holds significant land positions in the two largest producing North American uranium districts, the Athabasca Basin and the Colorado Plateau. While the Bleasdell Lake historic resource may turn out to be the jewel, both Parks Lake and Pistol Lake hold significant exploration potential given Pistol Lake is mere meters away from Cameco's 5,000,000 pound Sand Lake1 discovery. Our technical team is currently reviewing the data rooms for the various projects with the objective of generating drill targets for near term diamond drilling."" Figure 1.

Exploration in the late 1950's discovered two uranium bearing pegmatite dykes on the west shore of Bleasdell Lake. The 400 metre Horn Zone hosted zones of 90 metres of 0.12% U3O8 over 2.56 metres and 0.062% U3O8 over 1.21 metres, while drill width intersections over the entire 400 metre ranged from 0.091% U3O8 over 1.86 metres to 0.2025% U3O8 over 2.99 metres. There is little information on the Jackpine Zone located 450 metres along strike to the northwest. The sampling, trenching and diamond drilling defined a 1957 historic resource of 620,700 pounds of U3O8 contained within two zones.A qualified person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as a current mineral resource. Therefore, Atomic is not treating the historical estimate as a current mineral resource. Figure 2.

The construction industry's resilience in Argentina, despite lower volumes in Q4 due to political transitions, underscores the cyclical nature of the sector and its sensitivity to economic and political climates. The company's net income increase of 70.7% YoY is notable, but this figure must be contextualized within the broader financial landscape, including the impact of a non-core asset sale in the previous year, which distorts a direct comparison.From a debt perspective, the Net Debt/LTM Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.40x represents a significant increase from 0.37x in FY22, signaling heightened leverage that could concern investors regarding the company's financial health and interest coverage capabilities. This increase in leverage, primarily due to the peso's devaluation, suggests potential liquidity risks and the need for careful debt management. The issuance of domestic bonds with a 6% interest rate and maturity in 2026 indicates the company's proactive approach to managing its capital structure amidst these challenges. Market Research Analyst Examining Loma Negra's performance within the broader industry, the contraction in the Adjusted EBITDA margin from 29.9% to 23.8% reflects a substantial decrease in operational efficiency or pricing power, or both. The contraction points towards increased cost pressures or reduced pricing capabilities, which are critical factors for maintaining profitability in the commodity-based cement industry. The reported volume decreases across cement, concrete and railroad segments also highlight the importance of economic stability and public infrastructure spending on the company's performance.Furthermore, the substantial fluctuations in exchange rates have had a pronounced impact on the company's financials, illustrating the vulnerability of Loma Negra to currency risk. This is further exacerbated by the 184.8% increase in net debt, which could be attributed to operational challenges and the peso devaluation. Investors and analysts must closely monitor these trends as they can significantly affect future earnings and cash flow projections. Economist The financial results of Loma Negra offer insights into the broader economic conditions in Argentina. The peso's devaluation in December 2023 played a pivotal role in affecting the company's financial results, particularly the increase in net financial costs and the impact on net debt valuation. The construction sector's performance, despite being the second-best in history for dispatch volume, was still subject to the ebbs and flows of political and economic stability, illustrating the sector's dependency on the fiscal and monetary policy environment.Moreover, the inflationary pressures reflected in the company's inability to adjust prices in line with inflation suggest a challenging environment for businesses operating in Argentina. The company's strategic focus on sustainability and dividends distribution, despite financial pressures, indicates a long-term investment in stakeholder engagement and corporate responsibility. This approach, while commendable, must be balanced with the imperative to maintain financial resilience amidst economic volatility. 03/06/2024 - 04:25 PM BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA / ACCESSWIRE / March 6, 2024 / Loma Negra, (NYSE:LOMA)(BYMA:LOMA), (""Loma Negra"" or the ""Company""), the leading cement producer in Argentina, today announced results for the three-month period ended December 31, 2023 (our ""4Q23 Results"").FY23 Key HighlightsNet revenues decreased 6.6% YoY to Ps. 422,161 million (US$ 790 million) mainly driven by the top line decrease in our core segment, Cement, while the positive performance of Concrete and Aggregates compensated the result of the Railroad segment.Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA reached Ps. 100,351 million, decreasing 25.7% YoY in adjusted pesos, while in dollars it reached 252 million, with a decrease of 12.7% YoY. The YoY comparison is affected by a non-core asset sale in 4Q22.Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA margin stood at 23.8%, contracting 610 basis points from 2022. Excluding the result of the asset sale in 2022, the contraction would have amounted to 378 basis points.Net income was Ps. 10,305 million, showing an increase of 70.7% YoY.During FY23, we distributed dividends for Ps. 39.4 billion (US$ 120 million), Ps. 67.53 per outstanding share (Ps. 337.63 per ADR).Loma Negra is presenting its third Sustainability Report for the fiscal year 2023, with the goal of sharing with all our stakeholders our journey and commitment to sustainable development.4Q23 Key HighlightsNet sales revenues decreased by 13.2% YoY to Ps. 99,398 million (US$ 182 million), mainly explained by a top line decrease in the Cement segment, with the other businesses following the same trend as our main segment.Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA reached Ps. 22,678 million, decreasing 44.7% YoY in adjusted pesos, while in dollars it reached 61 million, down 33.0% from 4Q22. Excluding the extraordinary result from the base of comparison, the decrease in pesos stood at 25.8%.The Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA margin stood at 22.8%, contracting 1,302 basis points YoY from 35.8%. Excluding the result of the asset sale in 2022, the contraction would have amounted to 389 basis points.Net Loss of Ps. 19,780 million, down from a gain of Ps. 22,746 million in the same period of the previous year, mainly explained by a higher financial cost.The Company issued its Class 4 of domestic bonds in the total principal amount of US$ 10.0 million, with an interest rate of 6% p.a. and with maturity in the second quarter of 2026.Net Debt stood at Ps. 140.636 million (US$ 174 million), representing a Net Debt/LTM Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.40x compared with 0.37x in FY22. Mainly due to the devaluation of the peso in December 2023.The Company has presented certain financial figures, Table 1b and Table 11, in U.S. dollars and Pesos without giving effect to IAS 29. The Company has prepared all other financial information herein by applying IAS 29.Commenting on the financial and operating performance for the fourth quarter of 2023, Sergio Faifman, Loma Negra's Chief Executive Officer, noted: ""We have reached the end of a very challenging year for Argentina, where the construction industry has shown all its resilience, allowing me to present another solid year for LOMA.Despite the lower volumes of the fourth quarter, affected by the lower level of activity due to the electoral period and the following change of administration, the industry showed strong adaptability to the economic environment and closed the year with the second-best dispatch volume in history, only behind the record reached in 2022.We are very satisfied with the results achieved in these challenging conditions, ratifying the position of leadership of LOMA, fulfilling our role as key players of the industry in Argentina, being close to our clients, suppliers, and other stakeholders. Working together, we can address the challenges our country faces, confident in our ability to bolster its growth potential once a less volatile environment is achieved.Also, with great satisfaction, we publish a new edition of Loma Negra's Sustainability Report to share with all our stakeholders our work and commitment to sustainable development.

Projects carried out by the private sector began the quarter at a promising pace but experienced a slowdown in December. Conversely, public sector works were significantly impacted by the transition in the national administration and the prevailing political context. Similarly, volumes for the Aggregates segment declined by 12.3%The volumes of the Railway segment experienced a contraction of 9.0% compared to the same quarter of 2022. The lower level of activity in the construction sector impacted our main cargo shippers, especially in Aggregates. Additionally, the storm that hit Bahía Blanca in December temporarily knocked out of service the two plants from which we transport chemicals.For fiscal year 2023, our main segment, Cement, masonry and lime, registered a year-on-year decrease of 4.5%, mainly explained by the soft dynamic of the economy in the second semester, affected by the election process. The bagged cement was more impacted by this environment, partially compensated by bulk dispatches, that ended the year in positive figures, primarily for the performance during the first half of the year.The Concrete segment ended the year almost flattish with an increase of 0.2%, while the Aggregates segments was up 3.9% YoY. Concrete demand was one of the principal drivers of the growth in bulk cement shipments, dispatch mode that ended the year with positive growth figures, primarily on the back of the volumes posted in the first half of the year.The volume of the Railroad segment experienced a decrease of 7.5%, primarily attributed to lower transported volumes of construction materials and fracsand. The transportation market in 2023 was characterized by being affected by the poor harvest due to the strong drought, which caused grain trucks to shift to other sectors, affecting our main transportation flows, specifically for construction materials.Review of Financial ResultsTable 3: Condensed Interim Consolidated Statements of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income(amounts expressed in millions of pesos, unless otherwise noted) Three-months ended December 31, Twelve-months ended December 31, 2023 2022 % Chg. 2023 2022 % Chg.

The bagged cement showed a more moderate decrease, following the trend of the previous quarters. Additionally, this effect was coupled with a softer price dynamic that, despite moving with inflation, showed a decrease due to higher monthly inflation figures and the timing of price adjustments.Concrete registered a decrease in its topline of 20.3% compared to 4Q22, primarily due to lower volumes, which were down by 17.5%. The Aggregates segment posted a decrease in revenues of 9.5%, where the positive price performance partially offset the lower volume.Railroad revenues decreased by 10.5% in 4Q23 compared to the same quarter of 2022, primarily due to a lower transported volume, which decreased by 9.0% in the quarter, mainly affected by the decrease in transported volumes of aggregates.For fiscal year 2023, net revenue decreased by 6.6% to Ps. 422,161 million from Ps. 451,954 million in fiscal year 2022, primarily due to lower topline performance of our core business, Cement, followed by the Railroad segment. This was partially offset by a better performance of Concrete and Aggregates.Cost of sales, and Gross profitCost of sales decreased by 12.8% YoY, reaching Ps. 73,379 million in 4Q23, mainly due to the decrease in sales volumes across all segments and the lower impact of depreciations in the Cement and Railroad segments. Regarding the cost of sales for Cement, the segment posted a decrease of 7.0% on a per-ton basis. The main reason for this was the reduction in energy inputs, primarily driven by lower consumption of thermal energy per ton, coupled with a decrease in natural gas prices. Similarly, the cost of electrical energy improved as the proportion of hydraulic energy, which has a lower cost, increased in the country's electrical generation matrix. Additionally, there was lower depreciation than that registered in 4Q22.Gross Profit decreased 14.3% YoY to Ps. 26,018 million in 4Q23, from Ps. 30,375 million in 4Q22, with a gross profit margin contraction of only 36 basis points YoY to 26.2%.During fiscal year 2023, Gross Profit decreased 13.2% to Ps. 105,907 million with a gross profit margin contracting 192 basis points to 25.1%.Selling and Administrative ExpensesSelling and administrative expenses (SG&A) in 4Q23 remained flat, with a variation of only -0.1% YoY to Ps. 9,959 million, from Ps. 9,965 million in 4Q22. As a percentage of sales, SG&A showed an increase against 4Q22 of 132 basis points, reaching 10.0% due to the decrease in the top line.During fiscal year 2023, SG&A decreased by 0.8% compared with the previous year, and as a percentage of sales stood at 9.2%, increasing 54 bps.Adjusted EBITDA & MarginTable 4: Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation & Margin(amounts expressed in millions of pesos, unless otherwise noted) Three-months ended December 31, Twelve-months ended December 31, 2023 2022 % Chg. 2023 2022 % Chg.

The sale of a non-core asset in 4Q23 affected the base of comparison, and accounts for 913 basis points. Excluding this effect, the margin contracted 389 basis points, with margins decreasing across all segments.In particular, the Adjusted EBITDA margin of the Cement, Masonry and Lime segment contracted 1,254 bps to 26.6%. Excluding the previously mention asset sale from the base of comparison, the margin contracted 217 bps. Prices, despite being adjusted by inflation, decreased when compared with 4Q22 due to high monthly inflation figures and the timing of the price adjustments. The lower top line performance was partially offset by efficient cost management driven by improved energy inputs.Concrete Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 121 bps, and stood at 1.5%, from 2.7% in 4Q22. Despite the cost and expenses controls, it couldn't fully offset the lower top line.The Adjusted EBITDA margin of Aggregates contracted to 14.2%, from 25.9% in 4Q22, mainly due to higher sales costs and the effect of lower volumes, partially compensated by a positive price performance.Finally, the Adjusted EBITDA margin of the Railroad segment contracted 922 bps to -4.2% in the fourth quarter, from 5.1% in 4Q22, principally due to higher costs, coupled with lower transported volumes.During FY23, Adjusted EBITDA decreased 25.7% reaching Ps. 100,351 million from Ps. 134,981 million in FY22, with an Adjusted EBITDA margin compression of 610 basis points, from 29.9% in 2022 to 23.8% in 2023. Excluding the sale of the non-core asset of the base of comparison, the Adjusted EBITDA decreased 19.4%, contracting 378 basis points.Finance Costs-NetTable 5: Finance Gain (Cost), net(amounts expressed in millions of pesos, unless otherwise noted) Three-months ended December 31, Twelve-months ended December 31, 2023 2022 % Chg. 2023 2022 % Chg.

In the same sense, we had an increase in the financial expense due to the higher debt position.During FY 2023, the Company recorded a total net financial cost of Ps. 46.1 billion, compared to a net financial cost of Ps. 54.8 billion in 2022.Net Profit and Net Profit Attributable to Owners of the CompanyNet loss of Ps. 20,188 million in 4Q23 compared to a net profit of Ps. 23,207 million in the same period of the previous year. The higher total financial cost due to the devaluation, along with the sale of the non-core asset in 4Q22, are the principal reasons for the variation.Net Loss Attributable to Owners of the Company stood at Ps. 19,780 million. During the quarter, the Company reported a loss per common share of Ps. 33.9003 and an ADR loss of Ps. 169.5014, compared to a gain per common share of Ps. 38.9166 and a gain per ADR of Ps. 194.5830 in 4Q22.During fiscal year 2023, Net Income Attributable to Owners of the Company increased 70.7% YoY, to Ps. 10,305 million, from Ps. 6,037 million in fiscal year 2022, mainly as a result of a lower total net financial cost coupled with a lower tax position thar compensated a lower operational result.CapitalizationTable 6: Capitalization and Debt Ratio(amounts expressed in millions of pesos, unless otherwise noted) As of December 31, 2023 2022 Total Debt 147,370 64,680 - Short-Term Debt 37,225 33,914 - Long-Term Debt 110,146 30,766 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments (6,734) (15,293)Total Net Debt 140,636 49,388 Shareholder's Equity 294,222 361,069 Capitalization 441,592 425,749 LTM Adjusted EBITDA 100,351 134,981 Net Debt /LTM Adjusted EBITDA 1.40x 0.37xAs of December 31, 2023, total Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments were Ps. 6,734 million compared with Ps. 15,293 million as of December 31, 2022.

The audio of the conference call will also be archived on the Company's website at www.lomanegra.comDefinitionsAdjusted EBITDA is calculated as net profit plus financial interest, net plus income tax expense plus depreciation and amortization plus exchange rate differences plus other financial expenses, net plus tax on debits and credits to bank accounts, plus share of loss of associates, plus net Impairment of Property, plant and equipment, and less income from discontinued operation. Loma Negra believes that excluding tax on debits and credits to bank accounts from its calculation of Adjusted EBITDA is a better measure of operating performance when compared to other international players.Net Debt is calculated as borrowings less cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.About Loma NegraFounded in 1926, Loma Negra is the leading cement company in Argentina, producing and distributing cement, masonry cement, aggregates, concrete and lime, products primarily used in private and public construction.

COR Portable Energy Storage System offers versatile recharge options and innovative features. Worksport aims to be a key player in the mobile battery power generator industry. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The introduction of Worksport's SOLIS Solar Cover and COR Battery System into the market represents a significant innovation in the automotive accessory sector, particularly for pickup trucks. The anticipated compatibility with major truck brands such as Ford, General Motors and Hyundai and the potential for future integration with Tesla's Cybertruck, suggests a strategic move to capitalize on the growing market for electric vehicles (EVs) and the increasing demand for sustainable, off-grid power solutions.The emphasis on the utility for not only recreational activities but also for professional use by military, law enforcement and first responders, indicates a broadening of the target market. By expanding beyond pickup truck owners to the global consumer electronics market, Worksport is significantly increasing its addressable market. This strategic pivot could potentially open new revenue streams and partnerships, especially considering the current trend towards portable power solutions and increased interest in renewable energy sources. Financial Analyst Worksport's announcement of the SOLIS Solar Cover and COR Battery System may be an indicator of potential future revenue growth. The company's plan to offer these products to a wider consumer base beyond pickup truck owners and the intention to design and produce the COR System within North America, could enhance its competitive edge in the market. The emphasis on North American innovation and manufacturing aligns with current consumer and investor interest in local production and supply chain resilience.However, investors should consider the risks associated with production and supply chain issues that have been prevalent in recent times. Delays in the launch or challenges in scaling production could impact the financial performance of the company. Additionally, the market's reception of the Alpha Release and subsequent consumer testing will be critical in determining the viability and profitability of the new products. Positive initial test results are promising, but the true test will come when the products reach the market and face competition. Energy Sector Analyst The integration of solar technology into vehicle accessories, like the SOLIS Solar Cover, reflects a growing trend in the automotive industry towards incorporating renewable energy solutions. Worksport's innovation could have a significant impact on the energy sector by providing additional electric driving range and charging capabilities for EVs. This not only aligns with global efforts to reduce carbon emissions but also offers a practical solution for energy independence on the go.The potential for the SOLIS Cover to passively charge vehicles like the Tesla Cybertruck represents a step forward in EV technology, potentially reducing reliance on traditional charging infrastructure. The modular and hot-swap features of the COR Battery System also demonstrate a forward-thinking approach to energy storage, offering versatility and convenience for users. These features could set new standards for portable power solutions, influencing future developments in the energy and automotive industries. 03/06/2024 - 05:15 PM West Seneca, New York, March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Worksport Ltd. (Nasdaq: WKSP) (“Worksport” or the “Company”), a manufacturer of truck beds and solar-integrated tonneau covers for pickup trucks, is excited to announce the anticipated summer launch of its revolutionary SOLIS Solar Cover and COR Battery System. The SOLIS Cover is expected to be available for major brands including the Ford Motor Company (“Ford”), the General Motors Company (“General Motors or “GM”) and the Hyundai Motor Company (“Hyundai”). Also, with immense popularity, Tesla, Inc. (“Tesla” or “Cybertruck”) with the Tesla Cybertruck could, one day, become an ideal candidate for the Worksport SOLIS and COR bundle, as the Tesla Cybertruck reaches mass market through increased deliveries. The innovative SOLIS and COR duo is on track for its scheduled release, promising to deliver an unparalleled off-grid power solution perfect for pickup truck users who enjoy camping, remote work, sports, and various outdoor activities. There also is a large market opportunity for both COR and SOLIS products for light trucks and those who work within military, law enforcement, and first responders within North America and globally. The benefits and applications for the SOLIS Solar Cover, coupled with the COR Battery System, are designed to transform the utility of pickup trucks by offering off-grid power, allowing over 60 million pickup trucks just in the USA alone to become traveling microgrids. Further, in future partnerships with EV manufacturers, the SOLIS Cover itself can provide additional electric driving range and charging capabilities directly from the sun. Worksport currently has open conversations with multiple OEM vehicle brands and has previously announced the production of prototypes for Hyundai. In addition to applications in pickup trucks such as Ford and General Motors, Worksport engineering departments are exploring new truck compatibility for future additional application coverage which could, one day, include Tesla and the Tesla Cybertruck. Fitment of the Worksport SOLIS with the Tesla Cybertruck is yet to be determined, but possible. A direct partnership between Worksport and Tesla would further integration of the SOLIS to be able to passively charge the Cybertruck. However, as an aftermarket add-on accessory, the SOLIS and the COR system would provide unparalleled utility for portable, mobile, solar energy away from the power grid. No pickup truck necessary. The Worksport COR Portable Energy Storage System, the Company’s highly anticipated mobile battery power generator system, is also planned to be offered to the domestic and global consumer market, not just pickup truck owners. The COR System can be recharged by any wall outlet or any solar panels, allowing the COR System to be used by anyone, anywhere, to power almost anything. This plan opens Worksport’s addressable market from 60 million pickup truck owners to the coveted global market for consumer electronic devices. The COR System will be one of very few power electronic devices that will be fully designed and produced within North America (using foreign and domestically sourced components). The Company believes North American innovation paired with local manufacturing will make the Worksport COR system among the best and most innovative mobile battery power generators ever released. With exclusive features such as modular batteries, for limitless power, and hot swap features and a clever built in uninterrupted power supply. This innovative power supply is to allow batteries to be changed and recharged without losing power to appliances connected and operating from the COR device. As the launch date approaches, Worksport is pleased to report that nearly all components for the COR Alpha Release have arrived and are currently undergoing rigorous testing. While results are pending, initial tests appear promising, indicating that the product is likely to meet and exceed expectations. Prior to full market release this summer, the COR System will first have an Alpha Release for real consumer testing to ensure a successful market release. Concurrently, prototypes of the SOLIS Solar Cover are in development and will be tested on different truck brands, including Hyundai, Ford, General Motors, Stellantis RAM, and more. Worksport's manufacturing facility in Buffalo, New York, is producing the Company’s state-of-the-art innovative hard-folding covers, which serve as the base for the SOLIS Solar Cover and contribute to the Company's current revenue growth. Worksport recently announced compatibility of its hard-folding covers with a wide range of popular truck models, including RAM by Stellantis, General Motors brands GMC and Chevrolet, Ford, Jeep by Stellantis, Nissan, and Toyota. Steven Rossi, CEO of Worksport, comments on the journey toward this landmark release: ""We have faced enormous challenges, including delays caused by issues that have affected supply chains across the globe. Despite these obstacles, our team’s dedication and hard work have kept us on track to deliver, and we now feel confident about releasing the SOLIS Solar Cover and the COR Battery System this summer to consumers. The SOLIS and COR duo embody our commitment to innovation and our vision for a more sustainable future."" The impending release of the SOLIS Solar Cover and COR Battery System marks a significant milestone for Worksport as it continues to push the boundaries of automotive accessory technology, providing customers with smart, eco-friendly solutions for their energy needs. The Company is positioning itself in renewable energy for a better tomorrow.

CPS Technologies Corporation Announces Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results,2024-03-06T22:12:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"CPS Technologies Corporation (CPSH) reported record revenue of $27.6 million for the fiscal year 2023, with a 10% growth in the fourth quarter. The company faced quality issues with a major customer impacting gross margin and operating profit. Despite short-term challenges, CPS remains optimistic about future growth opportunities.","CPS Technologies Corporation Announces Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary CPS Technologies Corporation (CPSH) reported record revenue of $27.6 million for the fiscal year 2023, with a 10% growth in the fourth quarter. The company faced quality issues with a major customer impacting gross margin and operating profit. Despite short-term challenges, CPS remains optimistic about future growth opportunities. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent financial results from CPS Technologies reveal a mixed performance. While the company achieved a record annual revenue of $27.6 million, the gross margin contraction from 26.6% to 17.0% year-over-year is a point of concern. This margin pressure is indicative of cost challenges or quality issues, which can affect profitability. Despite this, the company managed to maintain a positive operating profit, although reduced from the previous year. Investors would need to weigh the company's revenue growth against the margin decline to assess the sustainability of its earnings.The quality issues referenced by the CEO are critical, as they can lead to reputational damage and impact customer retention. However, the assertion that these issues have been largely mitigated could signal recovery in margins if no further issues arise. The mention of the U.S. Navy contract for HybridTech Armor® panels suggests potential volatility in revenue streams, dependent on the timing and completion of government contracts.Looking ahead, the CEO's optimism regarding the resolution of quality issues and the company's diverse end markets could suggest that CPS is positioned to capitalize on new opportunities. However, the Continuing Resolution in Washington is an external factor that could delay certain business developments, introducing an element of uncertainty for future performance. Market Research Analyst CPS Technologies' presence in fast-growing industrial and technological applications is noteworthy as it indicates the company's alignment with emerging market trends. The focus on diversification across various end markets could be a strategic move to buffer against sector-specific downturns. However, the market will be looking for evidence of how the company's investment in the future translates into tangible order flow and revenue growth.The CEO's confidence in improved order flow throughout the year suggests an anticipation of increased demand, which could be a positive signal for investors. It will be important to monitor the company's ability to secure new contracts, particularly in the context of the mentioned government-related delays. The completion of the U.S. Navy contract will be a test of the company's ability to manage and transition between large projects without significant revenue disruption. Economist The financial performance of CPS Technologies must be contextualized within the broader economic environment. The impact of the Continuing Resolution suggests a degree of dependency on government spending, which can be unpredictable and subject to political processes. This dependency highlights the importance of fiscal policy on the company's operations.Moreover, the company's ability to address quality issues and improve gross margins will be critical in an environment where input costs may be rising due to inflationary pressures. The margin compression experienced by CPS Technologies is a common concern for many businesses during periods of economic uncertainty. The company's long-term success will hinge on its ability to navigate these macroeconomic challenges while executing its growth strategy. 03/06/2024 - 05:12 PM Finished Year with Record Top Line Results; Large Pipeline of Opportunities for 2024 & BeyondNORTON, Mass., March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CPS Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:CPSH) (“CPS” or the “Company”) today announced financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter ended December 30, 2023. Fourth Quarter Highlights Revenue of $6.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 versus $6.1 million in the prior-year period, primarily due to growth in shipmentsGross margin of 17.0 percent versus 26.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting certain quality issues with a major customerOperating profit of $0.1 million for the quarter ended December 30, 2023 compared to $0.3 million in the prior-year period “We finished the year with the highest annual revenue in the Company’s history – $27.6 million – driven by 10 percent growth in the fourth quarter versus the prior-year period,” said Brian Mackey, President and CEO. “We are cautiously optimistic that the quality issues previously disclosed have been largely mitigated and should not have a material impact on 2024 results. While the Continuing Resolution in Washington has hampered certain decision making, impacting some of our new business development initiatives, we believe our strong position across the Company’s diverse end markets provides plenty of opportunity for further top line expansion. That said, the U.S. Navy contract for HybridTech Armor® panels is, as previously discussed, expected to be completed during the second quarter of this year. We remain steadfast in our mission to pursue other fast-growing industrial and technological applications that can accelerate demand and drive CPS to new levels of performance. We continue to invest for the future, and I am confident that order flow will improve as the year plays out. Even as short-term headwinds exist, the future is bright for CPS.” Results of Operations CPS reported revenue of $6.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 versus $6.1 million in the prior-year period, reflecting overall growth in product shipments. Gross profit was $1.1 million, or 17.0 percent of revenue, versus $1.6 million, or 26.6 percent of revenue, in the fiscal 2022 fourth quarter, with the lower gross margin year-over-year largely due to quality issues with one of the Company’s major customers. Operating profit was $0.1 million in the fiscal 2023 fourth quarter compared with $0.3 million in the prior-year period. Reported net income was also $0.2 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, versus $0.3 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, in the quarter ended December 31, 2022.

Positive Improved profitability in 4Q23 and FY23 with ROE at 26.9% and 16.7% respectively. Record high ROAE of 27% in 4Q23 despite a challenging macro and political environment. NIM spiked to an unusually high level driven by net financial income increase and strong performance of Argentine bonds. NPL ratio improved to a record low of 1.2% in 4Q23, with a coverage ratio of 262%. Digital transformation efforts include branch network consolidation, increased customer engagement, and enhanced digital product offerings. Retail digital customer expansion to 62% and digital loan originations increased to 64%. Success in the corporate segment with a focus on trade finance and online brokerage services. Solid Tier 1 capital ratio of 21% and commitment to sustainability highlighted through the publication of the 2023 Integrated Annual Report. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported profitability figures for Grupo Supervielle S.A. indicate a substantial turnaround from the previous fiscal year, with a notable increase in attributable net income from a loss to a significant gain. This is a critical financial metric that directly affects shareholder value and could influence investor sentiment and the company's stock performance. The reported Return on Equity (ROE) shows a robust recovery, signaling management's effectiveness in deploying shareholders' capital to generate profits.From a financial analysis perspective, the improvement in the Net Interest Margin (NIM) suggests a strategic management of assets and liabilities, particularly in a volatile economic environment with high inflation and currency devaluation. The increase in NIM could be attributed to the company's nimble reaction to market conditions, which is a positive sign for investors looking for management teams that can navigate economic turbulence effectively.The significant reduction in the Non-Performing Loan (NPL) ratio and the increase in the coverage ratio are also noteworthy. These figures indicate a healthier loan portfolio and a conservative approach to risk management, which can be reassuring to investors concerned about credit risk in the banking sector. The efficiency ratio's improvement underscores operational efficiency and cost management, which are essential for maintaining profitability in the competitive financial services sector. Market Research Analyst Grupo Supervielle's strategic focus on digital transformation and customer experience, as evidenced by the consolidation of branches and staff reduction alongside the expansion of digital customers and services, is a significant trend in the banking industry. The increase in digital adoption and the reported growth in digital sales of insurance products and personal loans originate from a strategic shift that many financial institutions are making to remain competitive and meet changing consumer behaviors.The successful digital adoption metrics, such as the increase in retail digital customers and the impressive growth in the use of the company's digital wallet, indicate that Grupo Supervielle is effectively capitalizing on the digital banking trend. This could position the company favorably in the market, potentially attracting new customers and retaining existing ones through enhanced digital offerings.The company's focus on sustainability and the publication of the integrated annual report align with the growing investor interest in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors. ESG considerations are becoming increasingly important in investment decisions and Grupo Supervielle's commitment to transparency and sustainable practices could enhance its reputation and appeal to a broader investor base. Economist The economic context in which Grupo Supervielle operates, characterized by high inflation and market volatility, presents both challenges and opportunities. The company's performance, particularly the ability to generate high financial income in such an environment, reflects a certain resilience and adaptability. The strategic shift towards less consumer loan exposure and more focus on middle-market corporates and payroll customers suggests a recalibration towards sectors that may offer more stability or growth potential in uncertain economic conditions.Looking ahead, the company's positioning in export-oriented sectors such as oil & gas, mining and agribusiness could be advantageous, considering these sectors often benefit from currency devaluation through increased competitiveness in international markets. However, the broader economic challenges mentioned, including the need for structural reforms and maintaining social support amid high inflation, will likely continue to be a backdrop against which the company's future performance must be assessed. 03/06/2024 - 05:09 PM Delivering improved profitability of AR$22.5 billion in 4Q23 and AR$51.4 billion in FY23 with ROE at 26.9% and 16.7% respectively. BUENOS AIRES, Argentina--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Grupo Supervielle S.A. (NYSE: SUPV; BYMA: SUPV), (“Supervielle” or the “Company”) a universal financial services group headquartered in Argentina with a nationwide presence, today reported results for the three and twelve-months period ended December 31, 2023. Starting 1Q20, the Company began reporting results applying Hyperinflation Accounting, in accordance with IFRS rule IAS 29 (“IAS 29”) as established by the Central Bank. Management Commentary Commenting on fourth quarter 2023 results, Patricio Supervielle, Grupo Supervielle’s Chairman & CEO, noted: “We closed the year with a strong quarter delivering record high ROAE of 27% in real terms, even as we navigate a complex macro and political environment characterized by high inflation, market volatility, and weak loan demand. NIM spiked to an unusually high level in the quarter, mainly driven by a significant sequential increase in net financial income supported by our nimble asset and liability management capabilities in the context of the sharp peso devaluation in December and the strong performance of Argentine bonds. Share gains in low-cost corporate sight deposits also contributed to this good performance. NIM still remained unusually strong in January 2024. Noteworthy, the NPL ratio continued to improve, reaching a record low of 1.2%, reflecting a shift in loans to middle-market corporates and payroll customers along with significantly lower exposure to consumer loans, together with the tightening of credit scoring standards throughout the year. In turn, the coverage ratio increased to 262%. For the full year, ROE in real terms improved to 17% from negative 5% in 2022. Higher profitability was mainly driven by 44% growth in Net financial income, while a healthier loan mix contributed to a 22% decline in loan loss provisions, further supported by a 5% reduction in operating expenses. Advancing on our transformation process, we evolved our organization by deepening our client-centric and product-focused operational model, enabling us to better address customer needs by strengthening our digital product culture and accelerating time to market. As we move towards becoming an increasingly digital bank, we continue to enhance our service model, improving digital, virtual, and automatic channels while transforming our branch network to deliver higher-value transactions to customers, while boosting cross-selling efforts. This has contributed to our improved NPS and positioned our Virtual Hub to become a highly efficient transactional channel. As a result, we consolidated 7 branches in the fourth quarter and 28 during 2023, leaving us with 137 branches, down from 183 when we started this process in 2020. In turn, we reduced our staff by 4% while advancing digital adoption and increasing the number of customers per branch by 17% during the year. This, together with the strong revenue performance, contributed to a sustained improvement in the efficiency ratio to 55%, down from 89% in 2022. On the retail front, we continued to boost our competitive NPS while also driving sustained digital adoption, higher customer engagement, and cross-selling. Notably, the share of retail digital customers expanded by ten percentage points year-on-year to 62%. Furthermore, 64% of personal loans originated digitally, up from 34% a year ago, while digital sales of insurance products offered through both digital and non-digital channels increased to 26%, up from 10% in January 2023. We are also pleased with the strong adoption of our digital wallet. Between January 2023 to December 2023, the number of transfers soared from 3 million to 7 million, QR code payments increased from 25,000 to 250,000 and bill payments were up 84%. Also encouraging is the 9x year-over-year increase in retail customers embracing our money market fund through our App. This is a distinct service unmatched by other banks, with assets under management at year-end increasing 7x in nominal terms. These developments underscore our customers' trust and reliance on our platform to safeguard their transactional funds against inflation. We are also achieving tangible results from our efforts to execute our strategic priorities for the corporate segment, recovering share in the second half and closing the year with a slight YoY share gain, as we attracted new clients and captured a higher share of wallet among SMEs and corporate customers while improving NPS in all segments for the second consecutive year. We completed our digital offering of working capital financing products during the year that were well-received, with digital transactions by SMEs in December accounting for 93% of factoring, 72% of commercial unsecured loans, and 52% of overdrafts just months after making them available. This has allowed us to continue expanding our market share in foreign trade transactions and sight deposit balances. Noteworthy, our banking subsidiary was recently ranked first by Euromoney´s 2024 Trade Finance Survey within the Best Service in Argentina, Foreign Trade category, and fifth within Latin America, reflecting our dedication to providing best-in-class tailored solutions to help our customers expand and develop their business internationally. Furthermore, our online brokerage platform, IOL, has become the leading online retail broker in Argentina delivering significant fee growth underscoring our ability to attract and retain customers. Monthly active users increased five-fold year over year to 271,000, while new accounts increased threefold and assets under management surged sevenfold, a testament to our commitment to sustainable growth and client satisfaction. Looking ahead, while president-elect Javier Milei remains committed to achieving a fiscal financial balance and moving Argentina into an open market economy with a sustainable economic model, the government faces several near-term challenges, including obtaining support to advance the structural reforms and deregulation agenda and maintaining social support in a recessionary backdrop with high inflation. At Supervielle, we are well-positioned to meet the current challenges with our entire capital shielded against inflation and a loan book with exposure to highly attractive export-oriented sectors, including oil & gas, mining, and agribusiness. We have established a solid and agile foundation, and we are confident in our ability to drive robust expansion once the economy stabilizes and resumes growth. Our confidence is bolstered by our solid 21% Tier 1 capital ratio. Reaffirming our commitment to embedding sustainability at the core of our strategy, today we filed our 2023 integrated report, which reflects our engagement to transparency and disclosure and highlights the progress made towards advancing our ESG goals, and we encourage you all to read it,” concluded Mr. Supervielle. Fourth quarter 2023 Highlights Attributable Net Income of AR$22.5 billion in 4Q23, compared to a net loss of AR$2.5 billion in 4Q22 and a net gain of AR$14.5 million in 3Q23. In FY23, Attributable Net Income was AR$51.4 billion compared to a loss of AR$13.7 billion in FY22. The YoY swing in Net Income reflects the successful execution of the Company’s strategic plan implemented in 2022 and 2023 to optimize operations, consolidate businesses, grow in profitable products and increase cross-sell. ROAE increased to 26.9% in 4Q23 from negative 3.4% in 3Q22 and positive 18.5% in 3Q23. FY23 ROAE reached 16.7% compared to negative 4.5% in FY22. Profit before income tax increased to AR$40.4 billion in 4Q23 compared to a loss of AR$15.2 billion in 4Q22 and a gain of AR$23.3 billion in 3Q23. QoQ performance is explained by: i) 62.7%, or AR$54.2 billion, increase in Adjusted Net Financial Income (Net Financial Income + Result from monetary position) reflecting unusually high financial income on the investment portfolio even with a relevant decline in average volume, and a higher yield on loan portfolio while weak credit demand continued to impact volume, and ii) higher fees from the brokerage business at IOL and asset management. These were partially offset by the following increases: i) 16.0%, or AR$9.3 billion, in expenses, mainly due to higher personnel expenses reflecting the impact of inflation adjustment on personnel expense provisions, and higher D&A mainly due to the impairment on the goodwill of Mila to reflect the business fair value, ii) AR$ 16.6 billion in Other operating expenses reflecting the year-end valuation of the Bank’s real estate assets at market value and a provision to execute several strategic initiatives in different business units, and iii) 33.0%, or AR$2.3 billion, in Net Loan loss provisions. Net Financial Income reached AR$192.6 billion in 4Q23 increasing 130.0% YoY and 64.9% QoQ. The QoQ performance is explained by a higher yield on lower investment portfolio volumes and higher interest earned on loans. These were coupled with a lower average balance of interest-bearing liabilities, resulting from assets and liability management, that reduced interest expenses. Adjusted Net Financial Income (calculated as Net Financial Income + Result from exposure to inflation) was AR$140.6 billion in 4Q23, increasing 94.9% YoY and 62.7% QoQ. The total NPL ratio was 1.2% in 4Q23 improving 230 and 50 bps from 3.5% in 4Q22 and 1.7% in 3Q23, respectively. The QoQ and YoY performance reflect the shift in loans to middle-market corporates and payroll customers along with significantly lower exposure to consumer loans, better retail customer behavior and the sale of delinquent retail loans, mainly open market and former consumer finance customers. Loan loss provisions (LLPs) totaled AR$10.1 billion in 4Q23, remaining flat YoY and increasing 51.3% QoQ. Net loan loss provisions, which is equivalent to loan loss provisions net of recovered charged-off loans and reversed allowances, amounted to AR$9.2 billion in 4Q23 compared to AR$9.7 billion in 4Q22 and AR$6.9 billion in 3Q23. The level of provisioning as of December 31, 2023, reflects the application of the IFRS9 expected loss models. The Coverage ratio increased to 262.4% as of December 31, 2023, from 135.5% as of December 31, 2022 and 182.8% as of September 30, 2023. Efficiency ratio improved to 43.4% in 4Q23, from 91.9% in 4Q22 and 51.7% in 3Q23. The QoQ performance was explained by a 44.8% increase in Revenues mainly reflecting a higher financial margin, partially offset by a 21.5% increase in total expenses. In FY23, the efficiency ratio improved to 54.7% from 79.7% in FY22, driven by a higher financial margin and increased fees together with cost efficiencies. Total Deposits of AR$1,548.9 billion increased 182.9% YoY and 59.8% QoQ in nominal terms, compared to an industry growth of 171.3% YoY and 48.9% QoQ. In real terms, total deposits decreased 9.2% YoY, but increased 4.3% QoQ. The QoQ performance resulted from the higher share of sight deposits reflecting higher transactional deposits from corporate customers and year-end seasonality on saving accounts, while retail time deposits decreased 47%. Average deposits decreased 23.1% YoY and 23.2% QoQ, reflecting assets and liability management. Total Assets increased 4.2% QoQ, and declined 5.0% YoY, to AR$ 2,063.1 billion as of December 31, 2023. The QoQ performance mainly reflects effective asset & liability management with Government securities and Repos & Central Bank Securities increasing sequentially AR$82.6 billion and AR$46.9 billion, respectively, while the average volume declined AR$8.3 billion and AR$310.7 billion, respectively. These were partially offset by weak credit demand which drove a 15.5%, or AR$ 88.1 billion, contraction in loans while inflation peaked in the quarter to 53.3%. Average AR$ Assets decreased 18.6% QoQ. Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio as of December 31, 2023, was 21.0% increasing 417 bps and 805 bps when compared to September 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. Tier 1 Capital Ratio reflects the Bank´s capital creation in 4Q23 on net results together with inflation adjustment of capital and IUDÚ tax efficiencies from the business consolidation which more than offset the expansion in Risk weighted assets and deductions.

Debt-to-equity ratio improved to 0.87-to-1 on January 31, 2024, from 1.08-to-1 on April 30, 2023. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results for Kewaunee Scientific Corporation show a mixed picture, with a significant decline in sales by 23.1%, yet an increase in pre-tax earnings by 70.6%. A deeper analysis reveals that the decrease in sales might be due to strategic changes, such as the decision to stop selling directly to end users, impacting the Domestic Segment. However, this was offset by an increase in net earnings and EBITDA, indicating improved operational efficiency and cost containment measures.The order backlog remains relatively stable, with a minor decrease from the previous year, suggesting a consistent demand for the company's products. The increase in cash on hand and the reduction in both short-term and long-term debt, especially when considering the net debt after accounting for the sale-leaseback transaction, reflect a stronger balance sheet. The improved debt-to-equity ratios further indicate a solid financial position, which could be a positive signal for investors concerned with financial stability and risk management. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Kewaunee's performance in the International Segment is noteworthy, despite the reported decline in international sales. The decrease is attributed to the completion of two large, non-recurring projects in the previous year, which skews year-over-year comparisons. Absent these projects, the company notes that international demand remains robust, which could suggest potential for growth in these markets. This insight is critical for investors who are looking for international expansion and diversification in the company's revenue streams.Additionally, the company's emphasis on its dealer and distribution network as a key factor in maintaining sales activity during typically slower quarters speaks to the strength of its go-to-market strategy. This could be a differentiator in the industry, providing resilience against seasonal fluctuations and ensuring consistent performance. Economist An economist might highlight the broader economic implications of Kewaunee's financial results. The company's ability to increase pre-tax earnings amidst a sales decline could reflect a strategic pivot that prioritizes profitability over volume, which can be a prudent approach in uncertain economic conditions. The improved cash position and working capital management are indicative of a robust operational strategy that enables the company to navigate market volatility effectively.Moreover, the company's debt management strategy, illustrated by the reduction in the debt-to-equity ratio, is particularly relevant in an environment where interest rates may fluctuate. A lower leverage ratio can provide the company with more flexibility and reduce the cost of capital, which is advantageous for long-term growth and investment. 03/06/2024 - 04:28 PM STATESVILLE, N.C., March 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Kewaunee Scientific Corporation (NASDAQ: KEQU) today announced results for its third quarter ended January 31, 2024. Fiscal Year 2024 Third Quarter Results: Sales during the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 were $46,778,000, a decrease of 23.1% compared to sales of $60,821,000 from the prior year's third quarter. Pre-tax earnings for the quarter were $3,515,000 compared to $2,060,000 for the prior year quarter, an increase of 70.6%.

Domestic Segment - Domestic sales for the quarter were $31,774,000, a decrease of 12.1% from sales of $36,134,000 in the prior year quarter. The decrease in Domestic sales was primarily due to the reduction in non-product revenue related to the Company's decision to stop selling directly to end users. This revenue typically includes freight, installation services and buyouts. Domestic segment net income was $2,633,000 compared to $417,000 in the prior year quarter. Domestic segment EBITDA was $3,832,000 compared to $1,012,000 for the prior year quarter. Domestic segment profitability improved versus the prior year quarter because of the strategic go-to-market decisions made in the previous year to stop selling direct, as well as improved manufacturing productivity and cost containment actions. International Segment - International sales for the quarter were $15,004,000, a decrease of 39.2% from sales of $24,687,000 in the prior year quarter. International segment net income was $923,000 compared to $1,561,000 in the prior year quarter. International segment EBITDA was $1,676,000 compared to $2,385,000 for the prior year quarter. The year-over-year decline in sales is attributable to the delivery of two large projects during the prior year that were non-recurring, one in Africa and one in India. Absent this impact, International segment performance remains strong as demand in the international markets served by the Company remain robust. Corporate Segment – Corporate segment pre-tax net loss was $1,069,000 for the quarter, as compared to a pre-tax net loss of $1,144,000 in the prior year quarter. Corporate segment EBITDA for the quarter was ($1,094,000) compared to corporate segment EBITDA of ($714,000) for the prior year quarter. The change in EBITDA was driven primarily by the net change in Corporate cost allocation methodology across our business segments. Total cash on hand on January 31, 2024 was $27,112,000, as compared to $13,815,000 on April 30, 2023. The increase in cash was primarily from improved operating performance, as well as a large customer advance payment received during the quarter for a project in India. Working capital was $54,014,000, as compared to $47,348,000 at the end of the third quarter last year and $47,867,000 on April 30, 2023. The Company had short-term debt of $3,184,000 as of January 31, 2024, as compared to $3,587,000 on April 30, 2023. Long-term debt was $28,655,000 on January 31, 2024, as compared to $29,007,000 on April 30, 2023. The building lease from the Company's December 2021 sale-leaseback transaction accounts for $28,298,000 of the long-term debt on January 31, 2024 and $28,774,000 of the long-term debt on April 30, 2023. Long-term debt, net of the sale-leaseback transaction, was $357,000 on January 31, 2024 as compared to $233,000 on April 30, 2023. The Company's debt-to-equity ratio on January 31, 2024 was 0.87-to-1, as compared to 1.08-to-1 on April 30, 2023. The Company's debt-to-equity ratio, net of the sale-leaseback transaction, on January 31, 2024 was 0.25-to-1, as compared to 0.34-to-1 on April 30, 2023. ""Our financial performance for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was strong,"" said Thomas D. Hull III, Kewaunee's President and Chief Executive Officer. ""As discussed in previous quarterly releases, we are realizing the benefits of executing on our strategic objectives."" ""While the third quarter can often be our softest quarter due to the holiday schedule in the US as well as customers looking to wrap up construction projects before the calendar-end, we did not experience a significant slow-down in activity during the quarter. This is a testament to our world-class dealer and distribution network who continue to perform at a high level in response to customer demand."" ""Looking ahead, we remain optimistic about the future, with a strong pipeline of projects, a sound strategy, and a commitment to sustained financial performance."" ___________________________ 1 EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure.

We believe EBITDA and Segment EBITDA allow management and investors to compare our performance to other companies on a consistent basis without regard to depreciation and amortization, which can vary significantly between companies depending upon many factors. EBITDA and Segment EBITDA are not calculations based upon generally accepted accounting principles, and the method for calculating EBITDA and Segment EBITDA can vary among companies. The amounts included in the EBITDA and Segment EBITDA calculations, however, are derived from amounts included in the historical consolidated statements of operations. EBITDA and Segment EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to net earnings (loss) or operating earnings (loss) as an indicator of the Company's operating performance, or as an alternative to operating cash flows as a measure of liquidity.

Financial Analyst The recent financial performance of Stabilis Solutions, Inc. highlights a positive trajectory with the delivery of positive net income and cash flow from operations totaling $6.7 million for the year 2023. The company's net leverage ratio of 0.6x is indicative of a conservative capital structure, which is favorable in terms of financial stability and risk management. The liquidity position, with more than $11.0 million in cash and available liquidity, provides the company with the flexibility to navigate market conditions and invest in growth opportunities.Stabilis' strategic shift towards long-duration, take-or-pay contracts could lead to more predictable and stable revenue streams, which is a positive sign for investors seeking reduced volatility in earnings. The anticipated growth in the marine bunkering business, expected to represent over one-third of total revenue, suggests a significant market opportunity that the company is well-positioned to capitalize on. Market Research Analyst The small-scale LNG market is gaining momentum, particularly in sectors such as marine bunkering and aerospace, where environmental considerations and efficiency gains are driving demand. Stabilis Solutions' operational updates indicate a robust commercial momentum and a strategic focus on these high-growth end markets.

The expected increase in sales volumes for aerospace-related LNG signifies a growing market segment that could provide a substantial revenue stream for Stabilis in the future. Energy Sector Analyst Stabilis Solutions' focus on LNG bunkering for marine applications is particularly noteworthy given the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) regulations on sulfur emissions, which have increased the attractiveness of LNG as a marine fuel. The company's multi-year contract with Carnival Corporation to provide LNG fueling operations represents a strategic move to establish a foothold in this niche but expanding market.The capital expenditure of $10.3 million, with $7.8 million allocated to growth, signifies an aggressive investment in capacity expansion, particularly in the LNG train and bunkering equipment.

EBITDA is defined as Earnings from continuing operations before Interest (includes interest income and interest expense), Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA further adjusted for certain special items that occur during the reporting period, as noted below. We include EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to provide investors with a supplemental measure of our operating performance. Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA is a recognized term under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (""GAAP""). Accordingly, they should not be used as an indicator of, or an alternative to, net income as a measure of operating performance. In addition, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to be measures of free cash flow available for management's discretionary use, as they do not consider certain cash requirements, such as debt service requirements. Because the definition of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may vary among companies and industries, it may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. The following table provides a reconciliation of net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands).

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Vermilion Energy Inc. regarding a cash dividend of $0.12 CDN per share represents a tangible return on investment for shareholders. Dividends are a critical factor in the total return calculation for investors and can signal a company's financial health and its board's confidence in future earnings. In assessing the impact of this dividend declaration, it's important to consider the dividend yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the stock price. A stable or increasing dividend yield can attract income-focused investors and potentially support the stock price.However, investors should also scrutinize the payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends. A payout ratio that is too high may not be sustainable in the long term, especially for companies that require significant capital reinvestment. Thus, an analysis of Vermilion's earnings, cash flow statements and capital expenditure plans would be pertinent to evaluate the sustainability of this dividend payment. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, dividend announcements are often interpreted as signals about a company's future prospects. A consistent or increasing dividend may be viewed positively, suggesting that Vermilion believes it can maintain or grow its earnings. This can have a favorable impact on investor sentiment and might lead to a more bullish outlook on the stock.On the other hand, the energy sector is subject to volatility due to fluctuating commodity prices, geopolitical issues and changing regulatory environments. Therefore, it's crucial to contextualize this dividend announcement within the broader industry trends. An analysis of Vermilion's operational efficiencies, cost management and production levels in comparison to its peers can provide additional insights into the company's competitive position within the sector. Tax Expert The classification of Vermilion's dividend as an 'eligible dividend' for the purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada) has tax implications for Canadian shareholders. Eligible dividends are taxed at a lower rate than regular income, which can be advantageous for investors in higher tax brackets. This preferential tax treatment can increase the after-tax return on investment for these shareholders.For international investors, the tax implications may differ and it would be advisable to consider any tax treaties between Canada and the investor's country of residence. Understanding the tax consequences is essential for investors to accurately assess the net benefit of the dividend received. 03/06/2024 - 05:05 PM CALGARY, AB, March 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Vermilion Energy Inc. (""Vermilion"") (TSX: VET) NYSE: VET) is pleased to announce a cash dividend of $0.12 CDN per share, payable on April 15, 2024 to all shareholders of record on March 28, 2024.

(TSX: ARR) (OTCQX: ATRWF) (“ARR” or the “Corporation”), is pleased to report its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended 2023 with a conference call to follow Thursday March 7, 2024 at 9:00 am EDT. The Corporation's 50% owned Great Bay Renewables (""GBR"") joint venture recorded $10.4 million in royalty revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $7.3 million in 2022, an increase of 44%. Operating cash flows at GBR were $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to $2.7 million in 2022, an increase of 89%. For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, GBR recorded $2.6 million in royalty revenue compared to $1.7 million in Q4 2022. Operating cash flows at GBR were $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to $0.4 million in Q4 2022. Selected financial information for the Corporation is included in the table below: Year ended December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Revenue per consolidated financial statements $ 2,665,000 $ 781,000 $ 82,000 Net loss (1,071,000 ) (780,000 ) (3,416,000 ) Total assets 214,989,000 201,613,000 165,565,000 Total liabilities 9,618,000 6,566,000 6,510,000 Non-GAAP financial measures(1) Proportionate revenue (1) $ 7,934,000 $ 4,420,000 $ 417,000 Adjusted EBITDA (1) 3,765,000 830,000 (2,958,000 ) Adjusted operating cash flow(1) 2,986,000 163,000 (2,342,000 ) ARR reported a net loss of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, proportionate revenue(1) of $7.9 million, adjusted EBITDA(1) of $3.8 million and adjusted operating cash flow(1) of $3.0 million. This compares to a net loss of $0.8 million, proportionate revenue(1) of $4.4 million, adjusted EBITDA(1) of $0.8 million and adjusted operating cash flow(1) of $0.2 million for 2022. Total proportionate revenue(1) for the year was comprised of $5.2 million in royalty revenue and $2.7 million in interest income. For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, ARR reported a net loss of $0.2 million, proportionate revenue(1) of $2.3 million, adjusted EBITDA(1) of $1.0 million and adjusted operating cash flow(1) of $1.3 million. This compares to net loss of $0.4 million, proportionate revenue(1) of $1.2 million, adjusted EBITDA(1) of $0.1 million and adjusted operating cash flow(1) of $0.6 million in Q4 2022. Total proportionate revenue(1) in Q4 2023 was comprised of $1.3 million in royalty revenue and $1.0 million in interest income. Full year production from royalties acquired in late 2022 led to higher royalty revenues for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, compared to prior year periods. The Corporation’s current quarter and year end results reflect the proportionate share of increased revenues at GBR offset by the proportionate share of increased costs including GBR’s non-cash share of loss in equity investments Bluestar Energy Capital LLC (""Bluestar"") and Nova Energy LLC (""Nova"") of approximately $0.3 million and $6.5 million respectively. Bluestar and Nova continue to engage in early-stage renewable energy development resulting in increased levels of expenses with minimal offsetting revenues thus far at those entities. Nova continues to make good progress in building its greenfield development pipeline as the current portfolio of projects has now grown to approximately 5GW of wind, solar and battery storage projects. Subsequent to December 31, 2023 GBR announced that it had entered into a $30 million royalty investment with Apex Clean Energy (“Apex”) related to Apex’s 195 MWac Angelo Solar project in Tom Green County, Texas (“Angelo”) which is anticipated to achieve commercial operations in May 2024. In addition, another wind project from GBR's development pipeline has achieved commercial operations and is expected to contribute to GBR's revenue beginning in Q2 2024. For 2024, GBR expects to realize renewable royalty revenue of $13.0 million to $16.0 million based upon the current royalty portfolio including construction stage assets that are expected to reach commercial operations in 2024, and recent merchant price assumptions. Additional potential revenue that may result from entitlements related to project sales by developers Hodson Energy and Hexagon Energy has not been included in this estimate. At December 31, 2023 the Corporation held cash of $88.7 million and has 2024 expected commitments related to existing GBR investment agreements of approximately $22.5 million. In addition, during the fourth quarter, GBR entered into senior secured credit financing agreements in the aggregate amount of $246.5 million (of which $117.9 million has been drawn by GBR). The drawdown was used for closing costs as well as return of capital totaling $108.2 million to the joint venture partners. The facility has available liquidity of $105.6 million at the time of this release. This credit facility enables GBR to accelerate its growth trajectory while maintaining a competitive cost of capital. ARR has not pledged any security in favour of the agreements. Commenting on the year, Frank Getman, CEO of GBR, said, ""In 2023, we continued to make great progress in building our business. In addition to growing revenues by 44% and adding another top-tier developer to our portfolio with our $40 million investment commitment into Hexagon, we significantly expanded our liquidity and enhanced our cost of capital for future investments with the $246.5 million credit facility that closed in the fourth quarter last year.” Getman added, “We’ve started 2024 strong, with our recent $30 million royalty investment into Apex’s 195 MWac Angelo Solar project and a robust pipeline of new investment opportunities we are pursuing."" Brian Dalton, CEO of ARR added, ""As experienced royalty company builders, we recognize and appreciate the contrarian investment windows being presented by current market conditions and sentiment. These are the periods when opportunities are greatest to build long-term value through the royalty model and the GBR team has put itself in an excellent position to continue to seize the current opportunity."" Non-GAAP Financial Measures Management uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: proportionate royalty and other revenue (“proportionate revenue”, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (adjusted EBITDA) and adjusted operating cash flow. Management uses these measures to monitor the financial performance of the Corporation and believes these measures enable investors and analysts to compare the Corporation’s financial performance with its competitors and/or evaluate the results of its underlying business which are held primarily in jointly controlled entities. These measures are intended to provide additional information, not to replace International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) measures, and do not have a standard definition under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. As these measures do not have a standardized meaning, they may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies.

The jet offers a 3200 nautical-mile range and spacious cabin amenities, marking a strategic move in modernizing the company's fleet and expanding its fractional program. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The strategic expansion of flyExclusive's fleet with the Challenger 350 super-midsize aircraft represents a significant investment in the company's growth and competitive positioning within the private jet charter industry. The Challenger 350 is known for its spacious cabin and long-range capabilities, making it attractive for high-net-worth individuals and corporate clients seeking premium travel experiences.From a market perspective, the fractional ownership model allows customers to enjoy the benefits of private jet ownership without the full costs and responsibilities. This model has been growing in popularity, particularly in a post-pandemic era where travelers prioritize safety, convenience and luxury. flyExclusive's decision to sell shares in increments aligns with consumer demand for flexible and cost-effective private travel solutions.Additionally, the company's listing on NYSE American in December could be indicative of a broader strategic plan to increase market visibility and attract investment. The move to modernize the fleet with a focus on a specific aircraft type like the Challenger 350 could streamline operations and maintenance, potentially improving profit margins over time. Financial Analyst The announcement of flyExclusive's addition of the Challenger 350 aircraft to its fleet and the potential for up to 20 more within the next two years is a forward-looking move that may have significant financial implications. This expansion will likely require substantial capital expenditure, which could impact the company's short-term financials. However, investors will be looking at the potential for increased revenue streams from the fractional sales of jet hours and the long-term benefits of a modernized fleet.As the company grows its fleet, economies of scale could be realized, leading to reduced operating costs per flight hour. The attractiveness of the Challenger 350's amenities and capabilities may also allow flyExclusive to command premium pricing. The company's recent appointment of an industry veteran to oversee fractional sales suggests a strong commitment to this revenue stream, which could be a key growth driver moving forward.Investors should monitor the utilization rates of the new aircraft and customer uptake of the fractional ownership offers, as these will be critical indicators of the success of this strategic initiative. Aviation Industry Analyst The introduction of the Challenger 350 into flyExclusive's fleet is a noteworthy development in the private aviation sector, particularly within the super-midsize category. The Challenger 350's range of 3200 nautical miles positions it as a competitive option for transcontinental flights, offering a nonstop travel capability that is highly valued among private jet users. This could potentially increase the company's market share in the charter service industry.Comparing the cabin specifications to a Gulfstream G-IVSP highlights the Challenger 350's value proposition in terms of space and comfort—a crucial factor in the luxury-oriented private jet market. The emphasis on amenities such as WiFi, a full galley and the availability of cabin attendants caters to the rising expectations of private jet customers who seek a blend of convenience and exclusivity.The timing of fleet expansion is also significant, as the private jet industry continues to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with an uptick in demand for private travel solutions. flyExclusive's investment in a modern fleet could position it well to capitalize on industry trends and consumer preferences. 03/06/2024 - 05:05 PM The addition of this Supermid jet represents the first of as many as 20 Challenger 350s to be added to the flyExclusive fleet over the next two years. KINSTON, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- flyExclusive, (NYSEAMERICAN: FLYX) (“flyExclusive” or the “Company”) a provider of premium private jet charter experiences, today announced that it has added the first Challenger 350 super-midsize aircraft to its fractional program. The jet, which has a 3200 nautical-mile range, is the first of what could be as many as 20 Challenger 350s that the company could add to its fleet within the next two years. “With the addition of the Challenger 350 to our fractional fleet, customers will have the chance to own a jet that boasts a cross-country, nonstop range in the largest cabin in the super-midsize category,” CEO and founder Jim Segrave said. “This is a beautiful jet that our customers will love. It’s fast, and it’s spacious. Whether you want to stand up and walk on the flat floor during the flight, get work done as you fly non-stop cross country or enjoy a meal prepared in a full galley, you can do it on our Challenger 350s.” The aircraft cabin is comparable to a Gulfstream G-IVSP and has space for eight passengers and 106 cubic feet of baggage. flyExclusive will sell shares in the jets in 50-, 75-, 100-, 150- and 200-hour increments. The arrival of the aircraft signals the next phase of the company’s strategic focus on modernizing its fleet and expanding its fractional program.

The conference call may be accessed through MariMed’s Investor Relations website, or by clicking the following link: MRMD Q432 Earnings Call. FOURTH QUARTER 2023 OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS During the fourth quarter, the Company announced the following developments in the implementation of its strategic growth plan: October 11: MariMed announced the opening of Thrive Dispensary in Casey, Illinois, marking the fifth dispensary it owns or manages in that state, and the 12th dispensary it owns or manages across its five-state footprint. In response to the state’s request to open as soon as possible, the Company began operating the dispensary from a temporary mobile facility until regulatory approval for a permanent brick-and-mortar facility is received.November 20: The Company announced a $58.7 million debt refinancing, lowering the Company's weighted average cost of debt to an industry low 8%. Highlights of the deal include a 10-year term with a fixed 8.4% interest rate for the first five years, and interest-only payments for the initial 12 months. Principal payments calculated on a 20-year amortization schedule will begin in the 13th month and continue for the life of the loan. There are no pre-payment penalties. The deal resulted in ZERO dilution to shareholders - no new equity was issued.December 4: MariMed announced commencement of operations at its new processing facility in Mt. Vernon, Illinois. The state-of-the-art facility contains an extraction lab to produce concentrates and a production kitchen for the manufacture of edibles and other derivative products. Later that month, MariMed's began selling its branded products through the Company's five Thrive Dispensary locations in the state, and began state-wide wholesale operations in January, 2024. The co-located cultivation facility is currently under construction and is expected to be completed in 2024. OTHER DEVELOPMENTSSubsequent to the end of the fourth quarter, the Company announced the following developments: February 26: MariMed received Certificate of Occupancy from the Illinois Cannabis Control Commission to commence operations in its permanent brick-and-mortar facility for its Casey, Illinois adult-use dispensary. The Company anticipates transitioning from its temporary facility at the same location and commencing operations in the new facility during the first quarter of 2024.March 6: MariMed announced expanded Maryland footprint with pending dispensary acquisition in Upper Marlboro. On February 1st, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the operating assets of Our Community Wellness & Compassionate Care Center, Inc, a medical licensed dispensary operator located in Upper Marlboro, Maryland. Total considerations were $5.25 million for the acquisition, which is subject to approval by the Maryland Cannabis Administration (“MCA”), will provide the Company with its second owned dispensary in Maryland. Upon MCA approval of the license transfer, MariMed will apply for an adult-use dispensary license to commence recreational dispensary sales. 2024 FINANCIAL TARGETS MariMed's full year 2024 financial targets are based on organic growth of its existing operating assets and do not include new revenue-generating projects such as commencing adult-use sales in Ohio, opening the new processing facility in Missouri, opening the new dispensary in Maryland, or acquiring other operating assets or licenses. The Company believes this more conservative approach to offering financial targets will allow investors and analysts to focus on key operating milestones versus discussions about issues outside the Company's control such as construction or regulatory delays. As such, the Company's full year 2024 financial targets are: Revenue growth of 5% to 7%;Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA growth of 0% to 2%; andCapital expenditures of $10 million. DISCUSSION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES MariMed’s management uses several different financial measures, both GAAP and non-GAAP, in analyzing and assessing the overall performance of its business, and making operating decisions, planning and forecasting future periods. The Company has provided in this release several non-GAAP financial measures: Non-GAAP Gross margin, Non-GAAP Net income (loss), Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA margin, as supplements to Revenue, Gross margin, Net (loss) income and other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in reviewing and assessing the performance of the Company, and when planning and forecasting future periods, as they provide meaningful operating results by excluding the effects of expenses that are not reflective of its operating business performance. In addition, the Company’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods and for financial and operational decision-making. The presentation of these non-GAAP measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that investors and analysts benefit from considering non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the Company’s financial results and its ongoing business, as it allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in the business. In particular, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is used by many investors and analysts themselves, along with other metrics, to compare financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies. As there are no standardized methods of calculating non-GAAP financial measures, the Company’s calculations may differ from those used by analysts, investors and other companies, even those within the cannabis industry, and therefore may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures used by others. Management defines non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA as income from operations, determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding the following items: depreciation of fixed assets;amortization of acquired intangible assets;Impairment or write-downs of intangible assets;stock-based compensation;legal settlements; andacquisition-related and other expenses.

Financial Analyst The public offering of 12,000,000 shares by Crescent Energy Company, conducted by Independence Energy Aggregator L.P., is a significant transaction that can influence the company's stock liquidity and shareholder composition. The sale does not generate proceeds for Crescent, as shares are offered by a current stakeholder, yet it could dilute existing shareholders' equity. The market's response to this event will hinge on investor perception of Crescent's valuation and the Selling Stockholder's future involvement.The underwriters' option to purchase additional shares introduces potential for increased liquidity but also further dilution. It's crucial to monitor the offering's impact on the stock price, as large offerings can sometimes lead to price depreciation. However, the concurrent OpCo Unit Purchase indicates a strategic maneuver to consolidate ownership structure, which may be viewed positively if it simplifies Crescent's capital structure and aligns with long-term growth plans. Market Research Analyst In the context of the energy sector, such offerings and subsequent ownership restructuring are not uncommon. The energy market's volatility often leads companies to seek financial flexibility and optimize capital structures. Analyzing Crescent's market position and the sector's performance is essential to understand the offering's timing and potential success. The involvement of reputable underwriters like Wells Fargo Securities and Raymond James suggests confidence in the offering's execution, which can be reassuring to investors.Furthermore, the energy sector is currently under scrutiny due to environmental concerns and the transition to renewable sources. Investors may be evaluating Crescent's portfolio and strategies in light of these trends, making the offering's outcome a reflection of market sentiment towards Crescent's long-term sustainability and profitability. Legal Expert The offering is being conducted in compliance with SEC regulations, as indicated by the effective registration statement and the use of a prospectus and prospectus supplement. It's important to note that the OpCo Unit Purchase is contingent upon the completion of the offering, which is a legal structuring that ensures the transaction aligns with Crescent's internal agreements and the Selling Stockholder's commitments.Prospective investors should be aware that the offering's legal framework, including the registration statement and prospectus, provides critical information about the risks and benefits associated with the transaction. The legal stipulations that no sales will occur in jurisdictions where it would be unlawful, underscores the regulatory complexities of such offerings and the importance of adhering to securities laws. 03/06/2024 - 04:26 PM HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Crescent Energy Company (“Crescent” or the “Company”) (NYSE: CRGY) today announced the commencement of an underwritten public offering of 12,000,000 shares of its Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“common stock”).

The company has completed over $1.1 billion in liquidity transactions with general partners through fund restructurings. Limited partners can participate in transactions exchanging interests for convertible preferred stock and potential earnout payments. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The transaction between Beneficient and ff Venture Capital signifies a strategic move that has the potential to substantially increase Beneficient's collateral base. The estimated growth of $121.5 million in loan portfolio collateral, assuming full participation from limited partners, is a significant figure that could enhance the company's balance sheet strength. This, in turn, might affect the company's creditworthiness and its ability to secure future financing at favorable terms. Additionally, the completion of over $1.1 billion of NAV in liquidity transactions underscores the scale and impact of the company's operations within the alternative asset space.Investors should take note of the potential dilution effects due to the issuance of Resettable Convertible Preferred Stock, which could convert into Class A common stock. While this could potentially lead to share price volatility, the earnout mechanism tied to the performance of the acquired assets could provide a long-term value proposition. It's also important to monitor the shareholder approval process as it could influence the transaction's timeline and final terms. Market Research Analyst The partnership with ff Venture Capital, a prominent player in venture capital, reflects Beneficient's strategic alignment with innovative sectors like fintech. The decision to allow ff Venture Capital to continue managing the alternative assets post-acquisition could be seen as a vote of confidence in ff Venture Capital's asset management capabilities, which might be a positive signal to the market about the quality of the underlying assets.Market participants should consider the broader implications of such liquidity solutions in the alternative asset management industry. By enabling general partners to solve for early exit demands, Beneficient is addressing a notable market need, which could position the company as a go-to provider for liquidity solutions. This could potentially attract more business in the future, contributing to the company's growth trajectory. Legal Expert The stipulation that the transactions are subject to shareholder approval and applicable listing standards introduces a layer of regulatory complexity and investor scrutiny. The condition that the Preferred Stock can be repurchased if Beneficient's Class A common stock is delisted post-closing adds a safeguard for investors but also implies a scenario that stakeholders should be aware of. It's crucial for investors to understand the legal mechanisms in place that could affect the final outcome of the transaction and their investment.Furthermore, the creation of special purpose continuation vehicles to acquire the alternative assets is a sophisticated legal structure that may offer tax advantages and risk isolation. This structure could potentially enhance the overall value proposition of the transaction for both Beneficient and the limited partners of ff Venture Capital. 03/06/2024 - 05:00 PM - Related liquidity transactions with three funds managed by ff Venture Capital, a leading investor in emerging industries, including fintech - With full participation from all limited partners, it is estimated Ben’s loan portfolio collateral will grow by up to $121.5 million - Upon closing and assuming full participation, Beneficient will have completed, in aggregate, over $1.1 billion of NAV in liquidity transactions with general partners through fund restructurings and continuation vehicles DALLAS, March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Beneficient (Nasdaq: BENF) (together with its affiliates, “Ben” or the “Company”), a technology-enabled platform focused on providing liquidity and related trust and custody services to holders of alternative assets, today announced that it has agreed to the financing of liquidity transactions for three separate funds managed by ff Venture Capital, a leading venture capital firm. Limited partners in each of the participating funds have the option to participate and, in exchange for their respective interests in the fund’s alternative assets, receive, in the aggregate, up to approximately $62 million in stated value of shares of the Company’s Resettable Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock”), which is convertible at the election of the holder into shares of the Company’s Class A common stock and potential earnout payments over a period of up to ten (10) years. The earnout payments represent the amount of cash available for distribution from the acquired alternative assets in excess of a designated return to the Company. Consummation of the transactions is subject to shareholder approval pursuant to applicable listing standards. In the event the Company’s Class A common stock is no longer listed on an approved exchange following the closing as specified in the purchase agreements, the holders of the Preferred Stock would have the right to cause the special purpose continuation vehicles that are the acquirers of the alternative assets to repurchase the shares of the Preferred Stock then outstanding with proceeds then available from the alternative assets. Should all limited partners elect to participate in the transactions, it is estimated that these transactions will represent an increase in the collateral for Ben’s loan portfolio by up to $121.5 million of interests in alternative assets, subject to the earnout. These transactions, subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including the shareholder approval discussed above, are expected to close in the third calendar quarter of 2024. Following closing, ff Venture Capital LLC will continue to manage the alternative assets acquired by the newly created special purpose continuation vehicles. “Ben strives to provide flexible, customized liquidity and capital solutions for general partners managing alternative assets, facing challenges in raising capital, or solving for early exit demands from their limited partners,” said Brad Heppner, Chief Executive Officer and founder of Beneficient. “This transaction with ff Venture Capital and its limited partners illustrates not only how we can provide a new means of liquidity for valuable alternative assets, but also how Ben’s GP Solutions can enable general partners to retain a portion of the upside of the in the alternative assets and underlying investments for their limited partners. Additionally, as a publicly traded entity, financing can be provided directly from Ben’s own balance sheet, which can potentially result in more flexible and creative solutions for general partners and their limited partners.” “We are pleased to be able to offer this new and creative liquidity solution to our limited partners,” said John Frankel, Founding Partner of ff Venture Capital.

Reduced debt outstanding by $30 million. 2024 guidance forecasts growth in production and reduction in capital expenditures. Negative None. Financial Analyst Free Cash Flow (FCF) is a critical measure for investors as it represents the cash a company can generate after accounting for capital expenditures to maintain or expand its asset base. Riley Permian's reported FCF of $33 million for Q4 and $70 million for the full year indicates a strong financial position, enabling them to pay dividends and reduce debt. The company's ability to generate FCF amidst capital expenditure reductions signals operational efficiency and a disciplined capital allocation strategy, which is favorable for long-term shareholder value. Market Research Analyst The growth in oil production and proved reserves suggests that Riley Permian is successfully expanding its operational base. The 49% increase in oil production and 62% in total production, along with a 39% increase in proved reserves, highlight the company's effective integration of acquisitions and robust development program. The company's strategic focus on organic development and acquisitions, such as the New Mexico Acquisition, is reflected in these numbers. Investors may interpret this as a positive indicator of the company's resource management and potential for sustained growth. Energy Sector Analyst The transition towards Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) methods, including CO2 injection, demonstrates Riley Permian's commitment to improving recovery rates and extending the life of its assets. The company's EOR pilot project and its plans for long-term expansion opportunities are indicative of a forward-looking approach to resource extraction. This could provide a competitive advantage in the energy sector, particularly if it leads to cost-effective recovery of additional reserves. However, the success of these projects will depend on factors such as the availability of industrial CO2 emissions and technological efficacy, which investors should monitor closely. 03/06/2024 - 05:00 PM OKLAHOMA CITY, March 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Riley Exploration Permian, Inc.

Bobby D. Riley, Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board, said ""We had outstanding operational and financial performance for 2023. This success continues to demonstrate our established track record of growth through both organic development and strategic acquisitions. Over the full year, the Company achieved a remarkable 49% growth in oil production and 62% total production growth year-over-year, which includes the impact of the New Mexico Acquisition for nine months of 2023. ""Our production growth on our legacy assets encompassed a 22% year-over-year increase organically and demonstrates our continued ability to achieve annual organic volume growth. Furthermore, our Free Cash Flow(1) experienced a year-over-year increase of 26%, and we increased our dividend by 9%. The Company increased proved reserves by 39%, primarily attributed to the New Mexico Acquisition, complemented by a robust development program. ""Looking ahead to 2024, our objective is to achieve a 10% growth in oil production while concurrently reducing capital expenditures by 10%. Our focus is on executing efficient operations and implementing cost-saving measures, which we believe will be the most impactful aspect of our 2024 plan."" OPERATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY UPDATE During the fourth quarter, the Company drilled 6 gross operated horizontal wells, including 4 in Texas and 2 in New Mexico. The Company completed 4 gross operated horizontal wells and turned to sales 2 gross operated horizontal wells. For the full year 2023, the Company drilled 23 gross operated horizontal wells, including 17 gross wells in Texas and 6 gross wells in New Mexico. The Company completed 18 gross operated horizontal wells and turned to sales 18 gross operated horizontal wells. The tables below provide a summary of our operating activity for the fourth quarter of 2023.

As compared to December 31, 2022, net acreage increased by 45%, driven primarily by the New Mexico Acquisition, as well as an 11% increase in Texas net acreage. The Company continues testing at its EOR pilot project, which is a 400-acre project area with six vertical injector wells and one horizontal water injector, injecting water and CO2 to push oil toward two horizontal producing wells. The Company completed installation of CO2 compression in early 2024 and is currently injecting 12 MMcf/d of CO2 into the reservoir, including 10 MMcf/d of purchased CO2 and 2 MMcf/d of recycled CO2. Continued forward testing will include monitoring pore volumes of CO2 injection and reservoir fluid movement with the use of tracers. We have obtained valuable information from the pilot so far and expect a full feasibility report sometime in 2024. We have demonstrated the ability to inject large volumes of CO2 into the reservoir with minimal to moderate breakthrough. Long term expansion opportunities will be dependent on availability of industrial CO2 emissions, (which was the basis of our initial thesis), further depletion of primary production and then re-pressurization of the reservoir with water to minimum miscibility pressure for optimal CO2 affects. This creates a long-term opportunity for enhanced oil recovery in the future. The Company successfully initiated temporary operations on the first phase of its baseload power generation facility, owned by our joint venture RPC Power LLC, late in the fourth quarter 2023. Construction of the onsite power generation facility was predominately completed during 2023 with temporary power generation beginning in November 2023 and the onsite power generation facility expected to be operational in spring of 2024.The thermal generation facility uses post-processed, take-in-kind natural gas as feedstock fuel. Currently, the facility is powering approximately 36% of our Yoakum County, TX operations.

RESERVES Estimates of Riley Permian's proved reserves as of December 31, 2023 were prepared by Ryder Scott Company, L.P., the Company's third-party reservoir engineer, using the SEC pricing methodology Proved reserves at year-end 2023 of 108 MMBoe increased by 30 MMBoe or 39% over year-end 2022 reserves. Oil represents 62% of Riley Permian's total proved reserves. Proved developed reserves (""PDP"") increased by 23% to 60 MMBoe, corresponding to 56% of total proved reserves. Proved undeveloped reserves (""PUD"") increased to 48 MMBoe, a 66% increase over year-end 2022. At December 31, 2023, standardized measure of discounted cash flows and PV-10(1) were $1,260 million and $1,584 million, respectively. The net proved reserve additions resulted in a reserve replacement ratio (defined as the sum of extensions and discoveries, revisions, acquisitions and divestitures, divided by annual production) of 543% for the year ended December 31, 2023. The organic reserve replacement ratio (defined as the sum of extensions and discoveries and revisions, divided by annual production) was 159%. Acquisitions were the primary contributor to the increase in reserves at 26 MMBoe. The Company had extensions and discoveries to proved reserves of 23 MMBoe, which consisted of 8 MMBoe added to PDP as a result of drilling successful wells that were previously classified as unproved locations, and 15 MMBoe added to PUDs as a result of drilling successful wells offsetting locations that were previously unproven locations. The Company had downward revisions of previous estimates of 12 MMBoe, which are primarily attributable to the removal of PUDs due to changes in the Company's development schedule. Consistent with SEC guidelines, PUDs are limited to those locations that are reasonably certain to be developed within five years.

The average working interest on gross operated wells drilled is subject to change and may have corresponding impacts on investing expenditures. The Company anticipates a notable increase in sales of processed natural gas and NGLs from its Yoakum County, Texas, operations during the second quarter of 2024, corresponding with a capacity expansion at our midstream counterparty's processing plant. Full-year 2024 guidance for total equivalent production volumes incorporates this anticipated increase in natural gas and NGL sales. Further, this anticipated increase leads to a disproportionately larger growth forecast for total equivalent production (17% growth year-over-year at the guidance midpoint) relative to the growth forecast for oil production alone (10% growth year-over-year at the guidance midpoint). The completion and timing of the plant capacity expansion is outside of the Company's control, and delays in the plant being fully operational could lead to lower actual results for the Company's total equivalent production volumes due to lower natural gas and natural gas liquids processed.

Decrease in oilfield solutions segment sales by 26% in 2023. Financial Analyst Intrepid Potash's reported financial results show a significant net loss, both for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2023, which is a critical point of concern for investors. The inclusion of substantial non-cash impairment charges suggests a reevaluation of asset values, particularly in the East mine and West mine. This could be indicative of underlying issues such as operational inefficiencies or market challenges that have led to a decrease in asset profitability. The impairment charges need to be scrutinized to understand their impact on the company's future earnings potential. The capital expenditure guidance for 2024, set lower than 2023's actual expenditures, reflects a strategic pivot towards cost management and could signal a more conservative approach in the face of market uncertainties.Additionally, the Cooperative Development Agreement with XTO Holdings represents a significant inflow of cash, which could provide a buffer against operational losses. This agreement is a strategic move that enhances liquidity and may reassure investors about the company's financial stability in the short term. However, the long-term success of this partnership and the contingent payments based on drilling activities introduce a level of uncertainty that stakeholders should consider. Market Research Analyst The global potash market dynamics are crucial in understanding Intrepid Potash's performance. The decline in potash and Trio® sales prices, as noted in the report, reflects the broader trend of price corrections following the peak in 2022. This could be due to increased global production and the stabilization of supply chains that were previously disrupted. The reported increase in potash sales volume, despite lower prices, suggests that demand remains robust, likely supported by strong agricultural commodity prices. The company's strategic focus on improving production rates at solar solution potash assets is an attempt to capitalize on this demand and improve cost efficiency.However, the company's production and sales performance must be contextualized within the competitive landscape. Factors such as international trade policies, currency fluctuations and the entry of new market players could significantly influence Intrepid's market position. The progress in the lithium project at Wendover also highlights diversification efforts, which could open up new revenue streams and reduce reliance on traditional potash sales. Legal Expert The Third Amendment to the Cooperative Development Agreement with XTO Holdings has legal implications that merit attention. The structure of the agreement, including the initial payment and the conditional future payments, introduces contractual obligations that may affect Intrepid's financial planning. The stipulation of additional payments based on specific drilling activities suggests a performance-based contract that ties Intrepid's financial inflows to XTO's operational success. Investors should be aware of the legal complexities that could arise from such agreements, including potential disputes over payment triggers and operational benchmarks.Furthermore, the final air permit for the Intrepid South Sand Project represents a significant milestone in regulatory compliance, which is essential for the project's advancement. Legal due diligence and ongoing regulatory engagement will be crucial in mitigating risks associated with environmental regulations, which can impact project timelines and costs. 03/06/2024 - 04:30 PM Denver, CO, March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Intrepid Potash, Inc. (NYSE:IPI) (""Intrepid"", the ""Company"", ""we"", ""us"" and ""our"") today reports its financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year of 2023. Key Financial & Operational Highlights for the Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2023 Total sales of $56.7 million in the fourth quarter and $279.1 million for the full-year 2023.Net loss of $37.3 million (or $2.91 per diluted share) and $35.7 million (or $2.80 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter and full-year 2023, respectively, and an adjusted net loss(1) of $5.2 million and $3.0 million, respectively. Included in the GAAP net loss figures are non-cash impairment charges of $42.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $43.3 million for the full-year 2023. Adjusted EBITDA(1) of $7.1 million for the fourth quarter, bringing our full-year 2023 adjusted EBITDA to $41.6 million.Cash flow from operations of $4.6 million in the fourth quarter, bringing our full-year 2023 cash flow from operations to $43.2 million.In December 2023, we announced the Third Amendment to the Cooperative Development Agreement with XTO Holdings (“XTO”), pursuant to which Intrepid received an initial $50 million in fees for Intrepid’ s agreement to support and not oppose XTO’s development and operation of oil and gas interests within a specified area. The Third Amendment also stipulates the following: Intrepid will receive an additional guaranteed, one-time $50 million payment, which XTO will pay within 90 days upon the earlier occurrence of (i) either the approval of the first new or expanded drilling island within a specific area to be used by XTO, or (ii) within seven years of the anniversary of the Third Amendment effective date; andXTO is also required to pay additional amounts to Intrepid of up to a maximum of $100 million in the event of certain additional drilling activities, although the timing and exact amount are uncertain. The breakdown of the $42.8 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2023 is as follows: $31.9 million related to our conventional langbeinite mine (""East mine""), $9.9 million related to the remaining assets at our West mine - which has been in care and maintenance since 2016 - and $1.0 million related to various water recycling assets. Liquidity & Investments We ended 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $4.1 million and had $4.0 million of outstanding borrowings on our $150 million revolving credit facility.As of March 1, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $35.4 million and we had no outstanding borrowings on our credit facility, for total liquidity of approximately $185.4 million.Intrepid maintains an investment account of short-and-long-term fixed income securities that had a balance of approximately $3.9 million as of March 1, 2024. Capital Expenditures Our capital expenditures for 2023 totaled $65.1 million, which was at the lower-end of our guidance range of $65 to $75 million. For 2024, our capital expenditure guidance range is $40 to $50 million. Our growth capital spending is expected to moderate to approximately $20 to $25 million in 2024 as we complete the projects described below. Strategic Focus for Growth Capital & Key Recent/Remaining Projects Our growth capital is focused on improving the production rates at our solar solution potash assets, which on a combined basis, have had a declining production profile since 2017. Our goal is to maximize brine availability and underground residence time, which in turn drives higher-grade extraction brine and an improved production profile. HB Solution Mine in Carlsbad, New Mexico Key Takeaways for HB: The three projects highlighted below are expected to deliver the step-change to higher production at HB starting in the second half of 2024 and start us back on the path of injecting more brine into our cavern system. Through improved injection rates, we expect to increase underground residence time of our brine which should lead to higher extraction brine grades and improved potash production over the long-term. We are also initiating discussions with the regulatory agencies to expand HB's solution mining footprint to further increase the productive capacity of this mine.Eddy Shaft Brine Extraction Project: We successfully commissioned this project in October 2023. To date, we have extracted approximately 143 million gallons of high-grade brine, which represents approximately 30% of HB's 2024 brine extraction volume. The extracted brine has measured at a potassium chloride (""KCl"") concentration of 9.1%, which is the highest level seen since our peak potash production years from 2017 to 2019. This project serves as an important bridge to achieving our higher production goals until we commission the new Replacement Extraction Well and Phase Two of the HB Injection Pipeline, but is also designed to have a long-term operational life as part of the brine injection/extraction cycle for the HB cavern system.Replacement Extraction Well (""IP30B""): Construction of the drilling pad recently finished and we expect to commission the project in the second quarter of 2024. This new extraction well is designed to have a long-term operational life and will also extract brine from the Eddy Cavern that is at deeper depths than the Eddy Shaft project. Given the lower depths, this brine is expected have an equal or higher KCl concentration than what is being extracted from the Eddy Shaft project. The initial brine pool that IP30B will extract has been measured at over 330 million gallons and together with the Eddy Shaft project is expected to provide for enough brine to cover the majority of our extraction needs at HB for 2024 and through early 2025. Note that this production is in addition to the Eddy Shaft brine we extracted in 2023 post-project commissioning.Phase Two of HB Injection Pipeline Project: All permitting is expected to be complete by the end of March 2024 and we anticipate construction beginning shortly thereafter, with commissioning expected in the first half of 2024. Upon Phase 2 commissioning, we expect our brine injection rates at HB to be the highest in company history. This project is key for maximizing brine availability and residence time, and in turn, developing higher-grade concentrations of KCl for the extraction brine. The injected brine associated with Phase Two commissioning is expected to result in improved brine grades ready for extraction by mid-2025. Brine Recovery Mine in Wendover, Utah Primary Pond 7: We started construction on a new primary pond at Wendover to increase the brine evaporative area, which will result in Wendover having two primary ponds when complete. Similar to our caverns at Moab and HB, the primary ponds at Wendover serve as the brine storage area, and adding another primary pond will help meet our goals of maximizing brine availability, increasing the KCl concentration in the brine, and improving our potash production. We expect this project to be commissioned in the third quarter of 2024 and with production benefits beginning in 2025.Lithium Project: We engaged Pickering Energy Partners as an advisor to help maximize the value of the lithium resource and evaluate direct lithium extraction technologies at Wendover. The lithium already present in our byproduct magnesium brine is estimated to support approximately two thousand tons of lithium carbonate production per year assuming a commercially feasible extraction technology. With a commercially feasible project, we plan to pursue a royalty structure or joint venture to limit Intrepid’s capital investment and operating costs. Intrepid South Sand Project: After significant delays in the permitting process, we received the final air permit for our sand project in Southeastern New Mexico and we now have all required permits necessary for project construction and operation. This project is planned to have a productive capacity of one million tons of wet sand per year and we estimate that the underlying resource contains enough sand to support decades of production. With all necessary permits in hand, we are continuing to evaluate the market and our options, including the potential to add a strategic partner. Consolidated Results, Management Commentary, & Outlook Intrepid generated fourth quarter and full-year 2023 sales of approximately $56.7 million and $279.1 million, respectively, which compares to fourth quarter and full-year 2022 sales of approximately $66.7 million and $337.6 million, respectively. The lower sales in 2023 were driven by lower pricing after the record levels seen in 2022, partially offset by higher sales volumes. Our average net realized sales price for potash(1) totaled $466 per ton in 2023, while the average net realized sales price for Trio®(1) totaled $321 per ton. During the fourth quarter, Intrepid generated a GAAP net loss of $37.3 million, a non-GAAP adjusted net loss(1) of $5.2 million, and adjusted EBITDA(1) of $7.1 million, bringing our full-year 2023 figures to a GAAP net loss of $35.7 million, a non-GAAP adjusted net loss(1) of approximately $3.0 million, and adjusted EBITDA(1) of $41.6 million. Bob Jornayvaz, Intrepid's Executive Chairman and CEO commented: ""Intrepid's fourth quarter saw the continuation of strong demand for our potash and Trio® with our combined 2023 sales volumes up approximately 16% compared to 2022. Slightly lower fertilizer pricing and higher costs associated with our current potash production profile again proved to be headwinds to our margins in the fourth quarter, although we are on track to start to see the first step-change to higher potash production beginning in the second half of 2024. Moreover, fertilizer pricing has remained resilient and we expect to see steady sales through the spring application season. The key highlight during the quarter was the December announcement that we entered into the Third Amendment to the Cooperative Development Agreement with XTO. Intrepid has already received the first $50 million for its commitments under the Amendment, and the Amendment also stipulates that Intrepid will receive an additional guaranteed, one-time $50 million payment upon certain events, with XTO also being required to pay additional amounts in the event of certain additional drilling activities, up to a maximum of $100 million. This is a milestone development for Intrepid and the cash infusion significantly helps de-risk our outlook. Our current balance sheet is close to fully funding our 2024 capital program, providing a cash runway until we see the positive impacts to our unit economics associated with the higher potash production rates. Intrepid's primary strategic priority has been to revitalize our potash assets and I'm very pleased to share that we are on track to successfully achieve this goal. We still have a couple projects to bring online over the next few months but our potash production outlook is improving, highlighted by the significantly improved brine grades we're already seeing in our harvest ponds at HB from the Eddy Shaft project. We are a few quarters away from seeing the first inflection to higher production from our HB mine and we want to be clear that our investments are designed to sustainably support higher potash production over the long-term. As for our other growth opportunities, we recently received the final permit for our sand project at Intrepid South and we continue to make progress on our lithium resource at Wendover. Overall, we're optimistic on Intrepid's future and we'll be laser-focused on getting appropriate value back in the stock."" Segment HighlightsPotash Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 (in thousands, except per ton data)Sales $ 28,557 $ 43,756 $ 155,920 $ 191,378 Gross margin $ 4,333 $ 20,907 $ 35,049 $ 94,769 Potash production volume (in tons) 79 106 224 270 Potash sales volume (in tons) 45 50 258 222 Average potash net realized sales price per ton(1) $ 431 $ 693 $ 466 $ 713 Our total potash segment sales in 2023 decreased $35.5 million to $155.9 million, or 19%, compared to 2022, as potash sales decreased 22%, partially offset by an 8% increase in byproduct sales. Potash sales decreased in 2023 as the average potash net realized sales price per ton decreased 35%, partially offset by a 16% increase in potash tons sold. Potash prices peaked during the second quarter of 2022 and steadily declined in each succeeding quarter in 2023. Potash tons sold increased in 2023 as supportive farm commodity prices and lower potash prices drove solid demand. Potash segment cost of goods sold increased $20.9 million, or 27%, in 2023, compared to 2022, mainly due to a 16% increase in potash tons sold. In addition, our weighted average carrying cost per ton increased mainly due to a 15%, or $3.8 million increase in production labor and benefits expenses in 2023. Our total tons of potash produced decreased 17% in 2023, compared to 2022, which also drove an increase in our per ton production costs. As the majority of our production costs are fixed, decreases in tons produced results in higher per ton costs. During 2023, we recorded $2.7 million in lower of cost or net realizable value inventory adjustments as our weighted average carry cost per ton exceeded our expected net realizable value per potash ton. Our potash segment gross margin decreased $59.7 million in 2023, compared to 2022, which was primarily due to the $35.5 million decrease in potash segment sales, increased cost of goods sold, and the lower of cost or net realizable value inventory adjustments, as discussed above. Trio® Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 (in thousands, except per ton data)Sales $ 21,130 $ 17,265 $ 102,182 $ 117,826 Gross (deficit) margin $ (2,378) $ 3,429 $ (3,995) $ 39,123 Trio® production volume (in tons) 57 51 216 226 Trio® sales volume (in tons) 49 28 228 197 Average Trio® net realized sales price per ton(1) $ 292 $ 461 $ 321 $ 479 Our total Trio® segment sales decreased $15.6 million, or 13%, in 2023, as compared to 2022, as Trio® sales decreased 15%, or $17.6 million, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in segment byproduct sales, which was primarily driven by an increase in byproduct water sales. Our 2023 Trio® sales decreased $17.6 million, or 15%, in 2023, as compared to 2022, as our average net realized sales price per ton decreased 33%, which was partially offset by a 16% increase in Trio® tons sold. Our Trio® average net realized sales price per ton decreased as the value of potassium fertilizers declined due to improved global production rates and product availability. Our higher Trio® tons sold in 2023 benefited from the reduced sales volumes we experienced in the second half of 2022 as customers delayed purchases in anticipation of lower price levels and overall strong commodity prices throughout 2023. Our Trio® cost of goods sold increased $19.7 million in 2023, or 36%, compared to 2022, primarily driven by a 16% increase in our Trio® tons sold and an increase in our per ton production costs. In addition, we also began 2023 with a higher average cost per ton of inventory compared to 2022. Our Trio® production costs increased in 2023 due to a $1.8 million increase in labor and benefits expenses, a $1.8 million increase in operating and maintenance supplies, a $1.8 million increase in depreciation due to increased capital investments, and a $1.0 million increase in property taxes and insurance, and were partially offset by a $1.0 reduction in royalty expense due to decreased sales revenue. In 2023, our Trio® segment gross deficit totaled $4.0 million which compares to gross margin of $39.1 million in 2022. Oilfield Solutions Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 (in thousands)Sales $ 7,045 $ 5,732 $ 21,310 $ 28,668 Gross margin $ 2,666 $ 1,315 $ 5,792 $ 7,516 Our oilfield solutions segment sales decreased 26% in 2023, compared to 2022. Water sales decreased $7.9 million in 2023 to $9.6 million, and revenue from right-of-way agreements, surface damages and easements decreased by $0.7 million. Brine sales increased $1.4 million, and produced water disposal royalties increased $0.1 million during 2023, compared to 2022. Our oilfield solutions water sales decreased as we purchased $5.0 million less in third-party water for resale in 2023 and due to reduced sales of Caprock water. Our sales of brine increased as we sold increased volumes of brine at a higher per barrel price in 2023. Oilfield solutions cost of goods sold decreased 27% in 2023, compared to 2022, primarily due to a $5.0 million decrease in third-party water purchased for resale. We incurred $0.6 million in increased labor and benefits expenses and a $0.6 million increase in depreciation related to new infrastructure placed in service in 2023, compared to 2022. These increased costs were partially offset by a $0.5 million decrease in royalty expense in 2023, compared to 2022, due to reduced water sales. Segment gross margin decreased $1.7 million, or 23%, in 2023 compared to 2022, due to the factors described above. Notes 1 Adjusted net (loss) income, average net realized sales price per ton and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. See the non-GAAP reconciliations set forth later in this press release for additional information. Unless expressly stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to tons in this press release refer to short tons. One short ton equals 2,000 pounds. One metric tonne, which many international competitors use, equals 1,000 kilograms or 2,204.62 pounds.

INTREPID POTASH, INC.UNAUDITED NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONSFOR THE THREE AND TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022(In thousands, except per share amounts) To supplement Intrepid's consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, Intrepid uses several non-GAAP financial measures to monitor and evaluate its performance. These non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted net (loss) income, adjusted net (loss) income per diluted share, adjusted EBITDA, and average net realized sales price per ton. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures varies among companies, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Intrepid believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors for analysis of its business. Intrepid uses these non-GAAP financial measures as one of its tools in comparing period-over-period performance on a consistent basis and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. Intrepid believes these non-GAAP financial measures are used by professional research analysts and others in the valuation, comparison, and investment recommendations of companies in the potash mining industry. Many investors use the published research reports of these professional research analysts and others in making investment decisions. Adjusted Net (Loss) Income and Adjusted Net (Loss) Income Per Diluted ShareAdjusted net (loss) income and adjusted net (loss) income per diluted share are calculated as net (loss) income or net (loss) income per diluted share adjusted for certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period, as set forth in the reconciliation below. Intrepid considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful because they allow for period-to-period comparisons of its operating results excluding items that Intrepid believes are not indicative of its fundamental ongoing operations.

(2) - Assumes an annual effective tax rate of 26% for 2023 and 2022. Average Potash and Trio® Net Realized Sales Price per Ton Average net realized sales price per ton for potash is calculated as potash segment sales less potash segment byproduct sales and potash freight costs and then dividing that difference by the number of tons of potash sold in the period. Likewise, average net realized sales price per ton for Trio® is calculated as Trio® segment sales less Trio® segment byproduct sales and Trio® freight costs and then dividing that difference by Trio® tons sold. Intrepid considers average net realized sales price per ton to be useful, and believe it to be useful for investors, because it shows Intrepid's potash and Trio® average per-ton pricing without the effect of certain transportation and delivery costs. When Intrepid arranges transportation and delivery for a customer, it includes in revenue and in freight costs the costs associated with transportation and delivery. However, some of Intrepid's customers arrange for and pay their own transportation and delivery costs, in which case these costs are not included in Intrepid's revenue and freight costs. Intrepid uses average net realized sales price per ton as a key performance indicator to analyze potash and Trio® sales and price trends.

Intrepid considers adjusted EBITDA to be useful because the measure reflects Intrepid's operating performance before the effects of certain non-cash items and other items that Intrepid believes are not indicative of its core operations.

(TSX: BOS) (OTCQX:ABSSF) (the “Company” or “AirBoss”) today announced its fourth quarter and annual results. The Company will host a conference call and webcast to discuss the results on March 7th at 9:00 a.m. ET, the details of which are further below. All dollar amounts are shown in thousands of United States dollars (""US $"" or ""$""), except per share amounts, unless otherwise noted. Recent Highlights Generated $40.9 million cash from operations during 2023, compared to consuming $30.8 million in 2022;2023 Adjusted EBITDA1 of $26.8 million on Adjusted Profit1 of $(6.4) million and a loss of $41.7 million;Finished 2023 with a Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio1 of 3.30x; andDeclared a quarterly dividend of C$0.07 per common share. “Despite a significant improvement in cash generation for AirBoss, 2023 was a challenging year as we continued to navigate the impact of economic headwinds, fueled by labour stoppages in the auto sector and continued delays in government sourcing. Looking forward however, and in order to better position the Company for sustainable growth, we recently completed an in-depth review of the entire enterprise, yielding a blueprint for a strategic transition related to the future roadmap of AirBoss,” said Chris Bitsakakis, President and Co-CEO of AirBoss. “This transition will consolidate all rubber compounding operations into one segment, AirBoss Rubber Solutions, emphasizing ARS’ ability to act as a core driver for margin expansion, sustainable growth and productivity. The new AirBoss Manufactured Products segment will consolidate all operations which manufacture or distribute finished products to a variety of target markets including automotive, non-automotive and defense. We will also undertake an in-depth strategic review of all individual product lines AMP currently manufactures and sells, in order to assess their overall alignment with the new strategic direction of AirBoss.” “Our businesses and the markets in which we operate continue to experience significant change, and we believe our shift in strategic focus will help prioritize investments, drive long-term shareholder value, growth and be accretive to the Company,” added Gren Schoch, Chairman and Co-CEO. “We have focused on fortifying our balance sheet from cash generated in 2023, and continue to explore implementing further cost reduction initiatives within our business units in 2024. As an organization, we remain committed to our long-term priorities, including growing the core Rubber Solutions segment, refocusing the range of products which Manufactured Products sells, while ensuring alignment with our new strategic direction, and investing in core areas of the business to support long-term sustainable growth.” Three Months ended December 31Twelve Months ended December 31(In thousands of US dollars, except share data)20232022 20232022Financial results: Net Sales92,696117,453426,025477,155Profit (loss)(35,958)11,997(41,749)(31,892)Adjusted Profit (2)(2,790)12,324(6,424)12,558Earnings (loss) per share (US$) -Basic(0.34)0.44(1.54)(1.18)-Diluted(0.34)0.43(1.54)(1.18)Adjusted earnings per share(2) (US$) -Basic(0.10)0.45(0.24)0.46-Diluted(0.10)0.45(0.24)0.45EBITDA(2)(31,002)13,470(11,177)(12,769)Adjusted EBITDA(2)4,02313,89826,75845,336Net cash from operating activities9,2917,88040,917(30,775)Free cash flow (2)6,0994,66132,453(40,964)Dividends declared per share (CAD$)0.070.100.370.40Capital additions(2)4,1343,2299,86310,212 Financial position:December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022Total assets356,656 440,766Debt(1)131,092 143,642Net Debt(2)88,213 110,083Shareholders’ equity148,857 196,997Outstanding shares*27,130,556 27,092,041*27,130,556 at March 6, 2024 Financial Results Consolidated net sales in the three-month period ending December 31, 2023 (“Q4 2023”) decreased by 21.1% to $92,696 compared with the three-month period ended December 31, 2022 (“Q4 2022”), with decreases at both Rubber Solutions and Manufactured Products. Consolidated net sales for the year decreased by 10.7% to $426,025 compared with 2022 primarily due to decreased sales at Rubber Solutions across the majority of sectors and Manufactured Products’ delivery of nitrile gloves to Department for Health and Human Services (“HHS”) in the prior year, partially offset by improved performance in other product lines in that segment. Consolidated gross profit for Q4 2023 decreased to $5,122 from $24,767 compared with Q4 2022, due to decreases in the Manufactured Products’ defense product lines and rubber molded product lines. For the year, consolidated gross profit was up by $34,279 to $58,410 and gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 13.7% from 5.1%, compared to 2022. The increase was driven by a $57.0 million non-cash write-down related to nitrile glove inventory in 2022 and improvements at the Rubber Solutions segments in addition to cost improvements that took place in the latter part of 2023 in each segment, partially offset by an $8 million non-cash write-down related to nitrile glove inventory in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 2023 decreased by 71.1%, compared to the same period in 2022 and decreased by 41.0% for 2023 compared to 2022. Financial Position The Company retains a $250 million credit facility and a net debt to TTM Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.30x (from 2.43x at December 31, 2022). Dividend The Board of Directors of the Company has approved a quarterly dividend of C$0.07 per common share, to be paid on April 15, 2024 to shareholders of record at March 29, 2024. Segment Results In the Rubber Solutions segment, net sales in the quarter decreased by 21.1% to $54,464 and by 12.3% to $248,395 in 2023, from the comparable periods in 2022. The decrease in net sales for Q4 2023 was primarily due to softness across most sectors and for 2023 was across most sectors driven by economic headwinds. For the quarter and 2023, volume was down 17.5% with decreases across the majority of sectors given softness in many customer sectors. Tolling volume was down 63.0% in the quarter and 59.6% in 2023, from the comparable periods in 2022. Non-tolling volume was down 9.9% for the quarter and by 7.4% in 2023, compared to the same periods in 2022. Gross profit in the Rubber Solutions segment increased by 1.9% to $7,845 for the quarter and decreased by 4.63% to $34,947 in 2023, from the comparable periods in 2022. For the quarter, the increase in gross profit was principally due to product mix and managing overhear costs, offset by a reduction in volume. For the year, the decrease was primarily as a result of decreased tolling and non-tolling volumes compared to 2022 and partially offset by managing controllable overhead costs. At Manufactured Products, net sales in the quarter decreased by 19.9% to $44,029 and by 7.4% to $202,290 in 2023 from the comparable periods in 2022. For the quarter, the decrease was the result of lower volumes in the defense product lines and across the rubber molding product lines, in particular the muffler hangers, bushings and spring isolator product lines. For the year, the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the defense products lines from the delivery of nitrile gloves to HHS in the part of the previous year partly offset by an increase in the rubber molded products lines due to increased volume. Gross profit in the Manufactured Products segment decreased by $19,791 to a loss of $2,723 for the quarter and increased by $35,977 to $23,463 in 2023, from the comparable periods in 2022. For the quarter, the decrease was primarily a result of an $8.0 million non-cash write-down related to nitrile glove inventory and retroactive pricing from improved arrangements with key suppliers and customers recognized in the comparable period in 2022 and lower volumes in the defense product lines and across the rubber molded product lines, partially offset by operational cost improvements in the segment. For the year, the increase was primarily a result of a $57.0 million non-cash write-down related to nitrile glove inventory in 2022, in addition to increased volume, and improved arrangements in 2023 within the rubber molded products lines with key suppliers and customers. In addition, there was a continued focus on controllable operational cost containment and managing overhead costs, partially offset by an $8.0 million non-cash write-down related to nitrile glove inventory in 2023. Overview 2023 was a challenging year for AirBoss as economic headwinds impacted each segment to varying degrees, and the Company continued to navigate significant and extensive obstacles related to labor, supply chain and logistics challenges. The Company focused on managing costs and risk mitigation plans in response to these challenges, which were particularly pronounced in the fourth quarter of 2023 (“Q4 2023”), and undertook a strategic review of each of its business units. This review has resulted in its new strategic transition, including a shift in reportable segments commencing with results for Q4 2023 and year ended December 31, 2023. AirBoss now reports results under two segments: (1) AirBoss Rubber Solutions (“ARS”), and (2) AirBoss Manufactured Products (“AMP”). The ARS segment consists of the former rubber solutions segment and the rubber compounding operations at Acton Vale, Quebec (previously included in the AirBoss Defense Group segment). The new AMP segment consists of AirBoss Engineered Products, formerly a standalone segment, and AirBoss Defense Group, formerly a standalone segment (other than the rubber compounding operations at Acton Vale, Quebec). Both ARS and AMP experienced residual softness in Q4 2023. The rubber molded products operations at AMP were impacted by the tail end of the union strike related to the OEMs which was settled in the quarter. The ability to recover in volumes in 2024 for each segment will remain subject to the ongoing challenges related to continued inflation pressure and the ongoing global geopolitical challenges, and successful conversion of key opportunities. Although ARS experienced some retraction in most business lines compared to 2022, which was a record year from both a sales and EBITDA perspective, 2023 remained a solid year with respect to sales and EBITDA. Despite strong performance during the earlier part of 2023, there was pronounced softness experienced at the end of Q4 2023 as sales were impacted by customers focused on reducing inventory levels. Despite these headwinds, the segment remains focused on executing on its strategy to deliver strong results with specialized products, expanded production of a broader array of compounds (white and color) and enhanced flexibility in attracting and fulfilling new business through identified synergies and margin expansion. As a segment, Rubber Solutions continued to invest in research and development to support enhanced collaboration with customers. AMP experienced strong traction in the rubber molded product lines despite challenges towards the latter part of the year due to labor disruptions with the OEMs, while the defense product lines experienced softness across the product portfolio throughout the entire year. Management continued its focus on operational improvements including managing costs and a commitment to drive efficiencies and best-in-class automation, as well as diversification of its product lines into adjacent sectors. In addition, the defense business continued to work with its key customers to leverage opportunities aligned with its growth initiatives, subject to timing as delays in the conversion of these opportunities continued through the fourth quarter of 2023. Further, although the West African Husky order has been completed, execution on the balance of the previously announced awards for Husky 2G vehicles has been delayed further due to ongoing delays in funding, creating a lack of certainty to the scope, timing and the terms and conditions of these awards which cannot reasonably be determined. The Company’s long-term priorities consist of the following: Growing the core Rubber Solutions segment by emphasizing rubber compounding as the core driver for sustainable growth and productivity, focusing on innovation in custom rubber compounding while aiming to expand market share through organic and inorganic means, while striving to achieve enhanced diversification by a broadening of product breadth through technological advancements and investments in specialty compound niches;Manufactured Products growth strategy will be focused on diversifying and expanding its range of rubber molded products while simultaneously narrowing the range of defense products through a renewed focus on core competencies; andUndertaking a strategic review of all product lines currently manufactured and sold by the Company in its Manufactured Products segment while targeting additional acquisition opportunities with a focus on adding new compounds and products, technical capabilities, and geographic reach into selected North American and international markets. AirBoss continues to focus on these long-term priorities while investing in core areas of the business to expand a solid foundation that will support long-term growth.

Announces Closing of Public Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary BioVie Inc. (BIVI) successfully closed a public offering, raising approximately $21 million. The offering included 15,000,000 shares of common stock, 6,000,000 pre-funded warrants, and 10,500,000 common warrants. The company plans to utilize the proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The closure of BioVie Inc.'s public offering, generating approximately $21 million before fees and expenses, is a significant liquidity event for the company. This capital raise is indicative of the company's proactive approach to funding its operations and research pipeline. The offering's structure, which includes both shares and warrants, provides investors with the potential for future equity participation at a set price, which could be beneficial if the stock appreciates. The immediate exercisability of the warrants at $1.50 suggests confidence in the company's future value, albeit it also implies potential dilution for current shareholders.From a financial perspective, the use of proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes is fairly standard. However, the specifics of how this capital will be allocated across BioVie's projects could significantly affect the company's burn rate and runway. Investors should monitor how this influx of capital translates into progress in the company's clinical trials and product development, which could impact the company's valuation and stock performance in both the short and long term. Medical Research Analyst BioVie's focus on liver disease, neurological and neuro-degenerative disorders places it within highly specialized and competitive segments of the pharmaceutical industry. The company's ability to close a substantial offering suggests investor confidence in its therapeutic prospects. The funding could accelerate the development of BioVie's drug therapies, potentially leading to advancements in treatment options for chronic debilitating conditions.Given the clinical-stage nature of the company, the capital raised is likely to support ongoing clinical trials, which are critical for securing regulatory approvals and commercialization. The success of these trials will be pivotal for the company's future, as positive outcomes can lead to significant stock appreciation, whereas any setbacks could have the opposite effect. Stakeholders should look for updates on trial progress and interim data, which can serve as indicators of the company's scientific and commercial potential. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the closing of BioVie's offering at $1.00 per share and associated warrant could be seen as an opportunity for investors to gain exposure to the biotech sector at a relatively low entry point. The biotech industry is known for its volatility and high-risk, high-reward nature. The pricing of the warrants at a 50% premium to the offering price reflects an expectation of growth, which could attract speculative investors.It is also important to consider the broader industry context. Biotech firms often rely on capital markets to fund research due to the long development timelines and significant costs associated with bringing new drugs to market. Therefore, BioVie's successful capital raise not only supports its individual objectives but also contributes to the overall narrative of investment viability within the biotech sector. Market trends, investor sentiment and the performance of peer companies should be considered when evaluating the potential impact of this offering on BioVie's stock performance. 03/06/2024 - 05:00 PM CARSON CITY, Nev., March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BioVie Inc.

About BioVie Inc.BioVie Inc. (NASDAQ: BIVI) is a clinical-stage company developing innovative drug therapies for the treatment of neurological and neurodegenerative disorders and advanced liver disease. In neurodegenerative disease, the Company’s drug candidate NE3107 inhibits inflammatory activation of ERK and NFkB (e.g., TNF signaling) that leads to neuroinflammation and insulin resistance, but not their homeostatic functions (e.g., insulin signaling and neuron growth and survival). Both are drivers of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. The Company conducted and reported efficacy data on its randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study to evaluate NE3107 in patients who have mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (NCT04669028). Results of a Phase 2 investigator-initiated trial (NCT05227820) showing NE3107-treated patients experienced improved cognition and biomarker levels were presented at the Clinical Trial in Alzheimer’s Disease annual conference in December 2022. An estimated six million Americans suffer from Alzheimer’s. A Phase 2 study of NE3107 in Parkinson’s disease (NCT05083260) has completed, and data presented at the International Conference on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease and Related Neurological Disorders conference in Gothenburg, Sweden in March 2023 showed significant improvements in “morning on” symptoms and clinically meaningful improvement in motor control in patients treated with a combination of NE3107 and levodopa vs. patients treated with levodopa alone, and no drug-related adverse events. In liver disease, the Company’s Orphan drug candidate BIV201 (continuous infusion terlipressin), with U.S Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) Fast Track status, is being evaluated and discussed with guidance received from the FDA regarding the design of Phase 3 clinical testing of BIV201 for the treatment of ascites due to chronic liver cirrhosis. The active agent is approved in the U.S. and in about 40 countries for related complications of advanced liver cirrhosis. For more information, visit http://www.bioviepharma.com/.

The audit was conducted by Fruci & Associates (“Fruci”), an Independent PCAOB registered Public Accounting Firm known for its expertise in accounting and auditing. Additionally, the Company is in the application process for name and ticker change with FINRA (the ""Financial Industry Regulatory Authority"" corporation). ""I am immensely proud of our team and the associates at Fruci who have continuously worked together over the past months in getting the audit completed. Throughout this process, the PickleJar executive team has continued to work diligently behind the scenes to drive our business forward, advance our technology footing in our core lines of business and develop new opportunities and partners,” said Jeff James, PickleJar’s chief executive officer. The completion of the audit is a significant milestone for PickleJar as it emphasizes the company's commitment to corporate governance, the highest accounting standards, and transparency to its shareholders. The primary purpose of the audit was to pave the way for PickleJar to strategize its process and timing for expanding both capital partners and attracting a larger shareholder base. The Management team continues to perform due diligence on planned acquisitions, execute on the core lines of business, and work with institutional investors and advisors to finance growth plans for 2024. The Company’s 2024 audit is already underway with the goal of achieving fully reporting status; PickleJar has adopted NREG’s fiscal year of January 31. Additionally, the corporate action of the name change represents the new chapter for the company as it allows the new name, PickleJar Entertainment Group, and ticker to shed any connection to the prior business entity, which had nothing to do with the Company’s current and future focus. The PickleJar Management believes the move is a watershed event and will eliminate confusion among existing and future stakeholders. “We will continue our transparency with our Shareholders and look forward to the next steps of our name change with FINRA to better reflect the true value of our Company to the market,” James continued. “I would like to thank our shareholders for their patience through this process and continued support which means so much to the entire PickleJar team.” For more information about the Company visit:Our OTC Markets Profile: https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/NREG/overview Our website is: https://picklejar.com or https://investors.picklejar.com Our Twitter account is: https://twitter.com/picklejarlive ABOUT PICKLEJAR ENTERTAINMENT GROUPPickleJar unlocks the potential of shared entertainment experiences through an integrated suite of software and services designed to inspire human creativity and enrich lives.

Revenues less transaction-based expenses up 2%.OTC Link revenues down 10%. Transaction-based revenues from OTC Link ECN and OTC Link NQB down 16%, reflecting the impact of lower trading volumes on these platforms, which more than offset the effect of increases in certain fees. Reduced trading activity on OTC Link ATS resulted in messages revenue declining 11% and QAP One Statement fees declining 19%, which further contributed to the overall decline in OTC Link revenues.Market Data Licensing revenues up 10%, due to a full quarter contribution of the November 2022 acquisition of EDGAR Online as well as subscriber growth and price increases for certain licenses. Pro-user revenues were up 7%, in line with a 6% increase in the number of professional users quarter over quarter. Revenues from non-pro users were down 22%, driven by a 20% decrease in the number of non-pro users of our market data. Revenues from market data connectivity fees increased 68% and revenues from internal system licenses, delayed data licenses, and certain other data services increased 5%, in each case due to growth in subscribers and price increases for certain licenses.Corporate Services revenues down 1% quarter over quarter, with a 4% increase in revenues from our OTCQX market, offset by a 5% decrease each in revenues from the OTCQB market and the Disclosure & News Service® (“DNS”) product. A lower average number of companies on our OTCQB market as well as of companies subscribing to DNS during the quarter impacted the revenues for these products, offsetting the annual, incremental price increases effective at the beginning of 2023. Partially offsetting the decline in Corporate Services revenues was higher revenue from our Virtual Investor Conferences® (“VIC”) product due to a greater number of events held during the quarter, and higher revenue from the OTCIQ Basic product.Operating expenses increased 11% over the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily driven by a 69% increase in professional and consulting costs, largely as a result of an accrual related to an SEC matter. Further contributing to the growth in operating expenses was a 6% increase in compensation and benefits costs, reflecting a higher average headcount during the quarter. Operating income and net income decreased 11% to $8.8 million and 19% to $7.0 million, respectively.Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense, decreased 7% to $10.8 million, or $0.89 per adjusted diluted share.

Revenues less transaction-based expenses up 5%.OTC Link revenues down 6%, primarily as a result of a reduction in revenues from OTC Link ATS messages of 18% and from OTC Link ECN and OTC Link NQB, which in aggregate declined 5%. Contributing to the overall decline in OTC Link revenues were also QAP One Statement fees, down 31%. The decline in OTC Link revenues is consistent with a year over year decline in trading activity on our markets.Market Data Licensing revenues up 19%, inclusive of the full year impact of the acquisitions of Blue Sky Data Corp and EDGAR Online. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions, Market Data Licensing revenues grew approximately 7%, due to 5% growth in revenues from professional user licenses, 67% growth in revenues from market data connectivity fees, and 9% growth in internal system licenses, delayed data licenses and certain other data services, offsetting a 27% decline in revenues from non-professional users.Corporate Services revenues down 2%. OTCQX revenues up 3% due to price increases and a relatively unchanged average number of companies on the OTCQX market. OTCQB and DNS revenues down 3% and 7%, respectively, due to a lower number of companies subscribing to OTCQB and DNS, more than offsetting the impact of pricing adjustments. Lower revenues from VIC, due to fewer events held during 2023, also contributed to the overall decline in Corporate Services revenues, but were partially offset by growth in revenues from OTCIQ Basic.Operating expenses were up $9.2 million, or 15%, reflecting a 13% increase in compensation and benefits as a result of higher average headcount, a 27% increase in IT infrastructure and information services costs, primarily as a result of our acquisitions, and a 25% increase in professional and consulting fees, primarily as a result of regulatory and legal costs related to an SEC matter. Operating expenses include approximately $1.1 million in one-time, non-recurring costs related to EDGAR Online, and approximately $1.4 million in costs related to the SEC matter.Operating income decreased 11% to $32.6 million and net income decreased 10% to $27.7 million.Adjusted EBITDA declined 5% to $40.9 million, or $3.37 per adjusted diluted share.

The quarterly cash dividend is payable on March 29, 2024, to stockholders of record on March 22, 2024. The ex-dividend date is March 21, 2024.

Studies evaluate efficacy and safety for HIV/HBV and HIV/TB coinfections. Positive results show potential benefits of Biktarvy in treating both conditions. Positive New data from Gilead Sciences evaluates Biktarvy for people with HIV and comorbid conditions. Studies focus on the efficacy and safety of Biktarvy for HIV/hepatitis B and HIV/tuberculosis coinfections. Results presented at the 31st Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) highlight the potential of Biktarvy in treating a broad range of individuals affected by HIV. The ALLIANCE Phase 3 study compares Biktarvy to dolutegravir in adults with HIV/hepatitis B coinfection, showing promising efficacy and safety results. The INSIGHT Phase 2b study investigates Biktarvy and dolutegravir for HIV/tuberculosis coinfection, demonstrating high viral suppression rates and similar safety profiles. An exploratory analysis reveals factors associated with HBV treatment response with Biktarvy compared to dolutegravir, supporting continued evaluation in this population. Genetic analysis shows persistence of resistance mutations in individuals switching to Biktarvy treatment after viral suppression on previous regimens. Additional research studies explore Biktarvy's safety and efficacy in older populations, immune activation biomarkers, and weight change in virologically suppressed individuals with HIV. The U.S. FDA approved an expanded indication for Biktarvy to treat virologically suppressed people with HIV with M184V/I resistance. Important safety information for Biktarvy includes warnings on post-treatment acute exacerbation of hepatitis B, drug interactions, renal impairment, and lactic acidosis. Biktarvy is a complete HIV treatment combining three powerful medicines in a single-tablet regimen, offering simple once-daily dosing with a high barrier to resistance. The drug is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and pediatric patients with no ARV treatment history or to replace current regimens in virologically suppressed individuals. Dosage, administration, drug interactions, and important safety information are provided for Biktarvy, emphasizing monitoring and precautions for specific patient populations. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst In the context of HIV treatment, the new data on Biktarvy's efficacy and safety for HIV and hepatitis B or tuberculosis co-infections is paramount. From a medical research perspective, the ALLIANCE trial's focus on treatment-naïve adults with HIV/HBV coinfection offers a novel comparison between TAF- and TDF-based regimens. The numerical superiority of Biktarvy in HBV viral suppression and seroconversion, although not statistically quantified in the provided data, could indicate a potential shift in clinical practice favoring TAF-based therapies for this patient subgroup.Furthermore, the INSIGHT study's preliminary results at Week 24 suggest high efficacy of Biktarvy in HIV/TB co-infected patients, which is critical given the high mortality associated with HIV-associated TB, especially in regions like the WHO African Region. The study's design, accounting for drug-drug interactions with rifampicin, is particularly relevant as it addresses a significant challenge in the treatment of co-infections. The continuation of the trial until Week 48 will be crucial in establishing long-term safety and efficacy. Infectious Disease Specialist As an infectious disease specialist, the implications of the exploratory analysis of the HBV treatment response with Biktarvy are noteworthy. The identification of subgroups that may benefit more from TAF-based therapy can lead to more personalized treatment approaches, which is a step forward in managing complex cases of HIV/HBV coinfection. It is essential to highlight that while the use of Biktarvy in individuals with HIV/HBV is still investigational, these findings could influence future guidelines and treatment protocols.The resistance-associated mutations study underscores the criticality of understanding an individual's treatment history and the persistence of resistance mutations. The approval by the U.S. FDA for Biktarvy to treat virologically suppressed individuals with M184V/I resistance mutations is a testament to the drug's potential in managing treatment-resistant HIV. This expanded indication could have a significant impact on treatment strategies for individuals with such resistance profiles. Pharmacologist From a pharmacological standpoint, the reported adverse events in the ALLIANCE trial, such as upper respiratory tract infection and pyrexia, are generally expected within the patient population. However, the reported rates of COVID-19 in the trial participants are noteworthy and may require further investigation to understand the interaction between HIV treatments and susceptibility to other infections. Additionally, the pharmacokinetic considerations in the INSIGHT study, such as the twice-daily dosing of Biktarvy during rifampicin-containing TB treatment, reflect the complexity of managing drug-drug interactions in co-infected patients.The FDA's contraindication for Biktarvy coadministration with rifampin highlights the delicate balance required when managing HIV/TB coinfection. The ongoing evaluation of Biktarvy's pharmacokinetics and safety profile in the context of TB treatment will be essential for future clinical recommendations and potential label changes. 03/06/2024 - 04:30 PM – New Data Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety Profile of Biktarvy for the Treatment of People with HIV and Hepatitis B or Tuberculosis will be Presented – – Retrospective Analysis Evaluating HIV Resistance-Associated Mutations Reinforces Importance of Treatment Selection in HIV Management – FOSTER CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) today announced new data from three studies evaluating the efficacy and safety profile of Biktarvy® (bictegravir 50 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg tablets, B/F/TAF) for a broad range of people with HIV, including those with HIV/hepatitis B (HBV) coinfection and HIV/tuberculosis (TB) coinfection. These data and other studies supporting the important role of Biktarvy in the HIV treatment landscape were presented at the 31st Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI). “People with HIV and comorbid conditions or pre-existing treatment resistance can often face complex and evolving treatment needs. These studies were conducted to help bridge the unmet HIV treatment gap and better understand the potential of Biktarvy in a broad range of people and communities affected by HIV and their diverse health needs, said Jared Baeten, MD, PhD, Vice President, HIV Clinical Development, Gilead Sciences. “The data presented at CROI contribute to the growing body of long-term evidence for Biktarvy and reinforce Gilead’s commitment to a person-centric approach to HIV treatment research.” HIV/HBV Coinfection ALLIANCE (NCT03547908) is an ongoing Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Biktarvy compared to dolutegravir 50 mg (DTG) + emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg, F/TDF, DTG+F/TDF, in adults with HIV/HBV coinfection initiating treatment. The ALLIANCE trial is the first randomized clinical trial of TAF- vs TDF-based regimens in treatment naïve adults with HIV /HBV coinfection. Its goal is to evaluate treatment regimens that may effectively suppress both HIV and HBV. Previously reported Week 96 results demonstrated the efficacy of both antiretroviral regimens. Additionally, ALLIANCE participants treated with Biktarvy exhibited numerically higher levels of HBV viral suppression and seroconversion. Further results from the trial showed that safety findings were similar between the Biktarvy and DTG+F/TDF groups. Adverse events (AEs) included upper respiratory tract infection (19.8% vs. 14.8%), COVID-19 (38% vs. 36.1%), pyrexia (12.4% vs. 13.1%), ALT increase (8.3% vs. 12.3%), and nasopharyngitis (12.4% vs. 6.6%). A new exploratory analysis presented at CROI further investigated the factors associated with the HBV treatment response observed with Biktarvy compared to DTG+F/TDF. This subgroup analysis compared the HBV treatment responses according to baseline demographics, HBV genotype, and markers of HIV-1/HBV disease severity for all participants (n=243) at two years. Consistent with the overall population, the present analysis suggests that in people with HIV/HBV coinfection, the treatment response of TAF- versus TDF-based therapy for many HBV treatment outcomes may be greater for certain subgroups, supporting the continued evaluation of Biktarvy in this population. Some of the subgroups that showed treatment differences favoring Biktarvy included younger age, those with certain levels or types of HBV DNA/genotypes and those with higher-than-normal liver enzymes, among others. The use of Biktarvy in individuals with HIV/HBV is investigational, and the safety and efficacy of this use have not been established. HIV/TB Coinfection TB is the leading cause of death among people with HIV. In 2022, approximately 167,000 people died from HIV-associated TB, with the WHO African Region having the highest prevalence. While significant progress has been made in early detection and treatment of HIV-associated TB, there are still significant therapeutic challenges. The interactions between antiretrovirals and TB medications complicate the management of individuals with dual infections. These interactions primarily occur during the metabolism of the drugs. The drug-drug interactions involving the first-line TB drug, rifampicin, are particularly clinically relevant for a number of antiretroviral agents. Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) are recommended by major standard guidelines for HIV treatment. Several clinical research gaps exist when combining the INSTIs and drugs used for the treatment of tuberculosis, which need to be addressed to inform HIV and tuberculosis co-treatment. INSIGHT (NCT04734652) is an ongoing Phase 2b open-label study conducted in collaboration with a range of organizations, including the Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA), investigating the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of Biktarvy and dolutegravir 50 mg (DTG) + lamivudine 300mg/ tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300mg, TLD, in adults initiating treatment for HIV/TB coinfection who have been receiving a rifampicin-based treatment regimen for at least eight weeks. Participants were randomly allocated to receive Biktarvy or TLD in a 2:1 ratio. Biktarvy was taken twice a day during rifampicin-containing TB treatment and 2 weeks after stopping TB treatment. Thereafter, Biktarvy was taken once daily. Once-daily TLD plus dolutegravir 50mg evening dose was taken during TB treatment and for two weeks after completion of TB treatment. Thereafter, TLD was taken once daily – as per standard of care, until 48 weeks. The primary outcome measure is viral suppression rates at Week 24, defined as HIV-1 RNA ˂50 copies/mL. Preliminary week 24 results presented at CROI showed that 97% percent (71/73) of participants treated with Biktarvy achieved viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies /ml) as did 97% (36/37) of participants treated with the DTG-based regimen. Serious adverse events (AEs) were common in this population with advanced HIV disease and TB. However, none of the reported AEs were deemed related to the study drug. A similar number of Grade 3 and Grade 4 AEs were reported in both arms. “South Africa has the largest HIV epidemic in the world, with more than 7 million people with HIV, over half of whom have latent TB co-infection,” said Anushka Naidoo, BPharm, MMedSc, PhD, Research Scientist, Centre for AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA), and Principal Investigator of the INSIGHT study. “The availability of antiretroviral therapy options, including within drug classes, is important, particularly in high HIV/TB burden settings. The key findings from this landmark study presented at CROI support the continued evaluation of Biktarvy in people with HIV and TB as a potential treatment to bridge a critical gap for the individuals and communities who bear the disproportionate burden of co-infection."" The INSIGHT trial will continue through Week 48 to determine longer-term safety and efficacy. Biktarvy is contraindicated for coadministration with rifampin, also known as rifampicin, by the U.S. FDA. The use of Biktarvy in individuals with HIV/TB coinfection is investigational, and the safety and efficacy of this use have not been established. Resistance-Associated Mutations in Switch Trials Genetic changes occur in HIV by chance. Some of these changes stop HIV medicines from working; these changes are called resistance mutations. To understand the length of time that resistance mutations stay in the body, researchers looked at the genetic patterns of HIV (called HIV genotype) over time in people who took part in three clinical studies. Genotype data were collected at the beginning of the clinical trials, and for some participants, earlier genotyping reports were also available. Researchers looked at these reports to find out whether resistance mutations persisted, newly appeared, or disappeared in a cohort of participants (n=242) from three trials who switched to Biktarvy treatment after achieving viral suppression for at least three months on their previous antiretroviral regimen. The majority of resistance-associated mutations in the analysis were detected 100% of the time or were newly detected and did not disappear over time. Drug resistance mutations archived in cells may persist despite viral suppression, posing a risk for transmission of drug-resistant virus in cases of virological failure, treatment interruption or non-adherence. Healthcare providers must consider all previous drug treatments and genotype reports and should not assume that resistance mutations are no longer present simply because they are not reported in the most recent genotype report, as they may reemerge at a later time. These findings highlight the importance of understanding an individual's treatment history and prior resistance mutation status for treatment management. In February 2024, the U.S. FDA approved a new, expanded indication for Biktarvy to treat virologically suppressed people with HIV with M184V/I resistance, a common form of treatment resistance. Additional research studies evaluating Biktarvy presented at CROI 2024 explore safety and efficacy data in older populations, as well as treatment effects on immune activation biomarkers and weight change in people with HIV who are virologically suppressed. Please see below for U.S. Indications and Important Safety Information for Biktarvy, including BOXED WARNING. There is currently no cure for HIV or AIDS. About Biktarvy Biktarvy is a complete HIV treatment that combines three powerful medicines to form the smallest 3-drug, integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-based single-tablet regimen (STR) available, offering simple once-daily dosing with or without food, with a limited drug interaction potential and a high barrier to resistance. Biktarvy combines the novel, unboosted INSTI bictegravir, with the Descovy® (emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg tablets, F/TAF) backbone. Biktarvy is a complete STR and should not be taken with other HIV medicines. U.S. Indication for Biktarvy Biktarvy is indicated as a complete regimen for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults and pediatric patients weighing at least 14 kg who have no antiretroviral (ARV) treatment history or to replace the current ARV regimen in those who are virologically-suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies per mL) on a stable ARV regimen with no known or suspected substitutions associated with resistance to bictegravir or tenofovir. U.S. Important Safety Information for Biktarvy BOXED WARNING: POST TREATMENT ACUTE EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and have discontinued products containing emtricitabine (FTC) and/or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and may occur with discontinuation of BIKTARVY. Closely monitor hepatic function with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and discontinue BIKTARVY. If appropriate, anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. Contraindications Coadministration: Do not use BIKTARVY with dofetilide or rifampin. Warnings and precautions Drug interactions: See Contraindications and Drug Interactions sections. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during BIKTARVY therapy and monitor for adverse reactions. Immune reconstitution syndrome, including the occurrence of autoimmune disorders with variable time to onset, has been reported. New onset or worsening renal impairment: Postmarketing cases of renal impairment, including acute renal failure, proximal renal tubulopathy (PRT), and Fanconi syndrome have been reported with tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)–containing products. Do not initiate BIKTARVY in patients with estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) <30 mL/min except in virologically suppressed adults <15 mL/min who are receiving chronic hemodialysis. Patients with impaired renal function and/or taking nephrotoxic agents (including NSAIDs) are at increased risk of renal-related adverse reactions. Discontinue BIKTARVY in patients who develop clinically significant decreases in renal function or evidence of Fanconi syndrome. Renal monitoring: Prior to or when initiating BIKTARVY and during therapy, assess serum creatinine, CrCl, urine glucose, and urine protein in all patients as clinically appropriate. In patients with chronic kidney disease, assess serum phosphorus. Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Fatal cases have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including FTC and TDF. Discontinue BIKTARVY if clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity develop, including hepatomegaly and steatosis in the absence of marked transaminase elevations. Adverse reactions Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥5%; all grades) in clinical studies through week 144 were diarrhea (6%), nausea (6%), and headache (5%). Drug interactions Prescribing information: Consult the full prescribing information for BIKTARVY for more information on Contraindications, Warnings, and potentially significant drug interactions, including clinical comments. Enzymes/transporters: Drugs that induce P-gp or induce both CYP3A and UGT1A1 can substantially decrease the concentration of components of BIKTARVY. Drugs that inhibit P-gp, BCRP, or inhibit both CYP3A and UGT1A1 may significantly increase the concentrations of components of BIKTARVY. BIKTARVY can increase the concentration of drugs that are substrates of OCT2 or MATE1. Drugs affecting renal function: Coadministration of BIKTARVY with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of FTC and tenofovir and the risk of adverse reactions. Dosage and administration Dosage: Adult and pediatric patients weighing ≥25 kg: 1 tablet containing 50 mg bictegravir (BIC), 200 mg emtricitabine (FTC), and 25 mg tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) taken once daily with or without food.

The action taken by American Express might attract income-focused investors, especially in a market environment where yield is highly sought after.Additionally, the timing of the announcement, following their fourth-quarter earnings release, suggests a strategic move to maintain investor interest and possibly impact the stock's trading volume around the ex-dividend date.

(NYSE: TDCX) reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023, with total revenue at US$499.3 million, down 0.9% year-on-year. Profit for the year was US$91.1 million, up 14.5% year-on-year. Despite market uncertainties, TDCX remains focused on long-term growth and improving operations. Positive TDCX reported a total revenue of US$499.3 million for the full year 2023, showing a slight decrease of 0.9% year-on-year. Profit for the year stood at US$91.1 million, reflecting a 14.5% increase compared to the previous year. The company faced challenges due to market uncertainties and a tough macroeconomic environment, impacting business sentiment. TDCX focused on cost optimization efforts, resulting in higher profits driven by lower tax, increased interest income, and a net reversal of share-based payment expenses. In the fourth quarter of 2023, TDCX reported a total revenue of US$120.4 million, down 10.1% year-on-year. Despite the challenges, the company managed to increase its profit for the period to US$24.2 million, showing a 27.8% rise compared to the same period last year. TDCX's CEO, Mr. Laurent Junique, emphasized the company's commitment to long-term goals and enhancing operational efficiency to deliver value to clients. The company saw sustained client growth, with a 15% increase in client count year-on-year, reaching a total of 97 clients by the end of 2023. Revenue diversification improved as revenue from clients outside the top five rose by 44% in FY 23, reducing the revenue mix from top five clients to 73% from 81% in FY 22. TDCX also expanded its presence in new geographies, with revenue from new geographies quadrupling in FY 23 compared to FY 22. Negative - TDCX experienced a decline in total revenue for the full year 2023, although the decrease was marginal at 0.9% year-on-year. - Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income showed negative changes for the full year and the fourth quarter of 2023, indicating challenges in certain financial aspects. - The company did not host a conference call to discuss the financial results, potentially limiting transparency and communication with investors. Financial Analyst An examination of TDCX Inc.'s financial performance reveals a mixed picture. While total revenue saw a slight decline of 0.9% year-on-year, the company's profit for the year increased by 14.5%. This increase in profitability can be attributed to effective cost optimization strategies, lower tax liabilities and higher interest income. Additionally, the company experienced a net reversal of equity settled share-based payment expense, which also contributed to the bottom line.Furthermore, the company's ability to grow its client base by 15% in a challenging macroeconomic environment is noteworthy. This client growth, coupled with improved revenue diversification—evidenced by a 44% year-on-year increase in revenue from clients outside the top five—suggests that TDCX is successfully reducing its reliance on its largest clients, which is a positive step towards mitigating risk.However, the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA by 12.8% and Adjusted Net Income by 8.7% indicates that there are underlying pressures on the company's operational efficiency and profitability that warrant close monitoring. Investors should consider the potential impact of foreign exchange rates on future earnings as well, given that the reported figures were significantly affected by currency fluctuations. Market Research Analyst The expansion into new geographies, with revenue from these locations increasing fourfold, is a strategic move that could open up new revenue streams and client bases for TDCX. This geographical diversification is essential for the company's long-term growth, especially considering the current global economic uncertainties.It is also important to highlight the industry's trend towards digital customer experience solutions, which TDCX is capitalizing on. As companies continue to invest in enhancing their customer experience to stay competitive, providers like TDCX could see increased demand for their services. However, the decline in revenue in the fourth quarter, both year-on-year and in constant currency terms, raises questions about the company's short-term revenue trajectory and the sustainability of its growth amidst market uncertainties. Economist From an economic perspective, TDCX's financial results must be contextualized within the broader macroeconomic environment. The company's reference to market uncertainties and a challenging macroeconomic environment implies that external factors such as inflation, currency volatility and economic slowdowns could be influencing performance. The resilience shown in their profit margins, despite these conditions, is commendable.The impact of foreign exchange rates is particularly significant, as evidenced by the 3.9 percentage point negative impact on full-year revenue and the 4.8 percentage point negative impact on fourth-quarter revenue. Companies operating internationally, like TDCX, must navigate currency risks, which can affect their reported earnings and operational costs. The company's performance in constant currency terms provides a clearer picture of its operational health, excluding the volatile effects of currency fluctuations. 03/06/2024 - 05:20 PM SINGAPORE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- TDCX Inc.

Unless otherwise noted, all translations from Singapore dollars to U.S. dollars and from U.S. dollars to Singapore dollars in this press release were made at a rate of S$1.3186 to US$1.00, the approximate rate in effect as of December 31, 2023. We make no representation that any Singapore dollar or U.S. dollar amount could have been, or could be, converted into U.S. dollars or Singapore dollar, as the case may be, at any particular rate, the rate stated herein, or at all. Non-IFRS Financial Measures To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS, we use the following non-IFRS financial measures to help evaluate our operating performance: “EBITDA” represents profit for the year/ period before interest expense, interest income, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization expense. “EBITDA margin” represents EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. “Adjusted EBITDA” represents profit for the year/ period before interest expense, interest income, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense, acquisition-related professional fees, net foreign exchange gains or losses and equity-settled share-based payment expense (or net reversal) incurred in connection with our Performance Share Plan. “Adjusted EBITDA margin” represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. “Adjusted Net Income” represents profit for the year/ period before acquisition-related professional fees, net foreign exchange gains or losses and equity-settled share-based payment expense (or net reversal) incurred in connection with our Performance Share Plan, net of any tax impact of such adjustments. Revenue at constant currency is calculated by translating the revenue of our local subsidiaries in each period in the respective local functional currencies to the presentation currency of the Company and its subsidiaries, using the average currency conversion rates in effect during the comparable prior period, rather than at the actual currency conversion rates in effect during the current reporting period. We believe that EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Income, Revenue at Constant Currency and Revenue Growth at Constant Currency help us to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of items not directly resulting from our core operations, and thereby help us to identify underlying trends in our operating results, enhancing our understanding of past performance and future prospects. We exclude items from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income, including acquisition-related professional fees, net foreign exchange gains or losses and equity-settled share-based payment expense (or net reversal) incurred in connection with our Performance Share Plan, as they are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, and adjusting for such items is meaningful and useful to readers to understand the underlying performance of the business by eliminating the impact of certain items that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of the business. The above non-IFRS financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to revenue, net income, or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of our operating performance. The non-IFRS financial measures presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies because other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently. For more information on the non-IFRS financial measures, including full reconciliations to the nearest IFRS measure, please see the form 6-K section captioned “Non-IFRS Financial Measures” or the presentation slides.

Comparison of the Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 Revenue. Our revenue decreased by 10.1% to S$158.8 million (US$120.4 million) for the three months ended December 31, 2023 from S$176.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 primarily driven by a 36.7% decrease in revenue from content, trust and safety services, a 12.1% decrease in revenue from sales and digital marketing services and 1.9% decrease in revenue from omnichannel CX solutions services rendered. Revenue from other services increased by 20.9%. Our revenue from omnichannel CX solutions services decreased by 1.9% to S$96.5 million (US$73.2 million) from S$98.5 million for the corresponding period of 2022 primarily impacted by lower volumes requirement by existing clients in the digital advertising and media and fintech sectors, buffered partially by increased demand by clients in the gaming, technology, travel and hospitality, e-commerce, fast-moving consumer goods verticals and new food delivery customer. Our revenue from sales and digital marketing services decreased by 12.1% to S$43.0 million (US$32.6 million) from S$48.9 million for the same period of 2022 mainly attributed to declined volume requirements of existing campaign by key digital advertising clients and media and e-commerce sectors. Our revenue from content, trust and safety services decreased by 36.7% to S$17.7 million (US$13.5 million) from S$28.1 million for the same period of 2022 primarily due to the contraction of volumes requirement by the digital advertising and media vertical client. Our revenue from our other service fees increased by 20.9% to S$1.5 million (US$1.1 million) from S$1.2 million for the same period of 2022 primarily due to an expansion of existing campaigns. The following table sets forth our service provided by amount for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. For the three months ended December 31, 2023 2022 US$’000 S$’000 S$’000 Revenue by service Omnichannel CX solutions 73,216 96,542 98,452 Sales and digital marketing 32,634 43,032 48,942 Content, trust and safety 13,460 17,749 28,052 Other service fees # 1,124 1,481 1,225 Total revenue 120,434 158,804 176,671 # Other service fees comprise revenue from other business process services and revenue from other services. Employee Benefits Expense. Our employee benefits expense decreased by 14.5% to S$98.2 million (US$74.5 million) from S$114.8 million for the same period of 2022 due mainly to a reversal of equity-settled share-based payment expense resulting from revised vesting expectation of the remaining tranche against the backdrop of more headwinds in the recent business dynamics that also contributed to the lower headcount volume requirements by customer campaigns. Depreciation and Amortization Expense. Our depreciation and amortization expense remained stable during the two comparative periods. Rental and Maintenance Expense. Our rental and maintenance expenses decreased by 10.9% to S$2.4 million (US$1.8 million) from S$2.7 million for the same period of 2022 primarily due to the decreased technology device renting and relocation of office space by the Korean unit from co-working space to a long term leased facilities in 2023. Recruitment Expense. Our recruitment expense decreased by 24.7% to S$2.6 million (US$1.9 million) from S$3.4 million for the same period of 2022, primarily due to lower hiring activities in several key operating sites reflecting the volume downturn. Transport and Travelling Expense. Our transport and travelling expenses decreased by 35.1% to S$0.4 million (US$0.3 million) from S$0.7 million for the same period of 2022 primarily due to lower logistical costs incurred by the Philippines site on the back of the reduction in the remote and work from home working arrangements in 2023. Telecommunication and Technology Expense. Our telecommunication and technology expenses remained stable during the two comparative periods. Interest Expense. Our interest expense increased by 8.7% to $0.6 million (US$0.5 million) from $0.5 million for the same period of 2022 on account of mainly higher lease liability interest from office spaces taken up by new and existing sites. Other Operating Expense. Our other operating expense decreased by 29.9% to S$6.6 million (US$5.0 million) from S$9.5 million for the same period of 2022 primarily due to lower net foreign exchange loss. Share of Profit from an Associate. This relates to our share of profit from an associated company in Hong Kong which later became a wholly-owned subsidiary on October 13, 2022 following the acquisition of the controlling shares in that business. Interest Income. Our interest income increased by 146.5% to S$3.5 million (US$2.7 million) from S$1.4 million for the same period of 2022 primarily due to higher placements of excess liquid funds in interest earning deposits as well as the increase in interest rates in 2023. Other Operating Income. Our other operating income increased by 280.5% to S$1.5 million (US$1.1 million) from S$0.4 million for the same period of 2022 primarily due to the increase in the fair value gain of financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss. Profit Before Income Tax. As a result of the foregoing, we achieved a profit before income tax of S$39.1 million (US$29.7 million) for the three months ended December 31, 2023 (S$33.0 million for the corresponding period of 2022). Income Tax Expense. Our income tax expense decreased by 10.1% to S$7.1 million (US$5.4 million) from S$7.9 million for the same period of 2022 primarily due to the reinstatement of tax incentive in the Philippines that was suspended in 2022 and one-off prosperity tax levied in Malaysia that was implemented in 2022. Profit for the Period. As a result of the foregoing, our profit for the period increased by 27.8% to S$32.0 million (US$24.2 million) from S$25.0 million for the same period of 2022. Exchange differences on translation of foreign operations. Exchange differences on translation of foreign operations recognized in other comprehensive income was a loss of S$11.0 million (US$8.3 million) and a loss of S$16.2 million for the same period in 2022, resulting from the strengthening of the Singapore Dollar against the respective functional currencies of the foreign operations. The exchange losses on translation of foreign operations for the period decreased by 32.3% as compared to the same period in 2022 as the extent of strengthening of the Singapore Dollar against those functional currencies is lesser in 2023. Total Comprehensive Income for the Period. As a result of the foregoing, our total comprehensive income for the period increased by 114.9% to S$21.0 million (US$15.9 million) from S$9.8 million for the same period of 2022. Additional Adjustments to Certain Non-IFRS Financial Measures With effect from January 1, 2023, we have decided to include adjustments for net foreign exchange gains or losses and acquisition-related professional fees in Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS, in addition to an adjustment for equity-settled share-based payment expense (or net reversal) that was included in such previously reported non-IFRS measures in prior periods. Over the course of the previous year, we have identified such additional items as not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, and adjusting for such items is meaningful and useful to readers to understand the underlying performance of the business by eliminating the impact of certain items that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of the business. For further information, see “Non-IFRS Financial Measures” below. Share Repurchase Program On March 14, 2022, we announced that the board of directors had approved a US$30.0 million share repurchase program. The share repurchase program commenced on March 14, 2022. The repurchase program has no expiration date and may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time without prior notice. We expect to fund repurchases under this program with our existing cash balance. Our proposed repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market at prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions, in block trades, and/or through other legally permissible means, depending on market conditions and in accordance with applicable rules and regulations and its insider trading policy. Our board of directors will review the share repurchase program periodically and may authorize adjustment of its terms and size. All share repurchases are subject to and will be carried out, if at all, in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. From October 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023, we purchased 418,187 American Depositary Shares (ADSs) at a cost of US$2,169,000 under our share repurchase program. No repurchases of ADSs were made from January 1, 2024 to March 4, 2024. NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income margin, Adjusted EPS, revenue at constant currency, and revenue growth at constant currency are non-IFRS financial measures. TDCX monitors EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income margin, Adjusted EPS, revenue at constant currency and revenue growth at constant currency because they assist the Company in comparing its operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of items not directly resulting from its core operations.

Revenue at Constant Currency and Revenue Growth at Constant Currency Revenue at constant currency, which is revenue adjusted for the translation effect of foreign currencies so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Revenue at constant currency is calculated by translating the revenue of our local subsidiaries in each period in the respective local functional currencies to TDCX Inc.’s and its consolidated subsidiaries’ (together, the “Group”) presentation currency, using the average currency conversion rates in effect during the comparable prior period (rather than at the actual currency conversion rates in effect during the current reporting period). Revenue growth at constant currency means the period-over-period change in revenue at constant currency compared against revenue in the prior period. For the three months ended December 31, 2023 2023 2022 S$’000 S$’000 S$’000 As reported At constant currency As reported Revenue growth as reported Foreign exchange impact Revenue growth at constant currency Revenue 158,804 167,318 176,671 (10.1)% 4.8% (5.3)% For the Full Year ended December 31, 2023 2023 2022 S$’000 S$’000 S$’000 As reported At constant currency As reported Revenue growth as reported Foreign exchange impact Revenue growth at constant currency Revenue 658,351 684,143 664,120 (0.9)% 3.9% 3.0% The Company has not reconciled non-IFRS forward-looking revenue growth at constant currency to its most directly comparable IFRS measure, as permitted by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K. The revenue growth outlook indicated for 2024 is calculated and presented at constant currency, as it would require unreasonable efforts to predict factors that are out of the Company’s control or are not readily predictable, such as currency exchange movements over the course of an entire year. The Company uses revenue at constant currency and revenue growth at constant currency, which are supplemental non-IFRS financial measures, to provide better comparability of revenue trends period-over-period (without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates) because it is a global company that transacts business in multiple currencies and reports financial information in the Group’s functional reporting currency. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the amounts reported by the Company in the Group’s functional reporting currency with respect to its foreign revenues. Generally, when the Group’s functional reporting currency dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, revenue at constant currency rates and revenue growth at constant currency rates will be higher or lower than revenue and revenue growth reported at actual exchange rates. The Company believes that non-IFRS financial measures such as EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income margin, Adjusted EPS, revenue at constant currency and revenue growth at constant currency help us to identify underlying trends in our operating results, enhancing our understanding of past performance and future prospects. While the Company believes that such non-IFRS financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating the Company’s results of operations in the same manner as its management, the Company’s use of such non-IFRS financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider these in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results of operations or financial condition as reported under IFRS. TDCX’s non-IFRS financial measures do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect the Company’s operations and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Further, these non-IFRS measures may differ from the non-IFRS information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. The Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-IFRS financial measures to the nearest IFRS performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating performance. The Company encourages you to review the company’s financial information in its entirety and not rely on any single financial measure.

CEO Mr. Igal Zamir highlighted increased demand, improved margins, record backlog, and positive operational cash flow in 2023. The company remains optimistic for 2024 with growing backlog, new contracts, and operational initiatives. Negative None. Financial Analyst The substantial growth in revenue and gross profit reported by TAT Technologies indicates a robust recovery and expansion post-COVID, with a revenue increase of 35% and a gross profit increase of 41%. The improvement in gross margin from 18.8% to 19.7% is particularly noteworthy, as it reflects not only increased sales but also enhanced operational efficiency. Additionally, the leap in Adjusted EBITDA by 176% underscores a significant enhancement in the company's earnings quality and its ability to generate profit from its core operations.The reduction in net debt from $19.4 million to $10.3 million, coupled with the successful private placement raising $10.1 million, suggests a strengthened balance sheet. This financial maneuvering provides TAT with greater flexibility and the potential to invest in further growth or to buffer against market volatility. The reported backlog exceeding $400 million offers visibility into future revenues, which is a positive signal for investors assessing the company's pipeline and long-term sustainability.However, it is important to scrutinize the company's inventory levels in light of the mentioned supply chain challenges. An increase in inventory could tie up capital and potentially lead to impairment risks if demand fluctuates. Stakeholders should also be aware that non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA, exclude certain expenses that are real costs to the business. While these measures provide a focused view of operational performance, they should be considered alongside GAAP metrics for a complete financial analysis. Market Research Analyst The aerospace and defense industries are undergoing a period of significant transformation, driven by the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and evolving military and commercial needs. TAT Technologies' growth mode since Q4 of 2022, as articulated by CEO Igal Zamir, indicates a successful adaptation to the increased demand for aerospace products and services. The introduction of new service lines and operational ramp-up are strategic moves that seem to align well with industry trends, such as the increased focus on maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) services.The mention of new APU MRO capabilities reflects a strategic investment in a niche yet crucial segment of the aerospace market, potentially positioning TAT as a key player in this space. The increase in backlog to over $400 million is a strong indicator of market confidence and provides a substantial cushion for future operations. However, the reliance on continued demand growth and the ability to maintain improved margins will be key factors in sustaining this positive trajectory. Investors should monitor industry trends and competitor movements to assess the likelihood of TAT maintaining its competitive edge. Economist The reported financial results of TAT Technologies are indicative of broader economic trends affecting the aerospace and defense sectors. The company's performance echoes the global recovery trajectory as economies rebound from the pandemic-induced downturn. The positive operational cash flow in the face of increased revenues and working capital requirements suggests a healthy liquidity position, which is critical in managing the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry.However, the mention of supply chain challenges and the necessity to hold more inventory is reflective of the lingering disruptions in global trade. This could have implications for the company's cost structure and operational agility. The management's optimism for 2024, based on backlog and new contracts, must be weighed against the potential for economic headwinds, such as inflationary pressures and geopolitical tensions, which could impact both demand and supply chain stability. Stakeholders should consider these macroeconomic factors when evaluating the company's future performance prospects. 03/06/2024 - 05:09 PM NETANYA, Israel, March 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- TAT Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ: TATT) (""TAT"" or the ""Company""), a leading provider of products and services to the commercial and military aerospace and ground defense industries, reported today its audited results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. Key Financial Highlights: Total revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, were $113.8 million compared to $84.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 35%.Gross profit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, were $22.5 million (19.7% of revenues) compared to $15.9 million (18.8% of revenues) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 41%.Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, was $11.2 million compared to $4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 176%.GAAP net profit from continued operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, was $4.7 million ($0.51 per share on a fully diluted basis) compared to GAAP net loss from continued operations of $1.6 million (net profit of $0.1 million without a onetime impact of our restructuring plan) ($0.175 loss per share on a fully diluted basis) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022.Net debt as of December 31, 2023, was $10.3 million compared to net debt of $19.4 million as of December 31, 2022.In December 2023 the Company raised $10.1 million (net from all related expenses) in a private placement sale to Israelis institutional investors.Mr. Igal Zamir, CEO and President of TAT Technologies stated ""We are very pleased to present the results of 2023. Since Q4 of 2022 we are in constant growth mode. This as a result of the increasing demand to our products and services as well as our new line of services and operation ramp up. The demand continues to grow while our industry is ramping up from the COVID crisis. During 2023 we managed to improve our margins leading to a record year in all relevant aspects of revenue, gross margin and EBITDA. We saw our backlog increase to a record number of over $400 million. We are pleased to see that the strategic shift the Company made over the last 3 years is starting to bear fruit, enabling the Company to compete and win large strategic deals and enjoy improved margin. We ended 2023 with positive operational cash flow despite the revenue increase and the need for working capital to support the growth. The industry supply chain challenges force us to hold much more inventory than what we used to pre COVID"". Mr Zamir continue: ""We remain optimistic for 2024 as we see our increase in backlog and its coverage for the year, new contracts that we believe will yield additional revenue, and the large potential from the new APU MRO capabilities. Various operational initiatives keep us optimistic that our margins will continue to improve."" Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company also presents a Non-GAAP presentation of Adjusted EBITDA. The adjustments to the Company's GAAP results are made with the intent of providing both management and investors a more complete understanding of the Company's underlying operational results, trends and performance. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as net income before the Company's share in results and sale of equity investment of affiliated companies, share-based compensation, taxes on income, financial (expenses) income, net, depreciation and amortization, inventory impairment from exit and dismissal activity and customers relationship write off. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, however, should not be considered as alternatives to net income and operating income for the period and may not be indicative of the historic operating results of the Company; nor they are meant to be predictive of potential future results. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures for other companies. See reconciliation of GAAP Adjusted EBITDA below.

The company's strategic initiatives aim to drive revenue growth and margin expansion. Despite a decline in total revenue for the full year 2023, the company's focus on reducing debt and returning value to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases is notable. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company's recent financial results indicate a positive trajectory in terms of revenue growth and operational efficiency. The reported 5.3% increase in Q4 revenue and the significant expansion in gross profit margin by 290 basis points for the full year are key indicators of the company's ability to manage costs effectively and optimize its product mix. Moreover, the substantial improvement in cash flow from operating activities, turning from a negative cash flow to $88.6 million, reflects a strong focus on net working capital management.However, the full-year revenue decrease of 2.4% suggests that the company may be facing challenges with its pricing strategy or market demand fluctuations. The reduction in total debt from $110.9 million to $50.0 million demonstrates a strategic approach to deleveraging, which is likely to be viewed positively by investors concerned with financial stability. The company's proactive measures in stock repurchase and dividend payments also signal confidence in its financial health and commitment to shareholder returns.The outlook for 2024, with expected modest revenue growth and moderate increase in operating profit, suggests a cautiously optimistic view. The emphasis on strategic initiatives, particularly in the North American market and the expansion into the health sector with the acquisition of HealthBeacon, indicate potential new revenue streams and diversification of the company's portfolio. However, the expected operating loss from Hamilton Beach Health in 2024 should be monitored as it may impact short-term profitability. Market Research Analyst The small kitchen appliance industry is highly competitive and Hamilton Beach's performance must be contextualized within this framework. The company's market share growth in the U.S. and its focus on premium and innovative products are strategic moves to differentiate itself in a saturated market. The shift towards higher-margin products could potentially offer a buffer against the price sensitivity that often characterizes this sector.Hamilton Beach's strategic initiatives, such as expanding its digital footprint and leveraging partnerships, are aligned with broader retail trends, where ecommerce and digital transformation are critical for capturing market share. The increase in ecommerce sales to 39% of total revenue is a testament to successful adaptation to consumer purchasing behaviors. This digital focus is essential for maintaining relevance and driving growth in an increasingly online retail landscape.On the international front, the decrease in global commercial market sales reflects the volatility that can arise from geopolitical unrest and market saturation. This underscores the importance of a diversified and adaptable global strategy that can withstand such external pressures. Medical Research Analyst The acquisition of HealthBeacon and the creation of Hamilton Beach Health represent a strategic entry into the home healthcare market, which is experiencing growth due to increasing health awareness and technological advancements. Hamilton Beach's approach to leverage its brand in developing digitally connected health tools aligns with the trend towards remote patient monitoring and personalized healthcare.HealthBeacon's subscription-based revenue model and focus on chronic disease treatments could offer a recurring revenue stream, diversifying Hamilton Beach's income sources. However, the initial operating loss expected in 2024 for Hamilton Beach Health indicates the challenges inherent in scaling new ventures, particularly in the healthcare sector where regulatory compliance and market penetration are significant hurdles.Investors should consider the long-term potential of this venture against the backdrop of an aging population and a shift towards in-home care. The success of this initiative will hinge on the company's ability to integrate HealthBeacon's technology with its existing product development capabilities and effectively market these new health management tools. 03/06/2024 - 04:30 PM GLEN ALLEN, Va., March 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company (NYSE: HBB) (The Company) today announced results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023.

Revenue growth reflected increased unit volume and favorable mix partially offset by lower average selling price. In the Company's consumer markets, revenue increased in the U.S., Mexican and Latin American markets and decreased in the Canadian market. In the Global Commercial market, revenue decreased compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, when revenue grew 57.1% due to a continued strong rebound in demand from the food service and hospitality industries from pandemic-driven demand softness. The year-over-year decline was attributable to lower sales in the international food service industry as several markets were overstocked as well as unrest in certain key countries that resulted in an unfavorable impact on sales. Gross profit was $55.3 million compared to $34.1 million. Gross profit margin expanded to 26.8% compared to 17.4%, mostly reflecting lower product costs, which offset lower average sales price. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $30.2 million compared to $22.8 million primarily due to higher incentive compensation, advertising, M&A and other expenses. Operating profit was $25.0 million compared to $11.3 million. Interest expense, net decreased to $0.4 million compared to $1.7 million primarily due to decreased average borrowings outstanding under the Company's revolving credit facility. Net income was $19.6 million or $1.40 per diluted share, compared to net income of $7.1 million, or $0.51 per diluted share. Results of the Full Year 2023 Compared to the Full Year 2022 Total revenue of $625.6 million decreased 2.4% compared to $640.9 million, reflecting lower average selling price for the year and lower unit volume in the first half of 2023. In the Company's consumer markets, revenue increased in the Mexican market and decreased in the U.S., Canadian, Latin American and Global Commercial markets. Gross profit was $143.7 million compared to $129.1 million. Gross profit margin expanded to 23.0% compared to 20.1% reflecting lower product costs and favorable product mix. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $108.4 million compared to $90.1 million, primarily due to higher incentive compensation and to the benefit of a $10 million insurance recovery in 2022. Additionally, there was an increase in employee-related costs in 2023 that was partially offset by a decrease in outside services. Operating profit was $35.1 million compared to $38.8 million, which included the benefit of the insurance recovery. Interest expense, net decreased by $1.6 million, to $3.0 million, primarily due to lower debt levels partially offset by higher interest rates. The effective tax rate on income was 20.4% and 22.1% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The effective tax rate was lower for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 due to the favorable impact of foreign operations in the current year. Net income was $25.2 million, or $1.80 per diluted share, compared to net income of $25.3 million, or $1.81 per diluted share. Cash Flow and Debt For the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was $88.6 million compared to cash used for operating activities of $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the Company's focus on net working capital improvement. Net working capital provided cash of $49.5 million in 2023 compared to a use of cash of $39.0 million in 2022. Net cash provided by accounts payable was $37.5 million in 2023 compared to $69.9 million used in 2022. Capital expenditures in 2023 were $3.4 million compared to $2.3 million in 2022. In 2023, the Company made $1.6 million in secured loan payments to HealthBeacon. The Company allocated its strong cash flow primarily to reduce debt and return value to shareholders through the quarterly dividend and repurchase of stock. On December 31, 2023, total debt was $50.0 million compared to $110.9 million as of December 31, 2022. On December 31, 2023, net debt, or debt minus cash and cash equivalents, was $34.6 million compared to $110.0 million on December 31, 2022. For the full year 2023, the Company paid $6.1 million in dividends and repurchased 250,772 shares of its Class A common stock at prevailing market prices for an aggregate purchase price of $3.1 million. Outlook In 2024, the retail marketplace for small kitchen appliances is expected to be modestly below 2023. The Company expects that continued progress with its strategic initiatives will enable it to deliver above market revenue performance. For the full year 2024, the Company expects total revenue to increase modestly compared to full year 2023. Revenue in both the first half and second half of 2024 is expected to increase modestly with the first half expected to be somewhat stronger than the second half mostly due to comparisons to the prior year. Operating profit for the full year 2024 is expected to increase moderately compared to 2023 based on an expansion of gross profit margin. Continued progress with the Company's six strategic initiatives is expected to drive revenue growth, expand margins, and generate strong cash flow over time. The initiatives are focused on increasing sales of innovative, higher priced, higher margin products in the Company's core North American market. The following is a summary of each initiative. Drive Core Growth: This initiative is focused on driving the growth of the Company's flagship brands Hamilton Beach® and Proctor Silex® in its core North American market. Both brands have a long history of consumer trust, based on quality, durability and innovation. The Company has a long track record of developing innovative new products that improve everyday living in the small appliance category. Teams study consumer pain points and develop new product solutions that have enabled the Company to generate significant revenue over time. New products are supported by digital marketing, social media advertising and influencer marketing. Hamilton Beach® continues to be the #1 small kitchen appliance brand in the U.S. based on units sold. Gain Share in the Premium Market: The Company continues to develop, license and acquire brands to increase its participation in the premium market. New products and digital marketing support underpin the strategy to grow this business. Premium products include the Company's owned brands Hamilton Beach Professional® and Weston®, and the licensed brands Wolf Gourmet® countertop appliances, CHI® premium garment care products, CloroxTM True HEPA air purifiers, and Brita HubTM countertop electric water filtration appliances. The Company has an exclusive multiyear agreement to design, sell, market, and distribute Bartesian® premium cocktail delivery machines. In March 2023, the Company announced an agreement to provide the next generation of specialty appliances for use with Numilk® raw ingredients to create a variety of fresh non-dairy milk products on demand in homes and commercial establishments. Initial rollout for the new Numilk appliances began in early 2024. Accelerate Growth of Hamilton Beach Health: Drawing on decades of experience as a trusted resource in the home, in 2021 the Company created the Hamilton Beach Health® brand. The Hamilton Beach Health business empowers people to take control of their health with digitally connected tools using in-home solutions. In February 2024, Hamilton Beach Health acquired HealthBeacon PLC, a medical technology firm and strategic partner of the Company since 2021. HealthBeacon develops connected devices that enable patients with chronic conditions to manage their injectable medication regimens at home and provides other health services. The Company believes HealthBeacon is an attractive investment with the potential to increase shareholder value over time as the business is scaled and expanded. Growth opportunities are expected to be driven by the development of in-home healthcare management tools, including Remote Therapeutic Monitoring systems. Sales are principally through the specialty pharmacy channel in the U.S. and directly to pharmaceutical companies outside the U.S. HealthBeacon's revenue model is subscription based. Growth plans include attracting new patients and adding new chronic disease treatments. The acquisition combines the trusted brand name of Hamilton Beach and the Company's leadership in innovation, engineering, and product development with HealthBeacon's digital capabilities and patented technologies. Hamilton Beach Health and HealthBeacon together are focused on improving patient outcomes and accelerating access to more patients and new opportunities. In 2024, Hamilton Beach Health is expected to have an operating loss due to planned investments in the business and as HealthBeacon continues in the start-up phase. Hamilton Beach Health is expected to contribute to operating profit in 2025. Hamilton Beach Health continues to explore collaboration opportunities with other companies in the home medical market. Lead in the Global Commercial Market: This initiative is focused on securing new business and increasing sales with existing customers that operate in the food service and hospitality industries throughout the world. The Hamilton Beach® brand, with its reputation for performance, reliability and differentiated products, is driving growth of commercial products. Continuing to develop products that create a competitive advantage in the Company's core blending and mixing categories, as well as expanding into new categories organically, is the cornerstone of the strategy. Commercial customers include restaurants, fast food chains, bars and hotels. The Company's products are sold through distributors and increasingly through internal sales capabilities. The Company's commercial products are sold in more than 100 countries and more than 50% of revenue is from outside the U.S. Growth plans also include expanding customer relationships with regional and global restaurant and hotel chains. Building strength in ecommerce, which is becoming more important in the commercial market, is also a focus. Accelerate Digital Transformation: The Company has a well-developed ecommerce capability and continues its investments to gain share in ecommerce markets for consumer and commercial products.

The company anticipates a positive full-year net income in 2024 despite challenges at the Red Hills Power Plant affecting customer demand. The outlook includes improved results at Mississippi Lignite Mining Company and higher earnings at Falkirk and Coteau. Positive Operating loss of $67.4 million and net loss of $44.0 million in Q4 2023 compared to operating profit of $15.5 million and net income of $13.8 million in 2022. Non-cash asset impairment charge of $65.9 million due to issues at Red Hills Power Plant. Adjusted EBITDA of $7.1 million in Q4 2023, excluding impairment charge, versus $23.6 million in 2022. Expectation of positive full-year net income in 2024 despite challenges at Red Hills Power Plant. Anticipated improvements at Mississippi Lignite Mining Company and higher earnings at Falkirk and Coteau in 2024. Consolidated cash of $85.1 million, debt of $36.0 million, and availability of $105.1 million under revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2023. Negative Significant decline in operating profit and net income in Q4 2023 compared to 2022. Force majeure event affecting Red Hills Power Plant leading to customer demand decline in 2024. Non-cash asset impairment charge impacting Coal Mining and Minerals Management segments. Lower earnings at unconsolidated operations contributing to reduction in Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Financial Analyst The reported operating loss of $67.4 million for Q4 2023, contrasted with the operating profit of $15.5 million in the previous year, signifies a notable deterioration in NACCO Industries' operational performance. This is primarily attributed to a substantial non-cash asset impairment charge of $65.9 million due to an unplanned outage at the Red Hills Mine. When evaluating the financial health of a company, such a significant impairment charge can be a red flag, indicating potential overvaluation of assets or adverse changes in business prospects.Investors should note that the adjusted EBITDA, which excludes this one-time impairment charge, stands at $7.1 million, down from $23.6 million in 2022. This metric is often used to assess a company's operating performance by stripping out non-cash and other one-time items. However, the sharp decline suggests underlying operational challenges beyond the impairment. The forward-looking statements for 2024 anticipate a positive turnaround in net income, which could suggest management's confidence in operational improvements and cost management strategies.It's crucial for stakeholders to monitor the company's ability to navigate the energy market's volatility and its strategic initiatives aimed at growth and diversification. The capital structure and liquidity position, with $85.1 million in cash and $105.1 million in credit facility availability, appear solid, providing some buffer against short-term disruptions. Energy Market Analyst The impairment charge related to Mississippi Lignite Mining Company's operational issues reflects broader challenges in the coal mining sector, including the transition to alternative energy sources and the impact of unforeseen events like the significant unplanned outage. The force majeure event notice from the power plant customer and the subsequent expected decline in demand for 2024 underscore the risks associated with reliance on a limited number of customers and the inherent volatility of the energy sector.On a positive note, the company's coal mining operations have a contract structure that shields them from spot coal market price fluctuations, mitigating some market risks. However, the dependency on natural gas prices, weather conditions and the availability of renewable power generation for customer demand remains a concern.Investors should also consider the company's strategic moves in the Minerals Management segment, such as the acquisition within the Midland Basin. This investment aligns with the company's diversification strategy and could provide a new growth avenue, although it also introduces exposure to the volatile oil and gas markets. Mining and Minerals Expert The write-down of coal inventory to net realizable value and the expected loss at Mississippi Lignite Mining Company in 2024 highlight the challenges faced in the coal mining segment. The anticipated improvement in results due to lower depreciation and amortization, post-impairment, suggests a more conservative valuation of assets moving forward.The Minerals Management segment's performance is closely tied to commodity prices, which have been volatile. The 51% decline in natural gas prices and the 5% decrease in oil prices significantly impacted revenues and Segment Adjusted EBITDA. The recent acquisition in the Midland Basin indicates a strategic pivot towards mineral interests, which may provide a buffer against the declining coal segment. However, this move also increases exposure to the unpredictable nature of commodity prices.Lastly, the North American Mining segment shows promise with increased revenues in Q4 2023 compared to 2022, despite a slight operating loss. The long-term contract to mine phosphate and amended limestone contracts could enhance future profitability, although the capital expenditures of approximately $32 million for 2024 will require careful management to ensure a positive return on investment. 03/06/2024 - 04:51 PM Consolidated Q4 2023 Highlights: Operating loss of $67.4 million versus operating profit of $15.5 million in 2022Includes non-cash asset impairment charge of $65.9 million triggered by significant unplanned outage at the power plant served by the Red Hills MineNet loss of $44.0 million compared with net income of $13.8 million in 2022Adjusted EBITDA of $7.1 million, which excludes the asset impairment charge, versus $23.6 million in 20222024 Consolidated Outlook Expect to report positive full-year net income compared with substantial 2023 lossCLEVELAND, March 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- NACCO Industries® (NYSE: NC) today announced the following consolidated results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023. Comparisons in this news release are to the three months and year ended December 31, 2022, unless otherwise noted. Three Months Ended Year Ended ($ in millions except per share amounts) 12/31/23 12/31/22 $ Change 12/31/23 12/31/22 $ Change Operating Profit (Loss) $(67.4) $15.5 $(82.9) $(70.1) $70.0 $(140.1) Net Income (Loss) $(44.0) $13.8 $(57.8) $(39.6) $74.2 $(113.8) Diluted Earnings (loss)/share $(5.88) $1.84 $(7.72) $(5.29) $10.06 $(15.35) Adjusted EBITDA* $7.1 $23.6 $(16.5) $27.5 $88.2 $(60.7) *Non-GAAP financial measures are defined and reconciled on pages 10 to 12. The substantial decreases in the Company's 2023 fourth-quarter and full-year results compared with the respective prior year periods were primarily due to a $65.9 million non-cash asset impairment charge combined with substantially lower operating results at the Company's Coal Mining and Minerals Management segments. In mid-December 2023, Mississippi Lignite Mining Company received a force majeure event notice from its customer as a result of an issue affecting one of two boilers at the Red Hills Power Plant. The unit remains disabled at this time and the timeline for resolution is uncertain. While the power plant continues to operate with one boiler, this issue is expected to result in a significant decline in customer demand during 2024. The anticipated reduction in demand contributed to a non-cash impairment charge of $65.9 million during the 2023 fourth quarter. While the impairment relates solely to Mississippi Lignite Mining Company, the Company recorded $60.8 million in the Coal segment and $5.1 million in the Minerals Management segment because certain land assets are included within that segment. In comparison, full-year 2022 net income included $30.9 million of pre-tax contract termination settlement income from the completion of Great River Energy's sale of Coal Creek Station to Rainbow Energy. At December 31, 2023, the Company had consolidated cash of $85.1 million and debt of $36.0 million with availability of $105.1 million under its $150.0 million revolving credit facility. During the 2023 fourth quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 66,000 shares under an existing authorized share repurchase program for a total purchase price of $2.3 million. The Company believes maintaining a conservative capital structure and adequate liquidity are important given evolving trends in energy markets and the Company's strategic initiatives to grow and diversify. These initiatives are discussed further in the Long-Term Growth and Diversification section of this release. Detailed Discussion of ResultsCoal Mining Results Coal deliveries for the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2022 were as follows: 2023 2022 Tons of coal delivered (in thousands) Unconsolidated operations 4,842 6,175 Consolidated operations 686 818 Total deliveries 5,528 6,993 Key financial results for the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2022 were as follows: 2023 2022 (in thousands) Revenues $ 19,754 $ 25,041 Earnings of unconsolidated operations $ 10,946 $ 12,449 Long-lived asset impairment charge $ 60,832 $ — Operating expenses(1) $ 9,357 $ 8,548 Operating profit (loss) $ (62,283) $ 3,693 Segment Adjusted EBITDA(2) $ 3,194 $ 8,084 (1) Operating expenses consist of Selling, general and administrative expenses, Amortization of intangible assets and (Gain) loss on sale of assets. (2) Segment Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP. See non-GAAP explanation and the related reconciliations to GAAP on page 11. Fourth-quarter 2023 revenues and Segment Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the impairment charge, decreased significantly compared with a strong fourth-quarter 2022. These decreases were primarily due to fewer tons delivered at Mississippi Lignite Mining Company, in part due to the issue affecting the power plant. The decrease in tons delivered contributed to an increase in the cost per ton sold and a $0.9 million write down of coal inventory to net realizable value. As expected, Mississippi Lignite Mining Company's fourth-quarter results, excluding the impairment, improved over the third quarter as costs began to moderate with the completion of the move to the new mine area. Lower earnings at the unconsolidated operations, as well as higher operating expenses primarily from increased employee-related expenses, also contributed to the reduction in Segment Adjusted EBITDA. The decrease in earnings of unconsolidated operations was mainly due to lower customer requirements. Coal Mining Outlook In 2024, the Company expects coal deliveries to increase modestly from 2023 levels. Higher deliveries at Coteau and Falkirk are expected to be partly offset by the unfavorable effects of the force majeure event at Mississippi Lignite Mining Company and the power plant retirement that led to the March 31, 2023 cessation of coal deliveries from the Company's Sabine Mine. Strong operating profit compared with a significant 2023 loss and substantially higher Segment Adjusted EBITDA are expected in 2024. These anticipated increases are primarily the result of an improvement in results at Mississippi Lignite Mining Company and higher earnings at Falkirk and Coteau. Mississippi Lignite Mining Company expects to incur a loss in 2024, albeit significantly less than in 2023, as a result of the lower tons expected to be delivered in 2024. While total production costs at Mississippi Lignite Mining Company are anticipated to decline substantially from 2023 levels, they are expected to remain above historical levels throughout 2024 until deliveries return to normal and a pit extension in the new mine area is completed. Lower depreciation and amortization expense as a result of the lower depreciable value of Mississippi Lignite Mining Companies' assets after the impairment is expected to contribute to the improved results. An extended delay in repairs to the Red Hills Power Plant could significantly affect the Company's 2024 outlook. An increase in 2024 earnings at the unconsolidated coal mining operations is driven primarily by an expectation for increased customer requirements at Coteau and Falkirk, as well as a higher per ton management fee at Falkirk beginning in June 2024 when temporary price concessions end. Operating profit is expected to be higher in the second half of 2024 compared with the first half due to anticipated improvements at Mississippi Lignite Mining Company, increased demand at the unconsolidated coal mining operations and the end of the Falkirk price concessions in June 2024. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $12.5 million in 2024. The Company's contract structure at each of its coal mining operations eliminates exposure to spot coal market price fluctuations. However, fluctuations in natural gas prices, weather and the availability of renewable power generation, particularly wind, can contribute to changes in power plant dispatch and customer demand for coal. Changes to customer power plant dispatch would affect the Company's 2024 outlook, as well as outlook over the longer term. North American Mining Results Deliveries for the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2022 were as follows: 2023 2022 (in thousands) Tons delivered 12,477 13,467 Key financial results for the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2022 were as follows: 2023 2022 (in thousands) Revenues $ 26,461 $ 18,484 Operating loss $ (562) $ (116) Segment Adjusted EBITDA(1) $ 1,811 $ 1,796 (1) Segment Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP. See non-GAAP explanation and the related reconciliations to GAAP on page 11. North American Mining® revenues increased significantly in fourth-quarter 2023 compared with 2022. This increase was primarily due to a $7.1 million increase in reimbursed costs, which have an offsetting amount in cost of goods sold and therefore no impact on operating profit. Favorable pricing and delivery mix, as well as an increase in revenue at Sawtooth Mining also contributed to the higher revenue. These favorable items were largely offset by a decrease in mine reclamation revenue at Caddo Creek and fewer tons delivered resulting from lower customer requirements. Improved fourth-quarter 2023 earnings at Sawtooth and North American Mining's active quarries were more than offset by a $0.5 million loss on sale of a dragline, $0.4 million of higher outside services costs compared with 2022 related to business development activities and the impact of the substantial completion of services at Caddo Creek in 2022. As a result, North American Mining's fourth-quarter 2023 operating loss increased over the prior year. Segment Adjusted EBITDA was comparable to 2022 despite the higher operating loss because results at the mining operations improved when the impact of depreciation expense was excluded. North American Mining has made significant progress on operational and strategic projects to improve profitability. While the fourth-quarter operating results were down from the prior year, full-year operating profit was up 52% compared with 2022. North American Mining Outlook In October 2023, North American Mining executed a 15-year contract to mine phosphate at a quarry in central Florida. Production is expected to commence in the first half of 2024 once relocation of a dragline is complete. The business also amended and extended existing limestone contracts with two customers that contain mutually advantageous contract terms and expanded the scope of work with another customer. As a result of the impact of these new and modified contracts, as well as improvements at existing operations, North American Mining expects consecutive quarterly growth in operating profit and Segment Adjusted EBITDA in 2024, leading to significantly improved full-year results over 2023. Sawtooth Mining has an exclusive agreement to provide mining design, consulting and, once mining commences, will be the exclusive contract miner for the Thacker Pass lithium project in northern Nevada. Thacker Pass is owned by Lithium Americas Corp. (TSX: LAC) (NYSE: LAC). Lithium Americas controls the lithium reserves at Thacker Pass. In March 2023, Lithium Americas commenced construction at Thacker Pass. With construction underway, Sawtooth began acquiring mining equipment totaling $23.3 million in 2023. These capital expenditures will be reimbursed by Lithium Americas over a five-year period, Sawtooth will recognize the associated revenue over the estimated useful life of the asset. In addition, during the construction period, Sawtooth will be reimbursed for all costs of construction and will recognize a contractually agreed upon construction fee. The Company expects to continue to recognize moderate income prior to the commencement of Phase 1 lithium production. In 2024, capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $32 million, primarily for the acquisition of dragline parts and other equipment to support existing contracts as well as the new and modified contracts previously discussed. Minerals Management Results Key financial results for the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2022 were as follows: 2023 2022 (in thousands) Revenues $ 9,782 $ 19,354 Operating profit $ 2,475 $ 16,897 Segment Adjusted EBITDA(1) $ 8,269 $ 18,142 (1) Segment Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP. See non-GAAP explanation and the related reconciliations to GAAP on page 11. Minerals Management's fourth-quarter 2023 revenues and Segment Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the impairment charge, decreased significantly from the 2022 fourth quarter primarily due to a 51% decline in natural gas prices from 2022 as measured by the Henry Hub Average Natural Gas Spot Price and a 5% decrease in oil prices, as measured by the West Texas Intermediate Average Crude Oil Spot Price. Minerals Management Outlook The Minerals Management segment derives income primarily from royalty-based leases under which lessees make payments to the Company based on their sale of natural gas, oil, natural gas liquids and coal, extracted primarily by third parties. Changing prices of natural gas and oil could have a significant impact on Minerals Management's operating profit. In December 2023, Minerals Management completed an approximately $37 million acquisition of mineral interests within the Midland Basin, the eastern sub-basin of the oil-rich Permian Basin. The acquisition includes 43.4 thousand gross acres and 2.5 thousand net royalty acres. This acquisition offers an attractive investment profile and aligns with the Company's strategy to establish a diversified portfolio of mineral and royalty interests. Management believes this acquisition will be accretive to 2024 earnings and provides opportunities for longer-term growth. In 2024, operating profit and Segment Adjusted EBITDA are expected to decrease moderately compared with the prior year, excluding the 2023 impairment charge stemming from issues at the power plant served by Mississippi Lignite Mining Company. The forecasted reduction in profitability is primarily driven by current market expectations for natural gas and oil prices and modest expectations for development of additional new wells by third-party lessees. Lower operating expenses are expected to partially offset the anticipated profit decline. The Company's forecast is based on current market assumptions for natural gas and oil market prices, as well as development and production assumptions on currently owned reserves. Commodity prices are inherently volatile. Changes may be abrupt in response to factors such as OPEC and/or government actions, geopolitical developments, economic conditions and regulatory changes, as well as supply and demand dynamics. Any change in natural gas and oil prices from current expectations will result in adjustments to the Company's outlook. The Company is closely monitoring the Russia/Ukraine and Israel/Hamas conflicts and their potential impact on OPEC countries and international oil and gas production and demand. Current merger and acquisition activity within the oil and gas exploration and production industry is also a focus as the Company works to understand its potential impact on development plans by third-party lessees. As an owner of royalty and mineral interests, the Company's access to information concerning activity and operations with respect to its interests is limited. The Company's expectations are based on the best information currently available and could vary positively or negatively as a result of adjustments made by operators, additional leasing and development and/or changes to commodity prices. Development of additional wells on existing interests in excess of current expectations, or acquisitions of additional interests, could be accretive to future results. In 2024, Minerals Management is targeting additional investments of up to $20 million. Future investments are expected to be accretive, but each investment's contribution to near-term earnings is dependent on the details of that investment, including the size and type of interests acquired and the stage and timing of mineral development. Mitigation Resources of North America® Mitigation Resources of North America® continues to build on the substantial foundation it has established over the past several years. Mitigation Resources currently has nine mitigation banks and four permittee-responsible mitigation projects located in Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama and Texas. In addition, Mitigation Resources is providing ecological restoration services for abandoned surface mines, as well as pursuing additional environmental restoration projects. It was named a designated provider of abandoned mine land restoration by the State of Texas. Mitigation Resources anticipates expanding its business in 2024, with a focus on generating a modest operating profit by 2025 and achieving sustainable profitability in future years. Consolidated 2023 Results Overall, the Company reported a fourth-quarter 2023 operating loss of $67.4 million and a loss before income taxes of $65.9 million compared with operating profit of $15.5 million and income before income taxes of $16.2 million in fourth-quarter 2022. Excluding the $65.9 million 2023 impairment, the Company generated a modest consolidated operating loss and break-even earnings before taxes. Lower operating results at each of the Company's operating segments and higher unallocated costs contributed to the overall modest consolidated operating loss. The Company's results before income taxes were less than the operating loss due to the net favorable effect of other income/expense items. During the fourth quarter, the Company realized a $2.4 million gain as a result of post-closing income received for an investment sold in 2023. Higher interest income in 2023 compared with 2022 also contributed to higher other income. These favorable items were partially offset by higher closed mine obligation expense of $2.3 million compared with 2022 and a $1.8 million pension settlement expense in 2023. Consolidated Outlook Overall, the Company expects to generate net income in 2024 compared with the substantial 2023 consolidated net loss. Adjusted EBITDA is also expected to increase significantly over 2023. These improvements are primarily due to anticipated increased profitability at the Coal Mining segment from improved results at Mississippi Lignite Mining Company, Falkirk and Coteau. Growth at North American Mining is also expected to contribute to the higher 2024 results. Additional contracts for North American Mining or Mitigation Resources, or the acquisition of additional mineral interests at Minerals Management could be accretive to the current forecast. Consolidated capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $69 million in 2024. In 2024, cash flow before financing activities is expected to be a moderate use of cash. Long-Term Growth and Diversification Outlook Management continues to view the long-term business outlook for NACCO positively. The Company is pursuing growth and diversification by strategically leveraging its core mining and natural resources management skills to build a strong portfolio of affiliated businesses. Management continues to be optimistic about the long-term outlook. In the Minerals Management segment, as well as in the Company's Mitigation Resources of North America® business, opportunities for growth remain strong. Acquisitions of additional mineral interests, an improvement in the outlook for the Company's largest Coal Mining segment customers, and securing contracts for Mitigation Resources and new North American Mining projects should be accretive to the Company's outlook. The Minerals Management segment continues to pursue acquisitions of mineral and royalty interests in the United States. Catapult Mineral Partners, the Company's business unit focused on managing and expanding the Company's portfolio of oil and gas mineral and royalty interests, has developed a strong network to source and secure new acquisitions. The goal is to construct a high-quality diversified portfolio of oil and gas mineral and royalty interests in the United States that delivers near-term cash flow yields and long-term projected growth. The Company believes this business will provide unlevered after-tax returns on invested capital in the mid-teens as this business model matures. This business model has the potential to deliver higher average operating margins over the life of a reserve than traditional oil and gas companies that bear the cost of exploration, production and/or development as these costs are borne entirely by third-party exploration and development companies that lease the minerals. North American Mining is focused on evaluating new business opportunities and driving profitable growth in line with refined strategic objectives. After a pause on business development in early 2023, North American Mining has better identified how to enhance operational excellence, where to focus and scale, and how to drive profitable growth. New contracts and contract extensions are central to the business' organic growth strategy, and North American Mining intends to be a substantial contributor to operating profit over time. Mitigation Resources continues to expand its business, which creates and sells stream and wetland mitigation credits, provides services to those engaged in permittee-responsible mitigation and provides other environmental restoration services. This business offers an opportunity for growth and diversification in an industry where the Company has substantial knowledge and expertise and a strong reputation. Mitigation Resources is making strong progress toward its goal of becoming a top ten provider of stream and wetland mitigation services in the southeastern United States. The Company believes that Mitigation Resources can provide solid rates of return on capital employed as this business matures. The Company also continues to pursue activities which can strengthen the resiliency of its existing coal mining operations. The Company remains focused on managing coal production costs and maximizing efficiencies and operating capacity at mine locations to help customers with management fee contracts be more competitive. These activities benefit both customers and the Company's Coal Mining segment, as fuel cost is a significant driver for power plant dispatch. Increased power plant dispatch results in increased demand for coal by the Coal Mining segment's customers. Fluctuating natural gas prices, weather and availability of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, could affect the amount of electricity dispatched from coal-fired power plants. While the Company realizes the coal mining industry faces political and regulatory challenges and demand for coal is projected to decline over the longer-term, the Company believes coal should be an essential part of the energy mix in the United States for the foreseeable future. The Company continues to look for ways to create additional value by utilizing its core mining competencies which include reclamation and permitting. The Company is working to utilize these skills through development of utility-scale solar projects on reclaimed mining properties. Reclaimed mining properties offer large tracts of land that could be well-suited for solar and other energy-related projects. These projects could be developed by the Company itself or through joint ventures that include partners with expertise in energy development projects. In 2023, NACCO formed ReGen Resources to pursue such projects, including the development of a solar farm on reclaimed land at Mississippi Lignite Mining Company. The Company is committed to maintaining a conservative capital structure as it continues to grow and diversify, while avoiding unnecessary risk. Strategic diversification will generate cash that can be re-invested to strengthen and expand the businesses. The Company also continues to maintain the highest levels of customer service and operational excellence with an unwavering focus on safety and environmental stewardship. **** Conference Call In conjunction with this news release, the management of NACCO Industries will host a conference call on Thursday, March 7, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

Receives Delisting Notice From the New York Stock Exchange Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Express, Inc. (EXPR) announced its delisting from the NYSE and transition to the OTC Pink® Market. The company's common stock will now trade under the symbol 'EXPR' on the OTC market. The delisting was due to the NYSE's requirement of a minimum $15 million market capitalization over 30 consecutive trading days. Despite this change, Express's business operations, SEC reporting obligations, and debt agreements remain unaffected. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The delisting of Express, Inc. from the NYSE is a significant event that typically reflects the market's reassessment of a company's valuation and its ability to meet the exchange's listing standards. A delisting often leads to reduced liquidity and investor interest, as many institutional investors are restricted from holding stocks not listed on major exchanges. This can result in increased volatility and wider bid-ask spreads for the stock. Moreover, the transition to the OTC Pink Market, which is considered less prestigious and rigorous in terms of reporting standards, could potentially diminish investor confidence.Express's delisting due to its failure to maintain the required market capitalization over a sustained period indicates underlying financial challenges. The company's mention of cost-saving initiatives and operational efficiency enhancements suggests ongoing efforts to improve its financial health. Investors should closely monitor the company's future SEC filings for insights into its operational and financial performance, as these will be critical in assessing the company's ability to navigate its post-delisting environment. Market Research Analyst Express, Inc.'s operational strategy following the delisting announcement focuses on serving customers and positioning for the future, which could involve reevaluating its product offerings, marketing strategies and customer engagement. The retail industry is highly competitive and sensitive to consumer trends, so Express's ability to adapt and innovate will be crucial for its survival in a market that has seen many traditional retailers struggle.Investors should consider the broader retail landscape, including consumer spending patterns, the rise of e-commerce and the potential for market recovery post-pandemic. The company's strategy in these areas will be important indicators of its potential to regain market capitalization and possibly relist on a major exchange in the future. It will also be essential to compare Express's performance with industry peers to gauge its competitive position. Legal Expert Express, Inc.'s assertion that the delisting and transition to the OTC Pink Market do not conflict with or cause an event of default under any of the company's material debt or other agreements is a critical legal point for stakeholders. This suggests that the company's contractual obligations remain intact, which is important for creditors and investors. It is essential for stakeholders to review the company's debt covenants and other agreements to understand the potential implications of the delisting.Additionally, the company's continued SEC reporting obligations indicate a commitment to transparency and regulatory compliance, which may help maintain a degree of investor trust despite the delisting. Stakeholders should pay attention to future disclosures, including any changes in governance or risk factors, as these could impact the company's legal and financial standing. 03/06/2024 - 04:45 PM COLUMBUS, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Express, Inc.

The offering includes shares from Pride Feeder, LP and AIX Pride Syndication L.P. Paycor will not receive proceeds from the sale. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC is the underwriter. Pride Aggregator, LP will distribute shares of Paycor's common stock to its limited partners. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of an underwritten public offering by Paycor HCM, Inc. represents a significant liquidity event for the investment funds advised by Apax Partners LLP. The decision to offload 8,000,000 shares is a strategic move that could indicate Apax Partners' assessment of Paycor's current valuation or a need to free up capital for other investments. The market's reception of this offering will serve as a barometer for investor sentiment towards Paycor and could influence the stock's price volatility in the short-term.From a financial perspective, the distribution of 11,038,476 shares to limited partners prior to the offering's close is a substantial reallocation of equity. This could potentially dilute the value of existing shares, depending on how the market absorbs the additional supply. Moreover, the 30-day lock-up on a portion of shares may provide some temporary price stability post-offering. However, once this period expires, there could be increased selling pressure if these shareholders decide to liquidate their positions. Market Research Analyst Paycor's decision to not receive proceeds from the sale and to bear the costs associated with the sale (excluding underwriting discounts and commissions) is an interesting strategic choice. This indicates that the primary objective of the offering is to facilitate the exit or portfolio adjustment of the selling stockholders rather than to raise capital for the company itself. For current and potential investors, this move could signal that Paycor is in a stable financial position with sufficient operating capital, thus not requiring the infusion of funds through this offering.Additionally, the role of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC as the underwriter is noteworthy. Their involvement lends credibility to the offering and could potentially attract institutional investors. The market will closely monitor the performance of this offering, as it may set a precedent for future transactions involving similar companies in the HCM software sector. Legal Expert The offering is being made pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which allows for the registered securities to be offered in one or more separate offerings with the size, price and terms determined at the time of sale. This flexibility is advantageous for the selling stockholders, as it enables them to respond quickly to market conditions. Investors should be aware that the prospectus filed with the SEC contains critical information and any discrepancies or updates in these documents could have legal implications and affect investor decisions.It is also important to consider the legal implications of the lock-up agreements. While these are standard practice to prevent a flood of shares hitting the market immediately after an offering, they can also lead to a concentrated period of volatility once they expire, as mentioned earlier. Stakeholders should monitor the SEC filings for any amendments or additional information that could provide further context to the offering. 03/06/2024 - 04:46 PM CINCINNATI, March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Paycor HCM, Inc.

Board of Directors declares a 5.6% increase in quarterly cash dividend to $0.19 per share. CEO William G. Miller II expresses confidence in the company's growth and efficiency improvements for 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in net sales and gross profit margin for Miller Industries signifies a robust demand for the company's products and an effective management of costs. The substantial growth in net income and earnings per share (EPS) suggests operational efficiency and could positively influence investor sentiment. The announcement of a dividend increase is also a positive signal to shareholders, reflecting confidence in the company's financial health and commitment to returning value.From a financial perspective, the significant reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales illustrates strong cost control measures. However, investors should closely monitor the company's future working capital management, as the intention to reduce inventory levels could impact the company's ability to meet demand if not executed effectively. Market Research Analyst The automotive and equipment manufacturing sector is highly competitive and Miller Industries' performance indicates a successful navigation of market dynamics. The company's ability to maintain a near $1 billion backlog demonstrates sustained market demand, which is critical for future revenue streams. Moreover, the company's strategic investments in capacity and productivity, as well as its workforce, appear to be paying off, positioning it well for continued growth.It's important to note that the company's supply chain improvements and flexibility enhancements are key competitive advantages in an industry often susceptible to material cost volatility and supply disruptions. The focus on reducing working capital to pre-COVID levels could improve cash flow and financial stability, an aspect that potential investors and market analysts will likely view favorably. Economist The financial results of Miller Industries reflect broader economic trends, such as the stabilization of raw material costs, which may indicate easing inflationary pressures. The company's performance can be seen as a microcosm of the manufacturing sector's recovery post-pandemic. The ability to execute against a substantial backlog could signal not only company strength but also a rebound in industrial activity.Additionally, the commitment to reducing working capital and paying down debt is a prudent financial strategy that can strengthen the company's balance sheet against potential economic headwinds. A strong balance sheet is particularly important in an uncertain economic environment, as it provides resilience to shocks and allows for strategic agility. 03/06/2024 - 04:43 PM CHATTANOOGA, Tenn., March 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Miller Industries, Inc. (NYSE: MLR) (""Miller Industries"" or the ""Company"") today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. For the fourth quarter of 2023, net sales were $296.2 million, an increase of 31.2%, compared to $225.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. The year over year improvement was predominantly due to continued strong order trends and execution against the Company's near $1 billion backlog in the form of improved deliveries of finished goods to customers. Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $38.6 million, or 13.0% of net sales, compared to $25.5 million, or 11.3% of net sales, for the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase in gross margin was driven largely by initiatives to improve productivity and the stabilization of raw material costs compared to the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $16.4 million, or 5.5% of net sales, compared to $13.1 million, or 5.8% of net sales, in the prior year period. The year over year increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was due to increases in bonus accruals and investments made in training and retaining the Company's workforce. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales demonstrates the Company's financial discipline and the inherent leverage in its business model. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $16.7 million, or $1.45 per diluted share, compared to net income of $9.3 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, in the prior year period, for increases of 80.2% and 79.0%, respectively. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, net sales were $1.15 billion, an increase of 35.9% compared to $848.5 million in the prior year period. The Company reported net income of $58.3 million, or $5.07 per diluted share for the full year 2023, compared to net income of $20.3 million, or $1.78 per diluted share for the full year 2022, for increases of 186.5% and 184.8%, respectively. The Company also announced that its Board of Directors has declared a 5.6% increase in its quarterly cash dividend to $0.19 per share, payable March 25, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 18, 2024, the fifty-third consecutive quarter that the Company has paid a dividend. ""2023 was a year of tremendous growth at Miller Industries,"" said William G. Miller, II, Chief Executive Officer of the Company. ""Over the past few years, we've remained committed to our strategy of investing in our capacity, productivity and our people. Those investments and the execution of our long-term strategy, coupled with the improvements to our supply chain and ability to cope with the immense demand we have seen for our products over the last three years, are starting to reflect in our financial results, demonstrating the underlying strength of our company and our end-markets."" ""Looking to 2024, we are acutely focused on enhancing our flexibility and reducing our working capital. Over the past two years, we increased our inventories to meet market demand and to increase manufacturing flexibility. Going forward, the investments we made will allow us to be more efficient in our manufacturing processes and should result in our inventory balance decreasing throughout the balance of the year. In 2024, we believe our working capital spend should more closely reflect our pre-COVID levels as a percentage of revenue. In addition, we're pleased to report that we've increased our quarterly dividend to $0.19 per share and paid down $5 million of our debt balance in the first quarter of 2024."" ""As I said in our preliminary earnings announcement, we believe our record 2023 is only the beginning of what is achievable at Miller Industries. Our backlog remains near record levels, we have seen no change in our strong order trends, and internally we are well positioned to continue our efficient execution. Based on these trends, we look forward to another record year on both the top and bottom line in 2024,"" concluded Mr. Miller II.

The measure provides an indication of and expectation of future sales to be achieved on these orders. There is no directly comparable GAAP financial measure for backlog.

Financial Analyst The announcement of Miller Industries' dividend increase is a positive signal to investors, reflecting the company's financial health and confidence in its ability to generate cash flows. A 5.6% increase in the quarterly dividend is a strong indicator of the company's commitment to returning value to shareholders. This move may result in a favorable perception of Miller Industries' stock, potentially increasing demand and positively influencing its stock price.Dividend increases are often a sign of a company's robust financial performance and are generally well-received by the market. Investors typically view such news as a sign of a company's strong profit-generating capabilities and financial stability. Furthermore, consistent dividend payments, as indicated by the fifty-third consecutive quarter of payouts, can attract income-focused investors, adding a stable component to the company's investor base. Market Research Analyst Examining the broader industry context, the towing and recovery equipment sector is often influenced by macroeconomic factors such as infrastructure spending and the health of the automotive industry. An increase in dividends by the world's largest manufacturer within this niche indicates not only the company's strong position but also suggests a stable demand environment for its products.Investors should consider how Miller Industries' performance and its dividend policy compare with peers in the same sector. A higher dividend yield can make the company more attractive relative to its competitors, especially in a low-interest-rate environment where investors are seeking yield. However, it's also important to assess whether the company is balancing its dividend payouts with necessary capital expenditures to ensure long-term growth and competitiveness. Economist From an economic perspective, dividend policy decisions can be influenced by prevailing economic conditions. A decision to increase dividends may suggest that the company anticipates stable or improving economic conditions that will support its business operations. It is also an indication that the company has sufficient earnings to distribute among its shareholders, which can be a proxy for economic health in the industry segment Miller Industries operates in.However, it is essential to monitor economic indicators that could impact the company's future performance, such as changes in disposable income, vehicle sales and commercial activity levels, as these could directly affect the demand for towing and recovery services and equipment. 03/06/2024 - 04:42 PM CHATTANOOGA, Tenn., March 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Miller Industries, Inc.

Negative The Company's delay in filing the Required Reports due to audits and acquisitions may impact investor confidence and raise concerns about financial transparency and compliance with regulatory requirements. 03/06/2024 - 04:40 PM VANCOUVER, BC, March 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- BioVaxys Technology Corp. (CSE: BIOV) (FRA: 5LB) (OTCQB: BVAXF) (the ""Company"") today announced that the Ontario Securities Commission (the ""OSC""), as the Company's principal regulator, on February 29, 2024, granted the Company's previously announced application for the imposition of a management cease trade order under National Policy 12-203 – Management Cease Trade Orders (""NP 12-203""). The Company made the application in connection with its default with respect to having not filed its audited annual financial statements for the year ended October 31, 2023, along with management's discussion and analysis relating to the audited annual financial statements for the year ended October 31, 2023, and certification of the foregoing filings as required by National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuers' Annual and Interim Filings (collectively, the ""Required Reports"") by the reporting deadline of February 28, 2024. The management cease trade order is to remain in place until two full business days after the Company files the Required Reports and restricts all trading by James Passin, director, CEO and CFO of the Company in securities of the Company. The Company applied for a management cease trade order as an alternative to the imposition by the OSC of a full cease trade order. The management cease trade order prevents the officers and/or directors named in the order from trading in the Company's securities but does not affect the ability of other shareholders, including the public, to trade in securities of the Company. As previously announced, the Company's filing of the Required Reports has been delayed as both management and its external auditor, Dale Matheson Carr-Hilton LaBonte LLP (""DMCL""), agreed that additional information and analysis is necessary to complete the Required Reports and DMCL's review of such Required Reports. One of the factors contributing to the delay is the recent unexpected departures of the Chief Financial Officer of the Company as announced on June 30th, 2023, as the Company experienced delays in its ability to provide the necessary documentation to complete internal pre-audit procedures associated with the audit process. A further factor contributing to the delay is the recent acquisition of the entire portfolio of discovery, preclinical and clinical development stage assets of former Canadian biotechnology company, IMV Inc., Immunovaccine Technologies Inc., and IMV USA on February 16th, 2024. The Company and its' external auditor, DMCL, believe that this acquisition constitutes a major purchase of assets that must be reported in its financial statement in accordance with IAS 10. Pursuant to IAS 10, adopted on April 2001 by the International Accounting Standards Board, the financial reporting of events after the reporting period under Section 22(c) of IAS 10 include the category of major purchases of assets. The Company is continuing to diligently work to complete the Required Reports at the earliest possible date and currently expects to be in a position to file the Required Reports within 30 days of the original filing deadline, being March 30th, 2024 and will issue a news release once the Required Filings have been filed. The Company has made all efforts and allocated all available resources to the preparation, completion and filing of the Required Filings. The Company confirms that it will satisfy the provisions of the alternative information guidelines under NP 12-203 by issuing bi-weekly default status reports in the form of news releases for so long as it remains in default of the above-noted filing requirements and until the revocation of the management cease trade order.

The policies that impact where and what type of housing and communities are built are inextricably linked to environmental sustainability and resilience. These issues are not separate from the affordability crisis that dominates much of the housing policy discussion. Indeed, the lack of affordable housing has many adverse impacts for the climate, including pushing new housing into the wildland-urban interface and increasing the time people spend in their cars. In turn, climate-related disasters exacerbate the housing crisis by reducing the supply of affordable housing and increasing costs, such as home insurance.Since its founding, the Terner Center's mission has been to formulate bold strategies to house families from all walks of life in vibrant, sustainable, and affordable homes and communities. We have pursued this mission by focusing our research on issues such as land use and zoning reforms that unlock new supply, racial gaps in access to homeownership, improving the way we finance and provide affordable housing, and addressing homelessness.While mitigating and building resilience to climate change was always a part of this original mission, we have done less research on the intersections between housing and climate than we had initially planned. However, the growing threat of climate change is increasing the urgency for solutions, and specifically, solutions that don't run counter to the urgency of the housing crisis and the ongoing efforts to expand housing supply. We're excited to share that, with initial support from the Wells Fargo Foundation, we are launching a new focus area that will bring evidence-based research to the intersections between housing and climate policy.Some of the challenges motivating our work on climate are not far afield from the housing policy failures we have tackled (and will continue to address). For example, the predominance of single-family zoning in the United States has exacerbated both affordability and the climate crises.1 Our goal of pursuing solutions that advance social and racial equity are strongly aligned with a focus on climate: the consequences of both housing and climate policy failures fall disproportionately on people with low incomes and people of color. Not only are these households more vulnerable to climate disasters due to where they live and the conditions of the homes they can afford,2 they are also less likely to receive disaster recovery assistance.3 These households are likewise more vulnerable to chronic stressors exacerbated by climate change, such as heat and air pollution.4But there is also the real risk that in the effort to respond to climate change, policy makers may make decisions that run counter to housing affordability and equity goals, when in fact what is needed are policies that advance progress on both fronts. Fragmented governance at the local, state, and federal scales contributes to poorly coordinated policies across housing and climate areas,5 which hamper their effectiveness and further pit climate and affordability goals in opposition to one another.Research is needed to provide policy makers with better evidence to navigate these tensions between climate and housing policies, and to identify complementary solutions at all scales of government. For example:To what extent does building infill housing in cities contribute to reducing emissions in their corresponding metropolitan regions? Can greater suburban housing density also be part of the solution set?How can the existing housing stock be retrofitted to improve energy efficiency and eliminate reliance on fossil fuels, while at the same time ensuring that these efforts don't raise energy cost burdens or displace renters of color and low-income renters?How could federal climate disaster assistance programs be better designed to protect renters and people experiencing homelessness, while not losing sight of the need to address long-term housing inequities?Our new ""Housing + Climate"" research area explores these topics and contributes to efforts to better align housing and climate policies. We've already started: we have launched new research projects that will explore how California's housing policies can best advance its greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. We are working with a coalition of community-based and environmental justice groups to better understand what is needed to advance equitable housing decarbonization strategies. We're also looking at how federal Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund grants can be leveraged to fund retrofitting and decarbonization of affordable housing. In 2024, our sister nonprofit, Terner Labs, is launching a new Builders Lab initiative, which will provide an opportunity to incubate innovative construction techniques and identify strategies to overcome regulatory and other barriers to implementation.Neither the climate nor the housing crises are easy challenges to address: both are emblematic of ""wicked problems""6-complicated, evolving, and multiscalar-without simple answers but with high stakes if we get the answers wrong. Research can help guide necessary policies, but partnerships and collective action are similarly critical.We invite your input as we undertake this work.

The company achieved a solid balance sheet with a net leverage ratio of 0.9x. Positive Pampa Energía S.A. reported a 19% year-on-year sales decrease, reaching $362 million in Q4 23. The company's adjusted EBITDA in Q4 23 was $129 million, 30% lower than Q4 22. Pampa Energía recorded a $155 million loss attributable to shareholders in Q4 23. The company's net debt decreased to $613 million, the lowest in the last 5 years. Pampa Energía achieved a solid balance sheet with a net leverage ratio of 0.9x. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported 19% year-on-year decrease in sales for Pampa Energía, primarily driven by lower gas sales, thermal and petrochemicals dispatch, indicates a significant shift in the company's revenue streams. This decline in sales, coupled with a 30% drop in oil and gas, has contributed to a reduced Adjusted EBITDA, which is a crucial measure of a company's operating performance. The sharp depreciation of the Argentine peso has further diluted the inflation-adjusted results of affiliates like TGS and Transener, exacerbating the impact on the company's financials.Moreover, the substantial net debt reduction to the lowest level in five years is a positive signal to investors and creditors, as it suggests improved financial stability and debt management. The decrease in gross debt, aided by the dilution of AR$ denominated debt, alongside an increase in cash and cash equivalents, has led to a net leverage ratio of 0.9x. This ratio is indicative of the company's leverage and its ability to meet its debt obligations, which is a key metric for assessing financial health. The solid balance sheet positions Pampa Energía favorably for future operations and potential investments. Economist The Argentine peso's steep depreciation against the US dollar has had a pronounced effect on Pampa Energía's financial results. The devaluation impacts not only the local currency tax valuation but also the accounting valuation of property, plant and equipment (PPE), leading to a significant non-cash deferred income tax charge. This situation reflects the broader economic challenges faced by companies operating in volatile currency environments, where inflation and currency risk can distort financial outcomes.Furthermore, the 21% average inflation adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2023 for Transener and TGS has been insufficient to counteract the currency devaluation. This scenario underscores the importance of considering both inflation and foreign exchange risks when evaluating a company's performance and potential investment in emerging markets. It also highlights the complexities of operating in economies with high inflation rates, where financial results can be significantly affected by non-operational factors such as exchange rate movements. Market Research Analyst The energy sector is highly sensitive to fluctuations in commodity prices and economic conditions. Pampa Energía's performance, as reflected in the reported financial results, suggests a challenging environment for the energy market in Argentina. The decrease in sales across gas, thermal and petrochemicals dispatch points to a potential decline in demand or pricing pressures within these segments. This information is crucial for stakeholders to understand the market dynamics that are currently affecting the company's operations.Additionally, the noted improvements in power generation and petrochemicals, which partially offset the overall decrease in Adjusted EBITDA, indicate areas of resilience or strategic focus for the company. It is essential for investors to monitor these segments closely, as they could represent key growth areas for Pampa Energía moving forward, especially in light of the broader economic pressures. 03/06/2024 - 04:35 PM BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA / ACCESSWIRE / March 6, 2024 / Pampa Energía S.A. (NYSE:PAM)(Buenos Aires Stock Exchange:PAMP), an independent company with active participation in the Argentine electricity and gas value chain, announces the results for the fiscal year and quarter ended on December 31, 2023.Pampa's financial information adopts US$ as functional currency, converted into AR$ at transactional nominal exchange rate (‘FX'). However, our affiliates Transener and TGS's figures are adjusted for inflation as of December 31, 2023, and translated into US$ at the period's closing FX. The reported figures in US$ from previous periods remain unchanged.The impact of the local currency depreciationThe steep US$ quote increase from AR$350 to AR$808 on December 13, 2023, mainly affected the tax valuation as it reports under local currency. Despite being adjusted for inflation, it was diluted by the AR$ depreciation, temporarily diverging from the accounting valuation of PPE and accruing a non-cash deferred income tax. Regarding Transener and TGS, the 21% average inflation adjustment on the fourth quarter 2023 (‘Q4 23') flows failed to offset the AR$ devaluation.Q4 23 main results[1]19% year-on-year sales decrease, recording US$362 million[2] in Q4 23, explained by lower gas sales, thermal and petrochemicals dispatch.Operating performance highlighted by Ensenada Barragán Thermal Power Plant (‘CTEB')'s Combined Cycle (‘CCGT') and hydros: Adjusted EBITDA[3] reached US$129 million, 30% lower than Q4 22, explained by reductions of US$46 million in holding and others, as the sharp AR$ devaluation significantly diluted the adjusted by inflation results of TGS and Transener, and a 30% drop in oil and gas. These decreases were partially offset by improvements of 10% in power generation and 33% in petrochemicals.The income attributable to the Company's shareholders recorded a US$155 million loss, briefly explained before by lower sales and affiliates' equity income, in addition to US$151 million of higher non-cash deferred income tax charges due to the temporary lag between the accounting and tax valuation of PPE. It is worth noting that the accounting valuation is based on the US$ as functional currency, while the tax reporting is in AR$, which inflation adjustment was diluted by the sharp devaluation impact towards the end of Q4 23. Gains from holding financial securities partially offset these losses.Net debt decreased to US$613 million, reaching the lowest in the last 5 years. This substantial decrease was mainly explained by an interannual reduction of US$165 million in gross debt, due to principal cancellations and dilution of the AR$ debt. Moreover, a US$135 million increase in cash and cash equivalents was recorded, resulting in a net leverage ratio of 0.9x and accomplishing a solid balance sheet.Consolidated balance sheet(As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, in millions) Consolidated income statement(For the fiscal year and quarters ended on December 31, 2023 and 2022, in millions) Note: 1: It considers the Employee stock-based compensation plan shares, which amounted to 3.9 million common shares as of December 31, 2022 and 2023.For the full version of the Earnings Report, please visit Pampa's Investor Relations website: ri.pampaenergia.com/en.Information about the videoconferenceThere will be a videoconference to discuss Pampa's Q4 23 results on Thursday, March 7, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time/12:00 p.m. Buenos Aires Time.

QuidelOrtho Receives Health Canada Approval for Quidel® Triage® PLGF Test for Laboratory Use in Canada,2024-03-06T21:35:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,"QuidelOrtho Corporation (QDEL) receives Health Canada approval for Triage PLGF test, aiding in preterm pre-eclampsia diagnosis and delivery prognosis. The test detects angiogenic imbalance, crucial for maternal and fetal health, with fast results and reduced maternal adverse outcomes.","QuidelOrtho Receives Health Canada Approval for Quidel® Triage® PLGF Test for Laboratory Use in Canada Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary QuidelOrtho Corporation (QDEL) receives Health Canada approval for Triage PLGF test, aiding in preterm pre-eclampsia diagnosis and delivery prognosis. The test detects angiogenic imbalance, crucial for maternal and fetal health, with fast results and reduced maternal adverse outcomes. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recent approval of QuidelOrtho's Triage PLGF test by Health Canada represents a significant advancement in the field of maternal-fetal medicine. The ability to quantitatively determine placental growth factor levels provides clinicians with a critical tool for early detection and management of pre-eclampsia, a condition that can have severe consequences for both mother and child. The test's high accuracy and rapid results could lead to a decrease in adverse maternal outcomes by as much as 20%, as indicated by recent studies.From a medical research perspective, the Triage PLGF test's reliance on a single biomarker simplifies the diagnostic process compared to alternative approaches requiring multiple biomarkers. This simplification is likely to enhance its adoption in various healthcare settings, potentially leading to a standardized approach in the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia across Canada. Healthcare Economist The approval of the Triage PLGF test in Canada not only has clinical significance but also economic implications for the healthcare system. Pre-eclampsia is associated with considerable healthcare costs due to increased maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. By facilitating early diagnosis and potentially reducing the incidence of adverse outcomes by 20%, the test could lead to significant cost savings for the healthcare system.Moreover, the test's compatibility with the Triage MeterPro instrument, suitable for both urban and rural settings, may help in alleviating healthcare disparities by enabling access to advanced diagnostic tools in less-resourced areas. This could result in more equitable healthcare delivery and further economic benefits through the prevention of costly complications associated with pre-eclampsia. Market Research Analyst The introduction of the Triage PLGF test into the Canadian market may influence the competitive landscape of in vitro diagnostics. QuidelOrtho's test differentiates itself by providing quick and accurate results using a small footprint device, which could disrupt current practices that rely on larger laboratory analyzers. This strategic positioning allows QuidelOrtho to tap into a niche market segment that values rapid and reliable point-of-care testing solutions.Given the prevalence of pre-eclampsia in up to 5% of pregnancies in Canada, the demand for such diagnostic tests is substantial. The ability of the Triage PLGF test to integrate into existing clinical management guidelines and deliver results within 15 minutes presents a compelling value proposition to healthcare providers, potentially driving market adoption and growth for QuidelOrtho. 03/06/2024 - 04:35 PM Aiding in the diagnosis of preterm pre-eclampsia and prognosis of delivery in symptomatic women SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- QuidelOrtho Corporation (Nasdaq:QDEL) (“QuidelOrtho”), a global provider of innovative in vitro diagnostic technologies designed for point-of-care settings, clinical labs and transfusion medicine, has received approval from Health Canada for its Triage PLGF test for laboratory use in Canada. The Triage PLGF test is a fluorescence immunoassay to be used with the small footprint Triage MeterPro® Instrument for the quantitative determination of placental growth factor (“PLGF”) in maternal plasma specimens. The test is intended to detect the presence of angiogenic imbalance, a consequence of abnormal placentation and poor blood flow in the placenta, which can lead to maternal and fetal complications of pregnancy, including pre-eclampsia.1 Pre-eclampsia is a serious disorder that affects up to 5 percent of pregnancies in Canada.2 The Triage PLGF test is used with other clinical information to aid in the diagnosis of preterm pre-eclampsia and in the prognosis of short-term delivery in women presenting with signs and symptoms of pre-eclampsia after 20 weeks and prior to 35 weeks of gestation. Diagnosis of pre-eclampsia indicates delivery within 14 days.3 “When signs or symptoms of pre-eclampsia are present, it is critical to the health and safety of the mother and her unborn baby that clinicians have the information necessary to determine the optimal course of action to achieve the best possible outcome for the pregnancy,” said Bernard Michaud, Country Director, Canada at QuidelOrtho. “The Triage PLGF test is intended to help clinicians diagnose pre-eclampsia sooner and may provide them with information on whether the pregnancy is likely to deteriorate within the next 14 days, allowing for a better patient care management plan.” Angiogenic imbalance plays a central role in the pathophysiology of preterm pre-eclampsia and places the pregnancy at risk for maternal complications, like HELLP syndrome and eclampsia, and fetal complications, like prematurity and stillbirth. With the Triage PLGF test, clinicians can be positioned to better detect angiogenic imbalance and assess the risk for these complications. The Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada (SOGC) guidelines indicate the measurement of angiogenic markers, such as those detected by the Triage PLGF test, because of strong clinical evidence supporting their use to aid in the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia and prognosis for adverse pregnancy outcomes.4 The Triage PLGF test delivers results in approximately 15 minutes and provides high accuracy to support the clinical diagnosis of pre-eclampsia needing delivery within 14 days. When integrated into a clinical management guideline, the Triage PLGF test can lead to faster diagnosis and a 20% reduction in maternal adverse outcomes.5 The Triage PLGF test is unique because it measures a single biomarker on the Triage MeterPro instrument, unlike other tests which require two biomarkers measured on a larger-footprint laboratory analyzer. The Triage PLGF test is available to customers in Canada for use with the Triage MeterPro instrument. The Triage MeterPro instrument is easy to use with robust quality control and would be suitable for urban and rural laboratory settings, delivering Triage PLGF test results quickly. Resources: 1.

The debt-to-equity ratio of 5.4:1, adjusted to 5.3:1, is also noteworthy as it reflects the company's financial leverage and risk profile. A lower ratio, as seen from the previous quarter's 7.3:1, suggests a reduction in leverage and possibly a more conservative capital structure.The dividend yield of 16.0% based on the closing stock price is exceptionally high, which may be attractive to income-focused investors but could also raise concerns about the sustainability of such payouts. The expansion of the CLO portfolio to $17.4 million demonstrates a strategic shift in the company's investment focus, which could have implications for future earnings and risk diversification. Market Research Analyst The reported quarter end results reflect a strategic rotation from RMBS to CLOs, indicating a shift in investment strategy that could affect the company's risk profile and return potential. The Agency RMBS portfolio turnover of 25% suggests active portfolio management, which could be a response to the volatile interest rate environment experienced in the quarter. The outperformance of Agency RMBS, especially in lower and intermediate coupons, compared to U.S. Treasuries and interest rate swaps, highlights a potentially favorable market condition for EARN's portfolio concentration.Moreover, the mention of FDIC's intervention in the Agency MBS market signifies a notable event that could have broader implications for the mortgage REIT industry. The economic 'soft landing' narrative and the anticipation of interest rate cuts create an uncertain yet opportunistic environment for investors in mortgage-related securities. The expectation of performance dispersion in the CLO market suggests that there may be differentiated returns within the sector, which could benefit firms with strong selection capabilities like EARN. Economist The broader economic context, including the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes and the subsequent market anticipation of a rate cut cycle, plays a significant role in the performance of mortgage REITs like EARN. The yield spread volatility experienced during the quarter, with widening and subsequent tightening, indicates a dynamic interest rate environment that impacts the pricing and attractiveness of mortgage-backed securities. The performance of EARN's Agency RMBS and CLO portfolios during this period reflects the company's ability to navigate such economic conditions.The reported growth in the CLO portfolio and the strategic capital allocation shift towards it suggest an adaptive response to the changing economic landscape. The economic 'soft landing' narrative, if it materializes, could stabilize market conditions and support the performance of credit assets. However, the uncertainty around the timing of future interest rate cuts poses a risk that could affect investment strategies and market valuations in the short to medium term. 03/06/2024 - 04:35 PM OLD GREENWICH, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ellington Residential Mortgage REIT (NYSE: EARN) (""we"", ""us,"" or ""our"") today reported financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. Highlights Net income (loss) of $12.4 million, or $0.75 per share. Adjusted Distributable Earnings1 of $4.6 million, or $0.27 per share. Book value of $7.32 per share as of December 31, 2023, which includes the effects of dividends of $0.24 per share for the quarter. Net interest margin2 of 2.02% on Agency, 6.28% on credit, and 2.19% overall. Weighted average constant prepayment rate (""CPR"") for the fixed-rate Agency specified pool portfolio of 6.83. Net mortgage assets-to-equity ratio of 6.5:14 as of December 31, 2023. CLO portfolio grew to $17.4 million as of December 31, 2023. Capital allocation5 as of December 31, 2023: 89% mortgage-related securities, 11% corporate CLOs. Dividend yield of 16.0% based on the March 5, 2024 closing stock price of $5.99, and monthly dividend of $0.08 per common share declared on February 7, 2024. Debt-to-equity ratio of 5.4:1 as of December 31, 2023; adjusted for unsettled purchases and sales, the debt-to-equity ratio as of December 31, 2023 was 5.3:1. Cash and cash equivalents of $38.5 million as of December 31, 2023, in addition to other unencumbered assets of $22.9 million. Fourth Quarter 2023 Results ""During the fourth quarter, Ellington Residential generated net income of $0.75 per share and a non-annualized economic return of 7.7%, while Adjusted Distributable Earnings grew to $0.27 per share and more than covered our dividend,"" said Laurence Penn, Chief Executive Officer and President. ""During the market selloff in October, we avoided forced asset sales and preserved our earnings power, which enabled us to fully participate in the subsequent market recovery. ""After a tumultuous start to the fourth quarter, which saw U.S. Treasury yields rise to 15-year highs and yield spreads widen sharply, markets subsequently rallied through year end in anticipation of the conclusion of the Federal Reserve’s hiking cycle. Overall for the quarter, Agency RMBS—especially lower and intermediate coupons where EARN's portfolio was concentrated—generally outperformed interest rate swaps and U.S. Treasury securities, which are our primary hedging instruments. ""In the corporate CLO market, after experiencing similar widening in October, credit spreads tightened through year end with an economic 'soft landing' narrative permeating the market. EARN's growing CLO portfolio also generated strong returns during the quarter. Our CLO portfolio grew by $13.6 million during the fourth quarter, as we continued to rotate more of our investment capital from RMBS to CLOs. This portfolio rotation has also contributed to our lower overall leverage ratios given that we employ much less leverage on our CLO investments. Including investment activity following quarter end, our CLO portfolio now stands at approximately $30 million. ""In a year of elevated interest rate and yield spread volatility that saw the FDIC seize and then sell $60+ billion of Agency MBS, Agency RMBS ended 2023 on a high note and actually outperformed U.S. Treasuries and interest rate swaps on a duration-adjusted basis for the year. Now, with markets expecting eventual interest rate cuts from here but yield spreads still wide on an historical basis, Agency RMBS is attracting incremental demand from investors, albeit tempered by uncertainty around the timing of future cuts. For CLOs, despite their strong finish to 2023, some subsectors have actually lagged the broader corporate bond rally and so should have further room to appreciate. We also expect performance dispersion in the CLO market to persist in 2024, which should continue to create investment opportunities for EARN."" ____________________ 1 Adjusted Distributable Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure. See ""Reconciliation of Adjusted Distributable Earnings to Net Income (Loss)"" below for an explanation regarding the calculation of Adjusted Distributable Earnings. 2 Net interest margin of a group of assets represents the weighted average asset yield less the weighted average cost of borrowings secured by those assets (including the effect of net interest income (expense) related to U.S. Treasury securities and actual and accrued payments on interest rate swaps used to hedge such borrowings); net interest margin excludes the effect of the Catch-up Amortization Adjustment. 3 Excludes recent purchases of fixed rate Agency specified pools with no prepayment history. 4 We define our net mortgage assets-to-equity ratio as the net aggregate market value of our mortgage-backed securities (including the underlying market values of our long and short TBA positions) divided by shareholder's equity attributable to our mortgage-related strategies. As of December 31, 2023 the market value of our mortgage-backed securities and our net long TBA position was $756.1 million and $36.7 million, respectively, and shareholders' equity attributable to our mortgage related strategies was $121.8 million. 5 Percentages shown are of net assets, as opposed to gross assets, deployed in each strategy.

(2) Expressed as a percentage of current principal balance. (3) Excludes IOs. The size of our Agency RMBS holdings decreased by 8% to $728.0 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $790.5 million as of September 30, 2023, as net sales and paydowns exceeded net gains. Similarly, our aggregate holdings of interest-only securities and non-Agency RMBS decreased by 13% during the quarter. Over the same period, we continued to rotate investment capital to CLOs, increasing our CLO holdings more than fourfold to $17.4 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $3.8 million as of September 30, 2023. Our Agency RMBS portfolio turnover was 25% for the quarter. Our debt-to-equity ratio, adjusted for unsettled purchases and sales, decreased to 5.3:1 as of December 31, 2023, as compared to 7.3:1 as of September 30, 2023. The decline was primarily due to a decrease in borrowings on our smaller Agency RMBS portfolio and significantly higher shareholders' equity, partially offset by a small increase in borrowings on our CLO portfolio. Similarly, our net mortgage assets-to-equity ratio decreased to 6.5:1 from 7.2:1 over the same time period, despite having a net long TBA position as of December 31, 2023 as compared to a net short TBA position as of September 30, 2023. In October, interest rates and volatility increased, which drove yield spreads wider in most fixed income sectors, including Agency RMBS. Markets then reversed course, however, with interest rates and volatility declining, and yield spreads tightening, through year end. Overall for the fourth quarter, Agency RMBS outperformed U.S. Treasury securities and interest rate swaps, with lower and intermediate coupon RMBS exhibiting the most pronounced outperformance. As a result, net gains on our Agency RMBS (which were concentrated in those coupons) and positive net interest income significantly exceeded net losses on our hedges, driving strong performance from our Agency RMBS portfolio for the quarter. Average pay-ups on our specified pool portfolio decreased slightly to 1.01% as of December 31, 2023, as compared to 1.02% as of September 30, 2023. During the quarter, we continued to hedge interest rate risk, primarily through the use of interest rate swaps. We ended the quarter with a net long TBA position on a notional basis, but a net short TBA position as measured by 10-year equivalents. We may also selectively hedge our corporate CLO and/or non-Agency RMBS investments; as of December 31, 2023, we had a small credit hedge position in place. Our larger corporate CLO portfolio also contributed positively to our quarterly results, driven by net interest income and net gains to our quarterly results. Similar to Agency RMBS, yield spreads on most CLOs widened in October before tightening in November and December, and finished the quarter tighter overall. Additionally, our non-Agency RMBS portfolio and interest-only securities also generated positive results for the quarter, driven by net interest income and net gains, as yield spreads followed a similar pattern during the quarter. We intend to continue increasing our allocation to corporate CLOs and/or non-Agency RMBS based on market opportunities. The net interest margin on our Agency portfolio increased quarter over quarter, driven by higher asset yields and a lower cost of funds, as we continued to benefit from positive carry on our interest rate swaps where we receive a higher floating rate and pay a lower fixed rate. The net interest margin on our credit portfolio also increased, with our larger CLO holdings boosting our asset yields. The net interest margin (excluding the Catch-up Amortization Adjustment) on our Agency and credit portfolios increased to 2.02% and 6.28% in the fourth quarter, respectively, as compared to 1.26% and 4.55% in the prior quarter. Expanding net interest margins also drove a sequential increase in our Adjusted Distributable Earnings.

Reconciliation of Adjusted Distributable Earnings to Net Income (Loss) We calculate Adjusted Distributable Earnings as net income (loss), excluding realized and change in net unrealized gains and (losses) on securities and financial derivatives, and excluding other income or loss items that are of a non-recurring nature, if any. Adjusted Distributable Earnings includes net realized and change in net unrealized gains (losses) associated with periodic settlements on interest rate swaps. Adjusted Distributable Earnings also excludes the effect of the Catch-up Amortization Adjustment on interest income. The Catch-up Amortization Adjustment is a quarterly adjustment to premium amortization or discount accretion triggered by changes in actual and projected prepayments on our Agency RMBS (accompanied by a corresponding offsetting adjustment to realized and unrealized gains and losses). The adjustment is calculated as of the beginning of each quarter based on our then-current assumptions about cashflows and prepayments, and can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Adjusted Distributable Earnings is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted Distributable Earnings provides information useful to investors, because: (i) we believe that it is a useful indicator of both current and projected long-term financial performance, in that it excludes the impact of certain current-period earnings components that we believe are less useful in forecasting long-term performance and dividend-paying ability; (ii) we use it to evaluate the effective net yield provided by our portfolio, after the effects of financial leverage; and (iii), we believe that presenting Adjusted Distributable Earnings assists investors in measuring and evaluating our operating performance, and comparing our operating performance to that of our residential mortgage REIT peers. Our calculation of Adjusted Distributable Earnings may differ from the calculation of similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures by our peers, with the result that these non-GAAP financial measures might not be directly comparable; adjusted Distributable Earnings excludes certain items, such as most realized and unrealized gains and losses, that may impact the amount of cash that is actually available for distribution. In addition, because Adjusted Distributable Earnings is an incomplete measure of our financial results and differs from net income (loss) computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, it should be considered supplementary to, and not as a substitute for, net income (loss) computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Furthermore, Adjusted Distributable Earnings is different than REIT taxable income. As a result, the determination of whether we have met the requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income (subject to certain adjustments) to our shareholders, in order to maintain qualification as a REIT, is not based on whether we have distributed 90% of our Adjusted Distributable Earnings. In setting our dividends, our Board of Trustees considers our earnings, liquidity, financial condition, REIT distribution requirements, and financial covenants, along with other factors that the Board of Trustees may deem relevant from time to time. The following table reconciles, for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, our Adjusted Distributable Earnings to the line on our Consolidated Statement of Operations entitled Net Income (Loss), which we believe is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure: Three-Month Period Ended (In thousands except share amounts and per share amounts) December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 Net Income (Loss) $ 12,439 $ (11,420 ) Adjustments: Net realized (gains) losses on securities 11,825 19,572 Change in net unrealized (gains) losses on securities (50,930 ) 15,824 Net realized (gains) losses on financial derivatives (1,440 ) (1,152 ) Change in net unrealized (gains) losses on financial derivatives 27,109 (25,276 ) Net realized gains (losses) on periodic settlements of interest rate swaps 880 796 Change in net unrealized gains (losses) on accrued periodic settlements of interest rate swaps 5,228 4,913 Non-recurring expenses 13 28 Negative (positive) component of interest income represented by Catch-up Amortization Adjustment (566 ) (46 ) Subtotal (7,881 ) 14,659 Adjusted Distributable Earnings $ 4,558 $ 3,239 Weighted Average Shares Outstanding 16,662,407 15,199,837 Adjusted Distributable Earnings Per Share $ 0.27 $ 0.21 View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240306220877/en/ Investors: Ellington Residential Mortgage REIT Investor Relations (203) 409-3773 info@earnreit.com or Media: Amanda Shpiner/Sara Widmann Gasthalter & Co. for Ellington Residential Mortgage REIT (212) 257-4170 Ellington@gasthalter.com Source: Ellington Residential Mortgage REIT What was Ellington Residential Mortgage REIT's net income for Q4 2023?

The company aims to use the net proceeds to repurchase or repay its 2026 Notes, potentially impacting the market price of its common stock. Positive None. Negative Potential decrease in the market price of the company's common stock due to unwinding capped call transactions with respect to the 2026 Notes and related derivatives sales. The 2029 Notes and any shares issuable upon conversion have not been registered under securities laws, limiting their sale in the United States. Financial Analyst The issuance of $160 million in Convertible Senior Notes by Avid Bioservices represents a strategic financial move aimed at restructuring the company's debt profile. By opting to repurchase a portion of its 1.250% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2026, the company is likely trying to take advantage of current market conditions to lower its interest expenses or extend the maturity of its debt. This could potentially lead to an improvement in the company's leverage ratios and interest coverage metrics, which are important indicators of financial health that investors closely monitor.However, the market's reaction to such an offering can be mixed. While it might signal confidence from management in the company's future cash flows, it also dilutes existing shareholders if the notes are converted into equity. Additionally, the unwinding of capped call transactions could lead to short-term volatility in the stock price as counterparties adjust their positions. Investors should weigh the potential benefits of improved financial flexibility against the risks of dilution and market volatility. Legal Expert The offering of Convertible Senior Notes in a private placement is a nuanced legal process governed by the Securities Act of 1933. Avid Bioservices is targeting qualified institutional buyers, which allows them to bypass the more rigorous public registration requirements. This can expedite the capital raising process but also limits the pool of potential investors, as the notes cannot be sold to the general public without registration or an applicable exemption.The mention of the notes not being registered under the Securities Act highlights the regulatory landscape companies must navigate when issuing securities. The legal stipulations and exemptions involved, such as those under Section 4(a)(2), are critical to ensure compliance and avoid sanctions or legal disputes that could negatively impact the company and its stakeholders. Market Research Analyst The biologics contract development and manufacturing sector is highly capital-intensive, requiring significant investment in technology, facilities and expertise. Avid Bioservices' decision to issue convertible notes may reflect underlying industry trends where companies are seeking to bolster their capital structures to fund growth initiatives or technology upgrades. It is important for stakeholders to consider the competitive landscape and the potential for this capital to be used in ways that enhance the company's service offerings or operational efficiency.Moreover, the potential repurchase or repayment of the existing 2026 Notes could be a strategic move to manage investor expectations and signal financial prudence. The impact of such financial maneuvers on the company's stock price and market perception should be monitored closely, as they can influence investor confidence and the company's ability to raise capital in the future. 03/06/2024 - 04:32 PM TUSTIN, Calif., March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Avid Bioservices, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDMO), a dedicated biologics contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO), announced today that it intends to offer, subject to market conditions and other factors, $160 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes”) in a private placement (the “Offering”) to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The company expects to price the Offering before open of market on March 7, 2024. The 2029 Notes will represent senior unsecured obligations of the company and will accrue interest payable semiannually in arrears. Upon conversion, the company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at its election. The interest rate, initial conversion rate and other terms of the notes will be determined at the time of pricing of the Offering. The company expects to use the net proceeds from the Offering (i) to repurchase for cash a portion of its 1.250% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) in privately negotiated transactions from certain noteholders and (ii) to the extent there are 2026 Notes outstanding after such repurchase, to repay in full any remaining outstanding 2026 Notes by depositing the required payoff amount with the trustee under the indenture of the 2026 Notes. In connection with the repurchase or repayment of the 2026 Notes, the company expects to unwind its capped call transactions with respect to the 2026 Notes with the applicable counterparties. In connection with any such termination, the company expects the counterparties to such capped call transactions and/or their respective affiliates will unwind various derivatives with respect to the company’s common stock and/or sell shares of the company’s common stock concurrently with such termination. This activity could decrease the market price of the company’s common stock at that time. The 2029 Notes and any shares of the company’s common stock issuable upon conversion of the 2029 Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, any state securities laws or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and other applicable securities laws. This press release is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any of these securities nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification thereof under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction. Further, this press release is not an offer to repurchase the 2026 Notes. As described in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the company on March 6, 2024, all of the 2026 Notes have been accelerated and became due and payable pursuant to an acceleration notice the company received from a holder of the 2026 Notes on February 29, 2024.

The forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those related to market and other conditions; the risk that the conditions to the closing of the proposed offering are not satisfied; and other risks and uncertainties that are described in the Risk Factors section of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023, as well as any updates to these risk factors filed from time to time in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Positive Record revenues of $572.9 million, up 18% from the previous year. Services revenues increased by 20% to $520.9 million. Cash provided by operating activities rose to $207.7 million. Income from operations reached $142.8 million, a 10% increase. Net income grew by 13% to $115.9 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 15% to $247.5 million. Negative None. Financial Analyst The Descartes Systems Group's announcement of its fiscal 2024 financial results indicates a robust performance with revenues increasing by 18% year-over-year and a 10% increase in income from operations. This growth trajectory is particularly impressive considering the global trade challenges cited by the CEO, including military conflicts and disruptions to shipping routes. The company's strategic focus on its Global Logistics Network appears to be paying dividends, as evidenced by the increased trust and business from their customers.From a financial perspective, the increase in cash provided by operating activities and earnings per share are positive indicators of the company's operational efficiency and profitability. However, the slight decline in net income as a percentage of revenues suggests a need to monitor cost management and margin pressures. Additionally, the adjusted EBITDA growth and consistent margin reflect a strong underlying business model with the potential for scalable growth.Investors might view the company's cash position, with a $41.4 million increase in Q4FY24, as a sign of financial health and potential for future investments or shareholder returns. The detailed breakdown of revenues and the emphasis on services revenue highlights the company's revenue mix and potential reliance on recurring revenue streams, which is often a key metric for stability and growth projections in the technology sector. Market Research Analyst Descartes' financial results reflect broader trends in the logistics and supply chain management industry, where companies are increasingly seeking technological solutions to navigate complex global trade environments. The growth in services revenues suggests that Descartes is successfully capturing market demand for its logistics and supply chain solutions. This is likely driven by the need for enhanced visibility, compliance and efficiency among shippers, carriers and logistics service providers.The company's ability to grow its customer base and increase revenues despite the ongoing global challenges is a testament to the resilience and adaptability of its business model. With a significant percentage of revenue coming from services, Descartes is well-positioned to benefit from the recurring revenue model, which provides a more predictable revenue stream and can lead to higher valuations in the stock market.It is important to note that the logistics and supply chain management software market is highly competitive, with players ranging from startups to established enterprise software giants. Descartes' continued investment in its Global Logistics Network, as indicated by the CEO, will be crucial in maintaining its competitive edge and fostering customer loyalty in the long term. Economist The financial results of Descartes Systems Group can be seen as a microcosm of the broader economic trends affecting global trade and logistics. The reported revenue growth amidst global trade challenges indicates that the company is leveraging economic headwinds to its advantage, possibly through increased demand for logistics solutions in turbulent times.The 18% revenue growth is particularly notable in the context of ongoing global supply chain disruptions, which have forced companies to re-evaluate and often invest more in their logistics operations. This suggests that Descartes' services are not only in high demand but may also be somewhat insulated from broader economic downturns due to the essential nature of supply chain and logistics operations.Moreover, the company's solid cash position and the increase in cash flows from operating activities give it a buffer against potential economic shocks and provide the means for strategic investments or acquisitions to spur further growth. This financial stability is crucial in an environment where many businesses are facing liquidity challenges. 03/06/2024 - 05:00 PM Record Revenues and Income from Operations WATERLOO, Ontario and ATLANTA, March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Descartes Systems Group Inc. (TSX:DSG) (Nasdaq:DSGX) announced its financial results for its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (Q4FY24) and year (FY24) ended January 31, 2024. All financial results referenced are in United States (US) currency and, unless otherwise indicated, are determined in accordance with US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). “Global trade continues to be impacted by military conflicts, disruptions to major shipping routes and a growing list of sanctions from various governments around the world,” said Edward J. Ryan, Descartes’ CEO. “Our Global Logistics Network is designed to help shippers, carriers and logistics services providers adapt their supply chains to efficiently manage the lifecycle of shipments in this increasingly dynamic landscape. As a result, our customers are trusting us with more of their business which puts us in a strong financial position to continue to invest in our business.” FY24 Financial Results As described in more detail below, key financial highlights for Descartes’ FY24 included: Revenues of $572.9 million, up 18% from $486.0 million in the same period a year ago (FY23);Revenues were comprised of services revenues of $520.9 million (91% of total revenues), professional services and other revenues of $46.7 million (8% of total revenues) and license revenues of $5.3 million (1% of total revenues). Services revenues were up 20% from $435.7 million in FY23;Cash provided by operating activities of $207.7 million, up 8% from $192.4 million in FY23. Cash provided by operating activities was negatively impacted by $12.6 million in FY24 and $5.6 million FY23 related to contingent consideration payments due to better-than-expected performance from recent acquisitions;Income from operations of $142.8 million, up 10% from $130.4 million in FY23;Net income of $115.9 million, up 13% from $102.2 million in FY23. Net income as a percentage of revenues was 20%, compared to 21% in FY23;Earnings per share on a diluted basis of $1.34, up 14% from $1.18 in FY23; andAdjusted EBITDA of $247.5 million, up 15% from $215.2 million in FY23. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues was 43%, compared to 44% in FY23. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues are non-GAAP financial measures provided as a complement to financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation (for which we include related fees and taxes) and other charges (for which we include restructuring charges, acquisition-related expenses, and contingent consideration incurred due to better-than-expected performance from acquisitions). These items are considered by management to be outside Descartes' ongoing operational results. We define Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues as the quotient, expressed as a percentage, from dividing Adjusted EBITDA for a period by revenues for the corresponding period. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues to net income determined in accordance with GAAP is provided later in this release.

Descartes Investor Contact Laurie McCauley (519) 746-2969investor@descartes.com Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This release may contain forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws (""forward-looking statements"") that relates to Descartes' expectations concerning future revenues and earnings, and our projections for any future reductions in expenses or growth in margins and generation of cash; our assessment of the potential impact of geopolitical events, such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine (the “Russia-Ukraine Conflict”), and between Israel and Hamas (“Israel-Hamas Conflict”), or other potentially catastrophic events, such as the COVID-19 virus (the ""Pandemic"") on our business, results of operations and financial condition; continued growth and acquisitions including our assessment of any increased opportunity for our products and services as a result of trends in the logistics and supply chain industries; rate of profitable growth and Adjusted EBITDA margin operating range; demand for Descartes' solutions; growth of Descartes' Global Logistics Network (“GLN”); customer buying patterns; customer expectations of Descartes; development of the GLN and the benefits thereof to customers; and other matters. These forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions including the following: global shipment volumes continuing at levels generally consistent with those experienced historically; the Russia-Ukraine Conflict, Israel-Hamas Conflict and the Pandemic not having a material negative impact on shipment volumes or on the demand for the products and services of Descartes by its customers and the ability of those customers to continue to pay for those products and services; countries continuing to implement and enforce existing and additional customs and security regulations relating to the provision of electronic information for imports and exports; countries continuing to implement and enforce existing and additional trade restrictions and sanctioned party lists with respect to doing business with certain countries, organizations, entities and individuals; Descartes' continued operation of a secure and reliable business network; the stability of general economic and market conditions, currency exchange rates, and interest rates; equity and debt markets continuing to provide Descartes with access to capital; Descartes' continued ability to identify and source attractive and executable business combination opportunities; Descartes' ability to develop solutions that keep pace with the continuing changes in technology, and our continued compliance with third party intellectual property rights. These assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Descartes, or developments in Descartes' business or industry, to differ materially from the anticipated results, performance or achievements or developments expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, Descartes' ability to successfully identify and execute on acquisitions and to integrate acquired businesses and assets, and to predict expenses associated with and revenues from acquisitions; the impact of network failures, information security breaches or other cyber-security threats; disruptions in the movement of freight and a decline in shipment volumes including as a result of contagious illness outbreaks; a deterioration of general economic conditions or instability in the financial markets accompanied by a decrease in spending by our customers; the ability to attract and retain key personnel and the ability to manage the departure of key personnel and the transition of our executive management team; changes in trade or transportation regulations that currently require customers to use services such as those offered by Descartes; changes in customer behaviour and expectations; Descartes’ ability to successfully design and develop enhancements to our products and solutions; departures of key customers; the impact of foreign currency exchange rates; Descartes' ability to retain or obtain sufficient capital in addition to its debt facility to execute on its business strategy, including its acquisition strategy; disruptions in the movement of freight; the potential for future goodwill or intangible asset impairment as a result of other-than-temporary decreases in Descartes' market capitalization; and other factors and assumptions discussed in the section entitled, ""Certain Factors That May Affect Future Results"" in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Ontario Securities Commission and other securities commissions across Canada, including Descartes' most recently filed Management's Discussion and Analysis. If any such risks actually occur, they could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In that case, the trading price of our common shares could decline, perhaps materially. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Forward-looking statements are provided for the purpose of providing information about management's current expectations and plans relating to the future. Readers are cautioned that such information may not be appropriate for other purposes. We do not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in our expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except as required by law. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues We prepare and release quarterly unaudited and annual audited financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. We also disclose and discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, used to evaluate our performance, in this and other earnings releases and investor conference calls as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. We believe that current shareholders and potential investors in our company use non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues, in making investment decisions about our company and measuring our operational results. The term “Adjusted EBITDA” refers to a financial measure that we define as earnings before certain charges that management considers to be non-operating expenses and which consist of interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation (for which we include related fees and taxes) and other charges (for which we include restructuring charges, acquisition-related expenses, and contingent consideration incurred due to better-than-expected performance from acquisitions). Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues divides Adjusted EBITDA for a period by the revenues for the corresponding period and expresses the quotient as a percentage. Management considers these non-operating expenses to be outside the scope of Descartes’ ongoing operations and the related expenses are not used by management to measure operations. Accordingly, these expenses are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, which we reference to both measure our operations and as a basis of comparison of our operations from period-to-period. Management believes that investors and financial analysts measure our business on the same basis, and we are providing the Adjusted EBITDA financial metric to assist in this evaluation and to provide a higher level of transparency into how we measure our own business. However, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues are non-GAAP financial measures and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues should not be construed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with GAAP or other non-GAAP measures that may be used by other companies, such as EBITDA. The use of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues does have limitations. In particular, we have completed six acquisitions since the beginning of fiscal 2023 and may complete additional acquisitions in the future that will result in acquisition-related expenses and restructuring charges. As these acquisition-related expenses and restructuring charges may continue as we pursue our consolidation strategy, some investors may consider these charges and expenses as a recurring part of operations rather than expenses that are not part of operations.

CEO Casey Hoyt highlights sustained profitability, robust growth, and free cash flow generation. Conference call scheduled for March 7, 2024, to discuss Q4 and year-end results. Negative None. Financial Analyst The significant growth in net revenues and net income reported by Viemed Healthcare indicates a robust performance for the fiscal year. A 35% increase in quarterly revenue and a 65% increase in annual net income are substantial, especially considering the broader healthcare industry's average growth rate. This suggests that Viemed is outperforming many of its peers and capitalizing on market opportunities more effectively.The company's ability to generate free cash flow is particularly noteworthy, as it increased by 294% year-over-year. This financial metric is crucial as it indicates the company's liquidity and ability to reinvest in its operations, pay dividends, or reduce debt. The management's strategic initiatives seem to be yielding tangible results, reflected in the company's substantial cash flow improvements.However, the increase in long-term debt to $6.0 million, from no long-term debt previously, warrants attention. While the company ended the year with no net debt, stakeholders should monitor the company's leverage and interest coverage ratios to ensure long-term financial stability. The acquisition made during the year could be a strategic move to enhance the company's market position, but the long-term impact on the balance sheet and profitability should be evaluated. Market Research Analyst Viemed's operational performance has implications for its competitive positioning within the respiratory care and home medical equipment sector. The company's record-breaking revenue growth suggests successful market penetration and customer retention strategies. Moreover, the assumption of no extension for the 75/25 blended Medicare reimbursement rate adjustment indicates that Viemed is not heavily reliant on this particular policy for its revenue projections, which could be seen as a strength in an environment where healthcare reimbursement policies are subject to change.Investors and market analysts should consider the broader industry trends, such as the increasing demand for home healthcare services and technology-enabled solutions. Viemed's focus on these areas could provide it with a competitive edge and make it a potentially attractive investment in a growing market segment. Healthcare Industry Analyst The financial results of Viemed Healthcare reflect a successful adaptation to the evolving healthcare landscape, where there is a growing emphasis on home-based care and technology integration. The company's performance is indicative of effective operational management and a strong market demand for its services. The importance of respiratory care has been highlighted in recent years, partly due to the global health crisis and Viemed's ability to capitalize on this trend is evident in its financial outcomes.It's also important to consider the implications of the company's financial health for its ability to invest in innovation and technology, which are critical for maintaining a competitive edge in the healthcare industry. Viemed's strong financial position could enable it to continue investing in new technologies and services that improve patient outcomes and operational efficiency. 03/06/2024 - 05:00 PM LAFAYETTE, La., March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Viemed Healthcare, Inc.

All statements other than statements of historical fact, including those that express, or involve discussions as to, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance, including the Company's net revenue guidance for the first quarter, are not historical facts and may be forward-looking statements and may involve estimates, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect the Company's current views and intentions with respect to future events, and current information available to the Company, and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Many factors could cause the actual results, performance or achievements that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements to vary from those described herein should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize. These factors include, without limitation: the general business, market and economic conditions in the regions in which the Company operates; significant capital requirements and operating risks that the Company may be subject to; the ability of the Company to implement business strategies and pursue business opportunities; volatility in the market price of the Company's common shares; the state of the capital markets; the availability of funds and resources to pursue operations; inflation; reductions in reimbursement rates and audits of reimbursement claims by various governmental and private payor entities; dependence on few payors; possible new drug discoveries; dependence on key suppliers; granting of permits and licenses in a highly regulated business; competition; disruptions in or attacks (including cyber-attacks) on the Company's information technology, internet, network access or other voice or data communications systems or services; the evolution of various types of fraud or other criminal behavior to which the Company is exposed; difficulty integrating newly acquired businesses; the impact of new and changes to, or application of, current laws and regulations; the overall difficult litigation and regulatory environment; increased competition; increased funding costs and market volatility due to market illiquidity and competition for funding; critical accounting estimates and changes to accounting standards, policies, and methods used by the Company; the Company’s status as an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company; and the occurrence of natural and unnatural catastrophic events or health epidemics or concerns, and claims resulting from such events or concerns; as well as those risk factors discussed or referred to in the Company’s disclosure documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov, including the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, and with the securities regulatory authorities in certain provinces of Canada available at www.sedar.com. Should any factor affect the Company in an unexpected manner, or should assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements prove incorrect, the actual results or events may differ materially from the results or events predicted. Any such forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. Moreover, the Company does not assume responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included in this press release are made as of the date of this press release and the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, other than as required by applicable law. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release refers to Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, which are financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""GAAP""). Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA provides helpful information with respect to the Company’s operating performance as viewed by management, including a view of the Company’s business that is not dependent on the impact of the Company’s capitalization structure and items that are not part of the Company’s day-to-day operations. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA (i) to compare the Company’s operating performance on a consistent basis, (ii) to calculate incentive compensation for the Company’s employees, (iii) for planning purposes, including the preparation of the Company’s internal annual operating budget, and (iv) to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the Company’s operational strategies. Accordingly, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information in understanding and evaluating the Company’s operating performance in the same manner as management. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of the Company’s financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to revenue or net income, as applicable, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other businesses. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s operating results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters the Company considers not to be indicative of ongoing operations; and other companies in the Company’s industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. The Company uses Free Cash Flow in its operational and financial decision-making and believes free cash flow is useful to investors because similar measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors, ratings agencies and other interested parties to evaluate the Company's competitors and to measure the ability of companies to service their debt.

Production averaged 16.9 MBoed in 2023, reflecting a 10% increase in oil production year-over-year. Negative None. Financial Analyst Analyzing SandRidge Energy's financial results reveals a robust fiscal performance with a reported net income of $60.9 million and adjusted net income of $69.0 million for 2023. Notably, the company's free cash flow of approximately $89.2 million and a high conversion rate of roughly 96% relative to adjusted EBITDA are indicative of efficient operations and financial health. The declaration of a $0.11 per share cash dividend, representing a 10% increase, aligns with a shareholder-friendly capital return policy. However, investors should be cautious about the decrease in proved reserves, which dropped significantly due to lower commodity prices and production. This could signal future production challenges or a need for strategic acquisitions to bolster reserves. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, SandRidge's emphasis on production optimization and high-return drilling programs that led to a 10% increase in oil production year-over-year demonstrates the company's strategic focus on enhancing commodity realizations. This is particularly relevant as the energy sector remains volatile with fluctuating oil and gas prices. The company's operational focus on the Meramec formation and its successful optimization program are likely to be received positively by the market, potentially impacting the stock's attractiveness to investors seeking growth in the energy sector. Energy Sector Analyst Examining the operational updates, SandRidge's pivot towards projects with high rate of return thresholds and its disciplined capital expenditure guidance for 2024, which ranges from $8 to $11 million in production optimization capital, reflects a strategic approach to maintaining financial stability while pursuing growth. The company's commitment to ESG principles, including no routine flaring and efficient water transportation, aligns with industry trends towards sustainable practices. However, the decrease in proved reserves may raise concerns about the long-term sustainability of production levels, which could impact the company's operational outlook and valuation in the energy sector. 03/06/2024 - 04:31 PM OKLAHOMA CITY, March 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- SandRidge Energy, Inc.

The Company's adjusted net income(1) amounted to $69.0 million, or $1.87 per basic share, adjusted operating cash flow(1) totaled $103.5 million and adjusted EBITDA(1) was $93.2 million for the year. The Company defines and reconciles adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in supporting tables at the conclusion of this press release. For the fourth quarter 2023, the Company's net cash provided by operating activity was $26.2 million, and adjusted operating cash flow(1) totaled $22.2 million, with adjusted EBITDA of $19.5 million. Adjusted net income(1) amounted to $13.0 million, or $0.35 per basic share, after adjusting for certain items, including a $14.0 million deferred tax expense related to changes in the Company's valuation allowance, and net income of $1.8 million or $0.05 per basic share.

For the full year 2023, LOE was $41.9 million, or $6.80 per Boe compared to $41.3 million, or $6.39 per Boe in the prior year.

For the full year 2023, G&A was $10.7 million compared to $9.4 million, in the prior year, and Adjusted G&A(1) was $8.8 million, or $1.42 per Boe for the full year 2023 compared to $7.9 million or $1.22 per Boe in the prior year. Liquidity and Capital Structure As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $253.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash. Adjusting for the one-time dividend paid on February 20, 2024, our cash on hand balance was approximately $200 million. The Company has no outstanding term or revolving debt obligations. Dividend Program On March 5, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a $0.11 per share cash dividend payable on March 29, 2024 to shareholders of record on March 15, 2024. This declaration represents a 10% increase in SandRidge's previous on-going quarterly dividend and is consistent with plans announced on January 16, 2024 when the Board of Directors declared a one-time dividend of $1.50 per share, which was paid on February 20, 2024 with an aggregate total payout of $55.6 million. SandRidge's on-going $0.11 per share quarterly dividend is subject to quarterly approval by the Board of Directors. Since May 2023, the Company has paid approximately $137.1 million in cash dividends. Operational Results & Update Production Production totaled 1,473 MBoe (16.0 MBoed, 16% oil, 57% natural gas and 27% NGLs) for the fourth quarter and 6,152 MBoe (16.9 MBoed, 17% oil, 55% natural gas and 28% NGLs) for the full year of 2023. The higher oil content our recently-drilled wells targeting the Meramec formation in the Northwest Stack play versus the Company's base production was the primary driver of SandRidge's oil production increasing by approximately 10% in 2023 versus 2022. This increases the Company's oil as a percentage of total production and enhances its commodity realizations. Revenues totaled $33.9 million (53% oil, 22% natural gas and 25% NGLs) for the fourth quarter and $148.6 million (53% oil, 23% natural gas and 24% NGLs) for the full year of 2023. Production Optimization Program The Company continues to optimize its stable, low-decline production base, which has an estimated single-digit annual PDP decline rate over the next ten years. The Company continuously evaluates the potential for high-return projects that further enhance its asset base. Such projects include, but are not limited to, workovers, artificial lift improvements and conversions from less efficient systems, recompletions of ""behind pipe"" pay in vertical section of existing wells, and the restimulation of existing intervals and previously bypassed unstimulated intervals in existing wells. When evaluating these and other options, the Company continues to ensure that all projects meet high rate of return thresholds and remains capital disciplined as the commodity price landscape changes. Year End 2023 Estimated Proved Reserves Proved reserves decreased from 74.3 MMBoe at December 31, 2022 to 55.7 MMBoe at December 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in year-end SEC commodity prices for oil and natural gas, price realizations and NGL yield which resulted in a decrease of 17.5 MMBoe, as well as 6.2 MMBoe from the Company's production during 2023, 1.4 MMBoe attributable to well shut-ins and other revisions, and 0.1 MMBoe in sales. However, we also had positive revisions, which included purchases of 1.8 MMBoe, extensions of 1.2 MMBoe, 1.9 MMBoe associated with well positive performance revisions, and 1.7 MMBoe associated with other commercial improvements.

The Company also plans to spend $35 - $43 million in lease operating expenses. Total production for 2024 is projected to be 4.7 - 5.9 MMBoe. SandRidge will remain vigilant in ensuring prudent capital allocation and will continue to adapt appropriately to changing environments. Other operational guidance details can be found on the ""2024 Operational and Capital Expenditure Guidance"" table below. Outlook SandRidge will continue to focus on growing the cash value and generation capability of its asset base in a safe, responsible and efficient manner, while exercising prudent capital allocations to projects it believes provide high rates of returns in the current commodity price outlook. These near-term projects will be focused on artificial lift conversions to more efficient and cost-effective systems and other capital-efficient workovers while preserving future development and expanded well reactivations, benefited by our 99% held by production acreage position that extends the option value to initiate projects in favorable commodity price environments, to achieve high rates of return. The Company will continue to monitor forward-looking commodity prices, results, costs and other factors that could influence returns on investments, which will continue to shape its disciplined development decisions in 2024 and beyond. SandRidge will also continue to maintain the optionality to execute on value accretive merger and acquisition opportunities that could bring synergies, leverage the Company's core competencies, complement its portfolio of assets, seek to further utilize its approximately $1.6 billion of net operating losses (""NOLs""), or otherwise yield attractive returns for its shareholders. Environmental, Social, and Governance (""ESG"") SandRidge maintains its Environmental, Social, and Governance (""ESG"") commitment, to include no routine flaring of produced natural gas and transporting over 95% of its produced water via pipeline instead of truck. Additionally, SandRidge maintains an emphasis on the safety and training of our workforce. We have personnel dedicated to the close monitoring of our safety standards and daily operations.

(3) Equivalent Boe are calculated using an energy equivalent ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of oil. Using an energy-equivalent ratio does not factor in price differences and energy-equivalent prices may differ significantly among produced products. (4) The present value of estimated future cash inflows from proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, less future development and production costs and future income tax expenses and costs as of the date of estimation without future escalation and without giving effect to hedging activities, non-property related expenses such as general and administrative expenses, debt service and depreciation, depletion and amortization, discounted at 10% per annum to reflect timing of future cash flows and using the same pricing assumptions as were used to calculate PV-10. Standardized Measure differs from PV-10 because Standardized Measure includes the effect of future income taxes on future net revenues. (5) The present value of estimated future revenues to be generated from the production of proved reserves, before income taxes, calculated in accordance with SEC guidelines, net of estimated production and future development costs, using prices and costs as of the date of estimation without future escalation and without giving effect to hedging activities, non-property related expenses such as general and administrative expenses, debt service and depreciation, depletion and amortization. PV-10 is calculated using an annual discount rate of 10%. (6) Revisions include changes due to commodity prices, production costs, previous quantity estimates, and other commercial factors. Primary factor for revisions in years ended 2023, 2022 and 2021 were changes in SEC prices, among other factors. 2024 Operational and Capital Expenditure GuidancePresented below is the Company's operational and capital expenditure guidance for 2024: 2024 Guidance Production Oil (MMBbls) 0.7 - 0.9 Natural Gas Liquids (MMBbls) 1.3 - 1.7 Total Liquids (MMBbls) 2.0 - 2.6 Natural Gas (Bcf) 16.2 - 19.8 Total Production (MMBoe) 4.7 - 5.9 Total Capital Expenditures Non-D&C / Production Optimization $8 - $11 million Expenses Lease Operating Expenses (""LOE"") $35 - $43 million Adjusted General & Administrative (""G&A"") Expenses (1) $8 - $11 million Severance and Ad Valorem Taxes (% of Revenue) 6% - 7% Price Differentials Oil (% of WTI) 96% - 98% NGL (% of WTI) 25% - 30% Natural Gas (% of HH) 50% - 70% (1) Adjusted G&A expense is a non-GAAP financial measure.

These non-GAAP measures are not alternatives to GAAP measures, and you should not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Below is additional disclosure regarding each of the non-GAAP measures used in this press release, including reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP measure. Reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Adjusted Operating Cash Flow The Company defines Adjusted operating cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities as shown in the following table. Adjusted operating cash flow is a supplemental financial measure used by the Company's management and by securities analysts, investors, lenders, rating agencies and others who follow the industry as an indicator of the Company's ability to internally fund exploration and development activities or incur new debt. The Company also uses this measure because operating cash flow relates to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements that the Company may not control and may not relate to the period in which the operating activities occurred. Further, Adjusted operating cash flow allows the Company to compare its operating performance and return on capital with those of other companies without regard to financing methods and capital structure. This measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net cash provided by operating activities prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Free cash flow is a supplemental financial measure used by the Company's management and by securities analysts, investors, lenders, rating agencies and others who follow the industry as an indicator of the Company's ability to internally fund exploration and development activities or incur new debt. This measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net cash provided by operating or investing activities prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Adjusted EBITDA, as presented herein, is EBITDA excluding items that management believes affect the comparability of operating results such as items whose timing and/or amount cannot be reasonably estimated or are non-recurring, as shown in the following tables. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because management believes it provides useful additional information used by the Company's management and by securities analysts, investors, lenders, ratings agencies and others who follow the industry for analysis of the Company's financial and operating performance on a recurring basis and the Company's ability to internally fund exploration and development activities or incur new debt. In addition, management believes that adjusted EBITDA is widely used by professional research analysts and others in the valuation, comparison and investment recommendations of companies in the oil and gas industry. The Company's adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Management uses the supplemental measure of adjusted net income as an indicator of the Company's operational trends and performance relative to other oil and natural gas companies and believes it is more comparable to earnings estimates provided by securities analysts. Adjusted net income is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for net income available to common stockholders.

This non-GAAP measure allows for the analysis of general and administrative spend without regard to stock-based compensation programs and other non-recurring cash items, if any, which can vary significantly between companies. Adjusted G&A per Boe is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for general and administrative expense per Boe. Therefore, the Company's Adjusted G&A per Boe may not be comparable to other companies' similarly titled measures. The Company defines adjusted G&A as general and administrative expense adjusted for certain non-cash stock-based compensation and other non-recurring items, if any, as shown in the following tables: Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 $ $/Boe $ $/Boe (In thousands, except per Boe amounts) General and administrative $ 2,731 $ 1.85 $ 2,366 $ 1.48 Stock-based compensation (523) (0.36) (395) (0.25) Adjusted G&A $ 2,208 $ 1.49 $ 1,971 $ 1.23 Year Ended December 31, 2023 Year Ended December 31, 2022 $ $/Boe $ $/Boe (In thousands, except per Boe amounts) General and administrative $ 10,735 $ 1.74 $ 9,449 $ 1.46 Stock-based compensation (1,945) (0.32) (1,526) (0.24) Adjusted G&A $ 8,790 $ 1.42 $ 7,923 $ 1.22 Cautionary Note to Investors - This press release includes ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended., and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including, but not limited to, the information appearing under the heading ""2024 Operational and Capital Expenditure Guidance.""

The Issuer reserves the right to withdraw, terminate, extend, or amend the Offer and Consent Solicitation for any Series independently. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Barclays Bank PLC regarding the cash tender offers and consent solicitations for its exchange-traded notes (ETNs) is a strategic financial move that warrants a thorough analysis. The purchase price determination for each ETN series, based on a formula premium to the closing indicative note value, is a critical element for current note holders and potential investors. This premium represents an incentive for note holders to participate in the offer before the expiration deadline.From a financial perspective, the offer price above the market value could indicate Barclays' intention to restructure its debt or manage its ETN offerings more efficiently. It is essential to assess the liquidity position of Barclays and the potential impact on its balance sheet. The transaction could affect the bank's leverage ratios and interest expenses, depending on the volume of notes tendered and the premiums paid. Market participants should evaluate the implications for Barclays' credit risk profile and the broader ETN market.Furthermore, the independent nature of each series' offer suggests a targeted approach, possibly reflecting the varying market demand and risk associated with each underlying commodity. Investors should be aware of the nuances of commodity-linked ETNs and the factors influencing their indicative values, such as commodity price volatility and the creditworthiness of the issuer. Market Research Analyst The ETN tender offer by Barclays could signal broader market trends in the structured products space. Exchange-traded notes are debt instruments that track the performance of a market index or other benchmark and their appeal lies in their ability to provide exposure to non-traditional asset classes, such as commodities, without direct investment.Investors should consider the historical performance of the specific ETNs in question, the current market conditions for the commodities they track and the overall investor sentiment towards such financial products. The response to the tender offer might also reflect the market's valuation of these ETNs relative to their perceived risk and return profiles.It's also important to note the timing of the announcement and its alignment with market cycles. For example, if the commodities associated with these ETNs are expected to perform well, the premium offered might be attractive to investors looking to cash out at a perceived market high. Conversely, if the outlook is bearish, investors might view the tender offer as an opportunity to exit positions that may otherwise depreciate. Legal Expert The legal intricacies of the tender offers and consent solicitations are of paramount importance. The amendment of certain provisions of the notes, as proposed by Barclays, could have significant implications for the rights and obligations of the note holders. It is crucial to understand the specific amendments being proposed and their potential impact on the note holders' future cash flows and legal recourse.In addition, Barclays' conditional approach to each series, with the possibility of extension, termination, or amendment, introduces an element of uncertainty that must be factored into the decision-making process of investors. The adherence to applicable laws and regulations, including securities law and contractual obligations, is essential to ensure the legitimacy and smooth execution of the offers.Stakeholders should carefully review the Statement and any related documentation to fully grasp the legal ramifications. The transparency of the process and the communication of any changes will be critical in maintaining investor confidence and ensuring that the offers are conducted in a fair and equitable manner. 03/06/2024 - 04:32 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Barclays Bank PLC (the “Issuer”) announced today that it has determined the purchase price of each Formula Price Series (as defined below) in connection with its previously announced cash tender offers (each, an “Offer”) to purchase any and all of its outstanding exchange-traded notes (the “Notes” or the “ETNs”) of the twenty-four separate series (each, a “Series”) and the solicitation of consents (each, a “Consent Solicitation”) from holders of the Notes (the “Noteholders”) to amend certain provisions of the Notes with respect to each Series, subject to the conditions and restrictions set out in the Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement dated December 7, 2023 (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the “Statement”).

For further information about Barclays, please visit our website www.barclays.com. Selected Risk Considerations An investment in the ETNs described herein involves risks. Selected risks are summarized here, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks described under “Risk Factors” in the applicable prospectus supplement and pricing supplement. You May Lose Some or All of Your Principal: The ETNs are exposed to any change in the level of the underlying index or exchange rate, as applicable (the “index”) between the inception date and the applicable valuation date. Additionally, if the level of the index is insufficient to offset the negative effect of the investor fee and other applicable costs, you will lose some or all of your investment at maturity or upon redemption, even if the level of such index has increased or decreased, as the case may be. The ETNs are riskier than ordinary unsecured debt securities and have no principal protection. Credit of Barclays Bank PLC: The ETNs are unsecured debt obligations of Barclays Bank PLC and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of or guaranteed by any third party. Any payment to be made on the ETNs, including any payment at maturity or upon redemption, depends on the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC will affect the market value, if any, of the ETNs prior to maturity or redemption. In addition, if Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the ETNs. Market and Volatility Risk: The market value of the ETNs may be influenced by many unpredictable factors and may fluctuate between the date you purchase them and the maturity date or redemption date. You may also sustain a significant loss if you sell your ETNs in the secondary market. Factors that may influence the market value of the ETNs include prevailing market prices of the commodity markets, the U.S. stock markets or the U.S. Treasury market, the index components included in the underlying index, and prevailing market prices of options on such index or any other financial instruments related to such index; and supply and demand for the ETNs, including economic, financial, political, regulatory, geographical or judicial events that affect the level of such index or other financial instruments related to such index. Concentration Risk: Because the ETNs are linked to an index composed of futures contracts on a single commodity or in only one commodity sector, the ETNs are less diversified than other funds. The ETNs can therefore experience greater volatility than other funds or investments. A Trading Market for the ETNs May Not Develop: The ETNs are not listed on any securities exchange. A trading market for the ETNs may not develop and the liquidity of the ETNs may be limited. No Interest Payments from the ETNs: You may not receive any interest payments on the ETNs. Uncertain Tax Treatment: Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the ETNs are uncertain. You should consult your own tax advisor about your own tax situation. The ETNs may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage account. Commissions may apply and there are tax consequences in the event of sale, redemption or maturity of ETNs. Sales in the secondary market may result in significant losses. © 2024 Barclays Bank PLC. All rights reserved. iPath, iPath ETNs and the iPath logo are registered trademarks of Barclays Bank PLC.

Positive The company reported a decrease in revenues by 11% for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the same prior year period. Avid signed new orders totaling $41 million during the third quarter, resulting in a record high revenue backlog of $206 million. Gross profit margins decreased due to fewer manufacturing runs and increased costs related to capacity and technical expansions. SG&A expenses decreased by 10% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. Operating loss for the third quarter was $4.0 million, a decrease compared to the same period in the prior year. Avid completed its cell and gene therapy facility expansion, increasing its revenue generating capacity to approximately $400 million annually. Negative The decrease in revenues for the third quarter and nine months ended January 31, 2024 compared to the same prior year periods was primarily attributed to fewer manufacturing runs and a reduction in process development services from early-stage customers. Gross margins were impacted by changes in estimated variable consideration under a contract, a terminated project, and delays in recognizing revenues for a customer product. Operating loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was $17.4 million, a decrease compared to the same period in the prior year. Financial Analyst The revenue and earnings data released by Avid Bioservices indicate a notable decline in their year-over-year quarterly performance, with revenues decreasing by 11% from the previous year's same quarter. This is a significant metric for investors as it reflects the company's ability to maintain or grow its business. The reported increase in backlog to a record $206 million, however, suggests a potential for future revenue growth, which is a positive indicator for the company's long-term prospects. Additionally, the completion of the CGT facility expansion could be a strategic move to diversify and expand service offerings, potentially leading to increased market share and customer base in the high-growth cell and gene therapy sector.From a financial perspective, the gross margin contraction to 7% from 26% in the prior year's quarter is concerning as it may reflect increased costs or pricing pressures that could impact profitability. Investors will need to monitor whether this is a temporary fluctuation or indicative of a longer-term trend. The maintenance of revenue guidance despite the setbacks suggests management's confidence in the company's recovery and growth trajectory. However, the operating loss increase points to the need for careful expense management and operational efficiency improvements. Market Research Analyst The biologics CDMO industry is highly competitive and sensitive to technological advancements and capacity expansions. Avid Bioservices' completion of its CGT facility positions the company to capitalize on the burgeoning cell and gene therapy market. This strategic investment could be seen as a move to future-proof the company against industry shifts towards personalized medicine. The reported 33% increase in revenue compared to the previous quarter indicates a recovery trajectory, which is critical for investor confidence.However, the decrease in process development services from early-stage customers could signal a shift in the industry's development pipeline or a change in customer preferences, which may require strategic adjustments from Avid. The reduction in SG&A expenses reflects a prudent approach to cost management, which is essential in periods of revenue decline. An analysis of the competitive landscape and Avid's positioning within the industry would be crucial to understand the potential impact on the company's market share and future revenue streams. Biotech Industry Expert The biotech sector is known for its volatility and reliance on continuous innovation and pipeline development. Avid Bioservices' preliminary earnings report shows a decrease in manufacturing runs and process development services, which could be indicative of broader industry trends or company-specific challenges. The completion of the CGT facility is a significant milestone and reflects an industry-wide pivot towards advanced therapies. The expertise required to manufacture these therapies is substantial and Avid's expanded capacity may provide a competitive advantage in attracting partnerships with biotech firms focusing on CGT.The ability to maintain a high revenue backlog is a positive sign of client trust and demand for Avid's services. However, the reported decrease in gross profit and operating losses raises questions about the company's cost structure and operational efficiencies. Investors and industry stakeholders will be interested in how Avid plans to optimize its expanded capabilities to improve profitability and how it will navigate the competitive landscape of contract development and manufacturing in the biotech sector. 03/06/2024 - 04:31 PM TUSTIN, Calif., March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Avid Bioservices, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDMO), a dedicated biologics contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) working to improve patient lives by providing high quality development and manufacturing services to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, today announced preliminary earnings estimates for the third quarter and nine months ended January 31, 2024. The company expects results in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 to include: Revenues & Backlog Revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 were $33.8 million, representing an 11% decrease as compared to revenues of $38.0 million recorded in the same prior year period and a 33% increase as compared to revenues of $25.4 million recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. For the first nine months of fiscal 2024, revenues were $96.9 million, a decrease of approximately 11% compared to $109.5 million in the same prior year period. The decrease in revenues for the third quarter and nine months ended January 31, 2024 compared to the same prior year periods was primarily attributed to fewer manufacturing runs and a reduction in process development services from early-stage customers. Additionally, the first nine months revenues were also impacted by a reduction of revenue for changes in estimated variable consideration under a contract where uncertainties have been resolved.The company’s commercial team signed multiple new orders during the third quarter of fiscal 2024, totaling approximately $41 million net, and resulting in record high revenue backlog of $206 million, representing an increase of 17% compared to $176 million at the end of the same quarter last year. These orders span a broad range of the company’s capabilities and are primarily from later-stage projects. The company anticipates a significant amount of its backlog will be recognized as revenue over the next five fiscal quarters. Gross Profit Gross profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $2.4 million (7% gross margin), compared to $9.8 million (26% gross margin) in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and a gross loss of $4.7 million (negative 18% gross margin) in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Gross profit for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was $1.8 million (2% gross margin), compared to a gross profit of $23.1 million (21% gross margin) for the same period during fiscal 2023. The decrease in gross margin for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2024 compared to the same prior year periods was primarily driven by fewer manufacturing runs, a reduction in process development services from early-stage customers, and an increase in our costs related to expansions of both the company’s capacity and technical capabilities. Gross margins during the nine months ended January 31, 2024, were also impacted by a reduction of revenue for changes in estimated variable consideration under a contract where uncertainties have been resolved, a terminated project relating to the insolvency of one of the company’s smaller customers, and a delay in the ability to recognize revenues of a customer product pending the implementation of a process change. Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses SG&A expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 were $6.4 million, a decrease of 10% compared to $7.1 million recorded for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and a decrease of 3% compared to $6.6 million recorded for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. SG&A expenses for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 were $19.2 million, a decrease of approximately 6% compared to $20.3 million recorded in the same prior year period. The decrease in SG&A for both the three and nine months ended January 31, 2024 compared to the same prior year periods was primarily due to decreases in compensation and benefit related expenses, and consulting fees. Operating Income (Loss) Operating loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $4.0 million, a decrease compared to operating income of $2.7 million recorded for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and an increase compared to an operating loss of $11.2 million recorded for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Operating loss for first nine months of fiscal 2024 was $17.4 million compared to operating income of $2.8 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The decrease in operating income for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2024 compared to the same prior year periods was driven by a decrease in gross profit partially offset by reduced SG&A.

Net Loss of $760.5 million in Full Year 2023, a significant increase from $211.6 million in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA of $(22.3) million in Full Year 2023, a decrease from $28.8 million in 2022. Decrease in Total Segment Adjusted Gross Margin % from 48% in Q4 2022 to 32% in Q4 2023. Awarded contracts and grants decreased by 6% in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022. Operating expenses decreased by 17% in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022. Goodwill Impairment decreased by $6.7 million in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022. Capital expenditures decreased by 52% in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022. MCM Products gross margin decreased by 55% in Full Year 2023 compared to 2022. Financial Analyst The reported financial figures of Emergent BioSolutions Inc. reflect a mixed picture, with full-year revenues meeting guidance but a significant net loss recorded. A critical observation is the 6% year-over-year decline in total revenues, coupled with a substantial increase in net loss from $211.6 million in 2022 to $760.5 million in 2023. This deterioration in net income is a red flag for financial stability and could raise concerns among investors regarding the company's profitability trajectory.Another key point is the shift in product sales mix, with a notable 98% increase in Anthrax MCM revenues, which may suggest a successful strategic pivot or favorable government contracts. However, this is contrasted by a 92% reduction in Smallpox MCM revenues, indicating potential volatility in government procurement patterns. The 22% increase in NARCAN® sales is a positive development, likely reflecting successful expansion into OTC markets.The significant decrease in adjusted EBITDA from $44.0 million to $3.4 million in Q4 and a turn from a positive to a negative adjusted EBITDA for the full year, highlight operational challenges. This could suggest a need for further cost control measures or strategic reassessment. The reported $160 million in annual savings from organizational changes indicates proactive management efforts to address these challenges.Lastly, the capital expenditure reduction by 52% suggests a conservative approach to spending, possibly in response to the net loss incurred. This may impact the company's ability to invest in future growth opportunities. Market Research Analyst Emergent BioSolutions' financial performance has implications for its market positioning and competitive landscape. The launch of OTC NARCAN® and the FDA approval of CYFENDUS® represent strategic initiatives to diversify and strengthen the product portfolio. The entry into retail pharmacies and digital commerce with OTC NARCAN® could enhance market penetration and brand visibility, potentially leading to increased market share in the opioid overdose treatment sector.The awarded contracts, such as the $75 million option for CYFENDUS® and a $379.6 million U.S. Department of Defense contract, are indicative of the company's solid footing in the public sector market, particularly in medical countermeasures. These contracts can provide a stable revenue stream and bolster the company's reputation as a reliable government supplier.However, the divestiture of the Travel Health business and the cessation of the Janssen Agreement manufacturing may reflect a strategic refocus but could also signal a narrowing of the company's commercial scope. This could have mixed implications for market presence, depending on the success of newly launched and existing products to compensate for the divested assets. Medical Research Analyst The FDA's approval of CYFENDUS® and the subsequent contract option awarded to Emergent are significant developments in the field of anthrax vaccines. The two-dose regimen for post-exposure prophylaxis could represent an advancement in public health preparedness, potentially improving response times and efficacy in the event of biological threats.The procurement of the Ebola treatment, Ebanga™, under a 10-year BARDA contract, highlights the company's ongoing commitment to addressing global health emergencies. This long-term contract could provide both financial stability and support sustained investment in infectious disease research and development.It is important to monitor the impact of the FDA's closure of the inspection of Emergent's Camden facility. The resolution of regulatory challenges can restore confidence in the company's manufacturing capabilities and compliance, which is crucial for maintaining partnerships and securing new contracts in the medical sector. 03/06/2024 - 04:31 PM Fourth Quarter 2023 Total Revenues of $277 million, which aligned our Full Year to the mid-point of guidanceFull Year 2023 Total Revenues of $1.05 billion, which was the mid-point of guidanceFourth Quarter 2023 Net Loss of $50 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $3 millionIssues Q1 2024 and FY 2024 guidance GAITHERSBURG, Md., March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Emergent BioSolutions Inc.

The new categories are: NARCAN® — comprises contributions from NARCAN® Nasal SprayOther Commercial Products - comprises contributions from Vaxchora® and Vivotif®, which we sold to Bavarian Nordic as part of our travel health business in May 2023Anthrax MCM — comprises potential contributions from CYFENDUS®, previously known as AV7909, BioThrax®, Anthrasil® and RaxibacumabSmallpox MCM — comprises potential contributions from ACAM2000®, VIGIV and TEMBEXA®Other Products — comprises potential contributions from BAT®, RSDL® and Trobigard®Bioservices — comprises service and lease revenues from the Bioservices business ($ in millions)Q4 2023Q4 2022% ChangeProduct sales, net (3): NARCAN®$111.0$91.122%Other Commercial Products — 4.9NM Anthrax MCM 111.6 56.498%Smallpox MCM 11.5 144.6(92)%Other Products 15.0 8.772%Total Product sales, net$249.1$305.7(19)% Bioservices: Services$20.6$17.220%Leases 0.2 0.2—%Total Bioservices revenues$20.8$17.420% Contracts and grants$6.7$7.1(6)% Total revenues$276.6$330.2(16)% NM - Not Meaningful Products Revenue, net NARCAN® For Q4 2023, revenues from NARCAN® (naloxone HCl) Nasal Spray increased $19.9 million, or 22%, as compared with Q4 2022. The increase was primarily driven by higher OTC NARCAN® sales to U.S. public interest channels and retailers, partially offset by a decrease in sales of prescription based NARCAN® due to the launch of OTC NARCAN® in 2023 and the cessation of authorized generic NARCAN® sales related to the termination of the Company’s relationship with Sandoz. Other Commercial Products For Q4 2023, revenues from Other Commercial Products decreased $4.9 million as compared with Q4 2022. The decrease was driven by no sales of our Vaxchora® and Vivotif® products during the current year quarter, which we sold to Bavarian Nordic as part of our travel health business in May 2023. Anthrax MCM For Q4 2023, revenues from Anthrax MCM increased $55.2 million, or 98%, as compared with Q4 2022. The increase reflects the impact of timing of sales related to CYFENDUS® (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed, Adjuvanted), Anthrasil® (Anthrax Immune Globulin Intravenous (human)) and BioThrax® (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed). Anthrax vaccine product sales are primarily made under annual purchase options exercised by the U.S. Government (""USG""). Fluctuations in revenues result from the timing of the exercise of annual purchase options, the timing and amount of USG purchases, the availability of governmental funding and timing of Company delivery of orders that follow. Smallpox MCM For Q4 2023, revenues from Smallpox MCM decreased $133.1 million, or 92%, as compared with Q4 2022. The decrease was due to no current quarter sales of TEMBEXA® and timing of VIGIV deliveries. Fluctuations in revenues from Smallpox MCM result from the timing of the exercise of annual purchase options in existing procurement contracts, the timing of USG purchases, the availability of governmental funding and timing of Company delivery of orders that follow. Other Products For Q4 2023, revenues from other product sales increased $6.3 million, or 72%, as compared with Q4 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher BAT® product sales, partially offset by lower sales of RSDL®. Bioservices Revenues Services For Q4 2023, revenues from Bioservices services increased $3.4 million, or 20%, as compared with Q4 2022. The increase was primarily driven by resolution of a customer's outstanding obligation at our Bayview facility and increased production at our Camden facility, partially offset by a decrease in production at our Winnipeg facility. In the prior year, there was a reversal of revenue related to the halt in manufacturing under the Janssen Agreement. Leases For Q4 2023, revenues from Bioservices leases were consistent with Q4 2022. Contracts and Grants For Q4 2023, revenues from contracts and grants decreased $0.4 million, or 6%, as compared with Q4 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to changes in the mix and timing of various development initiatives.

The increase was primarily due to higher sales of OTC NARCAN® and Branded NARCAN®, partially offset by no sales of Vivotif® and Vaxchora® or related expenses during the current quarter due to the sale of our travel health business to Bavarian Nordic in May 2023. Cost of MCM Product Sales For Q4 2023, cost of MCM product sales decreased $30.4 million, or 24%, as compared with Q4 2022. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales of TEMBEXA® and lower shutdown costs, partially offset by increases due to higher sales of CYFENDUS®, Anthrasil® and BioThrax®, inventory write-offs and additional allocations of cost of goods sold to MCM Products from Bioservices. Cost of Bioservices For Q4 2023, cost of Bioservices decreased $14.9 million, or 28%, as compared with Q4 2022. The decrease was primarily due to higher allocations to MCM Product cost of goods sold and reduced production activities related to the halt in manufacturing under the Janssen Agreement at our Bayview facility, coupled with decreases in production at the Company’s Camden and Winnipeg facilities. Research and Development Expenses For Q4 2023, R&D expenses decreased $17.6 million, or 37%, as compared with Q4 2022. The decrease was primarily due to the sale of the Company’s development program for CHIKV VLP to Bavarian Nordic, which was a significant contributor to prior period R&D expense, as well as a decrease in funded R&D across various development initiatives and reduction in related overhead costs driven by headcount reductions, partially offset by write-offs related to program terminations during the period and an increase in Ebanga™ and TEMBEXA® funded R&D. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses For Q4 2023, SG&A expenses decreased $3.7 million, or 4%, as compared with Q4 2022. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in consulting and contracted services and decreases in compensation and other employee costs related to the restructuring initiatives taken during 2023. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in marketing expenses related to the launch of OTC NARCAN® and higher professional services fees related to legal remediation services. Goodwill Impairment For Q4 2023, goodwill impairment decreased $6.7 million as compared with Q4 2022. The decrease was related to the Q4 2022 $6.7 million non-cash impairment charge to Goodwill in the Bioservices reporting unit, which reduced the reporting unit's goodwill balance to zero.

SEGMENT INFORMATION In the fourth quarter of 2023, we realigned our reportable operating segments to reflect recent changes in our internal operating and reporting process. The Company now manages the business with a focus on three reportable segments: (1) a Commercial Products segment consisting of our NARCAN® and other commercial products which were sold as part of our travel health business in the second quarter of 2023; (2) a MCM Products segment consisting of the Anthrax - MCM, Smallpox - MCM and Other products and (3) a services segment (“Services”) consisting of our Bioservices. The Company evaluates the performance of these reportable segments based on revenue and segment adjusted gross margin, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Segment revenue includes external customer sales, but does not include inter-segment services. The Company does not allocate contracts and grants, R&D, SG&A, amortization of intangible assets, interest and other income (expense) or taxes to its evaluation of the performance of these segments.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES In the accompanying analysis of financial information, we sometimes use information derived from consolidated and segment financial information that may not be presented in our financial statements or prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). Certain of these financial measures are considered not in conformity with GAAP (“non-GAAP financial measures”) under the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules. Specifically, we have referred to the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted Net Income (Loss)Adjusted Net Income (Loss) per Diluted ShareAdjusted EBITDATotal Segment RevenuesTotal Segment Gross MarginTotal Segment Gross Margin %Total Segment Adjusted Gross MarginTotal Segment Adjusted Gross Margin %Segment Adjusted Gross MarginSegment Adjusted Gross Margin % We define Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) per Diluted Share, which are non-GAAP financial measures, as net loss and net loss per diluted share, respectively, excluding the impact of changes in fair value of contingent consideration, acquisition and divestiture-related costs, goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges, severance and restructuring costs, exit and disposal costs, inventory step-up provisions, and non-cash amortization charges. We use Adjusted Net Income (Loss) for the purpose of calculating Adjusted Net Income (Loss) per Diluted Share. Management uses Adjusted Net Income (Loss) per Diluted Share to assess total Company operating performance on a consistent basis. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our GAAP financial results and GAAP financial measures, provide management and investors with an additional understanding of our business operating results, including underlying trends. We define Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as consolidated net loss before income tax provision (benefit), interest expense, net, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges, severance and restructuring costs, exit and disposal costs, acquisition and divestiture-related costs and inventory step-up provisions. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure, when considered together with our GAAP financial results and GAAP financial measures, provides management and investors with a more complete understanding of our operating results, including underlying trends. In addition, EBITDA is a common alternative measure of operating performance used by many of our competitors. It is used by investors, financial analysts, rating agencies and others to value and compare the financial performance of companies in our industry, although it may be defined differently by different companies. Therefore, we also believe that this non-GAAP financial measure, considered along with corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides management and investors with additional information for comparison of our operating results with the operating results of other companies. We have included the definitions of segment gross margin and segment gross margin %, which are GAAP financial measures, below in order to more fully define the components of certain non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release. We define Segment Gross Margin, as a segment's revenues, less a segment's cost of sales or services. We define Segment Gross Margin %, as Segment Gross Margin as a percentage of a segments revenues. We define Segment Adjusted Gross Margin, which is a non-GAAP financial measure as Segment Gross Margin excluding the impact of restructuring costs and non-cash items related to changes in fair value of contingent consideration and inventory step-up provision. We define Segment Adjusted Gross Margin %, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as Segment Adjusted Gross Margin as a percentage of a segment's revenues. We define Total Segment Revenues, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as our Total Revenues, less contracts and grants revenue, which is also equal to the sum of the revenues of our operating segments. We define Total Segment Gross Margin, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as Total Segment Revenues less our aggregate cost of sales or services. We define Total Segment Gross Margin %, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as Total Segment Gross Margin as a percentage of Total Segment Revenues. We define Total Segment Adjusted Gross Margin, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as Total Segment Gross Margin, excluding the impact of restructuring costs, inventory step-up provision and the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Total Segment Adjusted Gross Margin %, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as Total Segment Adjusted Gross Martin as a percentage of Total Segment Revenues. Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined in the same manner by all companies and may not be comparable with other similarly titled measures of other companies. The determination of the amounts that are excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures are a matter of management judgment and depend upon, among other factors, the nature of the underlying expense or income amounts. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, the information contained in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the financial tables accompanying this press release. SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT This press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding the future performance of the Company or our business strategy, future operations, future financial position, future revenues and earnings, our ability to achieve the objectives of our restructuring initiatives, including our future results, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives of management, are forward-looking statements. We generally identify forward-looking statements by using words like “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “future,” “goal,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “position,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “target,” “will,” “would,” and similar expressions or variations thereof, or the negative thereof, but these terms are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. Forward-looking statements are based on our current intentions, beliefs and expectations regarding future events based on information that is currently available. We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be accurate. Readers should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or if known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could differ materially from our expectations. Readers are, therefore, cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this press release, and, except as required by law, we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect new information, events or circumstances. There are a number of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, including, among others, the availability of USG funding for contracts related to procurement of our MCM products, including CYFENDUS® (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed (AVA), Adjuvanted), BioThrax® (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed), ACAM2000®, (Smallpox (Vaccinia) Vaccine, Live), among others, as well as contracts related to development of medical countermeasures; the availability of government funding for our other commercialized products, including Ebanga™ (ansuvimab-zykl), BAT® (Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent) and RSDL® (Reactive Skin Decontamination Lotion Kit); our ability to meet our commitments to quality and compliance in all of our manufacturing operations; our ability to negotiate additional USG procurement or follow-on contracts for our MCM products that have expired or will be expiring; the commercial availability and acceptance of over-the-counter NARCAN® (naloxone HCl) Nasal Spray; the impact of the generic marketplace on NARCAN® (naloxone HCI) Nasal Spray and future NARCAN® sales; our ability to perform under our contracts with the USG, including the timing of and specifications relating to deliveries; our ability to provide Bioservices for the development and/or manufacture of product and/or product candidates of our customers at required levels and on required timelines; the ability of our contractors and suppliers to maintain compliance with current good manufacturing practices and other regulatory obligations; our ability to negotiate further commitments related to the collaboration and deployment of capacity toward future commercial manufacturing under our existing Bioservices contracts; our ability to collect reimbursement for raw materials and payment of services fees from our Bioservices customers; the results of pending stockholder litigation and government investigations and their potential impact on our business; our ability to comply with the operating and financial covenants required by our senior secured credit facilities and the amended and restated credit agreement relating to such facilities, and our 3.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2028; our ability to resolve the going concern qualification in our consolidated financial statements and otherwise successfully manage our liquidity in order to continue as a going concern; the procurement of our product candidates by USG entities under regulatory authorities that permit government procurement of certain medical products prior to FDA marketing authorization, and corresponding procurement by government entities outside of the United States; our ability to realize the expected benefits of the sale of our travel health business to Bavarian Nordic; the impact of the organizational changes we announced in January 2023 and August 2023; our ability to identify and acquire companies, businesses, products or product candidates that satisfy our selection criteria; the impact of cyber security incidents, including the risks from the unauthorized access interruption, failure or compromise of our information systems or those of our business partners, collaborators or other third parties; the success of our commercialization, marketing and manufacturing capabilities and strategy; and the accuracy of our estimates regarding future revenues, expenses, capital requirements and needs for additional financing. The foregoing sets forth many, but not all, of the factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations in any forward-looking statement. Readers should consider this cautionary statement, as well as the risks identified in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, when evaluating our forward-looking statements.

This transition to a more modern facility in LaGrange, Georgia, indicates a shift towards modernization and efficiency improvements within the sector. The offering of high-value assets like Metal Injected Molded operations and OKK horizontal machining centers suggests that there is a market for specialized manufacturing equipment, which could attract a diverse range of buyers, potentially impacting the secondary market for industrial assets.From a market research perspective, the interest generated by these auctions could serve as an indicator of the health of the manufacturing sector and the demand for such assets. It is also reflective of the growing trend of companies leveraging the circular economy to recoup investment and minimize waste. The success of these auctions could influence other companies' decisions to adopt similar strategies when upgrading or relocating facilities, which may have a ripple effect on the industry's approach to asset management and disposition. Financial Analyst Liquidity Services' involvement in the sale of RemArms' assets is a critical component to consider for investors. The ability of Liquidity Services to attract both domestic and international buyers and generate strong sales results could have a positive impact on their financial performance. For RemArms, the revenue generated from these auctions will be telling of the company's ability to efficiently manage its transition and may affect its financial health in the short term.Investors should monitor the outcome of the auctions for insights into Liquidity Services' performance in asset liquidation and for any potential impact on its stock price. For RemArms, the proceeds from the asset sales will likely be reinvested into the new facility, which could enhance long-term profitability through increased operational efficiency. However, the initial costs associated with the plant closure and relocation may weigh on the company's short-term financials. Economist The closure of the longest-operating firearms manufacturing site in the U.S. has broader economic implications, including potential effects on local employment and economic activity in Ilion, New York. The relocation of operations to LaGrange, Georgia, could contribute to regional economic development in that area through job creation and increased industrial activity. This move is an example of how shifts within an industry can have significant local economic impacts.Additionally, the auction's success in attracting international buyers could highlight the global demand for manufacturing assets and the interconnectedness of the global economy. The flow of these assets across borders can influence trade balances and contribute to the transfer of technology and skills. In the long run, such activities could affect the competitive dynamics of the firearms manufacturing industry and the broader manufacturing sector. 03/06/2024 - 04:30 PM More than 600 assets offered for sale as part of facility closureBETHESDA, Md., March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Liquidity Services (NASDAQ: LQDT), a leading global commerce company powering the circular economy, today announced it is partnering with RemArms, a leading firearms manufacturer, to sell equipment and materials that will result from the scheduled closure of its iconic Ilion, New York manufacturing plant, the longest-operating firearms manufacturing site in the U.S. As part of a strategic move by the company to relocate its manufacturing operations to a modern facility in LaGrange, Georgia, more than 600 arms manufacturing assets are currently available through a series of auctions on AllSurplus.com, the leading online marketplace for surplus business assets. “As RemArms’ strategic partner, we are confident the upcoming auctions will produce strong sales results by delivering interest from both domestic and international buyers,” said Chris Register, vice president of corporate sales for AllSurplus.

J.P. Morgan is the underwriter for the offering. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Clearwater Analytics Holdings' announcement of a secondary public offering can have a significant impact on the company's stock liquidity and market perception. Typically, a secondary offering can dilute existing shares, potentially lowering their value. However, since the company is not issuing new shares but rather facilitating a resale by existing stakeholders, the direct impact on the company's financials is neutral. Investors should closely monitor the volume of shares traded post-announcement, as it could affect stock price volatility.Furthermore, the involvement of a reputable financial institution like J.P. Morgan as the underwriter and book-runner lends credibility to the offering and may ease potential investor concerns about the transaction's execution. The offering's success and the subsequent stock performance will hinge on market conditions and investor appetite for Clearwater's stock at the time of the sale. Market Research Analyst The secondary public offering from Clearwater Analytics Holdings is indicative of the current trend where companies leverage strong market conditions to provide liquidity options for early investors or private equity stakeholders. It's essential to analyze the market's reception to such offerings, as it reflects investor confidence in the company's long-term growth prospects.Investors should consider the broader industry context, including market demand for SaaS-based investment management solutions and Clearwater's competitive positioning within this sector. Market saturation, innovation and regulatory changes can all influence investor sentiment and, by extension, the outcome of the secondary offering. Legal Expert The legal framework governing the secondary public offering, particularly the use of a shelf registration statement, allows Clearwater Analytics Holdings to sell shares in a more streamlined manner. This process demonstrates regulatory compliance and the company's preparedness to take advantage of market opportunities. It's important for investors to understand that the SEC's involvement through the registration statement ensures transparency and provides a layer of security for potential buyers.Investors should note that the offering is conducted under the guidelines of the Securities Act of 1933, which mandates full disclosure to protect investors.

ASUR Announces Total Passenger Traffic for February 2024,2024-03-06T21:30:00.000Z,Low,Positive,"Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste (ASR) reports a 4.8% increase in passenger traffic for February 2024, with significant growth in Mexico and Puerto Rico but a decline in Colombia. Mexico saw a 5.7% increase driven by international traffic, while Puerto Rico experienced a 12.6% rise. Colombia's traffic dropped by 3.4% due to the suspension of local airlines.","ASUR Announces Total Passenger Traffic for February 2024 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste (ASR) reports a 4.8% increase in passenger traffic for February 2024, with significant growth in Mexico and Puerto Rico but a decline in Colombia. Mexico saw a 5.7% increase driven by international traffic, while Puerto Rico experienced a 12.6% rise. Colombia's traffic dropped by 3.4% due to the suspension of local airlines. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Observing the reported figures, we see a nuanced picture of regional aviation demand. The growth in passenger traffic for Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste in Mexico and Puerto Rico suggests a robust recovery trajectory in these markets, likely driven by a combination of factors such as economic growth, increased tourism and expanded flight capacity.Particularly, the double-digit increase in international traffic in Mexico and Puerto Rico indicates a strong rebound in tourism and business travel. However, the decline in Colombia's domestic traffic, attributed to the suspension of operations of two local airlines, presents a challenge that could affect the company's revenue streams and operational efficiency in the region. Stakeholders should monitor the company's strategies to mitigate this downturn, such as attracting new carriers or promoting alternative routes.Long-term implications for the business may include strategic shifts to capitalize on growing markets, while addressing underperforming segments. Investors might consider these trends when assessing the company's future revenue potential and market position. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the mixed performance across different regions has implications for Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste's revenue diversification strategy. The growth in passenger numbers, particularly in international traffic, is likely to contribute positively to the company's top-line growth and profitability, especially considering the typically higher yields on international routes compared to domestic ones.The reported decline in domestic traffic within Mexico and the downturn in Colombia could signal potential risks to revenue. However, the overall increase in total passenger traffic suggests that the company's diversified portfolio is providing some buffer against localized market challenges. The impact on the stock market performance of ASUR will depend on how these traffic trends translate into financial results and whether the company can leverage its growth in stronger markets to offset challenges in weaker ones. Economist An economist's perspective would highlight that the variations in passenger traffic growth rates among the regions reflect broader economic trends. Mexico's and Puerto Rico's increases suggest a favorable economic environment and consumer confidence, which bodes well for discretionary spending on travel. Conversely, Colombia's decrease could be indicative of microeconomic issues, such as the impact of local airline disruptions on the country's connectivity and competitive dynamics within the aviation sector.These traffic patterns may also have implications for employment within the aviation sector and related industries, such as tourism and hospitality. The increased international traffic to Mexico and Puerto Rico might stimulate job creation and economic activity in these regions. However, the situation in Colombia could have the opposite effect unless swiftly addressed. 03/06/2024 - 04:30 PM Passenger traffic increased year-on-year by 5.7% in Mexico and 12.6% in Puerto Rico and decreased 3.4% in Colombia MEXICO CITY, March 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste, S.A.B. de C.V. (NYSE: ASR; BMV: ASUR), ASUR, a leading international airport group with operations in Mexico, the U.S. and Colombia, today announced that passenger traffic for February 2024 reached a total of 5.8 million passengers, representing an increase of 4.8% compared to February 2023. Passenger traffic presented year-on-year increases of 5.7% in Mexico, 12.6% in Puerto Rico, while it decreased 3.4% in Colombia. Passenger traffic growth in Mexico was driven by a 10.9% increase in international traffic which more than offset a 1.3% decline in domestic traffic. Puerto Rico reported growth in both domestic and international traffic, up 12% and 17.9%, respectively. Passenger traffic in Colombia, remained impacted by the suspension of operations of two local airlines from the beginning of 2023, resulting in a 7.8% drop in domestic traffic, while international traffic improved 16.9% year-on-year.

(AIRG) reported Q4 2023 sales of $10.1 million, ending the year with $56.0 million in sales. The company anticipates gradual growth in 2024 driven by market recoveries and product innovations. However, sales declined in all markets compared to the previous year. Positive Airgain reported Q4 2023 sales of $10.1 million and full-year sales of $56.0 million. The company expects gradual growth in 2024 due to market recoveries and product innovations. All market segments experienced sales declines in Q4 2023 compared to the previous quarter and the same period last year. Negative Sales decreased in all markets compared to the previous year. GAAP net loss increased in Q4 2023 due to lower sales and higher expenses. The company's financial outlook for Q1 2024 indicates a potential net loss. Financial Analyst The reported financial results of Airgain, Inc. reflect a significant year-over-year decline in sales, with a 26.2% drop from the previous year. This decrease is indicative of challenges faced across the enterprise, consumer and automotive markets. The notable decline in gross profit, both GAAP and non-GAAP, suggests a contraction in operational efficiency, potentially due to the excess and obsolete inventory charges mentioned. The reported net losses have widened, with the GAAP net loss growing more substantially than the non-GAAP net loss, emphasizing the impact of non-operating factors and adjustments on the company's financial health.From an investor's perspective, the increased net loss and reduced sales raise concerns about the company's current market position and competitive dynamics. Despite this, the forecast for the first quarter of 2024 indicates an expectation of sales recovery and improved gross margins. This projection, if realized, could signal the beginning of a turnaround for Airgain. However, the anticipated continued net loss suggests that the path to profitability may still be challenging. Stakeholders should monitor the company's ability to execute its growth strategy, particularly in the context of its 5-G connectivity initiatives, which could be pivotal in driving future performance. Market Research Analyst The wireless connectivity sector is undergoing rapid evolution, with 5-G technology being a key driver of growth. Airgain's focus on product innovation and the launch of 5-G initiatives could position the company to capitalize on this trend. However, the reported decline in sales across all market segments, particularly in the enterprise and consumer markets, suggests that Airgain is facing significant headwinds, possibly due to market saturation, competitive pressures, or shifts in consumer demand.It is critical to assess Airgain's market strategy and its ability to differentiate its offerings in a crowded marketplace. The company's performance must be contextualized within the broader industry trends, such as the impact of the global semiconductor shortage, which may have affected supply chains and inventory levels. The financial outlook for Q1 2024 hints at modest improvements, but stakeholders should remain cautious and seek evidence of sustained demand and effective inventory management in subsequent quarters to validate the company's growth trajectory. Technology Industry Analyst Airgain's performance in the wireless connectivity market is closely tied to technological advancements and the adoption of new standards like 5-G. The decline in sales, particularly in the automotive market due to the discontinued AC-HPUE product line, reflects the importance of maintaining a relevant and competitive product portfolio. The excess inventory correction also points to potential misalignment between production and market demand, which is critical in the fast-paced technology sector.Investments in product innovation and 5-G initiatives could be key differentiators for Airgain moving forward. The technology sector values agility and the ability to quickly adapt to changing market needs. As such, Airgain's future success will likely depend on its ability to not only innovate but also to effectively forecast and respond to market demands. Stakeholders should monitor the company's R&D focus, particularly in the enterprise WiFi and industrial IoT segments, to gauge its potential for recovery and growth in the evolving landscape of wireless technology. 03/06/2024 - 04:30 PM SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Airgain, Inc. (Nasdaq: AIRG), a leading provider of wireless connectivity solutions that creates and delivers embedded components, external antennas, and integrated systems across the globe, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. “Our team delivered quarterly sales of $10.1 million, closing out 2023 with sales of $56.0 million,” said Airgain’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Jacob Suen. “We believe that the fourth quarter was the trough for our business after sequential declines through the year.

Sales decreased by $3.6 million or 26.5%, compared to $13.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. Enterprise product sales decreased from the third quarter of 2023 by $2.2 million driven by lower enterprise WiFi and industrial IoT product sales. Consumer sales declined $1.2 million from the third quarter of 2023 driven by lower sales to cable operators. Automotive sales decreased $0.2 million from the third quarter of 2023 on lower aftermarket sales. Sales for the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased by $9.8 million or 49.4% from $19.9 million in the same year-ago period due to decreased sales of $5.4 million from the enterprise market, $3.2 million from the consumer market and $1.2 million from the automotive market.

GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 29.1%, compared to 38.2% for the third quarter of 2023 and 29.6% in the same year-ago period. The decrease in gross margin compared to the third quarter of 2023 was primarily due to an excess and obsolete inventory charge. Non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 30.3% compared to 39.1% for the third quarter of 2023 and 30.5% in the same year-ago period (see note regarding ""Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below for further discussion of this non-GAAP measure). GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $8.4 million, compared to $7.1 million for the third quarter of 2023 and $9.2 million in the same year-ago period. Operating expenses were higher for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to higher personnel compensation and engineering project expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $6.5 million compared to $6.0 million in the third quarter of 2023 and $7.2 million in the same year-ago period (see note regarding ""Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below for further discussion of this non-GAAP measure). GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $5.5 million or $(0.52) per share (based on 10.5 million shares), compared to $1.9 million or $(0.18) per share (based on 10.4 million shares) for the third quarter of 2023 and a net loss of $3.2 million or $(0.31) per share (based on 10.2 million shares) in the same year-ago period. The increase in net loss compared to the third quarter of 2023 was due to lower sales, higher expenses and a fourth quarter excess and obsolete inventory charge. Non-GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $3.5 million or $(0.33) per share (based on 10.5 million shares), compared to a net loss of $0.7 million or $(0.06) per share (based on 10.4 million shares) for the third quarter of 2023 and a non-GAAP net loss of $1.1 million or $(0.11) per share (based on 10.2 million shares) for the same year-ago period (see note regarding ""Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below for further discussion of this non-GAAP measure).

Sales decreased by $19.9 million or 26.2% for the full year of 2023 compared to $75.9 million in 2022. Enterprise sales decreased $7.3 million from $34.5 million in 2022 primarily due to channel excess inventory correction impacting our IIoT products sales. Consumer sales declined by $6.9 million from $25.8 million in 2022 primarily due to weaker end demand, coupled with excess inventory, with cable operators customers. Automotive sales decreased $5.7 million from $15.6 million in 2022 driven by the discontinued AC-HPUE product line and excess inventory correction impacting our aftermarket antenna sales. GAAP gross profit for the full year of 2023 was $20.8 million compared to $28.0 million in 2022. Non-GAAP gross profit for the full year of 2023 was $21.2 million compared to $28.5 million in 2022 (see note regarding ""Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below for further discussion of this non-GAAP measure).

The increase in net loss was primarily due to a decrease of $7.2 million in gross profit on lower sales, partially offset by a $3.4 million decrease in operating expenses.

These forward-looking statements include statements regarding our first quarter and 2024 financial outlook, expected recovery of markets the company serves, expected launches of company initiatives, and overall long-term strategy and priorities. The inclusion of forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by Airgain that any of our plans will be achieved. Actual results may differ from those set forth in this press release due to the risks and uncertainties inherent in our business, including, without limitation: the market for our products is developing and may not develop as we expect; our operating results may fluctuate significantly, including based on seasonal factors, which makes future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations or guidance; supply constraints on our and our customers' ability to obtain necessary components in our respective supply chains may negatively affect our sales and operating results; risks associated with the performance of our products, including bundled solutions with third-party products; our products are subject to intense competition and competitive pressures from existing and new companies may harm our business, sales, growth rates, and market share; risks associated with quality and timing in manufacturing our products and our reliance on third-party manufacturers; we may not be able to maintain strategic collaborations under which our bundled solutions are offered; overall global supply shortages and logistics delays within the supply chain that our products are used in, as well as adversely affecting the general U.S. and global economic conditions and financial markets, and, ultimately, our sales and operating results; any rise in interest rates and inflation may adversely impact our margins, the supply chain and our customers’ sales, which may negatively affect our sales and operating results; our future success depends on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new and enhanced products for the wireless market that meet the needs of our customers, including our ability to transition to provide a more diverse solutions capability; we sell to customers who are price conscious, and a few customers represent a significant portion of our sales, and if we lose any of these customers, our sales could decrease significantly; we rely on a limited number of contract manufacturers to produce and ship all of our products, and our contract manufacturers rely on a single or limited number of suppliers for some components of our products and channel partners to sell and support our products, and the failure to manage our relationships with these parties successfully or a failure of these parties to perform could adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products; if we cannot protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed or we could incur significant expenses to enforce our rights; and other risks described in our prior press releases and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent filings with the SEC. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof, and we undertake no obligation to revise or update this press release to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof. All forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement, which is made under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement our condensed financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this earnings release and the accompanying tables and the related earnings conference call contain certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization (Adjusted EBITDA), non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders (non-GAAP net income (loss)), non-GAAP net income (loss) per (basic or diluted) share (non-GAAP EPS), non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin. We believe these financial measures provide useful information to investors with which to analyze our operating trends and performance. In computing Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income (loss), and non-GAAP EPS, we exclude stock-based compensation expense, which represents non-cash charges for the fair value of stock awards; interest income, net of interest expense offset by other expense, depreciation and amortization, severance and exit costs, and provision (benefit) for income taxes. In computing non-GAAP operating expense, we exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles, and severance and exit costs. In computing non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin, we exclude stock-based compensation expense, and amortization of intangible assets. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions, and the variety of equity instruments that can impact a company’s non-cash operating expenses; we believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude non-cash expense allows for meaningful comparisons between our core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing us with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating our own core business operating results over different periods of time. Management considers these types of expenses and adjustments, to a great extent, to be unpredictable and dependent on a considerable number of factors that are outside of our control and are not necessarily reflective of operational performance during a period. Our non-GAAP measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies in our industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring, unusual items. Our Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP EPS, non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to operating or net income or as an indication of operating performance or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. We do not consider these non-GAAP measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results. Reconciliations with specific adjustments to GAAP results and outlooks are provided at the end of this release. Airgain, Inc.

This differentiation between GAAP and Non-GAAP results is crucial for investors to understand the underlying business performance.The initiation of a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share could be seen as a positive signal to shareholders, indicating that the company's management is confident in its cash flow stability and its commitment to returning value. However, the relatively small dividend size in comparison to EPS might suggest a cautious approach, possibly reflecting uncertainty in future cash flows or a strategy to retain earnings for reinvestment.Despite a decrease in consolidated revenue by 6%, the record increase in consolidated gross profit and margin expansion by 410 basis points to 32.9% is noteworthy. This implies that the company has been successful in improving its cost structure or selling higher-margin products and services. However, the decrease in consolidated Adjusted EBITDA by 7% raises questions about the sustainability of these margins and the operational costs involved. Market Research Analyst The performance indicators in IDT Corporation's report reveal a nuanced picture of the company's market positioning. The significant growth in NRS recurring revenue by 30% and BOSS Money revenue by 42% is indicative of the company's strong foothold in the fintech and POS terminal markets. The addition of 1,500 net active POS terminals and a 37% increase in remittance volume highlight the company's expanding market reach and operational scale.Meanwhile, the growth in net2phone's subscription revenue by 19% and the addition of 11,000 net seats suggest a robust demand for cloud communication services, which is a rapidly growing industry segment. These metrics are essential for investors to understand the company's growth drivers and the potential for future revenue streams.However, the overall decrease in consolidated revenue alongside these growth figures may indicate competitive pressures or market saturation in certain segments. Investors should consider the company's strategic initiatives to counteract these challenges and the potential for international expansion or new product offerings to drive future growth. Economist From an economic perspective, the financial results of IDT Corporation can be seen as a reflection of broader macroeconomic trends. The fact that the company has managed to increase its gross profit amidst a revenue decline could suggest a strategic shift towards more profitable segments or cost-cutting measures that have been effective. This could be an adaptive response to economic conditions that favor efficiency over expansion.The initiation of a dividend may also reflect a broader trend where companies are seeking to attract income-focused investors in a potentially low-interest-rate environment. This move, while conservative, could be a strategic allocation of capital that balances growth with shareholder returns.It is also important to consider the impact of currency fluctuations, trade policies and global economic shifts on IDT's international operations, especially in the fintech and remittance sectors. These factors can significantly affect transaction volumes and profitability, thus influencing the company's financial health and stock performance. 03/06/2024 - 04:30 PM GAAP EPS of $0.57 – unchanged YoY; Non-GAAP EPS* increased to $0.67 from $0.62 Cash, cash equivalents, debt securities, and current equity investments totaled $177.6 million Initiates quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share of Common Stock NEWARK, NJ, March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IDT Corporation (NYSE: IDT), a global provider of fintech, cloud communications, and traditional communications services, today reported results for the second quarter of its fiscal year 2024, the three months ended January 31, 2024.

REMARKS BY SHMUEL JONAS, CEO “The second quarter was highlighted by the continued expansion of our growth businesses, with both NRS and BOSS Money surpassing the $100 million annual revenue run rate milestone. “NRS continued to deliver robust recurring revenue per terminal. We again saw strong growth in Merchant Services and SaaS revenues, and increased Merchant Services revenue per NRS Pay account. We added approximately 1500 net new terminals to the NRS network this quarter. “BOSS Money delivered another quarter of impressive results, with 42% year-over-year revenue growth. Its improving economics helped our Fintech segment to achieve Adjusted EBITDA break-even for the quarter. “I am also very pleased with net2phone increasing subscription revenue 19% year over year and achieving cash flow break-even – which we measure as Adjusted EBITDA less CapEx. Together, our combined growth segments propelled IDT to achieve another quarter of record consolidated gross profit and increased gross margin. “The businesses within our Traditional Communications segment continue to generate strong cash-flow. Over the past few months, we have been very focused on reducing our overhead and on streamlining our operations within Traditional Communications and company-wide. You will see the benefits of these efforts in the third quarter and beyond. “Now, I want to provide some context to our Board’s decision to initiate a quarterly cash dividend. “NRS, BOSS Money and net2phone no longer need new cash investments to fund their organic growth. In aggregate, they have become significant contributors to our bottom line. Meanwhile, we expect cash flows from our Traditional Communications segment to remain robust for years to come. The strength of our operational results and of our balance sheet -- including our enhanced liquidity -- provides us with flexibility as we invest in the development of our next generation of exciting early-stage initiatives and scout for other growth opportunities. “In light of our robust financial position and positive outlook, the Board felt that we should supplement our ongoing program of opportunistic stock buybacks, which can vary from quarter to quarter, with a regular, predictable dividend payment to our stockholders.” CONSOLIDATED RESULTS IDT Consolidated Results($ in millions, except gross profit margin and EPS) 2Q241Q244Q233Q232Q23 2Q24-2Q23 VarianceRevenue$296.1$301.2$303.8$299.3$313.9 (5.7)%Gross profit***$97.4$94.4$91.1$87.9$90.4 +7.7%Gross profit margin32.9%31.4%30.0%29.4%28.8% +410 bpsSG&A$80.7$77.2$78.2$72.6$72.1 +12.0%Income from operations$16.0$17.2$12.0$10.4$18.2 (11.9)%Adjusted EBITDA*$21.8$22.3$18.1$20.5$23.4 (7.0)%Net income attributable to IDT$14.4$7.7$8.0$6.9$14.6 $(0.2)EPS (diluted)$0.57$0.30$0.31$0.27$0.57 NCNon-GAAP EPS* (diluted)$0.67$0.32$0.36$0.46$0.62 +$0.05 RESULTS BY SEGMENT National Retail Solutions (NRS) During 2Q24 and 2Q23, the NRS segment contributed 8.5% and 6.3% of IDT’s consolidated revenue, respectively.

The ARPU increase reflects, in part, the faster rate of CCaaS seat expansion compared to UCaaS seats. Fintech During 2Q24 and 2Q23, the Fintech segment contributed 9.4% and 6.5% of IDT’s consolidated revenue, respectively.

The latter was driven by expansion of the BOSS Money retail agent network.BOSS Money revenue increased 42% driven primarily by cross-marketing within the larger BOSS ecosystem, an expansion of the BOSS Money retailer network, and ongoing efforts to enhance user-experience within the BOSS Money and Boss Calling apps.The continued growth of BOSS Money transaction volumes and improving unit economics drove the Fintech segment’s year-over-year and sequential improvements in loss from operations and Adjusted EBITDA.

By 1Q24, however, that corridor was no longer a significant factor in current resultsTraditional Communications revenue continued to decrease in line with expectations while the segment’s gross profits have been comparatively more durable.IDT continues to streamline the operations of its Boss Revolution and IDT Global businesses and expects this effort will drive reductions in SG&A in the coming quarters. OTHER FINANCIAL RESULTS Consolidated results for all periods presented include corporate overhead. Corporate G&A expense increased to $3.2 million in 2Q24 from $2.5 million in 2Q23 reflecting an increase in employee compensation expense.

Generally, a non-GAAP measure is a numerical measure of a company’s performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. IDT’s measure of non-GAAP EPS is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income by the diluted weighted-average shares. IDT’s measure of non-GAAP net income starts with net income attributable to IDT in accordance with GAAP and adds severance expense, stock-based compensation, and other operating expense, and deducts other operating gains. These additions and subtractions are non-cash and/or non-routine items in the relevant fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 periods. Management believes that IDT’s Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS are measures which provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses and non-routine gains and losses that may not be indicative of IDT’s or the relevant segment’s core operating results. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA, among other measures, as a relevant indicator of core operational strengths in its financial and operational decision making. In addition, management uses Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS to evaluate operating performance in relation to IDT’s competitors. Disclosure of these financial measures may be useful to investors in evaluating performance and allows for greater transparency to the underlying supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. In addition, IDT has historically reported similar financial measures and believes such measures are commonly used by readers of financial information in assessing performance, therefore the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in financial reporting. Management refers to Adjusted EBITDA, as well as the GAAP measures income (loss) from operations and net income, on a segment and/or consolidated level to facilitate internal and external comparisons to the segments’ and IDT's historical operating results, in making operating decisions, for budget and planning purposes, and to form the basis upon which management is compensated. While depreciation and amortization are considered operating costs under GAAP, these expenses primarily represent the non-cash current period allocation of costs associated with long-lived assets acquired or capitalized in prior periods. IDT’s Adjusted EBITDA, which is exclusive of depreciation and amortization, is a useful indicator of its current performance. Severance expense is excluded from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS. Severance expense is reflective of decisions made by management in each period regarding the aspects of IDT’s and its segments’ businesses to be focused on in light of changing market realities and other factors. While there may be similar charges in other periods, the nature and magnitude of these charges can fluctuate markedly and do not reflect the performance of IDT’s core and continuing operations. Other operating (expense) gain, net, which is a component of income (loss) from operations, is excluded from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS. Other operating (expense) gain, net includes, among other items, legal fees net of insurance claims related to Straight Path Communications Inc.’s stockholders’ class action, gains from the write-off of contingent consideration liabilities, gain from the sale of state income tax credits, and fixed asset write-offs. From time-to-time, IDT may have gains or incur costs related to non-routine legal, tax, and other matters, however, these various items generally do not occur each quarter. IDT believes the gain and losses from these non-routine matters are not components of IDT’s or the relevant segment’s core operating results. Stock-based compensation recognized by IDT and other companies may not be comparable because of the variety of types of awards as well as the various valuation methodologies and subjective assumptions that are permitted under GAAP. Stock-based compensation is excluded from IDT’s calculation of non-GAAP EPS because management believes this allows investors to make more meaningful comparisons of the operating results per share of IDT’s core business with the results of other companies. However, stock-based compensation will continue to be a significant expense for IDT for the foreseeable future and an important part of employees’ compensation that impacts their performance. Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, income (loss) from operations, cash flow from operating activities, net income, basic and diluted earnings per share or other measures of liquidity and financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, IDT’s measurements of Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Following are reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which are, (a) for Adjusted EBITDA, income (loss) from operations for IDT’s reportable segments and net income for IDT on a consolidated basis, and (b) for non-GAAP EPS, diluted earnings per share.

Financial Analyst The strategic investment and partnership between Avinger, Inc. and Zylox-Tonbridge Medical Technology Co., Ltd. signifies a considerable development in Avinger's financial and operational strategy. The infusion of up to $15 million in equity funding from Zylox-Tonbridge, particularly the initial $7.5 million at-the-market investment, provides Avinger with a strengthened balance sheet. This capital injection is critical for Avinger as it likely improves their cash position, potentially extending their runway and enabling further investment in research and development.The three-year extension of existing debt terms with CRG Partners is also a significant development. By deferring principal payments until 2027, Avinger gains financial flexibility, which could alleviate short-term liquidity pressures and improve financial stability. However, it is important to consider the potential increase in the total interest paid over the extended loan period, which could impact long-term profitability.The strategic partnership opens up the Greater China market for Avinger's intravascular image-guided devices, which is a substantial opportunity given the region's large patient population and growing healthcare sector. However, investors should monitor the progress of regulatory activities and the achievement of sales milestones, as these are crucial for realizing the full potential of this partnership. Market Research Analyst The entry into the Greater China market through this partnership is a strategic move for Avinger, considering the robust growth rate of over 50% reported by Zylox-Tonbridge in the region. Access to Zylox-Tonbridge's established distribution network and sales force could significantly enhance Avinger's market penetration and sales volume. The collaboration may also provide Avinger with competitive advantages through cost-efficient manufacturing and the potential distribution of Zylox-Tonbridge's peripheral vascular products in the U.S. and Germany.It is essential to understand the competitive landscape within the Greater China interventional markets. Avinger's ability to capture market share will depend on the efficacy and differentiation of its image-guided devices compared to existing solutions. Additionally, the long-term success of the partnership will hinge on the seamless integration of Avinger's products into Zylox-Tonbridge's portfolio and the effective management of cross-border regulatory and operational challenges. Medical Device Industry Analyst The technology transfer agreement to build cost-efficient manufacturing capacity is a critical component of this partnership. This aspect could not only reduce production costs but also improve the scalability of Avinger's operations. The manufacturing and distribution rights granted to Zylox-Tonbridge for the Greater China region suggest a significant commitment to the partnership. However, the execution of technology transfer and the establishment of manufacturing facilities in compliance with regulatory standards, such as the FDA, will be crucial for the success of this initiative.The potential distribution of Zylox-Tonbridge's peripheral vascular products in the U.S. and Germany through Avinger could diversify Avinger's product offerings and strengthen its position in these markets. The ability to source finished goods from Zylox-Tonbridge following FDA registration could also be a game-changer for Avinger, potentially enhancing its supply chain efficiency and product availability.Investors and stakeholders should be aware of the inherent risks in international partnerships, such as potential intellectual property challenges, quality control across manufacturing sites and the complexities of navigating different healthcare systems and regulatory environments. 03/06/2024 - 07:30 PM Initial $7.5 Million Strategic InvestmentStrategic Partnership Opens Pathway to Access Greater China MarketStrengthened Balance Sheet and Three-Year Extension of Existing Debt TermsREDWOOD CITY, CA / ACCESSWIRE / March 6, 2024 / Avinger, Inc.

The company's CEO highlights operational improvements and growth initiatives, including capacity expansion at Segovia Operations and progress at Marmato Lower Mine project. Aris Mining generated significant free cash flow and ended the year with a healthy cash position, setting the stage for future growth and production milestones. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The disclosed financial and operating results of Aris Mining Corporation for Q4 and FY 2023 exhibit a mixed financial performance with net losses in Q4 but overall profitability for the fiscal year. The company's all-in sustaining costs (AISC) per ounce for gold production remained relatively stable, reflecting effective cost management despite the restructuring of operations post-merger. The increase in gold production and the expansion of the Segovia Operations are pivotal for future revenue growth. However, the negative free cash flow after expansion capital in Q4 indicates potential liquidity concerns. Investors should note the substantial growth in mineral reserves and resources, which could lead to increased production capacity and revenue in the long-term. Yet, the decrease in net cash year-over-year raises questions about the company's ability to sustain its growth investments without additional financing. The cash position at year-end, though significant, has declined from the previous year, which may affect the company's financial flexibility. Market Research Analyst The gold mining industry is sensitive to gold prices, which have fluctuated over the past year. Aris Mining's average realized gold price in 2023 indicates a favorable market environment, which has contributed to their revenue. The company's strategy to increase processing capacity by 50% at the Segovia Operations aligns with industry trends of scaling operations to leverage economies of scale. Market dynamics suggest that construction projects such as the Marmato Lower Mine could position Aris Mining for competitive advantage, but also carry operational risks and cost overruns. The projected increase to 500,000 ounces of gold production in Colombia by 2026 could significantly impact the company's market share and valuation if executed efficiently. Mining Industry Expert The technical aspects of Aris Mining's operations, such as the processed grade of 10.4 g/t at the Segovia Operations, are indicative of high-grade mining, which is typically more cost-effective than lower-grade mining. The shift to increase processing capacity and the ramp-up of the Marmato Lower Mine project demonstrate a commitment to long-term growth and operational efficiency. The focus on exploration potential and growth projects is essential in the mining industry to sustain production levels and replace depleted reserves. However, the capital intensity of these projects requires careful financial planning to ensure they do not jeopardize the company's financial health. The partnership with artisanal and small-scale mining units is noteworthy, as it reflects a trend towards more inclusive and sustainable mining practices. 03/06/2024 - 06:26 PM VANCOUVER, BC, March 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Aris Mining Corporation (Aris Mining or the Company) (TSX: ARIS) (NYSE-A: ARMN) announces financial and operating results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023 (Q4 2023 and FY 2023, respectively). All amounts are in US dollars unless otherwise indicated.

The new team achieved consistent quarter-over-quarter increases in gold production during 2023, significantly enhancing our position in 2024 and the future. We have achieved the initial phase of our vision to create an attractive gold mining company for investors by integrating profitable operations with exploration potential and growth projects. During 2023, our high-grade Segovia Operations produced 202,940 ounces of gold at a processed grade of 10.4 g/t with all-in sustaining costs per ounce of $1,173, achieving production and AISC guidance. For the full year 2023, our mines generated $75.4 million in free cash flow from operations1 which largely funded $84.2 million in growth and expansion investments, and we ended the year with a cash position of $195 million. With strong gold production results and substantial growth in mineral reserves and resources at our Segovia Operations, we have started construction to increase its processing capacity by 50% to 3,000 tonnes per day with completion expected in early 2025. As the new capacity is used, we expect to increase annual gold production at Segovia to over 300,000 ounces. Construction at our Marmato Lower Mine project has ramped up with initial access roads completed, the lead contractor for portal and decline development selected, and tenders for key items for the new processing plant underway. We are on pace to reach 500,000 ounces of gold production in Colombia in 2026.""

Key achievements include adding 475MW of battery storage, securing federal grants for transmission networks, and protecting conservation lands. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst The recent Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Report released by Portland General Electric (PGE) highlights the company's strategic efforts in enhancing energy reliability, affordability and sustainability, which are critical factors influencing investor confidence in the utility sector. The addition of 475 megawatts of battery storage is particularly noteworthy, as it signifies PGE's investment in energy storage solutions that can smooth out the intermittency of renewable energy sources and bolster grid reliability. This is a strategic move, given the increasing demand for clean energy and the need for utilities to adapt to a changing energy landscape.Furthermore, PGE's success in securing $250 million in federal grants for transmission network investments is a strong indicator of the company's ability to leverage government resources to improve infrastructure. This not only enhances customer reliability but also positions PGE favorably in the market for future federal infrastructure initiatives. The financial implications of these grants can lead to improved long-term profitability by reducing the capital expenditure burden on PGE and its shareholders. Sustainability Consultant PGE's commitment to social responsibility and environmental stewardship is evident through its actions detailed in the ESG report. The protection of over 11,000 acres of conservation lands and the record fish returns at the North Fork Dam underscore the company's dedication to biodiversity and ecosystem health. Such initiatives can enhance PGE's reputation among consumers and investors who prioritize corporate environmental responsibility, potentially leading to increased customer loyalty and investor interest.The establishment of the Community Benefits and Impacts Advisory Group shows a proactive approach to stakeholder engagement, particularly with low-income and historically underserved communities. This level of engagement is essential for maintaining social license to operate and can mitigate reputational risks associated with energy projects. It also aligns with broader ESG investment criteria, which are becoming increasingly important for attracting capital from socially conscious investors.

The offering is subject to customary closing conditions.","Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc. Prices Public Offering of $400 Million of 6.375% Unsecured Notes Due 2027 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc. (GSBD) announced the pricing of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% notes due 2027 to pay down debt under its revolving credit facility. The offering is subject to customary closing conditions. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc.'s announcement of a $400 million notes offering is a strategic financial move that has implications for the company's capital structure and liquidity. The interest rate of 6.375% is a critical figure, reflecting the cost of capital for the company compared to the current interest rate environment. Considering the Federal Reserve's rate hikes to combat inflation, this rate may be competitive and attractive to investors seeking yield in a higher interest rate environment.The decision to use the proceeds to pay down debt under its revolving credit facility suggests a proactive approach to debt management. This could potentially improve the company's leverage ratios and financial flexibility. However, investors should consider the potential for increased financial risk if the company cannot generate enough returns to cover the cost of this new debt, especially in an economic downturn. Market Research Analyst The offering of the 2027 Notes by Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc. is indicative of the broader trend in the business development company (BDC) sector, where firms often raise capital through debt issuances to fund investments and operations. The BDC industry is known for providing financing to small and mid-sized businesses and the health of this sector can serve as a barometer for the broader economy. The successful closing of this offering could signal investor confidence in the BDC model and Goldman Sachs BDC's specific investment strategy.It's also important to note that the ability to redeem the notes at par plus a 'make-whole' premium provides the company with some flexibility to manage its interest expenses in the future. Stakeholders should monitor the company's subsequent investment decisions, as the effective deployment of the net proceeds could lead to portfolio growth and potentially higher distributions. Debt Capital Markets Expert The terms of the 2027 Notes, including the 'make-whole' premium, are significant as they dictate the cost of early redemption for the company. This premium is designed to compensate investors for the potential loss of interest income if the company chooses to redeem the notes before maturity. The presence of this feature can make the notes more attractive to investors, as it offers a form of protection against early redemption.From a capital markets perspective, the successful pricing of the offering reflects investor appetite for fixed-income securities issued by financial institutions like Goldman Sachs BDC. The maturity date of 2027 suggests a medium-term horizon, which could appeal to investors looking for a balance between yield and duration risk. The closing of this offering under 'customary closing conditions' will be watched closely by the market, as any deviations could impact investor sentiment towards the company and its securities. 03/06/2024 - 05:50 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc.

The company will make voluntary water conservation commitments to ensure long-term sustainability. The agreement aims to balance mineral extraction with lake health, following new legislative amendments. Compass Minerals' Ogden facility, operating on the lake for over 50 years, will work towards a binding Voluntary Agreement with FFSL. Positive None. Negative None. Environmental Economist The agreement between Compass Minerals and the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire and State Lands (FFSL) represents a significant stride in aligning mineral extraction practices with environmental sustainability goals. The focus on voluntary water conservation is a proactive measure that could serve as a model for other companies operating in ecologically sensitive areas. By committing to such agreements, Compass Minerals may incur upfront costs for conservation efforts, but the long-term benefits include maintaining a stable operating environment and potentially avoiding more stringent future regulations.From an economic standpoint, the ability to negotiate severance tax relief through these agreements is a strategic move. It can improve the financial position of Compass Minerals by reducing tax liabilities in exchange for environmentally conscious practices. This approach also indicates a shift towards a more collaborative and sustainable model of resource extraction, which could enhance the company's reputation and provide a competitive advantage as consumers and investors increasingly favor environmentally responsible companies. Market Research Analyst The proactive engagement of Compass Minerals in negotiating a Voluntary Agreement with FFSL is likely to resonate positively with stakeholders concerned about environmental sustainability. The potential severance tax relief and protection against eminent domain actions, as outlined in House Bill 453, offer financial incentives that could positively impact the company's bottom line. However, the market will be watching closely to see how these measures translate into actual cost savings and whether they can offset the investments required for water conservation.Furthermore, the company's involvement in policy and advisory groups and its long-standing operation in the region, suggest a deep-rooted commitment to the local ecosystem and community. As investors are increasingly applying Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria in their investment decisions, Compass Minerals' actions could attract ESG-focused funds and socially responsible investors, potentially influencing the stock's attractiveness. Sustainability Expert The commitment by Compass Minerals to preserve the Great Salt Lake's ecosystem through a binding Voluntary Agreement is a notable example of corporate environmental responsibility. The company's role in producing essential minerals like sulfate of potash, salt and magnesium chloride is critical for various industries, but it also comes with a responsibility to mitigate environmental impact. By actively participating in water conservation efforts, Compass Minerals is not only contributing to the health of the Great Salt Lake but also setting a precedent for sustainability in the mining sector.The extraction of minerals from natural bodies of water often leads to ecological imbalances. Compass Minerals' approach, as indicated by the Term Sheet, suggests a willingness to adapt operations in response to fluctuating lake levels, which is commendable. This strategy could reduce the risk of adverse environmental effects and ensure the longevity of the lake's natural resources, which is essential for the continued production of the company's mineral products. 03/06/2024 - 06:40 PM OVERLAND PARK, Kan.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Compass Minerals (NYSE:CMP), a leading global provider of essential minerals, today announced that it has agreed to a Term Sheet with the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire and State Lands (FFSL) outlining voluntary water conservation and other commitments the company will be making in an effort to help preserve the long-term sustainability of the Great Salt Lake. Compass Minerals and FFSL are currently crafting a binding Voluntary Agreement based on the framework established within the Term Sheet. “We recognize that a healthy Great Salt Lake is essential to both the environmental and economic well-being of the region,” said Edward C. Dowling Jr., president and CEO. “We are proud to be pursuing this Voluntary Agreement with FFSL and are committed to actively contributing to the health and preservation of this vital natural resource.” Compass Minerals’ Ogden facility has operated on the Great Salt Lake for over half a century, producing sulfate of potash, salt and magnesium chloride from the lake’s mineral-enriched brine. The company’s Ogden operation currently provides nearly 400 local jobs and representatives of Compass Minerals participate on multiple policy and advisory groups focused on ensuring a healthy lake ecosystem. As part of its regulatory authorities, FFSL is responsible for managing Utah’s sovereign lands, including the beds and banks of navigable rivers and lakes within the State. “This agreement provides a framework where critical minerals can be extracted when the lake is at appropriate levels, and water is conserved as lake levels decline,” said Jamie Barnes, FFSL Director and State Forester. “We are pleased that Compass Minerals has actively pursued an agreement with FFSL, which will be the first of its kind for Great Salt Lake.” During the 2024 legislative session, the Utah Legislature passed House Bill 453 (H.B.453), “Great Salt Lake Revisions,” which amends and expands current state statute governing mineral extraction on the Great Salt Lake, including but not limited to new severance taxes and a requirement for the state to develop a mandatory water distribution plan for mineral extractors on the lake. Also included within H.B.453 were provisions allowing mineral companies to enter into Voluntary Agreements with FFSL, thereby enabling severance tax relief, protections against potential eminent domain actions and the ability to proactively negotiate voluntary water conservation commitments. “It’s critical we strike the right balance between industry’s ability to extract the various minerals found in the lake without compromising the health of the lake,” added Great Salt Lake Commissioner Brian Steed. “We are committed to safeguarding the lake’s ecological integrity while incentivizing extraction methods that prioritize sustainability and mitigate impacts to the lake. The Commissioner’s Office appreciates the leadership of the Legislature and the willingness of Compass Minerals to take these important steps to protect the Great Salt Lake.” About Compass Minerals Compass Minerals (NYSE:CMP) is a leading global provider of essential minerals focused on safely delivering where and when it matters to help solve nature’s challenges for customers and communities. The company’s salt products help keep roadways safe during winter weather and are used in numerous other consumer, industrial, chemical and agricultural applications.

McClory, has acquired a majority stake in the company, solidifying his confidence in Brera's potential and signaling a new era of international expansion. McClory's extensive experience in investment banking and growth companies positions him to drive Brera's growth and success. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The acquisition of a majority stake by Brera Holdings' Executive Chairman, Daniel J. McClory, is a significant financial event that could potentially influence the company's stock performance. McClory's increased investment to a 54.5% ownership stake and control of 83.7% of voting rights represents a strong vote of confidence in the company's direction and future growth prospects. Given McClory's extensive background in investment banking and international finance, this move may be interpreted by investors as a bullish signal, suggesting that the company may have strategic plans that could enhance shareholder value.McClory's global experience and the expansion of Brera's Advisory Board with international business leaders could facilitate the company's international focus and expansion. This could lead to diversification of revenue streams and potential resilience against market-specific risks. However, investors should also consider the implications of such concentrated ownership, as it might lead to significant influence over corporate decisions by a single entity, potentially affecting minority shareholder interests. Market Research Analyst Brera Holdings operates within the sports industry as a multi-club ownership (MCO) entity, a relatively novel concept in the realm of global football. The MCO model allows for synergies between clubs in terms of marketing, talent development and commercial strategies. McClory's investment and the company's strategic shift towards internationalization could capitalize on the growing global interest in football, tapping into new markets and fanbases. This could lead to increased brand recognition and revenue generation from merchandise sales, broadcasting rights and sponsorships.However, it's essential to analyze the competitive landscape, as the sports industry is highly competitive with established players. Brera's success will depend on its ability to effectively manage multiple clubs, leverage economies of scale and maintain competitive performance on the field, which ultimately drives fan engagement and revenue. Legal Expert With Daniel J. McClory's acquisition of a majority stake in Brera Holdings, it is crucial to consider the legal and regulatory implications of such a transaction. The consolidation of voting power in the hands of the Executive Chairman raises questions about corporate governance and the balance of power within the company. Regulatory bodies may scrutinize the transaction to ensure compliance with securities laws and regulations concerning market concentration and disclosure requirements.Furthermore, the international scope of the company's operations and its plans for expansion necessitate careful navigation of various legal jurisdictions and compliance with foreign investment regulations. The company must also be mindful of the legal complexities surrounding the ownership and management of multiple football clubs, including player contracts, intellectual property rights and league regulations. 03/06/2024 - 05:49 PM Brera’s Executive Chairman triples his investmentDUBLIN, Ireland and MILAN, Italy, March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Brera Holdings PLC (“Brera Holdings”, “Brera” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: BREA) announces today that its Executive Chairman, Daniel J.

RPMs decreased by 10.9%, with a load factor increase of 2.8 pp YoY to 85.9%. Passenger numbers dropped by 15.2% compared to February 2023, with Mexican domestic RPMs decreasing by 21.5%. International RPMs increased by 13.2%, and Volaris transported 2.1 million passengers in February 2024. Volaris' strategic plan includes reallocating capacity to the international market, achieving a robust load factor in February. The future performance of Volaris depends on various factors, and past performance may not indicate future results. Negative None. Market Research Analyst An analysis of Volaris' February 2024 traffic results indicates a strategic shift in their operational focus. The decrease in ASM capacity by 13.7% year-over-year, primarily due to Pratt & Whitney engine inspections, suggests a significant impact on the airline's fleet availability. Despite the reduced capacity, the increase in load factor to 85.9% reflects efficient capacity management and could signal a positive adjustment in pricing strategies or demand forecasting. The reallocation of capacity from the Mexican domestic market to international routes is a noteworthy development, potentially indicating a response to market dynamics or a strategic pivot towards more lucrative international segments.From a market perspective, the 21.5% decrease in domestic RPMs coupled with a 13.2% increase in international RPMs could imply that Volaris is experiencing a shift in consumer preference or is actively targeting international growth markets. This strategic reallocation might be a proactive measure to optimize revenue streams and could result in different competitive dynamics in both domestic and international markets. The reported performance aligns with the CEO’s statement on meeting quarterly guidance, which could reassure investors about the company's short-term outlook despite operational challenges. Financial Analyst The reported 15.2% decrease in passenger numbers year-over-year presents a potential concern for revenue, but this must be contextualized with the increase in load factor and the shift in operational strategy. The financial implications of these metrics will depend on the yield (revenue per passenger mile) and cost management. The increase in load factor typically indicates better revenue efficiency, but it is essential to assess whether this has been achieved at the expense of yield due to potential discounting to fill seats.Furthermore, the decrease in ASMs and the costs associated with the Pratt & Whitney engine inspections need to be evaluated in terms of their impact on the company's cost structure and profitability. Investors should look for trends in operational expenses and how they correlate with these traffic results in the upcoming earnings report. The ability of Volaris to manage these operational disruptions and maintain financial performance will be critical in assessing the company's resilience and operational efficiency. Aviation Industry Expert The aviation industry often faces challenges such as the one Volaris encountered with the need for accelerated Pratt & Whitney engine inspections. Such maintenance issues are not uncommon but can have a significant impact on an airline's operations. Volaris' proactive measures, such as capacity reallocation, demonstrate a strategic approach to mitigating the adverse effects of grounded aircraft. This also highlights the importance of fleet management and maintenance operations in the airline industry.The shift in focus to international routes is a strategic move that could be interpreted as a response to the competitive landscape or as a pursuit of higher-margin opportunities. Understanding the broader industry trends, such as regional economic conditions, travel restrictions and consumer behavior, is crucial in evaluating the long-term implications of Volaris' strategy. The airline's ability to adapt to these trends and optimize its route network accordingly will be a key factor in its sustained growth and market share. 03/06/2024 - 06:31 PM MEXICO CITY, March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Controladora Vuela Compañía de Aviación, S.A.B. de C.V.

Financial Analyst GeoPark Limited's financial results for 4Q2023 and FY2023 demonstrate a robust financial performance despite market headwinds. The company reported an Adjusted EBITDA of $451.9 million with a high EBITDA margin of 60%, indicating strong operational efficiency. Notably, the Adjusted EBITDA to capital expenditures ratio of 2.3x reflects capital discipline and efficient resource allocation. Furthermore, the return on average capital employed at 35% is impressive, especially when considering the one-off costs from Chile's divestment and the impact of a higher effective tax rate due to Colombia's new income surtax. The company's strategy to balance shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks, achieving a 13% capital return yield, is commendable and suggests confidence in its financial health and asset quality. Energy Sector Analyst GeoPark's operational highlights, such as the 10% increase in quarterly average oil and gas production in 4Q2023 compared to 3Q2023, are significant in the context of the broader energy sector. The success of exploration efforts in the Llanos 123 and 87 blocks, as well as the resumption of production in the CPO-5 Block, contributed to this growth. The 110% 2P Replacement Ratio indicates that the company is successfully replenishing its reserves, which is crucial for long-term sustainability. GeoPark's ESG rating upgrade to 'AA' by MSCI reflects its commitment to environmental and social governance, which is increasingly important to investors and may enhance its reputation and investor appeal in a market that values sustainable practices. Market Research Analyst GeoPark's tender offer to purchase up to $50 million of its common shares represents a strategic move to enhance shareholder value and reflects management's confidence in the company's intrinsic value. This buyback, at a price range of $9.00 to $10.00 per share, could affect the stock's liquidity and potentially its market price. The company's strong cash position and low net leverage ratio of 0.8 times provide it with the financial flexibility to pursue such capital return initiatives. However, investors should consider the potential dilution effects and the opportunity cost of not investing this capital into further exploration and development activities, which might drive future growth. 03/06/2024 - 05:24 PM Improved Volume Delivery in 4Q2023 Underpins Sustained Cash Returns Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.136 Per Share Tender Offer for up to $50 Million Shares MSCI ESG Rating Upgraded to ‘AA’: ESG Leader BOGOTA, Colombia--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- GeoPark Limited (“GeoPark” or the “Company”) (NYSE: GPRK), a leading independent Latin American oil and gas explorer, operator, and consolidator, reports its consolidated financial results for the three-month period ended December 31, 2023 (“Fourth Quarter” or “4Q2023”) and for the year ended December 31, 2023 (“Full Year” or “FY2023”). A conference call to discuss these financial results will be held on March 7, 2024, at 10:00 am (Eastern Standard Time). FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR 2023 SUMMARY In 2023, GeoPark delivered $451.9 million Adjusted EBITDA, an EBITDA margin of 60%, and $111.1 million of net profit. These results were leveraged by the success of new exploration and development campaigns and ongoing efficiencies in our operated assets. Results were achieved despite i) lower realization prices compared to 2022, ii) lower volumes due to the effects of a partial shut-in at the CPO-5 Block (GeoPark non-operated, 30% WI) during the first 9 months of 2023; and iii) a higher effective tax rate. During 2023, GeoPark invested $199.0 million in capital expenditures to drill 48 gross wells, which resulted in a 110% 2P Replacement Ratio and annual average production of 36,563 boepd. 4Q2023 quarterly average oil and gas production reached 38,315 boepd, up 10% compared to 3Q2023, supported by exploration successes in the Llanos 123 and 87 blocks (GeoPark operated, 50% WI), CPO-5 Block and Perico Block (GeoPark non-operated, 50% WI) in Ecuador, and the resumption of shut-in production in the CPO-5 Block. Improved operating results during 4Q2023 translated into $117.8 million Adjusted EBITDA for 4Q2023, the highest of 2023. Despite lower annual production and realization prices, GeoPark reported a solid and resilient cash generation with an Adjusted EBITDA of $451.9 million, underpinned by lower production and operating costs, lower hedge losses and lower administrative costs. Capital efficiency was once again a key feature of the year. Each dollar invested in capital expenditures yielded $2.3 in Adjusted EBITDA and the return on average capital employed reached 35%. Annual net profit in 2023 reached $111.1 million (approximately $2 per share), 51% lower than in 2022, mainly impacted by one-off costs and impairments associated with Chile’s divestment, the appreciation of the Colombian peso and a higher total effective tax rate1. Nonetheless, GeoPark ended 2023 with a stronger balance sheet illustrating its sustained commitment to financial discipline. The cash position continued to strengthen and reached $133.0 million at year-end, net leverage stood at 0.8 times, and the debt profile remained robust with no principal maturities until 2027. These financial achievements and discipline allowed GeoPark to reward its shareholders with a 13% capital return yield2 or $61.2 million balanced between buybacks and dividends. The 2023 buyback program allowed GeoPark to reduce its outstanding shares by 4% to 55.3 million. In 2024 and in acknowledgement of GeoPark’s long-standing commitment to its SPEED value system, MSCI recognized GeoPark as an ESG ‘leader’ by further upgrading its rating to “AA” (GeoPark was rated as “B” in 2018, “BB” in 2019, “BBB” in 2021 and “A” in both 2022 and 2023). GeoPark also received a rating upgrade by Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Climate and reached a “B” rating (up from a “C” rating). Colombia’s licensing authority recently granted the environmental license for the Putumayo-8 Block (GeoPark operated3, 50% WI). It was the result of several years of working closely with local leaders and communities, as well as a rigorous stakeholder participation process in coordination with local and national authorities, opening a very attractive exploration target in the Putumayo Basin in Colombia and targeting to drill by the end of 2024. Looking forward to 2024, GeoPark’s organic activities will be focused on continuing the development of its core operations in the Llanos 34 (GeoPark operated, 45% WI) and CPO-5 blocks, delineating the new plays opened in 2023 and preparing new blocks for future exploration, while continuing to evaluate inorganic options that are consistent with long-term value accretion. Reinforcing its commitment to continue returning value to its shareholders, GeoPark has the intention to commence a modified “Dutch Auction” tender offer (“the tender offer”) to purchase for cash up to $50 million of GeoPark common shares at a price per share of not less than $9.00 and not greater than $10.00, which could represent approximately 10% of outstanding shares. GeoPark intends to commence the tender offer before the end of March and to fund it using cash on hand. If commenced, the tender offer will remain open for at least twenty (20) business days. Further details, including the terms and conditions of the tender offer, will be provided in the offer to purchase and other documents to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in connection with the tender offer. The tender offer is in addition to the previously approved share repurchase program in November 2023. Andrés Ocampo, Chief Executive Officer of GeoPark, said: “The fourth quarter marked a strong finish to a challenging year on the production front. Despite a lower price environment compared to 2022, GeoPark ended the year with replenished 2P reserves, sustained cash returns to shareholders, and a stronger balance sheet. We are proud to announce our upgrade by MSCI to ‘AA’ status, placing us in the ESG ‘Leader’ bracket for the first time. The intention to execute an extraordinary buyback announced today reflects the financial health of the company and our confidence in our assets, which makes share buybacks rank very high in our capital allocation contest. Further, we continue to be committed to step-changing our growth trajectory by improving our underlying base business performance as well as by expanding our portfolio of assets. This will translate into more energy, more value, and more shared prosperity. We are working decidedly in this direction.” Supplementary information is available at the following link: https://ir.geopark.com/files/doc_downloads/test.pdf __________________________ 1 Starting in fiscal year 2023, Colombia introduced an income surtax whose amount depends on Brent oil prices.

Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to various factors. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company does not undertake any obligation to update them in light of new information or future developments or to release publicly any revisions to these statements in order to reflect later events or circumstances, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. For a discussion of the risks facing the Company which could affect whether these forward-looking statements are realized, see filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Oil and gas production figures included in this press release and its supplementary information are stated before the effect of royalties paid in kind, consumption and losses. Annual production per day is obtained by dividing total production by 365 days. Non-GAAP Measures: The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and operating netback per boe, which are each non-GAAP measures, are useful because they allow the Company to more effectively evaluate its operating performance and compare the results of its operations from period to period without regard to its financing methods or capital structure. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, and operating netback per boe may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA: The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as profit for the period before net finance costs, income tax, depreciation, amortization and certain non-cash items such as impairments and write-offs of unsuccessful exploration and evaluation assets, accrual of stock options and stock awards, unrealized results on commodity risk management contracts and other non-recurring events. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of profit or cash flow as determined by IFRS. The Company excludes the items listed above from profit for the period in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, profit for the period or cash flow from operating activities as determined in accordance with IFRS or as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure and significant and/or recurring write-offs, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDA. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the IFRS financial measure of profit, see the accompanying financial tables and the supplementary information. Operating Netback per boe: Operating netback per boe should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, profit for the period or cash flow from operating activities as determined in accordance with IFRS or as an indicator of the Company’s operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from operating netback per boe are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure and significant and/or recurring write-offs, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of operating netback per boe. The Company’s calculation of operating netback per boe may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

Barclays and UBS Investment Bank are lead managers. The offering is subject to market conditions and SEC regulations. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Nayax Ltd.'s underwritten public offering of ordinary shares marks a significant event for the company and its investors. From a financial standpoint, the offering could provide Nayax with capital to accelerate growth, fund research and development, or expand its market reach. The sale of shares by major insiders, including the CEO, could be indicative of their confidence in the company's valuation or a signal of diversification in their personal investment portfolios.Investors should assess the offering's price relative to current market conditions and historical performance. Additionally, the 'greenshoe' option granted to the underwriters, allowing them to purchase additional shares, is a common practice intended to stabilize the stock price post-offering. However, this could also lead to dilution of existing shareholders' equity if fully exercised.The involvement of established financial institutions as book-runners and managers, such as Barclays and UBS Investment Bank, typically adds credibility to the offering. Nevertheless, investors should consider the underwriting discounts and commissions, which will affect the net proceeds to Nayax. Market Research Analyst Nayax operates in the fintech space, offering a platform that combines commerce enablement, payments and loyalty programs. The success of their public offering could be contingent on the current fintech market trends and investor appetite for such equity. A key consideration is the competitive environment and how Nayax differentiates itself with its commerce enablement and loyalty solutions.Long-term growth potential in the fintech sector is promising, given the shift towards cashless transactions and the integration of loyalty programs in payment systems. Nayax's positioning and strategic use of the capital raised could strengthen its market share and enhance its product offerings. However, market saturation and regulatory challenges in fintech remain risks that could impact investor perception. Legal Expert The legal framework surrounding public offerings is rigorous, with the SEC requiring detailed disclosures to protect investors. Nayax's adherence to SEC regulations, including the filing of a registration statement and prospectus, is a critical step in ensuring transparency. The preliminary prospectus supplement provides vital information regarding the use of proceeds, risks and the company's financial position.It is also important to note that the offering is not an open invitation to the public but is subject to regulatory compliance and qualification under the securities laws. This legal structuring is designed to prevent unlawful sales and ensure that investors have access to all necessary information to make informed decisions. 03/06/2024 - 05:33 PM HERZLIYA, Israel, March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nayax Ltd.

The acquisition, valued at approximately $22.3 million USD, will enhance Nayax's global footprint by serving over 18,300 additional unattended points of sale across various industries in Brazil. This move is expected to boost Nayax's net income and solidify its position in the automated self-service industry.","Nayax Enters Definitive Agreement to Acquire VMtecnologia Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Nayax Ltd. announces the strategic acquisition of VMtecnologia, a top technology provider in Brazil, to expand its presence in the Latin American market. The acquisition, valued at approximately $22.3 million USD, will enhance Nayax's global footprint by serving over 18,300 additional unattended points of sale across various industries in Brazil. This move is expected to boost Nayax's net income and solidify its position in the automated self-service industry. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst From a market expansion perspective, the acquisition of VMtecnologia by Nayax is a strategic maneuver that is likely to enhance Nayax's competitive edge in the automated self-service industry. The Latin American market, particularly Brazil, presents a burgeoning opportunity for companies in this sector due to its large consumer base and increasing demand for automation and convenience. Nayax's move to acquire a company with an established local presence circumvents barriers to entry such as local market knowledge, regulatory challenges and brand recognition.By integrating VMtecnologia's operations, Nayax gains immediate access to an extensive network of over 2,400 retailers, which can be expected to generate synergies and cross-selling opportunities. The projected immediate contribution to net income suggests a well-calculated financial move, with the potential for revenue growth based on VMtecnologia's past performance and market position. Furthermore, the earnout component of the deal aligns interests and incentivizes the management team of VMtecnologia to continue driving growth post-acquisition. Financial Analyst Examining the financial aspects of the acquisition, the structured payment plan with a mix of cash and equity payouts, contingent upon performance, is a prudent approach to mitigate financial risk while maintaining capital efficiency for Nayax. The upfront cash payment of approximately $13.4 million USD, with subsequent payments spread over three years, provides Nayax with a manageable cash outflow and the flexibility to optimize its balance sheet. The earnout agreement, primarily in stock, further reflects confidence in the future performance of the combined entity. The total potential consideration of approximately $27.8 million USD, when compared to the additional 18,300 points of sale Nayax will serve, can be seen as a significant investment in growth.Investors should note the implications for Nayax's earnings per share (EPS), as the acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to net income. However, the dilutive effect of the earnout, if paid in equity, should also be considered. The long-term value creation will depend on the successful integration of VMtecnologia and the realization of the anticipated revenue and cost synergies. Legal Expert On the legal and regulatory front, the transaction's successful completion is contingent upon the fulfillment of closing conditions, which likely includes regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The structure of the deal, with payments tied to management retention and revenue growth targets, suggests that both parties are confident in the transaction's compliance with local laws and its potential for success. The earnout structured primarily in stock also indicates that the deal has been designed to align with corporate governance best practices, incentivizing key personnel to remain with the company and work towards shared long-term objectives.It is also important to consider the legal complexities of cross-border acquisitions, such as differing corporate laws, tax implications and potential antitrust issues. The successful navigation of these aspects will be critical to the seamless integration of VMtecnologia into Nayax's global operations. 03/06/2024 - 05:23 PM Nayax Announces Strategic Acquisition of VMtecnologia, Expanding Presence in the Latin American MarketHERZLIYA, Israel, March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nayax Ltd. (Nasdaq: NYAX; TASE: NYAX), a leading global commerce enablement, payments, and loyalty platform designed to help merchants scale their business, has today announced a definitive agreement to acquire VMtecnologia, a leading technology provider for the automated self-service industry in Brazil. This strategic acquisition marks a significant step in Nayax's expansion into the Latin American market, bolstering its global footprint. The acquisition of VMtecnologia will extend Nayax's comprehensive service offerings across Brazil as well as serves as a key milestone in fulfilling the company's international expansion growth strategy. By entering the Latin American market with a strong and immediate market presence, Nayax is poised to leverage VMtecnologia's established footprint, serving over 2,400 retailers in diverse industries across all 27 states in Brazil and more than 466 cities. This strategic move significantly enhances Nayax's global presence and its ability to offer advanced automated self-service solutions. With this expansion, Nayax will now serve over 18,300 additional unattended points of sale, including vending machines, micro markets, autonomous laundromats, and the electronic entertainment sector. The integration is anticipated to immediately contribute to Nayax's net income, underlining the strategic fit and potential for growth the acquisition represents. The purchase price, equating to an enterprise value of approximately R$ 110 million BRL (~$22.3 million USD), will be paid partially upfront in cash (R$ 66 million BRL or ~$13.4 million USD), with R$ 44 million (~$8.9 million USD) to be settled semi-annually over the next three years in cash or equity (at our option), contingent upon management retention and achieving certain revenue growth (consistent with prior experience) over a three-year period. In addition, there is an earnout of up to R$ 27.5 million BRL (~$5.6 million USD) payable primarily in stock (with the stock valued based on the value of Nayax stock at closing of the transaction) based on the achievement of significant three-year growth objectives, bringing the total potential consideration to R$ 137.5 million BRL (~$27.8 million USD). The transaction is slated for completion in Q2 2024, pending the fulfillment of closing conditions. Yair Nechmad, CEO and Chairman of Nayax, shared his excitement about the acquisition, stating, “We are excited to integrate VMtecnologia’s experienced and innovative team with Nayax, further solidifying our position in the automated self-service market. VMtecnologia’s outstanding performance and leadership in Brazil align perfectly with our strategic goals, promising a highly synergistic merger. The Brazilian automated self-service market follows the strong growth trend of the global automated self-service industry.

Despite a revenue decline of $5.1 million, the company improved its adjusted operating income by $1.6 million.

CEO Grant Moise highlighted progress towards profitability through expense savings and revenue growth. Positive None. Negative Revenue declined by $5.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 Net loss for full year 2023 was $7.1 million Total revenue decreased by $11.0 million for the full year 2023 Financial Analyst The reported financial results from DallasNews Corporation indicate a challenging fiscal period, with a net loss for both the fourth quarter and the full year of 2023. This performance suggests that investors may need to reassess the company's valuation and future earnings potential. The reduction in total revenue, particularly the significant 30.5 percent decline in advertising and marketing services revenue, reflects broader industry trends where print media continues to face headwinds from digital transformation. However, the increase in digital-only subscription revenue is a positive sign that the company's strategic pivot towards digital may be gaining traction. The expense savings reported, especially in distribution and newsprint, could be seen as effective cost management in response to declining revenues. The absence of debt and a reasonable cash position provides some financial stability, but the revenue decline may overshadow this aspect. Market Research Analyst The media industry is undergoing significant changes, with a shift from traditional print to digital platforms. DallasNews Corporation's strategic decision to exit its shared mail program and discontinue certain print-only editions aligns with the need to adapt to changing consumer preferences. The reported increase in digital subscription revenue aligns with market trends where media companies are focusing on building digital audiences and monetizing content through subscriptions. However, the decline in print advertising revenue is concerning and reflects the challenges of transitioning to a digital-first business model. The company's efforts to improve operating margins through voluntary severance offerings and other cost-saving measures are crucial for long-term sustainability. The impact of these strategic changes on the company's market share and competitive position will be critical to monitor in the coming quarters. Media Industry Analyst The reported financials from DallasNews Corporation provide insights into the ongoing transformation within the media sector. The company's decision to end its shared mail program and discontinue certain niche publications is indicative of the broader industry's move away from print towards digital media. This strategic shift may help the company align better with the evolving media consumption habits, where there is a growing preference for digital content. The increase in digital-only subscription revenue is a testament to the potential of digital platforms to drive future growth. It is also noteworthy that the company has managed to reduce its headcount and operating expenses without incurring any debt, which may position it favorably for a more agile operation in a competitive media landscape. However, the full impact of these changes on the company's brand and its ability to attract and retain a digital audience will be a key factor in its future success. 03/06/2024 - 05:25 PM DALLAS, March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DallasNews Corporation (Nasdaq: DALN) today reported a fourth quarter 2023 net loss of $2.2 million, or $(0.41) per share, and an operating loss of $2.5 million, which includes expense of $2.7 million related to the Voluntary Severance Program. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company reported a net loss of $2.1 million, or $(0.40) per share, and an operating loss of $1.9 million. For the fourth quarter of 2023, on a non-GAAP basis, DallasNews reported operating income adjusted for certain items (“adjusted operating income (loss)”) of $0.6 million, an improvement of $1.6 million when compared to an adjusted operating loss of $1.0 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2022. The improvement is primarily due to expense savings of $3.1 million in distribution, $1.6 million in employee compensation and benefits, $1.1 million in newsprint and $0.6 million in outside services, partially offset by a total revenue decline of $5.1 million. For the full year 2023, the Company reported a net loss of $7.1 million, or $(1.33) per share, and an operating loss of $8.1 million. For the full year 2022, the Company reported a net loss of $9.8 million, or $(1.83) per share, and an operating loss of $9.0 million. For the full year 2023, on a non-GAAP basis, the Company reported an adjusted operating loss of $2.7 million, an improvement of $2.6 million when compared to an adjusted operating loss of $5.3 million reported for the full year 2022. The improvement is primarily due to expense savings of $7.0 million in distribution, $2.2 million in outside services, $2.2 million in newsprint, $0.8 million in property rental and $0.6 million in employee compensation and benefits, partially offset by a total revenue decline of $11.0 million. The $7.0 million expense savings in distribution and total revenue decline of $11.0 million are primarily the result of the Company’s strategic decision to exit its shared mail program and discontinue print-only editions of its niche publications, Al Dia and Briefing, at the end of August 2023. Grant Moise, Chief Executive Officer, said, “I am pleased with the progress we made in 2023 as we get closer to our objective of creating a sustainably profitable media and marketing company. I am encouraged by our ability to grow membership revenue for the third consecutive year, as a result of our focus on balancing volume and price. In the fourth quarter, we executed a successful voluntary severance offering which was a necessary step to improve our operating margins entering 2024.” Fourth Quarter ResultsTotal revenue was $34.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease of $5.1 million or 13.1 percent when compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Revenue from advertising and marketing services, including print and digital revenues, was $12.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease of $5.6 million or 30.5 percent when compared to the $18.4 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2022. The decline is primarily due to a $5.3 million or 45.6 percent reduction in print advertising revenue resulting from the Company ending its shared mail program to deliver weekly preprints and inserts. Circulation revenue was $17.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of $0.5 million or 3.2 percent when compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Digital-only subscription revenue increased $1.2 million or 34.1 percent, partially offset by a print circulation decline of $0.6 million or 4.8 percent. Printing, distribution and other revenue was $4.0 million, a slight decrease when compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Total consolidated operating expense in the fourth quarter of 2023, on a GAAP basis, was $36.5 million, an improvement of $4.6 million or 11.2 percent when compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. The improvement is primarily due to expense savings of $3.1 million in distribution, $1.1 million in newsprint and $0.6 million in outside services, partially offset by an increase of $0.8 million in employee compensation and benefits expense. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted operating expense was $33.4 million, an improvement of $6.7 million or 16.7 percent when compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. In addition to the expense savings discussed above, excluding severance, employee compensation and benefits expense improved $1.6 million. Full Year ResultsTotal revenue was $139.7 million for the full year 2023, a decrease of $11.0 million or 7.3 percent when compared to the full year 2022. Revenue from advertising and marketing services, including print and digital revenues, was $59.0 million in 2023, a decrease of $10.6 million or 15.3 percent when compared to the $69.7 million reported for the full year 2022. Print advertising revenue declined $9.8 million or 21.8 percent, driven by an $8.8 million reduction in preprint advertising revenue primarily resulting from the Company ending its shared mail program. Digital advertising and marketing services revenue declined $0.9 million or 3.5 percent. Circulation revenue was $65.3 million for the full year 2023, an increase of $0.2 million when compared to the full year 2022. Digital-only subscription revenue increased $3.2 million or 24.1 percent, partially offset by a print circulation decline of $3.0 million or 5.8 percent. Printing, distribution and other revenue decreased $0.5 million, or 3.1 percent, to $15.3 million, primarily due to reductions in revenue from commercial printing and third-party distribution. Total consolidated operating expense for the full year 2023, on a GAAP basis, was $147.8 million, an improvement of $11.9 million or 7.4 percent compared to the full year 2022. The improvement is primarily due to expense savings of $7.0 million in distribution, $2.2 million in outside services, $2.2 million in newsprint, $1.2 million in depreciation, $0.8 million in property rental, partially offset by an increase of $2.3 million in employee compensation and benefits expense. The $7.0 million expense savings in distribution is primarily the result of the Company exiting its shared mail program and discontinuing print-only editions of its niche publications. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted operating expense was $142.4 million, an improvement of $13.5 million or 8.7 percent when compared to $155.9 million of adjusted operating expense in the full year 2022. In addition to the expense savings discussed above, excluding severance, employee compensation and benefits expense improved $0.6 million.

The Company believes that inclusion of certain noncash expenses and other items in the results makes for more difficult comparisons between years and with peer group companies. Adjusted operating income (loss) is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Management uses adjusted operating income (loss) and similar measures in internal analyses as supplemental measures of the Company’s financial performance, and for performance comparisons versus its peer group of companies. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure for the purposes of evaluating consolidated Company performance. The Company therefore believes that the non-GAAP measure presented provides useful information to investors by allowing them to view the Company’s business through the eyes of management and the Board of Directors, facilitating comparison of results across historical periods and providing a focus on the underlying ongoing operating performance of its business. Adjusted operating income (loss) should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss), cash flows provided by (used for) operating activities or other comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, this non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies. What was DallasNews Corporation's net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023?

(NYSE: PRU) and Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated (NYSE: RGA) have been selected in a pension risk transfer involving Verizon Communications Inc. The transaction will settle approximately $5.9 billion of Verizon pension liabilities and will provide retirement security for a population that includes 56,000 Verizon retirees and their beneficiaries who commenced their benefits before Jan. 1, 2023. Prudential and RGA will each irrevocably guarantee and assume 50% of the benefit obligation to the retirees, except in certain jurisdictions where Prudential will irrevocably guarantee and assume 100% of the benefit obligation. Prudential and RGA, organizations with a long history of providing lifetime income to individuals, are well positioned to meet this commitment. The transaction marks the second major pension risk transfer agreement between Prudential and Verizon. In 2012, Prudential completed an approximately $7.5 billion transfer that covered approximately 41,000 of Verizon’s retirees. “Prudential is once again proud to help secure the pension benefits of Verizon’s retirees, along with RGA for this transaction, with whom we have a long-standing relationship,” said Alexandra Hyten, head of Institutional Retirement Strategies. “That, along with Prudential’s deep experience and leadership in managing and administering retirement benefits, will provide Verizon’s retirees a seamless transition with the superior service they expect and deserve.” Under the terms of the agreement, The Prudential Insurance Company of America, a subsidiary of Prudential Financial, will assume complete responsibility for administrative services. This includes providing protected retirement income payments to this transaction’s population of retirees and their beneficiaries on behalf of Prudential and, where applicable, on behalf of RGA, beginning July 1, 2024. “We are proud to work with Prudential to help secure pension payments for Verizon retirees,” said David Lipovics, senior vice president, head of institutional markets, RGA. “This transaction ensures the financial protection of retirees and their families. As the second jumbo transaction in 2024, it also underscores continued momentum in the U.S. pension risk transfer market.” With this transaction, Prudential has completed four of the six largest U.S. pension risk transfers on record.

Announces Q4 2023 Results and Cash Distribution of $0.45 per Share for the First Quarter 2024 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary ArrowMark Financial Corp. (BANX) declares a cash distribution of $0.45 per share for Q1 2024, exceeding its net income of $0.67 per share for Q4 2023. Shareholders of record on March 21, 2024, will receive the distribution on March 28, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a cash distribution of $0.45 per share by ArrowMark Financial Corp. for the first quarter of 2024 is a pivotal development for shareholders. The distribution aligns with the company's objective to provide consistent income to its investors. The reported net income of $0.67 per share for Q4 2023, which exceeds the distribution amount, suggests a strong financial performance and could indicate a robust underlying business model.From a financial analysis standpoint, the ability of the Fund to 'over-earn' its quarterly distribution rate over the past four years demonstrates financial stability and reliability. This performance may lead to increased investor confidence and could potentially have a positive impact on the stock's attractiveness as an income-generating investment. However, investors should consider the payout ratio in relation to the earnings to assess the sustainability of these distributions. Market Research Analyst ArrowMark Financial's announcement must be contextualized within the broader market and its competitive landscape. Closed-end management investment companies are often evaluated based on their distribution yields and the consistency of their payments. The announcement of a distribution that is supported by earnings is a positive sign that may differentiate ArrowMark Financial from competitors who may not sustain such payouts.Furthermore, the market's response to this news could be influenced by the current interest rate environment and investor sentiment towards yield-generating assets. In a low-interest-rate environment, for instance, such distributions can make ArrowMark Financial more appealing to income-focused investors. Economist An economist's perspective would highlight the implications of ArrowMark Financial's distribution in relation to macroeconomic conditions. The ability to maintain and potentially grow distributions over time can be reflective of not only company-specific factors but also of economic stability and favorable investment conditions.It is important to monitor economic indicators such as inflation rates and GDP growth, as these can affect the company's asset performance and, consequently, its distribution capabilities. Additionally, the current economic climate can influence investor demand for such income vehicles. A shift in the economic landscape could alter the attractiveness of ArrowMark Financial's distributions and impact its stock valuation. 03/06/2024 - 05:30 PM DENVER, March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ArrowMark Financial Corp.

VSE Corporation Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Results,2024-03-06T21:30:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"VSE Corporation (VSEC) reports record revenue and profitability for its Aviation segment in the fourth quarter and full year 2023. The company's strong financial performance is attributed to above-market revenue growth, improved profitability, and strategic acquisitions. VSE is well-positioned for growth in 2024 with new investments, acquisitions, and a focus on execution.","VSE Corporation Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary VSE Corporation (VSEC) reports record revenue and profitability for its Aviation segment in the fourth quarter and full year 2023. The company's strong financial performance is attributed to above-market revenue growth, improved profitability, and strategic acquisitions. VSE is well-positioned for growth in 2024 with new investments, acquisitions, and a focus on execution. Positive Record revenue and profitability in the Aviation segment drove VSE Corporation's outstanding financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. VSE's Aviation segment reported a 43% year-over-year revenue increase to a record $153.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. The Fleet segment also saw a 26% year-over-year revenue increase to $81.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. VSE announced the acquisition of Turbine Controls Inc. for approximately $120 million, enhancing its aftermarket maintenance, repair, and overhaul services. The company completed the sale of its Federal and Defense segment operating assets for a total cash consideration of $44.0 million. VSE is considering a corporate restructuring plan and headquarters relocation, which may result in adjustments to its financial statements throughout 2024. The company reaffirmed its full-year 2024 guidance for both the Aviation and Fleet segments, expecting continued revenue growth and improved profitability. VSE reported total net debt of $422 million and $114 million of trailing-twelve months Adjusted EBITDA as of December 31, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $31.4 million, representing a 45.7% increase compared to the same period in 2022. Negative The company is expecting one-time transaction expenses in the first quarter of 2024 related to the sale of its Federal and Defense segment. VSE's corporate cost restructuring plan and headquarters relocation may lead to significant adjustments to its financial statements in 2024. The Fleet segment's Adjusted EBITDA margin declined slightly in the fourth quarter of 2023 due to customer and product mix factors. Financial Analyst The reported financial results by VSE Corporation, including a 37% increase in total revenues and a 62% increase in GAAP Net Income for Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022, indicate robust growth and improved profitability. The Aviation segment's record revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth of 43% and 52% respectively, suggest a strong competitive position, likely due to effective program execution, product line expansion and strategic acquisitions such as Desser Aerospace. The Fleet segment's diversification efforts and growth in commercial sales, representing over 50% of its revenue, demonstrate resilience and adaptability in a dynamic market.From a financial perspective, the increase in Adjusted EPS by 31% and a significant 46% rise in Adjusted EBITDA for the year are particularly noteworthy, as these figures often provide a clearer picture of a company's operational performance by excluding one-time charges and other non-recurring events. The company's net leverage ratio remaining at 3.7x, despite an increase in net debt, suggests a stable debt-to-EBITDA ratio, which is a critical indicator of financial health and debt management. Investors will likely view the reaffirmed guidance for 2024 positively, signaling management's confidence in continued growth and profitability. Market Research Analyst VSE Corporation's strategic moves, including the acquisition of Turbine Controls Inc. and the divestiture of the Federal and Defense segment, highlight a focused realignment towards its core Aviation and Fleet services. The acquisition of TCI, a provider of aftermarket MRO support services, is poised to enhance VSE's service offerings and potentially create cross-selling opportunities, contributing to the Aviation segment's growth. The divestiture of non-core assets allows for capital reallocation to more profitable segments, a strategy that can result in a more streamlined and efficient operation.The company's balance sheet optimization, with an amended credit agreement increasing the term loan and extending its maturity, provides financial flexibility and may reduce near-term liquidity risks. However, investors should monitor the outcomes of the Fleet segment's strategic review, as any resulting transaction could significantly alter the segment's contribution to the overall business. Economist The positive financial results of VSE Corporation reflect broader economic trends in the aftermarket distribution and repair services industry. The reported growth may be partially attributed to the recovery of the aviation industry post-pandemic, with increased MRO activity as airlines ramp up operations to meet rising travel demand. This uptick is a sign of economic recovery and increased business confidence.Furthermore, VSE's emphasis on commercial sales growth within its Fleet segment, particularly in e-commerce fulfillment, aligns with the broader shift towards online retail and the resulting demand for logistics and transportation services. The strategic focus on diversification and expansion into new geographies indicates an anticipation of sustained economic growth and an attempt to capitalize on emerging market opportunities. 03/06/2024 - 04:30 PM Record Revenue and Profitability for Aviation Segment Business Transformation Accelerates ALEXANDRIA, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- VSE Corporation (NASDAQ: VSEC; “VSE”, or the “Company”), a leading provider of aftermarket distribution and repair services, announced results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023.

Our Aviation segment reported record revenue and Adjusted EBITDA driven by strong program execution, an expansion of our distribution product lines and repair capabilities, and contributions from recent acquisitions. Our Fleet segment continued to diversify its customer base and reported record revenue, driven by strong growth in commercial sales and solid contributions from legacy customers.

(""TCI""), a leading provider of aftermarket maintenance, repair and overhaul (“MRO”) support services for complex engine components, as well as engine and airframe accessories. VSE will acquire TCI for a total consideration of approximately $120 million, comprising $110 million in cash and $10 million of common shares of the Company, subject to working capital adjustments. The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. FEDERAL AND DEFENSE DIVESTITURE: VSE announced the sale of substantially all of its Federal and Defense segment (“FDS”) operating assets. The FDS sale was completed in two separate transactions with two buyers for a total cash consideration of $44.0 million, which included $10.0 million as an estimated net working capital adjustment (subject to post-closing adjustments). Associated with the sale of FDS, VSE will cease use of the one remaining non-core FDS facility by the second quarter of 2024. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company is expecting to record one-time transaction expenses between $6 and $8 million, including non-recurring fees and costs in support of these transactions and employee severance and benefit related expenses. Additionally, the Company is expecting to record a $6 million non-cash charge including an impairment related to the asset not included in the sale. CORPORATE COST RESTRUCTURING: The Company is considering a corporate restructuring plan and headquarters relocation, which could result in certain adjustments to the Company's consolidated financial statements ranging between $18 to $23 million throughout 2024 depending on the resolution of certain contract and leasing agreements. The Company’s evaluation may include a facilities consolidation strategy to sublease, early terminate, or abandon its headquarters, and would be designed to reduce centralized corporate costs. FLEET SEGMENT STRATEGIC REVIEW: VSE initiated a process to explore and evaluate strategic alternatives involving the Fleet segment. The Company has not set a definitive timetable for the completion of the review, and there can be no assurances that it will result in a transaction. BALANCE SHEET OPTIMIZATION In December 2023, the Company amended and extended its credit agreement, providing for an increase of approximately $122 million on its term loan and an extension of the maturity date by one year to October 2026. SEGMENT RESULTS Aviation segment revenue increased 43% year-over-year to a record $153.7 million in the fourth quarter 2023. The year-over-year revenue growth was attributable to strong program execution on new and existing distribution awards, an increase in maintenance, repair and overhaul (“MRO”) activity, and contributions from the acquisition of Desser Aerospace. Aviation distribution and repair revenue increased 41% and 49% respectively, in the fourth quarter versus the prior-year period. The Aviation segment reported operating income of $18.8 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $12.3 million in the same period of 2022. Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased by 52% in the fourth quarter to $23.9 million, versus $15.8 million in the prior-year period, driven by strong execution on distribution programs, MRO market share gains, improved pricing and product mix, increased operating leverage, and contributions from the Desser Aerospace acquisition. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 15.6%, an increase of approximately 90 basis points compared to the prior year. Fleet segment revenue increased 26% year-over-year to $81.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Revenue from commercial customers increased 72% on a year-over-year basis, driven by strong growth in e-commerce fulfillment and commercial fleet sales. Commercial revenue represented approximately 52% of total Fleet segment revenue in the fourth quarter, compared to 38% in the prior year period and represented the first quarter in segment history of greater than 50% of revenue from Commercial customers. Revenue from the United States Postal Service (USPS) declined approximately 3% on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter, driven by mix of fleet vehicles within the installed base. The Fleet segment reported operating income of $9.0 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $5.6 million in the same period of 2022. Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 24% year-over-year to $9.8 million, while Adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.0%, a decline of 20 basis points versus the prior-year period, primarily driven by customer and product mix. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $216 million in cash and unused commitment availability under its $350 million revolving credit facility maturing in 2026. As of December 31, 2023, VSE had total net debt outstanding of $422 million and $114 million of trailing-twelve months Adjusted EBITDA.

The non-GAAP Financial Information set forth in this document is not calculated in accordance with GAAP under SEC Regulation G. We consider Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS (Diluted), EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, net debt and free cash flow as non-GAAP financial measures and important indicators of performance and useful metrics for management and investors to evaluate our business' ongoing operating performance on a consistent basis across reporting periods. These non-GAAP financial measures, however, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Net Income represents Net Income adjusted for acquisition-related costs including any earn-out adjustments, loss on sale of a business entity and certain assets, gain on sale of property, other discrete items, and related tax impact. Adjusted EPS (Diluted) is computed by dividing net income, adjusted for the discrete items as identified above and the related tax impacts, by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding. EBITDA represents net income before interest expense, income taxes, amortization of intangible assets and depreciation and other amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA (as defined above) adjusted for discrete items as identified above. Net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents. Free cash flow represents operating cash flow less capital expenditures. CONFERENCE CALL A conference call will be held Thursday, March 7, 2024 at 8:30 A.M.

Vermilion plans to increase capital return targets and accelerate share buybacks. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results of Vermilion Energy Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2023, particularly the fund flows from operations (FFO) and free cash flow (FCF), indicate a positive financial performance with a significant reduction in net debt. The company's achievement of a net debt-to-FFO ratio of under 1.0 times is a strong indicator of its improved leverage position. This ratio is a critical measure of a company's ability to service its debt and is often used by investors to gauge financial health. The 50% reduction in net debt from the 2020 peak and the lowest debt level in a decade is a testament to the company's effective debt management and operational efficiency.Furthermore, the increase in shareholder returns through dividends and share buybacks reflects confidence in the company's financial stability and commitment to delivering shareholder value. The 20% increase in the quarterly dividend and the decision to manage a capital return target of 50% of excess FCF suggest that Vermilion is prioritizing the distribution of its financial surplus to shareholders, which could potentially lead to an optimistic outlook among investors and a positive impact on the stock price. Energy Sector Analyst Vermilion's operational highlights, such as the average production of 87,597 boe/d in Q4 2023 and the year-end production averaging 83,994 boe/d, demonstrate the company's ability to maintain stable production levels. The production figures, which met the midpoint of Vermilion's annual guidance, suggest operational resilience and efficiency despite challenges such as wildfire-related downtime in Canada and maintenance downtime in Australia. The diversification of Vermilion's portfolio, with assets spread across North America and internationally, appears to mitigate regional operational risks and contribute to the company's robust performance.The planned development activities, such as the construction of the Mica Montney battery and exploration in Germany and Croatia, signal Vermilion's strategic focus on growth and expansion. The successful execution of these projects could enhance Vermilion's production capacity and reserves, potentially leading to long-term revenue growth. However, investors should be mindful of the inherent risks associated with exploration and development, such as project delays, cost overruns and the volatility of commodity prices, which could impact future financial performance. Market Research Analyst The energy sector is highly sensitive to changes in commodity prices, as evidenced by the fluctuations in average realized prices for crude oil, condensate and natural gas reported by Vermilion. The company's production mix and pricing references to WTI, Dated Brent, AECO, TTF and NBP provide a diversified price exposure, which can be advantageous in managing market volatility. Investors should note that the operating netback, an important measure of profitability per barrel of oil equivalent, stands at $57.48/boe for Q4 2023. This figure, compared to the annual operating netback of $49.22/boe, indicates a favorable cost structure and the potential for strong margins when commodity prices are high.It is also noteworthy that Vermilion's strategy includes high-grading its asset base, focusing on low emission, premium-priced European natural gas. This approach aligns with the global shift towards cleaner energy sources and could position the company favorably in markets with increasing demand for natural gas. Investors may view this as a forward-looking strategy that aligns with environmental, social and governance (ESG) trends, which are becoming increasingly important in investment decisions. 03/06/2024 - 05:05 PM CALGARY, AB, March 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Vermilion Energy Inc. (""Vermilion"", ""We"", ""Our"", ""Us"" or the ""Company"") (TSX: VET) (NYSE: VET) is pleased to report operating and condensed financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023. The audited financial statements, management discussion and analysis and annual information form for the year ended December 31, 2023 will be available on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval Plus (""SEDAR+"") at www.sedarplus.ca, on EDGAR at www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml, and on Vermilion's website at www.vermilionenergy.com. Highlights Q4 2023 Results Q4 2023 fund flows from operations (""FFO"")(1) was $372 million ($2.27/basic share)(2) and exploration and development (""E&D"") capital expenditures(3) were $143 million, resulting in free cash flow (""FCF"")(4) of $229 million ($1.40/basic share)(5).Net debt(6) decreased by $164 million in Q4 2023 to $1.1 billion, the lowest level in a decade and a 50% reduction from the peak in 2020. In addition, Vermilion returned $45 million to shareholders comprised of $16 million of dividends and $29 million of share buybacks.Production during the fourth quarter of 2023 averaged 87,597 boe/d(8), comprised of 54,216 boe/d(8) from our North American assets and 33,381 boe/d(8) from our International assets.Q4 2023 production benefited from a full quarter of production from Australia and Ireland following maintenance downtime in the prior quarter, as well as increased production in the Netherlands due to new production from our 2023 drilling program.Year End 2023 Results 2023 FFO(1) was $1,143 million ($6.98/basic share)(2) and E&D capital expenditures(3) were $590 million, resulting in FCF(4) of $552 million ($3.37/basic share)(5).Net debt(6) decreased by $266 million in 2023 to $1.1 billion, representing a trailing net debt-to-FFO ratio(7) of under 1.0 times. In addition, Vermilion returned $160 million to shareholders, comprised of $65 million in dividends and $95 million of share buybacks.Reported a 2023 net loss of $238 million ($1.45/basic share) driven by non-cash impairment charges and dispositions, partially offset by strong price realization and acquisition activity. Excluding non-cash impairments, net earnings were $536 million ($3.27/basic share).Production during 2023 averaged 83,994 boe/d(8), which was at the mid-point of our 2023 guidance range. Strong performance across many of our business units served to offset wildfire-related downtime in Canada and maintenance downtime in Australia.Year-end 2023 proved developed producing (""PDP"") reserves were 173 mmboe(9) and total proved plus probable (""2P"") reserves were 430 mmboe(9), reflecting a reserve life index of 5.6 years and 14.0 years, respectively.The after-tax net present value of PDP reserves, discounted at 10%, is $3.2 billion(9) and the after-tax net present value of 2P reserves, discounted at 10%, is $5.7 billion(9), or $28.72 per basic share(9) after deducting year-end net debt.Outlook In conjunction with our Q4 2023 release, we announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share, payable on April 15, 2024 to shareholders of record on March 28, 2024. This quarterly cash dividend represents a 20% increase over the prior quarterly dividend.Given our strong financial position and continued operational momentum, we are increasing our capital return target to 50% of excess FCF and will manage to this target on a full-year basis versus our previous effective date of April 1, 2024. Year-to-date, we have repurchased and retired 1.4 million shares and plan to increase the pace of share buybacks starting immediately.Construction of the 16,000 boe/d Mica Montney battery is progressing as planned and remains on schedule for a mid-year start-up. With the additional capacity provided by this battery, we are able to move forward with the growth phase of our Mica Montney asset, and have drilled six wells on our 16-28 BC pad that will be completed and ready for tie-in during Q2 2024.We continued to advance our deep gas exploration and development plans in Germany, with drilling operations nearly complete on the first well of our program. We expect to reach total depth in the coming weeks and will then move the rig to the next location, where the second well of our program will be drilled during Q2 2024.In Croatia, we drilled the first exploration well on the SA-7 block in Q1 2024 and reached total measured depth of 2,371 metres, where we discovered hydrocarbons in multiple zones. We plan to evaluate and test these zones during the second quarter while commencing drilling on the second of four wells planned on the SA-7 block this year. Construction of the gas plant on the SA-10 block is progressing as planned and remains on schedule for a mid-year start-up.($M except as indicated) Q4 2023 Q3 2023 Q4 2022 2023 2022 Financial Petroleum and natural gas sales 522,969 475,532 842,693 2,022,555 3,476,394 Cash flows from operating activities 343,831 118,436 495,195 1,024,528 1,814,220 Fund flows from operations (1) 372,117 270,218 284,220 1,142,611 1,634,865 Fund flows from operations ($/basic share) (2) 2.27 1.65 1.74 6.98 10.00 Fund flows from operations ($/diluted share) (2) 2.27 1.62 1.70 6.98 9.71 Net (loss) earnings (803,136) 57,309 395,408 (237,587) 1,313,062 Net (loss) earnings ($/basic share) (4.91) 0.35 2.42 (1.45) 8.03 Cash flows used in investing activities 132,932 170,404 168,053 576,435 1,059,292 Capital expenditures (3) 142,887 125,639 169,305 590,191 551,817 Acquisitions (10) 25,724 5,238 4,558 273,018 539,713 Dispositions 14,855 — — 197,007 — Asset retirement obligations settled 28,937 13,582 16,508 56,966 37,514 Repurchase of shares 28,736 11,645 — 94,838 71,659 Cash dividends ($/share) 0.10 0.10 0.08 0.40 0.28 Dividends declared 16,227 16,367 13,058 65,248 45,769 % of fund flows from operations (11) 4 % 6 % 5 % 6 % 3 % Payout (12) 188,051 155,588 198,871 712,405 635,100 % of fund flows from operations (12) 51 % 58 % 70 % 62 % 39 % Free cash flow (4) 229,230 144,575 114,915 552,420 1,083,048 Long-term debt 914,015 966,505 1,081,351 914,015 1,081,351 Net debt (6) 1,078,567 1,242,522 1,344,586 1,078,567 1,344,586 Net debt to four quarter trailing fund flows from operations (7) 0.9 1.2 0.8 0.9 0.8 Operational Production (8) Crude oil and condensate (bbls/d) 32,866 31,417 38,915 31,727 37,530 NGLs (bbls/d) 7,412 7,344 7,497 7,296 7,961 Natural gas (mmcf/d) 283.91 263.80 234.23 269.83 238.18 Total (boe/d) 87,597 82,727 85,450 83,994 85,187 Average realized prices Crude oil and condensate ($/bbl) 107.91 106.94 115.02 102.43 123.89 NGLs ($/bbl) 33.38 27.77 39.93 31.54 45.95 Natural gas ($/mcf) 8.48 6.32 17.43 8.17 18.99 Production mix (% of production) % priced with reference to WTI 29 % 34 % 38 % 33 % 38 % % priced with reference to Dated Brent 17 % 13 % 18 % 13 % 16 % % priced with reference to AECO 31 % 34 % 30 % 33 % 30 % % priced with reference to TTF and NBP 23 % 19 % 14 % 21 % 16 % Netbacks ($/boe) Operating netback (13) 57.48 49.30 70.00 49.22 70.15 Fund flows from operations ($/boe) (14) 48.83 35.76 35.08 37.90 52.65 Operating expenses 15.35 16.26 16.81 17.03 15.75 General and administration expenses 2.60 2.77 1.65 2.68 1.86 Average reference prices WTI (US $/bbl) 78.32 82.26 82.65 77.63 94.23 Dated Brent (US $/bbl) 84.05 86.76 88.71 82.62 101.19 AECO ($/mcf) 2.30 2.61 4.64 2.64 5.25 TTF ($/mcf) 17.45 14.11 38.36 17.40 48.35 Share information ('000s) Shares outstanding - basic 162,271 163,666 163,227 162,271 163,227 Shares outstanding - diluted (15) 166,456 167,904 168,616 166,456 168,616 Weighted average shares outstanding - basic 163,335 163,946 163,105 163,719 163,489 Weighted average shares outstanding - diluted (15) 163,335 166,392 167,397 163,719 168,426 (1) Fund flows from operations (FFO) is a total of segments measure comparable to net (loss) earnings that is comprised of sales less royalties, transportation, operating, G&A, corporate income tax, PRRT, windfall taxes, interest expense, realized gain (loss) on derivatives, realized foreign exchange gain (loss), and realized other income (expense).

Message to Shareholders We made significant progress in 2023 towards our debt reduction and asset high-grading initiatives, while also advancing key growth projects in Canada, Germany, and Croatia. We closed the Corrib acquisition in Ireland and completed the disposition of select non-core assets in southeast Saskatchewan early in the year. These transactions further strengthened our asset base by adding more low emission, premium-priced European natural gas to our portfolio while divesting less efficient, higher cost assets in Canada. With this high-graded asset base, we were able to deliver on the midpoint of our annual production guidance of 84,000 boe/d despite wildfire-related downtime in Western Canada and unplanned downtime in Australia. Our ability to meet annual production guidance highlights the advantages of operating a diversified portfolio as we were able to reallocate capital to offset the production impacts in Canada and Australia. With strong operational performance in the fourth quarter, we achieved average production of 87,597 boe/d in Q4 2023, representing a 6% increase over the prior quarter. Vermilion generated $1.1 billion of fund flows from operations (""FFO"") in 2023, representing the second strongest year in the history of the company. After accounting for E&D capital expenditures, we generated $552 million of free cash flow (""FCF""), of which 29%, or $160 million ($0.98 per share), was returned directly to shareholders through an increased dividend and share buybacks, and an additional $266 million ($1.62/share) was returned indirectly through debt reduction. Q4 2023 FFO and FCF was $372 million and $229 million, respectively, representing a 38% and 59% increase over the prior quarter, primarily due to higher production from our high-margin Australia and Ireland business units and tax adjustments. Net debt decreased by $266 million in 2023 to end the year at $1.1 billion, which is the lowest level in a decade and represents 0.9 times our annual FFO. This is a key milestone for the company as it aligns with our internal leverage target of one times net debt to FFO or less, and positions us for increasing shareholder returns, including a 20% increase to our quarterly dividend effective Q1 2024, previously announced with our 2024 budget. As a result of the progress achieved on debt reduction, we are now able to accelerate our return of capital. The return of capital framework outlined with our 2024 budget release in December contemplated a capital return target of 30% of excess FCF (""EFCF"") in Q1 2024, increasing to 50% of EFCF effective April 1, 2024. Given our strong financial position and continued operational momentum, we now plan to increase our capital return target to 50% of EFCF on a full-year basis for 2024 with a corresponding increase in share buybacks starting immediately, as we continue to believe share buybacks represent a competitive use of capital. Our disciplined focus on strengthening the balance sheet and high-grading the asset base, along with diligent capital allocation, has made the company much stronger and much more resilient today. We ended 2023 with a strong balance sheet and have continued our operational momentum from the fourth quarter into 2024. Our 2024 capital program is well underway and we are very pleased with how things are progressing on our three key growth initiatives in Canada, Germany and Croatia. The development of our gas prospects in Germany and Croatia will increase our exposure to premium-priced European gas, while the expansion of our Montney infrastructure in Canada will set the stage for long-term development and growth of this asset. We are excited about Vermilion's outlook and believe we have a robust portfolio capable of generating strong compounded returns for our shareholders through a combination of modest annual production growth, a resilient and growing base dividend and share buybacks. We would like to thank all our stakeholders for their ongoing support and contributions, and we look forward to providing further updates on our 2024 operational and financial results as the year progresses. Q4 2023 Operations Review North America Production from our North American operations averaged 54,216 boe/d(1) in Q4 2023, a decrease of 4% from the previous quarter due to natural declines in both Canada and the United States. In the Deep Basin, we drilled five (5.0 net), completed five (5.0 net), and brought on production four (4.0 net) Mannville liquids-rich conventional natural gas wells. At Mica we drilled the initial four (4.0 net) Montney liquids-rich shale gas wells on our BC lands as part of our winter drilling program in advance of the expected start-up of our 8-33 BC battery in mid-2024. In Saskatchewan, we completed and brought on production one (1.0 net) light and medium crude oil well, while in the United States, we participated in the drilling of six (2.0 net) non-operated light and medium crude oil wells in Wyoming. Construction of the 16,000 boe/d Mica Montney battery is progressing as planned and remains on schedule for a mid-year start-up. Once operational, this battery will more than double our Montney infrastructure capacity to approximately 20,000 boe/d. With this additional capacity, we are able to move forward with the growth phase of our Mica Montney asset, and to date have drilled eight of the 11 planned wells on or offsetting our recent 16-28 BC pad. The two wells that were previously drilled on this pad and brought on production in March 2023 have produced nearly 700,000 boe combined to the end of February 2024, including over 215,000 barrels of liquids (83% light crude oil). Six of the new wells are expected to be completed and ready for tie-in during Q2 2024 to align with the start-up of the new battery. International Production from our International operations averaged 33,381 boe/d(1) in Q4 2023, an increase of 29% over the previous quarter primarily due to a full quarter of production at our Australia and Ireland operations following maintenance downtime in the prior quarter, as well as increased production in the Netherlands due to new production from our 2023 drilling program. We continued to advance our deep gas exploration and development plans in Germany, with drilling operations nearly complete on our first well of our program. We expect to reach total depth in the coming weeks and will then move the rig to the next location, where the second well of our program will be drilled during Q2 2024. In Croatia, construction of the gas plant on the SA-10 block is progressing as planned and remains on schedule for start-up mid-year. This gas plant will facilitate production from the SA-10 block where we have previous gas discoveries. Subsequent to year-end, we commenced drilling on the first exploration well on the SA-7 block and reached total measured depth of 2,371 metres, where we discovered hydrocarbons in multiple zones. We plan to evaluate and test these zones during the second quarter while commencing drilling on the second of four wells planned on the SA-7 block this year. In addition, we recently signed a farmout agreement with the INA Group to jointly develop the SA-7 block. INA is the largest integrated oil and gas company in Croatia and brings local expertise and access to existing infrastructure that will play a critical role in developing this asset. 2023 Reserves Update Our 2023 proved developed producing (""PDP"") reserves decreased by 8% from the prior year to 172.7 mmboe(2) while our total proved plus probable (""2P"") reserves decreased by 18% from the prior year to 429.8 mmboe(2), primarily due to dispositions, production, and technical revisions, including technical revisions resulting from capital allocation decisions. Early in the year, we divested a non-core asset in southeast Saskatchewan which accounted for 11.6 mmboe of the PDP reduction and 32.4 mmboe of the 2P reduction. During the second half of the year we divested non-core assets in the USA, contributing 0.7 mmboe to the PDP reduction and 13.9 mmboe of the 2P reduction. The closing of the Corrib acquisition in Ireland in Q1 2023 added 12.5 mmboe of premium priced European gas to our PDP reserves and 17.2 mmboe to our 2P reserves. Over the past couple years, we have placed a great deal of focus on asset high-grading and advancing several key growth projects within our portfolio to increase FCF per share. As a result, some of our near-term capital allocation priorities have shifted, with a greater emphasis on funding our Mica Montney development and Germany exploration program. With this in mind, we have updated future capital allocation estimates to align with our long-term capital priorities, including our return of capital framework. As a result, we have removed or divested reserves associated with undeveloped locations that are not prioritized for investment under our current plans. The assets most impacted by these capital allocation decisions are located in the USA and Saskatchewan. Approximately 40% of the 2P technical revisions relate to capital allocation decisions and therefore, some of these formerly assigned reserves could be recognized at a future date if they align with our capital allocation parameters at that time. In addition, we expect to recognize additional reserves over time from our Mica Montney and Germany exploration program as we develop these assets. The PDP and 2P reserve life index at December 31, 2023 is 5.6 years and 14.0 years, respectively, both of which are in line with our long-term average and appropriately reflect the conventional composition of our asset base. The after-tax net present value of PDP reserves, discounted at 10%, is $3.2 billion(2) and the after-tax net present value of 2P reserves, discounted at 10%, is $5.7 billion(2), or $28.72 per basic share(3) after deducting year-end net debt.

Outlook and Guidance Update Our Q1 2024 capital program is progressing as planned with a primary focus on Montney drilling and battery construction, Germany exploration drilling and Croatia gas plant construction. Most of the production from the Q1 2024 activity will not be on stream until mid-year or later, and as a result we expect Q1 2024 production to be in the range of 83,000 to 85,000 boe/d. Organizational Update Mr. Bryce Kremnica has stepped down as Vice President of North America. We would like to thank Mr. Kremnica for his many contributions to Vermilion over the past 18 years. Mr. Randy McQuaig has been promoted to Vice President, North America and will become a member of Vermilion's Executive Committee. Mr. McQuaig has been with Vermilion since 2013 and most recently held the position of Director of Canada Business Unit Assets, a position he has held since 2021. Mr. McQuaig has 30 years of operations and executive management experience, and has a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from the University of Alberta. Commodity Hedging Vermilion hedges to manage commodity price exposures and increase the stability of our cash flows. In aggregate, as of March 6, 2024, we have 33% of our expected net-of-royalty production hedged for 2024. With respect to individual commodity products, we have hedged 46% of our European natural gas production, 28% of our crude oil production, and 29% of our North American natural gas volumes for 2024, respectively. Please refer to the Hedging section of our website under Invest With Us for further details using the following link: https://www.vermilionenergy.com/invest-with-us/hedging.

These oil and gas metrics do not have any standardized meaning or standard methods of calculation and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies where similar terminology is used and should therefore not be used to make comparisons. Natural gas volumes have been converted on the basis of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent. Barrels of oil equivalent (boe) may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet to one barrel of oil is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. This document may contain references to sustainability/ESG data and performance that reflect metrics and concepts that are commonly used in such frameworks as the Global Reporting Initiative, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, and the Value Reporting Foundation (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board). Vermilion has used best efforts to align with the most commonly accepted methodologies for ESG reporting, including with respect to climate data and information on potential future risks and opportunities, in order to provide a fuller context for our current and future operations. However, these methodologies are not yet standardized, are frequently based on calculation factors that change over time, and continue to evolve rapidly. Readers are particularly cautioned to evaluate the underlying definitions and measures used by other companies, as these may not be comparable to Vermilion's. While Vermilion will continue to monitor and adapt its reporting accordingly, the Company is not under any duty to update or revise the related sustainability/ESG data or statements except as required by applicable securities laws.

Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst VG-3927's preclinical data presented by Vigil Neuroscience represents a significant milestone in the field of neurodegenerative disease treatment. As a small molecule TREM2 agonist, VG-3927 could potentially alter the course of diseases like Alzheimer's (AD) by modulating microglial function. Microglia are the brain's resident immune cells and their dysfunction is implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative conditions. TREM2 is a receptor expressed on microglia that, when activated, can shift microglia towards a neuroprotective role.The specificity of VG-3927 in targeting TREM2 may offer advantages over broader-acting treatments, potentially reducing side effects and increasing efficacy. The transition from preclinical to clinical development, as noted with the commencement of Phase 1 trials, marks a crucial step towards validating this therapeutic approach. If successful, this could lead to a paradigm shift in how AD is treated, moving from symptomatic management to modifying the disease's progression.From an investment perspective, the progression of VG-3927 into clinical trials could have significant implications for Vigil Neuroscience's valuation. The current lack of disease-modifying therapies for AD means that a successful drug could capture a substantial market share. However, investors should be aware of the risks inherent in drug development, particularly in the notoriously challenging field of neurodegenerative diseases, where many promising candidates have failed in the past. Financial Analyst The announcement of preclinical data at a high-profile conference like AD/PD™ can have immediate effects on investor sentiment towards Vigil Neuroscience. The market for AD treatments is vast, with an estimated value of billions of dollars, given the increasing prevalence of the disease in an aging population. The novelty of VG-3927 as the first small molecule TREM2 agonist to enter clinical trials could position Vigil as a pioneer in this space, attracting investor interest and potentially leading to increases in stock price.However, the financial impact of these developments will depend on the outcomes of the ongoing Phase 1 trials and subsequent studies. Positive results could lead to partnerships, increased funding opportunities and a rise in stock valuation. On the other hand, failure to demonstrate efficacy or safety in clinical trials could result in significant financial losses. Investors should closely monitor the progress of VG-3927's clinical trials and manage their investment portfolios accordingly, considering the high-risk, high-reward nature of biotech investing. Biotech Market Analyst The biotech sector is highly sensitive to clinical trial outcomes and the implications of VG-3927's development extend beyond Vigil Neuroscience. A successful TREM2 agonist could galvanize the entire sector, leading to increased investment in similar mechanisms and potentially driving up the stock prices of companies with parallel research avenues. The focus on microglial activation and neuroinflammation is a growing trend in neurodegenerative disease research and VG-3927's preclinical data may encourage further exploration of this therapeutic target.It is essential to consider the competitive landscape. While VG-3927 is currently unique as a TREM2 agonist in clinical development, other companies may be pursuing similar targets. The long-term impact on the market will depend not only on VG-3927's clinical results but also on how it compares to other emerging therapies. Should VG-3927 prove to be safe and effective, it could set a new standard for AD treatment, but it could also face competition from other novel therapeutics in the pipeline. 03/06/2024 - 04:25 PM Presentation highlights potential for VG-3927 to treat neurodegenerative diseases associated with microglial dysfunction, like AD, due to its differentiated neuroprotective profile and ability to favorably tune microglia activationWATERTOWN, Mass., March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vigil Neuroscience, Inc.

Financial Analyst The reported net income of NL Industries for Q4 2023, in contrast to the net loss in the same period of the previous year, indicates a significant turnaround in profitability. The swing from a net loss to net income is a critical indicator of the company's operational performance and could influence investor sentiment. Highlighting the unrealized gains in marketable equity securities in Q4 2023 versus the unrealized losses in Q4 2022, it's essential to recognize the volatility these instruments can introduce into reported earnings. Unrealized gains or losses are paper values that reflect the current market valuation of securities not yet sold, which can reverse if the market conditions change.One should note that while the Q4 results are positive, the full year reflects a net loss for 2023, which could be a cause for concern. This suggests that despite a strong end to the year, there were underlying challenges throughout the year that impacted the overall financial health of the company. Furthermore, the decrease in net sales year-over-year could signal a potential red flag regarding the company's market position and demand for its products, particularly in the Marine Components sector.The income from operations remaining consistent year-over-year, despite lower full-year sales, may imply effective cost management and improved operational efficiency. Investors might view this positively as it indicates the company's ability to maintain profitability margins in challenging conditions. However, the equity in losses of Kronos for the full year is a significant shift from the prior year's equity in earnings and warrants attention as it could affect NL Industries' valuation and future income from this investment. Market Research Analyst The increase in Q4 net sales driven by the Security Products segment, particularly due to a pilot project for a government security customer, suggests a strategic pivot or diversification that could be beneficial if the company can secure additional contracts in this area. The decline in Marine Components sales, especially to the towboat market, raises questions about the competitiveness and future prospects of this segment. The company's ability to navigate these market shifts and capitalize on new opportunities will be critical for sustained growth.Looking at Kronos, the subsidiary of NL Industries, the increase in TiO2 sales volumes in Q4 2023 indicates a recovering demand in its primary markets, which could be a positive sign for the industry. However, the decrease in average TiO2 selling prices and the overall net sales decline for the full year reflect the pricing pressures and market challenges faced by the industry. The fluctuations in currency exchange rates benefiting Kronos' net sales also highlight the impact of global economic factors on the company's financial performance.The reported operational losses for Kronos, both quarterly and annually, underscore the importance of cost management in the face of production curtailments and lower demand. The capacity utilization figures provide insight into the operational efficiency and responsiveness to market demand. The restructuring costs and impairment charges also indicate ongoing adjustments to the business model, which could have long-term strategic implications. Economist The reported financials of NL Industries offer a mixed picture, reflective of broader economic trends. The pilot project in the government security market suggests that NL is potentially aligning with increased government spending in security, which could be a response to macroeconomic factors such as heightened focus on national security or infrastructure investment. This realignment could be a strategic move to tap into stable revenue streams amid economic uncertainties.The decline in Marine Components sales could be indicative of sector-specific downturns or a general economic slowdown affecting discretionary spending. The towboat market's performance may be tied to broader trends in global trade and shipping, which have faced volatility in recent years due to geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions.The currency exchange gains for Kronos highlight the role of international financial dynamics on company earnings. A weaker euro relative to the dollar can benefit U.S.-based companies with significant European operations when translating sales back into dollars. However, this benefit can quickly reverse with currency fluctuations, adding a layer of uncertainty to future earnings projections.The overall decline in net sales and the shift from net income to net loss year-over-year for NL Industries may reflect underlying economic challenges such as inflationary pressures, changes in consumer demand and global supply chain issues. The company's financial performance must be contextualized within these broader economic conditions to fully understand its potential trajectory. 03/06/2024 - 04:25 PM Dallas, Texas, March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NL Industries, Inc. (NYSE: NL) today reported net income attributable to NL stockholders of $7.6 million, or $.16 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to a net loss attributable to NL stockholders of $6.1 million, or $.13 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2022. NL’s results include an unrealized gain of $2.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 related to the change in value of marketable equity securities compared to a $3.8 million unrealized loss in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year of 2023, NL reported a net loss attributable to NL stockholders of $2.3 million, or $.05 per share, compared to net income attributable to NL stockholders of $33.8 million, or $.69 per share for the full year of 2022. NL’s results include an unrealized loss of $8.1 million in each of the full years of 2022 and 2023 related to the change in value of marketable equity securities. Net sales were $43.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $40.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $161.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $166.6 million for the full year of 2022. Net sales increased in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to higher Security Products sales related to a pilot project for a government security customer, partially offset by lower Marine Components sales primarily to the towboat market. Net sales decreased for the full year of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 due to lower Marine Components sales predominantly to the towboat market, partially offset by higher Security Products sales to the government security market largely in the fourth quarter related to the pilot project as noted above. Income from operations attributable to CompX was $7.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $5.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2022 and $25.4 million for each of the full years of 2022 and 2023. Income from operations increased in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 due to higher sales and improved gross margin percentage at Security Products, partially offset by lower Marine Components sales and gross margin percentage. Income from operations for the full year of 2023 was comparable to 2022 as lower Marine Components sales were offset by higher gross margin percentages across both reporting units, primarily due to lower production costs, and higher Security Products sales. NL recognized equity in losses of Kronos of $1.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to equity in losses of $6.0 million in the same period of 2022 and equity in losses of Kronos of $15.0 million in the full year of 2023 compared to equity in earnings of $31.9 million in the full year of 2022. Kronos’ net sales of $400.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $57.7 million, or 17%, higher than in the fourth quarter of 2022. Kronos’ net sales of $1.7 billion in the full year of 2023 were $263.7 million, or 14%, lower than in the full year of 2022. Kronos’ net sales increased in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 due to the net effects of higher sales volumes due to strengthening demand for TiO2 in its primary markets of Europe and North America and lower average TiO2 selling prices. Kronos’ net sales decreased in the full year of 2023 compared to the full year of 2022 due to the effects of lower sales volumes in all its major markets and lower average TiO2 selling prices. Kronos’ TiO2 sales volumes were 29% higher in the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 and 13% lower in the full year of 2023 as compared to the full year of 2022. Kronos’ average TiO2 selling prices were 11% lower in the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 and 4% lower in the full year of 2023 as compared to the full year of 2022. Kronos’ average TiO2 selling prices at the end of 2023 were 13% lower than the end of 2022. Changes in product mix positively contributed to Kronos’ net sales, primarily due to higher average selling prices and sales volumes in its complementary businesses which somewhat offset declines in TiO2 sales volumes in the full year of 2023. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates (primarily the euro) also affected Kronos’ net sales comparisons, increasing net sales by approximately $10 million in both the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 as compared to the same periods in 2022. The table at the end of this press release shows how each of these items impacted Kronos’ net sales. Kronos’ loss from operations in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $5.7 million as compared to a loss of $19.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year of 2023, Kronos’ loss from operations was $56.0 million as compared to income from operations of $159.6 million in 2022. Kronos’ loss from operations decreased in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to the net effect of higher sales volumes and lower average TiO2 selling prices. Kronos’ loss from operations increased in the full year of 2023 as compared to the full year of 2022 as a result of the combination of lower sales volumes, higher production costs and lower average TiO2 selling prices. In addition, cost of sales in the fourth quarter and the full year of 2023 includes $22 million and $96 million, respectively, of unabsorbed fixed production and other manufacturing costs associated with production curtailments at Kronos’ facilities during the full year of 2023 as it adjusted its TiO2 production volumes to align inventory levels with lower demand. Kronos’ TiO2 production volumes were 15% higher in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 but 19% lower in the full year of 2023 compared to the full year of 2022. As a result of reduced demand and scheduled maintenance activities, Kronos operated its production facilities at 72% of practical capacity utilization in the full year of 2023 (76%, 64%, 73% and 78% in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2023, respectively) compared to 89% capacity in the full year 2022 (100%, 95%, 93% and 66% in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2022, respectively). Fluctuations in currency exchange rates (primarily the euro) decreased Kronos’ loss from operations by approximately $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and by approximately $16 million in the full year of 2023 as compared to the same prior year periods. Kronos’ loss from operations in the full year of 2023 includes an insurance settlement gain related to a 2020 business interruption insurance claim of $2.5 million (NL’s equity interest was $.5 million, or $.01 per share, net of tax), a fixed asset impairment related to the write-off of certain costs resulting from a capital project termination of $3.8 million (NL’s equity interest was $.7 million, or $.01 per share, net of tax) and restructuring costs related to workforce reductions of $5.8 million (NL’s equity interest was $1.0 million, or $.02 per share, net of tax). Kronos’ income from operations in the full year of 2022 includes a gain related to the 2020 business interruption insurance claim noted above of $2.7 million (NL’s equity interest was $.5 million, or $.01 per share, net of tax). Corporate expenses decreased $.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 primarily due to lower litigation fees and related costs. Corporate expenses decreased $.4 million for the full year of 2023 as compared to 2022 primarily due to lower administrative expenses and $.5 million of insurance recoveries received in 2023. Interest and dividend income in the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2023 increased $1.3 million and $5.8 million, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2022 primarily due to higher average interest rates on invested balances somewhat offset by lower average balances on CompX’s revolving promissory note from Valhi. Marketable equity securities represent the change in unrealized gains (losses) on our portfolio of marketable equity securities during the periods. The net loss per share attributable to NL stockholders for the full year of 2023 includes a non-cash loss of $4.9 million ($3.9 million, or $.08 per share, net of tax) due to the termination of our U.K. pension plan recognized in the second quarter.

FIRST UNITED CORPORATION ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER 2024 DIVIDEND,2024-03-06T21:23:00.000Z,Low,Positive,"First United Corporation (FUNC) declares a cash dividend of $.20 per share, payable on May 1, 2024, to holders of record of the Corporation's common stock as of April 17, 2024.","FIRST UNITED CORPORATION ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER 2024 DIVIDEND Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags dividends earnings Rhea-AI Summary First United Corporation (FUNC) declares a cash dividend of $.20 per share, payable on May 1, 2024, to holders of record of the Corporation's common stock as of April 17, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a cash dividend of $.20 per share by First United Corporation represents a tangible return on investment for shareholders and signals confidence by the company's management in its financial stability and profit-generating ability. It's important to analyze the dividend yield, which is calculated by dividing the annual dividends per share by the share price. This metric helps investors understand the return on their investment relative to the market value of the stock.Furthermore, the timing and consistency of dividend payments can indicate the company's long-term financial health. Regular dividends are often perceived as a sign of a company's mature and stable position in the market. It would be prudent to compare this dividend declaration with the company's historical payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends to shareholders. A payout ratio that is too high might not be sustainable in the long run, whereas a lower ratio could suggest room for future dividend growth.Investors should also consider the ex-dividend date, which is April 17, 2024, in this case. Share purchases must be made before this date to be eligible for the dividend payment. This often influences stock trading patterns as the date approaches. Market Research Analyst A dividend announcement can have several market implications. Firstly, it may affect investor sentiment, potentially increasing demand for the stock as it becomes more attractive to income-focused investors. The size and timing of the dividend could also be compared to industry peers to gauge competitiveness. If the dividend is higher than average, it might attract more investors, whereas a lower dividend could suggest that the company is conserving cash for other strategic investments or operations.Additionally, the market may interpret the dividend in the context of the company's capital allocation strategy. A steady or increased dividend might imply that the company has limited high-return investment opportunities and thus is returning cash to shareholders. On the other hand, a reduction or omission of dividends could signal internal investments or possible financial difficulties. It's beneficial to analyze the company's growth prospects and how they align with the dividend policy. Economist From an economic standpoint, dividend declarations must be assessed in the context of the prevailing economic conditions. During periods of low interest rates, dividends become a more attractive source of income, potentially leading to a higher valuation of dividend-paying stocks. Conversely, in a high-interest-rate environment, the opportunity cost of holding dividend stocks increases, as investors might find better returns in fixed-income securities.Moreover, the broader economic outlook, including factors such as inflation rates, GDP growth and unemployment rates, can influence investor perception of the safety and attractiveness of dividend stocks. A robust economic environment may bolster confidence in the company's ability to maintain or grow its dividends, while an economic downturn could raise concerns about future earnings and the sustainability of dividend payments. 03/06/2024 - 04:23 PM OAKLAND, Md., March 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- First United Corporation (NASDAQ: FUNC) announces that its Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $.20 per share that will be payable on May 1, 2024, to holders of record of the Corporation's common stock as of April 17, 2024.

Gross margin rate exceeded expectations due to inventory management and cost reductions. CEO emphasized strategic priorities and growth initiatives for the future. Negative None. Financial Analyst Analyzing the financial performance of Victoria's Secret as disclosed, several key figures stand out. The company's ability to generate $590 million in operating cash flow in the fourth quarter is a strong indicator of its operational efficiency. Moreover, reducing debt by over $150 million year-over-year significantly improves the company's balance sheet and could potentially lead to a better credit rating.The announcement of a new $250 million share repurchase authorization is a strategic move that signals confidence in the company's future to investors. Share buybacks often lead to an increase in earnings per share (EPS) and can have a positive impact on the stock price, as they typically reduce the number of shares outstanding. However, this must be balanced against the opportunity cost of investing that capital back into the business for growth initiatives.The provided guidance for fiscal year 2024 is cautiously optimistic, acknowledging the challenges faced in the broader intimates market. This conservative approach can be seen as a risk mitigation strategy, which may reassure investors looking for stability in uncertain market conditions. Market Research Analyst The reported 3% increase in net sales for Q4 2023, despite a 6% decrease in total comparable sales, indicates a mixed performance. The additional week in the quarter, contributing approximately $80 million in net sales, should be taken into account when comparing year-over-year performance. This extra week can distort the true underlying sales trends, which seem to be challenging given the decrease in comparable sales.Victoria's Secret's international business performance, with a 24% increase in sales, suggests that the company's growth strategy outside North America is gaining traction. This geographical diversification could be a key driver for future growth, especially as the North American market has shown a downward trend for four consecutive quarters.The emphasis on strategic priorities such as accelerating the core business, igniting growth and transforming the foundation indicates a long-term vision for the company. The focus on initiatives like a multi-tender loyalty program, customer experience enhancements and a reimagined merchandise strategy for PINK shows a commitment to innovation and adaptation to consumer preferences. Retail Industry Expert The significant improvement in fourth quarter gross margin rate can be attributed to disciplined inventory management and cost reductions. This is particularly noteworthy in the retail sector, where margins are often squeezed by promotional activities and inventory markdowns. Efficient supply chain management, as part of the 'transform the foundation' initiative, is essential in modern retail to maintain profitability.Victoria's Secret's focus on giftable merchandise assortment during the holiday season and the reported strong response to marketing initiatives reflect an understanding of seasonal consumer behavior. However, the volatility in sales trends by week during the quarter suggests that the retail environment remains unpredictable and companies must be agile in their marketing and inventory strategies.The repositioning efforts of the Victoria's Secret brand and the strategic focus discussed at the Investor Day demonstrate a proactive approach to evolving consumer tastes and the competitive landscape. The company's confidence in its leadership team and long-term financial targets suggests a clear strategic direction, which is crucial for investor confidence in a rapidly changing retail industry. 03/06/2024 - 04:17 PM Fourth quarter adjusted operating income and adjusted diluted EPS at the high-end of guidance Generated nearly $590 million in operating cash flow in the fourth quarter and ended the year with debt down over $150 million year-over-year Announces new $250 million share repurchase authorization Provides initial full year and first quarter 2024 guidance REYNOLDSBURG, Ohio, March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Victoria’s Secret & Co. (“Victoria’s Secret” or the “Company”) (NYSE: VSCO) today reported 2023 financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 3, 2024. Chief Executive Officer Martin Waters commented on the fourth quarter, “I am grateful for the hard work and dedication of our team of associates and partners around the world who executed our strategies, delighted our customers and delivered solid financial results in the all-important holiday quarter. Sales trends during the quarter were volatile by week, but we were encouraged by the improving quarterly sales trend in North America. We were particularly pleased with our early holiday sales in November and during the peak days and weekends leading up to Christmas, both in our stores and through digital channels, led by strong response to our giftable merchandise assortment, improved customer experiences and marketing messages. Our international business continued its strong performance with sales up 24% in the quarter compared to last year, igniting excitement around our aggressive growth plans to expand our footprint both in stores and online around the world. Our fourth quarter gross margin rate exceeded our expectations and increased significantly compared to last year, a positive inflection point driven by disciplined inventory management and cost reductions related to our transform the foundation initiative to modernize our supply chain operating model.” Martin continued, “With the long-term health of the business in mind, we remain committed to our strategic priorities: 1) Accelerate Our Core; 2) Ignite Growth; and 3) Transform the Foundation. As we look into the new year, we recognize the broader intimates market in North America has been down for four consecutive quarters and we are planning the business appropriately conservative in the near-term.

Adjusted net income and adjusted operating income are non-GAAP financial measures. At the conclusion of this press release, we have included more information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure reported in accordance with GAAP. Full Year 2023 ResultsThe Company reported net income of $109 million, or $1.39 per diluted share for the 53-week fiscal year 2023. This result compares to net income of $348 million, or $4.14 per diluted share for the 52-week fiscal year 2022. Fiscal year 2023 operating income was $246 million compared to operating income of $478 million last year.

Liquidity and Capital AllocationIn the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company generated $589 million in operating cash flow and paid down $410 million on its asset-based revolving credit facility (“ABL credit facility”). The Company ended fiscal year 2023 with a cash balance of $270 million and an outstanding balance owed under the ABL credit facility of $145 million, which was down 51% ($150 million) compared to last year. The Company today announced that its Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program (“March 2024 Share Repurchase Program”) authorizing the repurchase of up to $250 million of the Company’s common stock. Share repurchases under the March 2024 Share Repurchase Program will be made at management’s discretion and from time to time, subject to market conditions and other factors, through open market, accelerated share repurchase or privately negotiated transactions, including pursuant to one or more Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, and are expected to offset dilution under the Company’s equity compensation plans and, unless retired, for general corporate purposes. The March 2024 Share Repurchase Program is open-ended in term, eligible to begin immediately and will continue until exhausted. The March 2024 Share Repurchase Program replaces the Board-authorized January 2023 Share Repurchase Program, which expired at the end of fiscal year 2023. In fiscal year 2023, the Company invested a total of $125 million to repurchase 3.7 million shares under the January 2023 Share Repurchase Program. Full Year and First Quarter 2024 OutlookThe Company is forecasting 52-week fiscal year 2024 net sales to be about $6.0 billion, or down low-single digits compared to a comparative 52-weeks from fiscal year 2023. At this forecasted level of sales, adjusted operating income for fiscal year 2024 is expected to be about $250 million to $275 million. The Company is forecasting first quarter 2024 net sales to decrease mid-single digits compared to last year’s first quarter net sales of $1.407 billion. At this forecasted level of sales, adjusted operating income for the first quarter of 2024 is expected to be in the range of $10 million to $35 million. Forecasted adjusted operating income and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share for the full year and first quarter 2024 excludes the financial impact of purchase accounting items related to the Adore Me acquisition, including expense (income) related to changes in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration and performance-based payments, as well as the amortization of intangible assets. The Company is not able to provide a reconciliation of forward-looking adjusted operating income or adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures because the Company is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate reconciliation or estimation of certain reconciling items without unreasonable effort, due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting the timing of, and quantifying, the various purchase accounting items that are necessary for such reconciliation.

We believe that these special items are not indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and nature. The intangible asset amortization excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures is excluded because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised. We use adjusted financial information as key performance measures of results of operations for the purpose of evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Instead, we believe that the presentation of adjusted financial information provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. Further, our definition of adjusted financial information may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. The table below reconciles the GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures.

Negative Decrease in revenue and net loss in Q4 compared to Q3. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased from 16.7% in Q4 2022 to 11.8% in Q4 2023. Reduction in operating income and Adjusted EBITDA across geographic segments. 35% decrease in net working capital from December 2022 to December 2023. Financial Analyst The reported financial results of KLX Energy Services Holdings, Inc. show a significant increase in annual revenue and Adjusted EBITDA despite a decline in rig count, which is indicative of operational efficiency and potentially a higher revenue per rig. The net income margin has seen a dramatic increase, which suggests improved profitability. However, the reported net loss in the fourth quarter suggests a potential concern for volatility or seasonal effects on the business. The reduction in net debt and a lower net leverage ratio are positive signs for the company's balance sheet strength and financial flexibility.Investors should note the company's liquidity position, which has improved, providing a cushion for operational needs or investment opportunities. The capital expenditure decrease in the fourth quarter could signal a strategic pullback in investment or a completion of necessary upgrades. The maintenance of a stable debt level year-over-year, while reducing net debt, is a strategic financial management that could be favorable for long-term sustainability. Market Research Analyst The oilfield services industry is highly sensitive to fluctuations in commodity prices and rig counts, which are proxies for industry activity levels. KLX's ability to increase revenue in a period of declining rig count indicates a competitive advantage or a shift in market share. The mention of commercialization of proprietary offerings and an acquisition suggests strategic moves to diversify services and expand market presence, potentially making KLX more resilient to industry downturns.The forward-looking statements regarding the natural gas strip and global LNG demand provide insight into the company's market expectations and could signal growth opportunities for KLX. The emphasis on capturing a greater portion of customer spending among well-capitalized operators could indicate a focus on high-value contracts and clients with stable financial backgrounds, which might mitigate risks associated with smaller or financially unstable customers. Energy Sector Analyst The company's operational performance in the context of the broader energy sector reflects an ability to navigate the post-COVID environment effectively. The significant increase in net income and Adjusted EBITDA margins highlights operational efficiencies that could be attributed to technological advancements or cost management strategies. The acquisition of Greene's Energy Group may provide synergies and additional service capabilities, potentially enhancing KLX's competitive position.KLX's commentary on the natural gas strip and LNG demand projects optimism for the sector's growth, driven by global energy trends and the transition to cleaner fuels. The company's strategic positioning to benefit from these trends could imply a favorable outlook for its services. The focus on free cash flow is crucial for the energy sector, as it indicates the company's ability to self-fund operations and growth initiatives without relying heavily on external financing. 03/06/2024 - 04:20 PM Company generates record annual revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow HOUSTON, March 6, 2024 KLX Energy Services Holdings, Inc.

Full Year 2023 Financial Highlights Revenue of $888 million, an increase of 14% compared to prior year despite a 20% decline in rig count over the same periodNet income of $19 million, an increase of 719% compared to prior year, and diluted income per share of $1.22Net income margin of 2%, a 645% increase from prior yearAdjusted EBITDA of $138 million, an increase of 42% compared to prior yearAdjusted EBITDA margin of 16% compared to 2022 Adjusted EBITDA margin of 12%Cash balance of $113 million, increased 96% compared to prior yearTotal debt of $284 million, consistent with prior yearNet Debt of $172 million, a $54 million or 24% reduction compared to prior yearLiquidity of $154 million, consisting of approximately $113 million of cash and nearly $42 million of available borrowing capacity under the December 2023 asset-based revolving credit facility (the ""ABL Facility"") borrowing base certificate, representing a $53 million or 52% increase compared to prior yearNet Leverage Ratio of 1.2x, reduced 47% from prior yearFourth Quarter 2023 Financial Highlights Revenue of $194 millionNet loss of $(9) million and diluted loss per share of $(0.58)Adjusted EBITDA of $23 million and Adjusted EBITDA margin of 12%See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" at the end of this release for a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) per share, Unlevered and Levered Free Cash Flow, Net Working Capital, Net Debt, Net Leverage Ratio and their reconciliations to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). We have not provided reconciliations of our future expectations as to Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA margin as such reconciliations are not available without unreasonable efforts. Chris Baker, KLX President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, ""2023 was a record year on numerous fronts marked by outstanding operational performance, financial successes, post-COVID record HSE statistics and significant strategic advancements, including the commercialization of multiple proprietary offerings and the acquisition of Greene's Energy Group. As we look forward to 2024, we currently expect our first quarter results to be negatively impacted by normalized seasonality, the Polar Vortex in January and safety standdowns for two separate customers due to non-KLX safety incidents. Based on our current schedules, we expect to exit the first quarter on a strong monthly run-rate and to approach 2023 levels of quarterly revenue and Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter and beyond. ""We believe KLX, and the oilfield services industry in general, is positioned exceptionally well as we move further into 2024,"" added Baker. ""More specifically, the forward natural gas strip is highly constructive into 2025 and 2026 due to the much-anticipated incremental LNG offtake demand. Global LNG demand is expected to double over the next two years and we believe this increase will drive incremental natural gas-directed activity that will ultimately lift and support service pricing and utilization across all basins. ""We are proud of our track record of driving free cash flow and believe the exceptional caliber of our team and service offerings positions us to capture a greater portion of customer spending, particularly amongst the largest, most active, and well-capitalized operators in the US onshore market. ""On behalf of all of us at KLX, I am excited to welcome Ms. Danielle Hunter to the Board. Danielle is an accomplished executive and brings expertise specific to the oilfield services we provide at KLX. She possesses core competencies in corporate law and in her current role as President of Berry Corporation, she will add a unique viewpoint into the upstream market. The Board and Management look forward to her contributions and insights,"" concluded Baker. Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 totaled $194.2 million, a decrease of 12.0% compared to third quarter revenue of $220.6 million. The decrease in revenue reflects a decrease in activity in addition to the expected seasonal decline in the fourth quarter. On a product line basis, drilling, completion, production and intervention services contributed approximately 25%, 51%, 15% and 9%, respectively, to revenues for the fourth quarter 2023. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $(9.2) million, compared to fourth quarter 2022 net income of $13.2 million. Adjusted net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $(8.7) million, compared to fourth quarter 2022 adjusted net income of $12.7 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $23.0 million, compared to fourth quarter 2022 Adjusted EBITDA of $37.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 11.8%, compared to fourth quarter 2022 Adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.7%. Fourth Quarter 2023 Segment Results The Company reports revenue, operating income and Adjusted EBITDA through three geographic business segments: Rocky Mountains, Southwest and Northeast/Mid-Con. Rocky Mountains: Revenue, operating income and Adjusted EBITDA for the Rocky Mountains segment was $60.0 million, $6.7 million and $12.7 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2023. Fourth quarter revenue represents a 22.1% decrease over the third quarter of 2023 largely due to a 2% reduction in average rig count and annual seasonality, which affected all of our regional drilling, completion and production offerings, including frac rentals, coiled tubing, rentals and tech services. Segment operating income and Adjusted EBITDA decreased 62.1% and 45.5%, respectively, as a function of the seasonal decrease in revenue, which is expected to correct as we exit the first quarter of 2024.Southwest: Revenue, operating income and Adjusted EBITDA for the Southwest segment, which includes the Permian and South Texas, was $67.3 million, $1.7 million and $8.8 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2023. Fourth quarter revenue represents a 13.5% decrease over the third quarter of 2023 largely due to a 5% reduction in average rig count and annual seasonality, which affected our flowback, wireline, tech services and coiled tubing offerings. Segment operating income and Adjusted EBITDA decreased 64.6% and 25.4%, respectively, as a function of the decrease in revenue as we maintained elevated staffing levels to support an expected increase in first quarter activity.Northeast/Mid-Con: Revenue, operating income and Adjusted EBITDA for the Northeast/Mid-Con segment was $66.9 million, $4.1 million and $10.7 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2023. Fourth quarter revenue represents a 1.7% increase over the third quarter of 2023 due to increased pressure pumping activity driven by a newly executed frac contract, along with increases in coiled tubing and flowback revenue that offset the declines experienced in directional drilling and tech services. Segment operating income and Adjusted EBITDA decreased 21.2% and 6.1%, respectively, largely due to lower pricing and increased insurance costs.The following is a tabular summary of revenue, operating income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA (loss) for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023, the third quarter ended September 30, 2023 and the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022 ($ in millions).

Accrued interest as of December 31, 2023 was $4.5 million for the Senior Secured Notes and $0.0 million related to the ABL Facility. Net working capital as of December 31, 2023 was $47.2 million, a 35% decrease from December 31, 2022 driven by a reduction in days sales outstanding. KLX did not sell any shares under our at-the-market offering program in the fourth quarter ended December 2023. Other Financial Information Capital expenditures were $12.8 million during the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease of $5.0 million or 28.1% compared to capital expenditures of $17.8 million in the third quarter of 2023.

Each of the metrics are ""non-GAAP financial measures"" as defined in Regulation G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of net earnings or cash flows as determined by GAAP. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted for (i) goodwill and/or long-lived asset impairment charges, (ii) stock-based compensation expense, (iii) restructuring charges, (iv) transaction and integration costs related to acquisitions and (v) other expenses or charges to exclude certain items that we believe are not reflective of the ongoing performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA is used to calculate the Company's leverage ratio, consistent with the terms of the Company's ABL Facility. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows us to supplement the GAAP measures in order to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We exclude the items listed above in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP, or as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDA. Our computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA margin is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. Adjusted EBITDA margin is not a measure of net earnings or cash flows as determined by GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as the quotient of Adjusted EBITDA and total revenue. We believe Adjusted EBITDA margin is useful because it allows us to supplement the GAAP measures in order to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period without regard to our financing methods or capital structure, as a percentage of revenues. We define Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as consolidated net income (loss) adjusted for (i) goodwill and/or long-lived asset impairment charges, (ii) restructuring charges, (iii) transaction and integration costs related to acquisitions and (iv) other expenses or charges to exclude certain items that we believe are not reflective of the ongoing performance of our business. We believe Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is useful because it allows us to exclude non-recurring items in evaluating our operating performance. We define Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) per share as the quotient of adjusted net income (loss) and diluted weighted average common shares. We believe that Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) per share provides useful information to investors because it allows us to exclude non-recurring items in evaluating our operating performance on a diluted per share basis. We define Unlevered Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and proceeds from sale of property and equipment plus interest expense. We define Levered Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and proceeds from sale of property and equipment. Our management uses Unlevered and Levered Free Cash Flow to assess the Company's liquidity and ability to repay maturing debt, fund operations and make additional investments. We believe that each of Unlevered and Levered Free Cash Flow provide useful information to investors because it is an important indicator of the Company's liquidity, including our ability to reduce Net Debt and make strategic investments. Net Working Capital is calculated as current assets, excluding cash, less current liabilities, excluding accrued interest and finance lease obligations. We believe that Net Working Capital provides useful information to investors because it is an important indicator of the Company's liquidity. We define Net Debt as total debt less cash and cash equivalents. We believe that Net Debt provides useful information to investors because it is an important indicator of the Company's indebtedness. We define Net Leverage Ratio as Net Debt divided by Adjusted EBITDA. We believe that Net Leverage Ratio provides useful information to investors because it is an important indicator of the Company's indebtedness in relation to our operating performance.

Financial Analyst TriplePoint Venture Growth BDC Corp.'s (TPVG) fiscal year 2023 financial results demonstrate a robust net investment income of $2.07 per share, which is a significant indicator for investors assessing the company's profitability and operational efficiency. The 15.4% weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments for the fiscal year is notably high, reflecting TPVG's ability to generate income from its debt investments. This yield is a crucial metric, as it provides insights into the returns TPVG is able to secure from its lending activities and it is comfortably above the average yields seen in more traditional fixed-income investments. TPVG's strategy of focusing on venture growth stage companies backed by select venture capital firms appears to be paying off, as evidenced by the 18.3% return on average equity based on net investment income for the fourth quarter. This outperformance could be attributed to the company's niche focus on technology and other high-growth industries, which have the potential to offer higher returns albeit with increased risk. The declaration of a $0.40 per share distribution for the first quarter of 2024 signals confidence in TPVG's earning potential and commitment to shareholder returns. The company's liquidity position, with total liquidity of $306.6 million and the gross leverage ratio of 1.76x, are also of interest to investors as they reflect the company's financial health and its ability to meet short-term obligations. The asset coverage ratio of 157% indicates that TPVG is well within regulatory requirements, providing a cushion for investors against potential losses. Market Research Analyst TPVG's investment in a diversified portfolio of 49 debt investments, 97 warrants and 46 equity investments in various portfolio companies showcases its broad exposure to the venture capital ecosystem. The company's ability to sign $471.0 million of term sheets and close $31.5 million of new debt commitments during a challenging venture capital market is an impressive feat. This indicates a strong pipeline and potential for future earnings growth, which is essential for investors looking for growth opportunities in the Business Development Company (BDC) sector. The strategic moves by portfolio companies, such as Metropolis Technologies' agreement to purchase SP Plus Corporation for approximately $1.5 billion and Cohesity's intention to combine with Veritas Technologies LLC's data protection business in a $7 billion transaction, are indicative of TPVG's ability to pick winners and potentially benefit from their growth and exit events. These developments can have a considerable impact on TPVG's future realized and unrealized gains, potentially influencing the stock price. However, the net decrease in net assets resulting from operations for the fiscal year 2023, which stood at $39.8 million, or $1.12 per share, warrants attention. This decrease could be due to market volatility and valuation adjustments in the high-growth sectors TPVG invests in. Investors should monitor these metrics closely as they can affect TPVG's net asset value and, consequently, investor sentiment and stock performance. Legal Expert From a regulatory standpoint, TPVG's compliance with the asset coverage ratio, which is a legal requirement for BDCs to limit the amount of leverage they can employ, is reassuring for investors. The reaffirmation of TPVG's investment grade rating by DBRS, Inc. with a negative trend outlook in April 2023 suggests that the company is viewed as having a moderate risk of default. This rating is crucial for investors as it influences the company's borrowing costs and ability to raise capital. The negative trend outlook, however, implies potential future downgrades if adverse conditions persist, which investors should be aware of as it could impact the company's financial flexibility. Furthermore, the ATM Program's remaining capacity of $28.3 million provides TPVG with an accessible channel to raise additional equity if needed, which could dilute existing shareholders but also offer financial flexibility to seize investment opportunities or manage debt levels. The balance between financial prudence and strategic capital deployment is a delicate one that TPVG appears to be managing well, as evidenced by its current liquidity and leverage metrics. 03/06/2024 - 04:15 PM Achieved Net Investment Income of $2.07 Per Share for Fiscal Year 2023 15.6% Portfolio Yield on Debt Investments for the Fourth Quarter and 15.4% for Fiscal Year 2023 DECLARES FIRST QUARTER 2024 DISTRIBUTION OF $0.40 PER SHARE MENLO PARK, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- TriplePoint Venture Growth BDC Corp.

PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY During the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company entered into $4.2 million of new debt commitments with two portfolio companies, funded debt investments totaling $24.4 million to six portfolio companies and acquired warrants valued at $1.1 million in two portfolio companies. Debt investments funded during the quarter carried a weighted average annualized portfolio yield of 18.8% at origination. During the quarter, the Company received $33.7 million of principal prepayments, $8.5 million of early repayments and $9.2 million of scheduled principal amortization. The weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments for the fourth quarter was 15.6%. The Company calculates weighted average portfolio yield as the annualized rate of the interest income recognized during the period divided by the average amortized cost of debt investments in the portfolio during the period. The return on average equity for the fourth quarter was 18.3% based on net investment income. The Company calculates return on average equity as the annualized rate of net investment income recognized during the period divided by the Company’s average net asset value during the period. As of December 31, 2023, the Company held debt investments in 49 portfolio companies, warrants in 97 portfolio companies and equity investments in 46 portfolio companies. The total cost and fair value of these investments were $850.1 million and $802.1 million, respectively.

SIGNED TERM SHEETS During the three months ended December 31, 2023, TPC entered into $100.1 million of non-binding term sheets to venture growth stage companies. These opportunities are subject to underwriting conditions including, but not limited to, the completion of due diligence, negotiation of definitive documentation and investment committee approval, as well as compliance with the allocation policy. Accordingly, there is no assurance that any or all of these transactions will be completed or assigned to the Company. UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s unfunded commitments totaled $118.1 million, of which $29.2 million was dependent upon portfolio companies reaching certain milestones. Of the $118.1 million of unfunded commitments, $86.7 million will expire during 2024 and $31.4 million will expire during 2025, if not drawn prior to expiration. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn, unfunded commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements or future earning assets for the Company. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Total investment and other income was $33.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, representing a weighted average annualized portfolio yield of 15.6% on debt investments, as compared to $34.9 million and 15.3% for the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease in total investment and other income was primarily due to a lower weighted average principal amount outstanding on our income-bearing debt investment portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company’s total investment and other income was $137.5 million, as compared to $119.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, representing a weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments of 15.4% and 14.7%, respectively. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $15.7 million as compared to $14.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 consisted of $8.3 million of interest expense and amortization of fees, $4.5 million of base management fees, $0.6 million of administration agreement expenses and $2.3 million of general and administrative expenses. Due to the total return requirement under the income component of our incentive fee structure, our income incentive fees were reduced by $3.5 million during the three months ended December 31, 2023. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2022 consisted of $8.4 million of interest expense and amortization of fees, $4.2 million of base management fees, $0.6 million of administration agreement expenses and $1.3 million of general and administrative expenses. The Company’s total operating expenses were $63.7 million and $55.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. For the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company recorded net investment income of $17.3 million, or $0.47 per share, as compared to $20.5 million, or $0.58 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease in net investment income between periods was driven primarily by lower total investment and other income and an increase in general and administrative expenses. Net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $73.8 million, or $2.07 per share, compared to $63.6 million, or $1.94 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2022. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company recognized net realized losses on investments of $52.0 million, resulting primarily from the write-off of investments in four portfolio companies, of which $32.5 million was previously included in the Company’s unrealized losses. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company recognized net realized losses on investments of $29.0 million. Net change in unrealized gains on investments for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $6.0 million, consisting of $34.1 million from the reversal of previously recorded unrealized losses from investments realized during the period, reduced by $12.6 million of net unrealized losses on the existing debt investment portfolio and $15.5 million of net unrealized losses on the existing warrant and equity portfolio resulting from fair value adjustments. Net change in unrealized losses on investments for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $3.3 million. The Company’s net decrease in net assets resulting from operations for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $28.8 million, or $0.79 per share, as compared to a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of $11.8 million, or $0.33 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company’s net decrease in net assets resulting from operations was $39.8 million, or $1.12 per share, as compared to a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of $20.1 million, or $0.61 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2022. CREDIT QUALITY The Company maintains a credit watch list with portfolio companies placed into one of five credit categories, with Clear, or 1, being the highest rating and Red, or 5, being the lowest. Generally, all new loans receive an initial grade of White, or 2, unless the portfolio company’s credit quality meets the characteristics of another credit category.

Decline in funded volume by 65% compared to the previous year. Increase in total liabilities by $541 million on a sequential-quarter basis. Impairment of intangibles and other assets affecting financial performance. Financial Analyst Finance of America's reported earnings indicate a significant turnaround in the fourth quarter, with a net income from continuing operations of $171 million. This figure is particularly noteworthy when juxtaposed with the adjusted net loss of $20 million. The improvement in net income is primarily attributed to non-cash, positive fair value changes, which can be volatile and are not necessarily indicative of operational performance. However, the reported 20% improvement on an adjusted net basis over the prior quarter does suggest some underlying operational progress.From a financial analysis perspective, the substantial increase in total revenues, reporting a 494% increase quarter-over-quarter, is a positive sign. However, this must be tempered by the fact that the funded volume has decreased, with a 13% decline from the prior quarter and a 36% decline year-over-year. This contraction may raise concerns about the company's growth trajectory and market demand for its products.The company's 37% market share in the HECM Reverse market suggests a strong positioning within its niche, yet the overall decrease in funded volume could signal market saturation or increased competition. Investors should monitor how these market dynamics evolve and how the company adapts its strategies accordingly. Market Research Analyst The Retirement Solutions segment of Finance of America is a critical area to watch, as it drives revenue through net origination gains and fees from reverse mortgage loans. The 67% improvement in adjusted net loss in this segment is a positive development, especially considering the higher revenue margin and reduced expenses. However, the decrease in funded volume may be a point of concern, potentially reflecting a downturn in consumer demand or a strategic shift within the company.On the other hand, the Portfolio Management segment's performance, with a 333% increase in total revenue, is largely due to non-cash fair value adjustments. This indicates that while the segment's performance looks robust on paper, the underlying operational results are break-even, highlighting the importance of scrutinizing non-cash items that can significantly influence reported earnings.The increase in total equity by 162% is a strong indicator of improved financial health, which may be reassuring to investors. However, the 30% decrease in cash and cash equivalents could be a liquidity concern and warrants further investigation into the company's cash flow management and investment strategies. Legal Expert While the financial report does not raise any immediate legal concerns, the use of non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA, is worth noting. These measures exclude certain items that the company deems non-recurring or not reflective of core business operations. While permitted and often used to provide additional insight into a company's performance, these measures lack standardization and can vary significantly between companies. It is crucial for stakeholders to understand the adjustments made and to consider these figures in conjunction with GAAP measures to gain a comprehensive view of the company's financial health.Additionally, the report mentions certain non-recurring costs and adjustments, which may include legal and regulatory matters. Stakeholders should be aware that such costs, although not specified in detail, could have implications for the company's risk profile and should be monitored for any potential future legal liabilities or regulatory actions. 03/06/2024 - 04:21 PM – Net income from continuing operations of $171 million or $0.72 basic earnings per share for the quarter – – 20% improvement on an adjusted net basis(1) over the prior quarter – – Finished the year with 37% share of HECM Reverse market(2) – PLANO, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Finance of America Companies Inc.

Total assets increased 3% in line with the change in securitized loans held for investment. Total liabilities increased $541 million on a sequential-quarter basis primarily due to increases in HMBS obligations and nonrecourse debt, aligned to the change in securitized loans held for investment.

Fourth quarter revenue increased 3% from the third quarter to $41 million as seasonal volume declines were more than offset by increased margins in our Reverse business.

Forward-Looking Statements This release includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts or statements of current conditions, but instead represent only management’s beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the Company’s control. It is possible that our actual results, financial condition and liquidity may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results, financial condition and liquidity in these forward-looking statements. The Company’s actual results may differ from its expectations, estimates, and projections and, consequently, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Words such as “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “budget,” “forecast,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “believes,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue,” and similar expressions (or the negative versions of such words or expressions) are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. The Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which are current only as of the date of this release. Results for any specified quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year or any future period. The Company does not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in its expectations or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except as required by law. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning the Company or other matters and attributable to the Company or any person acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements above. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. A number of important factors exist that could cause future results to differ materially from historical performance and these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: our ability to manage the unique challenges presented by operating as a modern retirement solutions platform rather than a vertically-integrated, diversified lending and complementary services platform due to the transformation of our business; our ability to successfully operate the recently integrated lending platform that we acquired from American Advisors Group in March 2023 and generally, our ability to operate our business profitably; our ability to respond to significant changes in prevailing interest rates and to resume profitable business operations; our geographic market concentration if the economic conditions in our current markets should decline or if our current markets are impacted by natural disasters; our use of estimates in measuring or determining the fair value of the majority of our financial assets and liabilities, which may require us to write down the value of these assets or write up the value of these liabilities if the estimates prove to be incorrect; our ability to prevent cyber intrusions and mitigate cyber risks; the possibility that the Company may be adversely affected by other economic, business and/or competitive factors in our business markets and worldwide financial markets, including a sustained period of higher interest rates; our ability to manage changes in our licensing status, business relationships or servicing guidelines with the Government National Mortgage Association, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development or other governmental entities; our ability to obtain sufficient capital and liquidity to meet the financing and operational requirements of our business and our ability to comply with our debt agreements, including warehouse lending facilities, and pay down our substantial debt; our ability to refinance our debt on reasonable terms as it becomes due; our ability to manage disruptions in the secondary home loan market, including the mortgage-backed securities market; our ability to finance and recover costs of our reverse mortgage servicing operations; our ability to maintain compliance with the extensive regulations we are subject to, including consumer protection laws applicable to reverse mortgage lenders, which may be highly complex; our ability to compete with national banks, which are not subject to state licensing and operational requirements; our ability to manage various legal proceedings, federal or state governmental examinations and enforcement investigations we are subject to from time to time, the results of which are difficult to predict or estimate; our continued ability to remain in compliance with the terms of the consent orders issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which we assumed in connection with our acquisition of operational assets from American Advisors Group; our holding company status and dependency on distributions from Finance of America Equity Capital LLC; our ability to comply with the continued listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and avoid the delisting of our common stock from trading on its exchange; our common stock trading history has been characterized by low trading volume, which may result in an inability to sell your shares at a desired price, if at all; and our “controlled company” status under NYSE rules, which exempts us from certain corporate governance requirements and affords stockholders fewer protections. All of these factors are difficult to predict, contain uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and may be beyond our control. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for our management to predict all such factors or to assess the effect of each such new factor on our business. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and any of these statements included herein may prove to be inaccurate. Given the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that the results or conditions described in such statements, or our objectives and plans will be achieved. Please refer to “Risk Factors” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 16, 2023, for further information on these and other risk factors affecting us, as such factors may be amended and updated from time to time in the Company’s subsequent periodic filings with the SEC, which are accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company’s management evaluates performance of the Company through the use of certain measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), including Adjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Earnings (Loss) per Share. We define Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as net income (loss) from continuing operations adjusted for changes in fair value of loans and securities held for investment and related obligations due to assumption changes, deferred purchase price obligations (including earnouts and Tax Receivable Agreement (“TRA”) obligations), contingent earnout, warrant liability, and minority investments, amortization and impairment of intangibles and other assets, equity-based compensation, certain non-recurring costs, and pro-forma income tax provision adjustments to apply an effective combined corporate tax rate to adjusted consolidated pre-tax income (loss) from continuing operations. We define Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted Net Income (Loss) (defined above) adjusted for taxes, interest on non-funding debt, and depreciation. We define Adjusted Earnings (Loss) Per Share as Adjusted Net Income (Loss) (defined above) divided by our weighted average outstanding shares, which includes our outstanding Class A Common Stock plus Finance of America Equity Capital LLC’s Class A LLC units owned by our noncontrolling interests on an if-converted basis. The presentation of non-GAAP measures is used to enhance investors’ understanding of certain aspects of our financial performance. This discussion is not meant to be considered in isolation, superior to, or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management believes these key financial measures provide an additional view of our performance over the long-term and provide useful information that we use in order to maintain and grow our business. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), operating cash flows, or any other performance measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Earnings (Loss) per Share have important limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations of these metrics are: (i) cash expenditures for future contractual commitments; (ii) cash requirements for working capital needs; (iii) cash requirements for certain tax payments; and (iv) all non-cash income/expense items. Because of these limitations, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Earnings (Loss) per Share should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or distribute to shareholders. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using our non-GAAP financial measures only as a supplement. Users of our consolidated financial statements are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of our forward-looking Adjusted Earnings per Share outlook to GAAP Earnings per Share and Net Income cannot be provided without unreasonable effort because of the inherent difficulty of accurately forecasting the occurrence and financial impact of the various adjusted items necessary for such reconciliation that have not yet occurred, are out of our control, or cannot be reasonably predicted. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to assess the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could have a material impact on its future GAAP financial results.

The Trust, a real estate investment trust, focuses on healthcare and human service-related facilities across twenty-one states. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Universal Health Realty Income Trust's dividend payout of $0.725 per share is a key indicator of the company's financial health and its commitment to returning value to its shareholders. From a financial perspective, the dividend yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the price per share, becomes a critical metric for investors to evaluate the attractiveness of UHT's stock relative to other investment opportunities. Additionally, the stability and growth of dividends over time are often seen as a reflection of a company's sustainable earnings and cash flow, which can imply a positive outlook on the company's ability to manage its specialized real estate portfolio effectively.Moreover, the timing and consistency of dividend payments can influence investor sentiment and stock price performance. In the case of UHT, the regular dividend may suggest a steady stream of rental income from its healthcare and human service-related facilities, which is a sector known for its resilience due to the non-cyclical nature of healthcare demand. In the long term, the ability of UHT to maintain or increase its dividend will depend on the occupancy rates, lease agreements and the financial health of its tenants, which are critical factors in the healthcare real estate investment trust (REIT) industry. Market Research Analyst In the realm of healthcare REITs, Universal Health Realty Income Trust's portfolio diversification across acute care hospitals, behavioral healthcare facilities and other healthcare-related properties is a strategic advantage. This diversification helps mitigate risks associated with changes in healthcare policy, regional healthcare demands and potential shifts in the healthcare industry due to technological advancements or demographic trends.Analyzing the market implications, the announcement of a dividend may also signal the Trust's operational efficiency and asset management capabilities. Investors often look at the performance of REITs in terms of funds from operations (FFO), a measure of cash flow specific to the real estate industry. A consistent dividend could imply a stable or growing FFO, which is a positive sign for shareholders. However, it's important to consider the payout ratio, which is the percentage of earnings paid to shareholders as dividends. An excessively high payout ratio could be unsustainable in the long run, whereas a moderate payout ratio may indicate room for future dividend growth or reinvestment in the portfolio for further expansion. Real Estate Investment Trust Analyst As a REIT, Universal Health Realty Income Trust is required by law to distribute at least 90% of its taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends, which can result in high dividend yields compared to other sectors. The specific focus on healthcare-related facilities is particularly noteworthy because these types of properties often have long-term leases and stable cash flows, which are conducive to the REIT's ability to pay consistent dividends.Given the Trust's investment in seventy-six properties across twenty-one states, geographic diversification also plays a role in mitigating risks such as local economic downturns or regional healthcare legislation changes. For stakeholders, the implications of this dividend announcement revolve around the trust's management effectiveness in optimizing occupancy rates and lease terms, which directly affect revenue stability. Long-term benefits could include capital appreciation of the properties and potential increases in dividend payouts if the trust can capitalize on favorable healthcare real estate market trends and maintain strong financial discipline. 03/06/2024 - 04:15 PM KING OF PRUSSIA, Pa., March 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Universal Health Realty Income Trust (NYSE: UHT) announced today that its Board of Trustees voted to pay a dividend of $.725 per share on March 29, 2024 to shareholders of record as of March 18, 2024.

ADT will not receive proceeds from the offering but will repurchase 15,000,000 shares as part of its existing program. Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Apollo Global Securities, and RBC Capital Markets are managing the offering. Positive None. Negative ADT Inc. will not receive any proceeds from the proposed offering, potentially impacting its cash reserves and financial flexibility in the short term. Financial Analyst The secondary public offering of 55 million shares by entities managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management represents a significant event for ADT Inc. and its investors. This move could indicate Apollo's strategy to diversify or liquidate part of their investment, which may affect ADT's stock liquidity and investor perception. With the additional 30-day option for underwriters to purchase up to 8.25 million more shares, there is a potential for increased market supply that could put downward pressure on the stock price in the short term.The concurrent share repurchase by ADT, however, signals confidence by the company in its own stock and could counterbalance the selling pressure by supporting the stock price. The fact that the repurchase is part of an existing $350 million program shows a planned capital allocation strategy. This repurchase will reduce the number of shares outstanding, potentially increasing earnings per share (EPS) and shareholder value over the long term. The absence of underwriting fees for the repurchased shares also highlights cost savings for ADT.Investors should monitor the market's reaction to these developments. The involvement of prominent financial institutions as book-running managers could enhance the offering's credibility, potentially attracting institutional investors and affecting the stock's trading volume and volatility. Market Research Analyst The dynamics of this secondary offering and share repurchase by ADT Inc. could have implications for the home security industry as a whole. ADT's decisions may reflect broader market trends or company-specific strategies. The offering's success and the subsequent share price performance could serve as a barometer for investor sentiment towards the industry.It is also important to consider the competitive landscape. If ADT is perceived as financially strengthening through this strategic maneuver, it may gain a competitive edge. Conversely, if the market interprets the large sale by Apollo as a lack of confidence in ADT's future prospects, it could have a detrimental effect on ADT's market positioning. Observing competitor reactions and market share shifts following these financial moves will provide additional insights into the industry's health and ADT's place within it. Legal Expert From a legal perspective, the effectiveness of the shelf registration statement and the filing of a preliminary prospectus supplement with the Securities and Exchange Commission are critical steps in ensuring regulatory compliance for the secondary offering. Interested parties are encouraged to review these documents for a comprehensive understanding of the offering's terms, risks and the company's financial standing.Moreover, the legal intricacies of such transactions, including the underwriters' 30-day option and the conditions under which the share repurchase is authorized, must be carefully structured to adhere to securities law and protect shareholder interests. The absence of underwriting fees for the repurchased shares could also be seen as a strategic legal structuring to benefit ADT's financial position. 03/06/2024 - 04:17 PM BOCA RATON, Fla., March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ADT Inc.

Bone Biologics Announces Closing of $2.0 Million Public Offering,2024-03-06T21:15:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Bone Biologics Corporation (BBLG) closes public offering, raising $2.0 million for clinical trials and patent portfolio.","Bone Biologics Announces Closing of $2.0 Million Public Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Bone Biologics Corporation (BBLG) closes public offering, raising $2.0 million for clinical trials and patent portfolio. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent public offering by Bone Biologics Corporation represents a strategic move to bolster its financial position. By raising approximately $2.0 million before fees and expenses, the company is aiming to fund critical clinical trials and support its patent portfolio, both of which are essential for sustaining innovation and competitive advantage in the orthobiologic products market. The pricing of the shares and warrants suggests a calculated approach to attract investment while offering potential upside through the warrants' exercise price being set below the offering price.Investors should note the immediate exercisability of the warrants, which could lead to dilution if a significant number of warrant holders choose to exercise their rights to purchase additional shares. The five-year expiration on the warrants also provides a long-term potential for investors, but this comes with the inherent risks associated with the biotechnology sector, including the lengthy and uncertain nature of product development and regulatory approval processes. The use of proceeds indicates a focus on advancing the company's product pipeline, which could enhance its market position if successful but also carries the risk of sunk costs if the trials do not yield favorable results. Medical Research Analyst The orthobiologic sector is highly dependent on successful clinical trial outcomes to bring new products to market. Bone Biologics' allocation of funds towards clinical trials is a critical step in the development of spine fusion products. The success of these trials will be a significant determinant of the company's future revenue streams and market share. The focus on maintaining and extending the patent portfolio is equally important, as it protects the company's intellectual property and can prevent competitors from entering the market with similar products.It is crucial for stakeholders to monitor the progress of these clinical trials closely, as they will provide valuable data on the efficacy and safety of the company's products. Positive trial results could lead to a surge in investor confidence and potentially increase the company's valuation. Conversely, any setbacks could have a detrimental effect on the stock price and investor sentiment. The long-term success of Bone Biologics hinges on its ability to navigate the complex regulatory environment and bring innovative products to a market that is increasingly demanding more effective and less invasive treatment options. Market Research Analyst The offering's timing and structure suggest that Bone Biologics is responding to market demands for innovative spine fusion solutions. The orthobiologic market is experiencing growth due to advancements in technology and an aging population that requires more orthopedic care. By securing additional capital, Bone Biologics may accelerate its go-to-market strategy and potentially capture a larger share of this expanding market. However, the impact of this capital infusion on the company's stock will depend on the perceived value of the clinical trials and intellectual property strategy by the market participants.Investors will likely scrutinize the company's ability to manage its working capital efficiently and its general corporate strategies. The orthobiologic industry is competitive and the company's success will depend not only on its clinical outcomes but also on its ability to effectively commercialize its products and navigate the market dynamics. The market will be watching for milestones and updates related to the clinical trials, which can serve as catalysts for stock price movement. The expertise of H.C. Wainwright & Co. as the exclusive placement agent could also instill confidence in the offering's execution and the company's strategic direction. 03/06/2024 - 04:15 PM BURLINGTON, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Bone Biologics Corporation (“Bone Biologics” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: BBLG, BBLGW), a developer of orthobiologic products for spine fusion markets, today announced the closing of its previously announced public offering of an aggregate of 781,251 shares of its common stock (or common stock equivalents in lieu thereof) and warrants to purchase up to 781,251 shares of common stock, at a public offering price of $2.56 per share (or common stock equivalent in lieu thereof) and accompanying warrant.

(GBIO) reports progress in developing cell-targeted lipid nanoparticle delivery for sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia, alongside advancements in immune-quiet DNA for hemophilia A. The company's cash balance of $264.4 million is expected to sustain operations till the second half of 2027. Positive Generation Bio is making strides in leveraging its ctLNP platform for in vivo T cell and hematopoietic stem cell programs, showcasing selective targeting and high delivery efficiency. The development of iqDNA by Generation Bio demonstrates immune-quiet properties, with robust expression in mice, paving the way for innovative therapeutic applications in hepatocytes and other cell types. The company's cash position of $264.4 million as of December 31, 2023, is projected to fund operational and capital needs until the second half of 2027, ensuring financial stability for future growth. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported cash balance of $264.4 million by Generation Bio Co. indicates a strong cash position, providing the company with a significant runway to fund its operations into the second half of 2027. This is a critical factor for investors as it suggests the company does not require immediate additional financing, which could dilute existing shareholders' equity. The slight decrease in cash reserves from the previous year's $279.1 million is not alarming given the R&D investments made during the period.Regarding R&D expenses, the increase to $93.6 million for the year, despite a reduction in force, reflects the company's commitment to advancing its technology platforms and in vivo programs. The one-time charge of $5.1 million indicates a restructuring, which could be seen as a strategic move to streamline operations and allocate resources more efficiently. Investors typically look for such cost optimization strategies as they can lead to improved operational efficiencies and potentially better margins in the long term.The net loss figures, while significant, are not uncommon for biotechnology companies in the development stage. The slight improvement from a net loss of $136.6 million in 2022 to $126.6 million in 2023 could be interpreted as a positive trend, reflecting management's control over expenses while pursuing their R&D objectives. However, the basic and diluted net loss per share of $1.96 for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $2.35 for 2022, should be seen in the context of the company's long-term potential to bring new treatments to market. Biotechnology Market Analyst Generation Bio Co.'s focus on developing its proprietary cell-targeted lipid nanoparticle (ctLNP) delivery system and immune-quiet DNA (iqDNA) platforms could represent a significant advancement in the treatment of genetic diseases like sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia. The ability to target and transduce T cells and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in vivo is a notable scientific breakthrough, potentially offering a competitive edge over existing ex vivo therapies.From a market perspective, the shift towards in vivo therapies could disrupt the current treatment paradigm, offering patients less invasive and more accessible treatment options. The company's collaboration with Moderna on T cell therapies also adds credibility and potential synergies in R&D. The focus on optimizing iqDNA for hepatocytes and T cells is equally promising, with the potential to address a wide range of genetic diseases, including hemophilia A.The strategic importance of these developments cannot be overstated. If successful, Generation Bio's platforms could lead to new therapeutic classes with broad applications, positioning the company as a leader in genetic medicine. This could have long-term positive implications for the company's market positioning and valuation, pending successful clinical development and regulatory approvals. Medical Research Analyst The development of ctLNP and iqDNA by Generation Bio Co. represents a significant step in the field of genetic medicine. The high selectivity and potency in targeting T cells and HSCs in humanized mouse models suggest potential for a paradigm shift in the treatment of diseases like sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia. Unlike traditional ex vivo approaches, which often require chemotherapy and are limited by the availability of treatment slots and high costs, in vivo therapies can be administered directly into the patient, potentially reducing the treatment burden and associated costs.The reported progress in the development of immune-quiet DNA is particularly noteworthy. By avoiding innate immune detection, iqDNA could enable sustained therapeutic gene expression without eliciting an adverse immune response, which is a common challenge in gene therapy. This innovation could lead to treatments that are not only more effective but also safer for patients.While these technologies are promising, it is important to note the challenges ahead, including the need to demonstrate efficacy and safety in clinical trials and to navigate the complex regulatory landscape. The reported financial stability of the company provides a conducive environment for these critical development phases. The implications for patients with genetic diseases could be profound, offering hope for more effective and convenient therapies in the future. 03/06/2024 - 04:20 PM - Company is leveraging proprietary cell-targeted lipid nanoparticle delivery to develop wholly-owned in vivo program for sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia - Development of breakthrough immune-quiet DNA for hemophilia A program continues - Cash balance of $264.4 million expected to fund operations into 2H 2027 CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Generation Bio Co. (Nasdaq:GBIO), a biotechnology company innovating genetic medicines for people living with rare and prevalent diseases, reported business highlights and fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. “Late last year we announced important advances in our cell-targeted lipid nanoparticle and immune-quiet DNA platforms that we are now translating to our portfolio strategy,” said Geoff McDonough, M.D., chief executive officer of Generation Bio. “The potency and selectivity of our ctLNP platform open up significant opportunities for in vivo delivery of T cell and hematopoietic stem cell therapies, and this year we are laying the foundation for a wholly-owned program in sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia. We are also continuing to optimize iqDNA to progress our hemophilia A program and to explore therapeutic applications in cell types beyond hepatocytes. With our current cash balance, we believe we have sufficient runway to reach meaningful development milestones for our platforms and programs.” Business Highlights Developing ctLNP for in vivo T cell and hematopoeitc stem cell (HSC) programs: Generation Bio’s ctLNP platform has demonstrated a set of key characteristics that could make possible in vivo genetic medicine approaches to treating diseases for which only ex vivo therapies are currently available. The company has developed ctLNPs that selectively target and transduce 75% of circulating and splenic T cells and maintain high levels of delivery at doses as low as 0.005 mg/kg in humanized mice. In addition to continuing this work in T cells in collaboration with Moderna, Generation Bio is developing a wholly-owned in vivo program targeting HSCs to address sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia. In vivo approaches could offer important advantages over current ex vivo approaches, such as the lack of pre-treatment chemotherapy, redosing, on-demand availability and lower cost. In 2024, the company intends to show highly selective in vivo delivery to T cells with therapeutic transgenes, and proof of concept for specific and potent in vivo HSC targeting in humanized mouse models.Developing iqDNA for programs in hepatocytes and other cell types: In 2023, Generation Bio announced that it had developed a novel DNA cargo that was shown to avoid innate immune detection in both mice and NHPs.

Reports Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary BRC Inc. (NYSE: BRCC) reported a 28% increase in net revenue to $119.7 million in Q4 2023, with Wholesale growth of 79%. Profitability improved with Adjusted EBITDA of $12.1 million and a Net Loss of $14.0 million. The company expects accelerated profit and cash flow in 2024 with guidance for Adjusted EBITDA of $27.0 million to $40.0 million. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported 28% increase in net revenue for Q4 2023 is a significant indicator of BRC Inc.'s growth trajectory, particularly in the wholesale segment, which saw a 79% surge. This performance substantially outpaces the category growth, suggesting that the company is gaining market share and strengthening its competitive position within the FDM and RTD coffee segments. The strategic pivot towards wholesale channels is noteworthy because it typically involves lower marketing costs compared to DTC, which could be a factor in the decreased marketing expenses and improved profitability.The company's focus on efficiency is evident in the reduced general and administrative expenses, contributing to a healthier bottom line despite a net loss. The projected Adjusted EBITDA for 2024 indicates management's confidence in continued operational improvements and cash flow generation. Investors should monitor the company's ability to maintain this momentum and manage the lower gross margins associated with the RTD product mix shift, as well as the potential risks from inflationary pressures on raw materials and finished goods. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the improvement in Adjusted EBITDA from a loss of $11.4 million to a positive $12.1 million is a critical turnaround, highlighting the company's progress towards profitability. The net loss reduction from $20.0 million to $14.0 million further underscores this trend. However, the decrease in gross margin by 500 basis points is a concern that warrants attention, as it reflects the impact of product mix, inventory reserves and inflation, which could squeeze profitability if not managed effectively.The guidance for 2024, with an Adjusted EBITDA range of $27.0 million to $40.0 million and a Free Cash Flow conversion rate of approximately 80%, signals strong expectations for operational efficiency and profitability. Investors should consider the implications of the barter transaction on reported revenue, as it inflates the top-line figures. Excluding this, the underlying revenue growth is less pronounced, which is an essential consideration for assessing the company's organic growth. Economist The company's performance must be contextualized within the broader economic environment. The inflationary pressures mentioned, which have affected raw materials and finished goods costs, are reflective of current macroeconomic conditions. The ability of BRC Inc. to navigate these challenges while still posting significant revenue growth is commendable and indicates strong management and operational resilience.The strategic reduction in marketing expenses, coupled with the shift towards wholesale distribution, suggests a tactical adaptation to market conditions that may favor lower-cost channels during times of economic uncertainty. The company's guidance for the upcoming fiscal year, particularly the anticipated increase in gross margin, suggests an expectation of either easing inflationary pressures or improved cost management strategies. Stakeholders should closely observe macroeconomic trends, as these will undoubtedly influence the company's financial health and its ability to meet projected targets. 03/06/2024 - 04:15 PM Financial Highlights Net Revenue increased 28% in Q4 2023 to $119.7 million, driven by Wholesale growth of 79% versus Q4 of 2022 Outpaced category growth by over 18x within the FDM coffee category and 4x within RTD category Profitability sequentially improved in Q4 2023; Adjusted EBITDA of $12.1 million and a Net Loss of $14.0 million compared to Adjusted EBITDA Loss of $11.4 million and a Net Loss of $20.0 million a year ago Continued acceleration of profit and cash flow expected in 2024 with guidance issued for Adjusted EBITDA of $27.0 million to $40.0 million with Free Cash Flow conversion of ~80% of Adjusted EBITDA SALT LAKE CITY, Utah--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BRC Inc. (NYSE: BRCC), the rapidly-growing, mission-driven premium coffee company creating long-term shareholder value through innovative brand strategy that elevates the service community, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. “Black Rifle continues to build momentum as a brand, as an efficient, well-run company, and most importantly, in its ability to impact the veteran and first responder community. We are one of the fastest growing brands in the coffee category, with bagged coffee growing at 18x the category and RTD coffee 4x the category,” said BRCC Chief Executive Officer Chris Mondzelewski. “Our brand awareness is now 29%, a 400bps increase since this past summer (Q3 2023), and we continue to have the #1 Net Promoter Score among coffee brands. Additionally, we continue to find ways to generate efficiency in our business, driving faster decision making and a stronger bottom line. Above all, Black Rifle continues to press our mission forward to serve the veteran and first responder community. Our Veterans Day partnership with the UFC and Hunter Seven Foundation raised over $250,000 in one weekend for Veterans battling cancer. I am honored to have the opportunity to lead this proud organization.” “BRCC has reached an inflection point, driven by a renewed focus on efficiency and effectiveness, giving us confidence in our first full-year guidance of positive profit and free cash flow,” said BRCC Chief Financial Officer Steve Kadenacy. “Our strong performance during the past fiscal year demonstrates our commitment to excellence at every level of the company. We’ve further refined operations to serve our greater vision for the company – a vision that will allow us to strengthen and grow the business while creating value for our customers, partners, and investors.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Highlights (in millions, except % data) Quarter To Date Comparisons Year To Date Comparisons 2023 2022 $ Change % Change 2023 2022 $ Change % Change Net Revenue $ 119.7 $ 93.6 $ 26.1 28% $ 395.6 $ 301.3 $ 94.3 31% Gross Profit $ 31.7 $ 29.5 $ 2.2 7% $ 125.4 $ 99.2 $ 26.2 26% Gross Margin 26.5 % 31.5 % 31.7 % 32.9 % Net Loss $ (14.0 ) $ (20.0 ) $ 6.0 $ (56.7 ) $ (338.0 ) $ 281.3 Adjusted EBITDA $ 12.1 $ (11.4 ) $ 23.5 $ 13.3 $ (34.0 ) $ 47.3 Fourth Quarter 2023 Results Fourth quarter 2023 revenue increased 27.8% to $119.7 million from $93.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Wholesale revenue increased 78.5% to $73.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 from $41.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Direct-to-Consumer (""DTC"") revenue decreased 14.4% to $39.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 from $45.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2022. Outpost revenue increased 3.9% to $7.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 from $6.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The Wholesale channel performance was primarily driven by entry into Food, Drug and Mass (“FDM”) market and growth in our Ready-to-Drink (“RTD”) product and included $28.9 million attributable to a barter transaction in which we received advertising services in exchange for our RTD product. In addition, RTD product sales increased through national distributors and retail accounts as our All Commodity Volume percentage increased 480 basis points to 43.4% and our total doors increased 41.8% versus the fourth quarter of 2022. The DTC performance was primarily due to lower customer acquisition as we strategically shifted advertising spend to other areas with higher returns. The Outpost channel performance was driven by an increase in our company-owned store count, which increased to eighteen in the fourth quarter of 2023 from fifteen company-owned outposts in the fourth quarter of 2022. Gross profit increased to $31.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 from $29.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of 7.5% year to year, with gross margin decreasing 500 basis points to 26.5% from 31.5% for the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by product mix shift, as RTD has lower margins than bagged coffee, an increase in our inventory reserve as a result of excess RTD inventory, and inflation in raw materials and finished goods. Marketing expenses decreased 38.3% to $8.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 from $13.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. As a percentage of revenue, marketing expenses decreased 750 basis points to 7.0% in the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to 14.5% in the fourth quarter of 2022 as marketing and advertising spend has been favorably impacted by channel mix with revenue growth primarily coming from the Wholesale channel, which requires lower marketing spend than DTC, partly offset by an increase in marketing fees related to a strategic partnership. Salaries, wages and benefits expenses increased 12.4% to $19.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 from $16.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. As a percentage of revenue, salaries, wages and benefits expenses decreased 220 basis points to 15.9% in the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to 18.0% for the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease in salaries, wages and benefits expense was driven by a reduction in headcount as well as a result of a change in estimate for a discretionary payroll accrual and a decrease in stock compensation expense, partially offset by severance expense incurred during the quarter. General and administrative (""G&A"") expenses decreased 18.3% to $15.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 from $18.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. As a percentage of revenue, G&A decreased 710 basis points to 12.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to 19.7% in the fourth quarter of 2022, benefiting from continued revenue growth and scale efficiencies. G&A expenses included $2.9 million of legal fees related to non-routine legal matters arising from the Business Combination in 2022, which continued from the previous quarter. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $14.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA was $12.1 million. This compares to net loss of $20.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA loss of $11.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Financial Outlook BRC Inc. provides guidance based on current market conditions and expectations for revenue, gross margin and adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. For the Full-year fiscal 2024, the Company expects: FY2023 FY2024 Guidance Actual Low High Net Revenue(1) $ 395.6 $ 430.0 $ 460.0 Growth 31 % 9 % 16 % Gross Margin 31.7 % 37 % 40 % Adj. EBITDA $ 13.3 $ 27.0 $ 40.0 Free Cash Flow 80% Flow Through (1) A barter transaction favorably impacted Net Revenue in 2023 by $28.9 million and projected Net Revenue in 2024 by an estimated $6.5 million. Excluding the impact of the barter transaction reduces revenue growth from 2022 to 2023 by 10% and increases projected Net Revenue growth in 2024 by 6% - 8%.

Refer to the “Forward-Looking Statements” safe harbor section below for information on the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.

These measures, as defined below, are not defined or calculated under principles, standards or rules that comprise GAAP. Accordingly, the non-GAAP financial measures we use and refer to should not be viewed as a substitute for performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as a substitute for a measure of liquidity. Our definitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA described below are specific to our business and you should not assume that they are comparable to similarly titled financial measures of other companies. We define EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense. We also present EBITDA excluding non-cash fair value adjustments relating to the remeasurement of earn-out and derivative liabilities upon vesting events and the remeasurement of a warrant liability upon redemption of warrants. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding non-cash fair value adjustments, as adjusted for equity-based compensation, system implementation costs, transaction expenses, executive, recruiting, relocation and sign-on bonus, write-off of site development costs, strategic initiative related costs, non-routine legal expenses, RTD start-up production issues, (Gain) loss on assets held for sale, contract termination costs, restructuring fees and related costs, RTD transformation costs, and loss on impairment of assets. Investors should note that, beginning with results for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, we have modified the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA to no longer exclude Outpost pre-opening expenses, and beginning with the results for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, we have modified the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA to no longer exclude (i) expenses associated with certain legal expenses we have determined are no longer non-routine and (ii) cash expenses associated with RTD start-up and production issues. To conform to the current period’s presentation, we have excluded Outpost pre-opening expenses, the aforementioned legal expenses, and cash expenses associated with RTD start-up and production issues when presenting Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023 and the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022. This change decreased Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022 by $0.5 million and $1.1 million, respectively. When used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, we believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful supplemental measures of operating performance because these measures facilitate comparisons of historical performance by excluding non-cash items such as equity-based payments and other amounts not directly attributable to our primary operations, such as the impact of system implementation, acquisitions, disposals, litigation and settlements. Adjusted EBITDA is also a key metric used internally by our management to evaluate performance and develop internal budgets and forecasts. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP and may not provide a complete understanding of our operating results as a whole. Some of these limitations are (i) they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs, (ii) they do not reflect our interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt, (iii) they do not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes, (iv) they do not reflect historical capital expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments, (v) although equity-based compensation expenses are non-cash charges, we rely on equity compensation to compensate and incentivize employees, directors and certain consultants, and we may continue to do so in the future and (vi) although depreciation, amortization and impairments are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and these non-GAAP measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. A reconciliation of net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is set forth below: Reconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA (amounts in thousands) Quarter Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net loss $ (14,036 ) (20,030 ) $ (56,716 ) (338,044 ) Interest expense 1,672 457 6,330 1,593 Tax expense 16 101 185 367 Depreciation and amortization 1,909 1,328 7,263 4,383 EBITDA $ (10,439 ) $ (18,144 ) $ (42,938 ) $ (331,701 ) Non-cash fair value adjustments Change in fair value of earn-out liability expense(1) — — — 209,651 Change in fair value of warrant liability expense(2) — — — 56,675 Change in fair value of derivative liability(3) — — — 2,335 EBITDA, excluding non-cash fair value adjustments $ (10,439 ) $ (18,144 ) $ (42,938 ) $ (63,040 ) Equity-based compensation(4) 1,329 1,496 6,974 6,929 System implementation costs(5) 484 318 3,541 723 Transaction expenses(6) — — — 1,020 Executive recruiting, relocation and sign-on bonus(7) (29 ) 876 1,515 3,757 Write-off of site development costs(8) 341 730 2,833 1,055 Strategic initiative related costs(9) — 629 1,505 7,760 Non-routine legal expense(10) 2,909 781 10,290 1,866 RTD start-up and production issues(11) — 1,769 2,394 5,205 (Gain) Loss on assets held for sale(12) — — 105 — Contract termination costs(13) — 125 730 683 Restructuring fees and related costs(14) 1,692 — 6,812 — RTD transformation costs(15) 15,268 — 18,917 — Loss on impairment of assets 592 — 592 — Adjusted EBITDA $ 12,147 $ (11,420 ) $ 13,270 $ (34,042 ) (1) Represents the non-cash expense recognized to remeasure the earn-out liability to fair value upon vesting events.

Positive Strong full year 2023 revenues of $254.6 million for NeoGames S.A. Net loss of $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 Adjusted EBITDA increased by 39.8% year-over-year Expected completion of the Aristocrat Business Combination in the second quarter of 2024 Significant growth in iLottery, Games, and Sports segments Key partnerships and product launches driving business growth Negative Net loss of $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 Decline in revenues during the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 Negative impact on Aspire Core revenues due to regulatory changes in the UK and Germany Net negative cash flow of $12.2 million for the twelve months of 2023 Financial Analyst The financial results reported by NeoGames S.A. for the full year 2023 indicate a mixed financial performance, with a reported net loss of $18.3 million alongside an adjusted net income of $12.8 million and a significant increase in Adjusted EBITDA by 39.8% year-over-year. This divergence between reported net loss and adjusted net income can be attributed to non-cash expenses such as amortization of intangibles, which suggests that the underlying operational performance is stronger than the net loss implies. The reported increase in Adjusted EBITDA, a key indicator of profitability, demonstrates operational efficiency and cost management.However, the company's cash position has weakened, with a net negative cash flow of $12.2 million for the year. This could raise concerns about liquidity and the company's ability to fund its operations and strategic initiatives without resorting to additional financing. The revenue figures, when adjusted for the accounting change to net basis due to new commercial terms, show a year-over-year growth, indicating underlying business strength, particularly in the iLottery, Games and Sports segments.Investors should closely monitor the completion of the Aristocrat Business Combination, as it could have significant implications for the company's future strategy and operations. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2024, subject to regulatory approvals. This merger could potentially offer synergies and growth opportunities, but also comes with execution risks that need to be managed effectively. Market Research Analyst NeoGames S.A.'s progress in expanding its iLottery and iGaming solutions is noteworthy, with strong growth reported in three of its four business segments. The company's strategic partnerships and extensions, such as with the North Carolina Education Lottery and the West Virginia Lottery, are expected to contribute positively to future revenues. The successful launch of eInstants in new markets and the signing of new operators like Hard Rock Digital, DraftKings and bet365 indicate a robust demand for the company's offerings and an ability to capitalize on market opportunities.From a market perspective, the regulatory changes in the United Kingdom and the temporary pause in Germany, which have impacted Aspire Core revenues, highlight the regulatory risk inherent in the iGaming industry. Companies in this sector must navigate a complex and changing regulatory landscape, which can have immediate effects on operations and revenues. NeoGames' ability to secure a local license in Germany and adapt to regulatory changes is critical for maintaining revenue streams and ensuring compliance.The planned merger with Aristocrat Leisure presents a strategic move that could reshape the competitive landscape. If successful, the merger could enhance NeoGames' market position and enable it to leverage Aristocrat's resources for further expansion. However, the outcome of such a large-scale transaction is uncertain until all regulatory approvals are obtained and the merger is completed. Legal Expert The regulatory environment for iGaming and iLottery services is a significant factor influencing NeoGames S.A.'s operations. The company's recent experiences in the United Kingdom and Germany underscore the importance of staying ahead of regulatory changes and maintaining compliance to avoid disruptions in service. Obtaining a local license in Germany is a positive development, but it also reflects the company's need to manage regulatory risk across different jurisdictions.The anticipated merger with Aristocrat Leisure is subject to a complex regulatory approval process, involving gaming and antitrust authorities. The fact that NeoGames is still in the process of obtaining the necessary approvals suggests that the regulatory landscape is a major consideration for its business strategy. The legal complexities of transnational mergers, especially in the gaming sector, require careful navigation to ensure a smooth transition and to avoid potential setbacks that could affect shareholder value.Investors should be aware of the legal and regulatory hurdles that could impact the timeline and finalization of the Aristocrat transaction. Delays or complications in receiving approvals could affect the company's strategic plans and potentially its stock performance. 03/06/2024 - 04:15 PM – Full Year 2023 Revenues and Share of NPI Revenues Interest total $254.6 million –– Full Year 2023 Net Loss of $18.3 million and Adjusted Net Income, after taking effect of the amortization of Aspire intangibles, was $12.8 million –– Full Year 2023 Adjusted EBITDA total $76.2 million, an increase of 39.8% year-over-year –– Expected Timeline for Completion of the Aristocrat Business Combination during the second quarter 2024 – LUXEMBOURG, March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NeoGames S.A. (Nasdaq: NGMS) (“NeoGames” or the “Company”), a technology-driven provider of end-to-end iLottery and iGaming solutions, announced today financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. Moti Malul, Chief Executive Officer of NeoGames, said: “We are very pleased with the progress we made during the fourth quarter and during the entire year of 2023, progressing our strategic goals and working to complete our merger with Aristocrat Leisure, which we announced last May. We continue to see strong growth across our business lines, as three of our four segments, including iLottery, Games, and Sports, all demonstrated strong double-digit growth in 2023. Our iLottery business continues to show strong growth, increasing 11.1% during the quarter and 22.4% for the full year 2023, with further room to run.We just launched our market leading eInstants with the North Carolina Education Lottery, where the launch has demonstrated significant early success, mirroring trends we saw when we first launched our eInstants product in Virginia. We also signed a two-year extension with the North Carolina Education Lottery, further cementing this valuable partnership. In another exciting development, NeoPollard Interactive was awarded a new ten-year contract to provide our turn-key iLottery solutions to the West Virginia Lottery, which is expected to launch during the fourth quarter of 2024.Our Pariplay business also saw excellent growth, signing several major new operators during the quarter including Hard Rock Digital, DraftKings and bet365.Subsequent to quarter-end, we are also excited with our planned launch in Tennessee in the coming weeks with Action 24/7, Aspire’s first U.S. customer to go live with online sports betting. We are focused on achieving sustainable growth and remain encouraged by the interest and pipeline in the U.S. market for our iGaming offering. As we look ahead, we will maintain our focus on investing in the execution of our recently announced partnerships and product enhancements. These efforts will further strengthen our capabilities and position us to capitalize on the meaningful growth opportunities across our business as the market continues to evolve.” Malul continued, “We continue to make progress towards completing our merger with Aristocrat Leisure and continue to receive the regulatory approvals required to close. We currently expect we will be able to obtain the remaining regulatory approvals by the end of April and should that happen we see a path to close during May.” Malul stated. “In the meantime, we remain dedicated to elevating the iGaming landscape, capitalizing on opportunities, and diligently executing on our strategic objectives for the benefit of all stakeholders.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Highlights The total of Revenues and the Company’s share of NPI revenues was $64.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $83.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2022. These figures reflect accounting for the majority of Aspire Core revenues on a net basis in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to historical figures in the fourth quarter of 2022, which were prepared on a gross basis, prompted by new commercial terms in certain Aspire Core contracts which went into effect on January 1, 2023. If iGaming revenues had been accounted for on a gross basis for the Aspire Core, the total of Revenue and the Company’s share in NPI revenues would have been $95.2 million, which would have reflected 14.5% year-over-year growth when measured in reporting currency. In addition to accounting for the new commercial terms, current year results reflect continued growth in the Company’s iLottery, Games and Sports business lines, partially offset by a slowdown in Aspire Core revenues due to regulatory changes in the United Kingdom and a temporary pause in operations in Germany prior and due to the Company obtaining its local license to operate.iLottery revenues were $14.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $14.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2022, representing a decrease of (0.4)% year-over-year. In addition, the Company’s share in NPI revenues was $17.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $14.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2022, representing an increase of 22.9% year-over-year. The total of NeoGames’ iLottery revenue plus the Company’s share of NPI revenues during the fourth quarter of 2023 was $31.6 million, up 11.1% year-over-year, primarily driven by continued positive growth trend across most major accounts as well as by very strong performance of new game launches by NeoGames Studio.iGaming revenues were $33.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. These figures reflect accounting for the majority of Aspire Core revenues on a net basis compared to historical figures which were prepared on a gross basis, prompted by new commercial terms in certain Aspire Core contracts which went into effect on January 1, 2023. If iGaming revenues had been accounted for on a gross basis for the Aspire Core, total revenue would have been $63.7 million for iGaming primarily driven by continued growth in Games and Sports business lines, partially offset by a slowdown in Aspire Core revenues due to regulatory changes in the United Kingdom and a temporary pause in operations in Germany prior to the Company recently securing its local license to operate, which would have reflected 16.2% year-over-year growth when measured in reporting currency.Net loss was $(6.1) million, or $(0.18) per share, during the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to a net loss of $(0.8) million, or $(0.02) per share, during the fourth quarter of 2022. Net loss during the fourth quarter of 2023 was mainly due to costs attributed to the Aristocrat transaction and the amortization attributable to the Aspire business combination, income tax expenses and interest and finance related expenses.Adjusted net income1 was $1.7 million, or $0.05 per share, during the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $7.3 million, or $0.22 per share, during the fourth quarter of 2022.Adjusted EBITDA¹ was $18.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $18.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2022, representing an increase of 0.4% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA results slightly increased during the quarter compared to the prior year, mainly due to good performance of the iLottery and the sports business lines, offset primarily by the Aspire Core business due to several factors related to the adaptation of regulatory changes as well as changes in partner mix. Full Year 2023 Financial Highlights The total of Revenues and the Company’s share of NPI revenues was $254.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $210.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. These figures reflect accounting for the majority of Aspire Core revenues on a net basis for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to historical figures during the year ended December 31, 2022, which were prepared on a gross basis, prompted by new commercial terms in certain Aspire Core contracts which went into effect on January 1, 2023. If iGaming revenues had been accounted for on a gross basis for the Aspire Core, the total of Revenue and the Company’s share in NPI revenues would have been $351.3 million, which would have reflected 15.2% year-over-year growth when measured in reporting currency. In addition to accounting for the new commercial terms, current year results reflect continued growth in the Company’s iLottery, Games and Sports business lines, partially offset by a slowdown in Aspire Core revenues due to regulatory changes in the United Kingdom and a temporary pause in operations in Germany prior to the Company recently securing its local license to operate. In addition to growth in our business lines, the strong comparison to the prior year is also due to partial year results from the Aspire business, as our acquisition completed on June 16, 2022.iLottery revenues were $57.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $53.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, representing an increase of 6.3% year-over-year. In addition, the Company’s share in NPI revenues was $63.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $44.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, representing an increase of 41.8% year-over-year. The total of NeoGames’ iLottery revenue plus the Company’s share of NPI revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $120.0 million, up 22.4% year-over-year, primarily driven by continued positive growth trend across most major accounts, as well as a jackpot run during the third quarter of 2023.iGaming revenues were $134.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. These figures reflect accounting for the majority of Aspire Core revenues on a net basis compared to historical figures which were prepared on a gross basis, prompted by new commercial terms in certain Aspire Core contracts which went into effect on January 1, 2023. If iGaming revenues had been accounted for on a gross basis for the Aspire Core, total revenue would have been $231.3 million for iGaming primarily driven by continued growth in Games and Sports business lines, partially offset by a slowdown in Aspire Core revenues due to regulatory changes in the United Kingdom and a temporary pause in operations in Germany prior to the Company recently securing its local license to operate, which would have reflected 11.8% year-over-year growth when measured in reporting currency.Net loss was $(18.3) million, or $(0.54) per share, for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to a net loss of $(19.0) million, or $(0.64) per share, for the year ended December 31, 2022. Net loss during the year ended December 31, 2023 was mainly due to income tax expenses, interest and other finance related expenses and the amortization attributable to the Aspire business combination, offset by a reduction in business combination related expenses.Adjusted net income1 was $12.8 million, or $0.38 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to Adjusted net loss1 of $(3.1) million, or $(0.11) per share, for the year ended December 31, 2022.Adjusted EBITDA1 was $76.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $54.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, representing an increase of 39.8% year-over-year.Cash and cash equivalents balance as of the year ended December 31, 2023 was $29.0 million, compared to $41.2 million at the end of 2022, resulting in net negative cash of $12.2 million for the twelve months of 2023. The difference in cash flows is primarily attributable to a number of key factors including advisor payments related to the Aristocrat transaction, slowness in Aspire Core operations, a consideration for the acquisition of the remaining shares of GMS Entertainment Ltd. from the managing director of Pariplay, and the impact from a bank guarantee required to secure the Company’s German license.

Aristocrat Transaction On May 15, 2023, the Company entered into a definitive Business Combination Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Aristocrat Leisure Limited (ASX:ALL) (“Aristocrat”) and Anaxi Investments Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Aristocrat (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which the Company is to be acquired by Aristocrat for $29.50 per share in an all-cash transaction. Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company agreed to transfer its statutory seat, registered office and seat of central administration (siège de l'administration centrale) from the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg to the Cayman Islands by way of continuation (the “Continuation”) and as promptly practical, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, which will be the surviving company and become a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Aristocrat (the “Merger”). On July 18, 2023, NeoGames’ shareholders approved the Agreement and the Continuation, which will become effective subject to certain regulatory approvals. A second NeoGames shareholder vote to approve the Merger will take place immediately following the effectiveness of the Continuation during the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. NeoGames’ shareholders representing approximately 61% of the Company’s outstanding shares have executed a support agreement with Aristocrat, pursuant to which they have also irrevocably agreed to vote in favor of the Merger. Completion of the transaction is contingent upon customary closing conditions, including the receipt of all required gaming and antitrust approvals. We continue to receive regulatory approvals as we work closely with Aristocrat towards finalizing the deal. We currently remain on track and expect to receive all regulatory approvals before the end of April 2024. We continue to plan to work closely with those remaining regulatory authorities and expect a closing date in May 2024 is possible.

Non-IFRS Financial Measures and Key Performance Indicators This press release may include E(L)BIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, NPI and NPI Revenues Interest, adjusted net income (loss), Adjusted EPS and revenues growth measured in constant currency which are financial measures not presented in accordance with IFRS. We use these financial measures to supplement our results presented in accordance with IFRS. We include these non-IFRS financial measures because they are used by our management to evaluate our operating performance and trends and to make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and new investments. The Company presents revenues growth measured in constant currency since we use constant currency information to provide a framework in assessing how our business and geographic segments performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and believe this information is useful to investors to facilitate comparisons and better identify trends in our business. E(L)BIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss), Adjusted EPS and revenues growth measured in constant currency. We define “E(L)BIT” as net income (loss), plus income taxes, and interest and finance-related expenses. We define “EBITDA” as E(L)BIT, plus depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, plus share-based compensation, prospective business combination and business combination related expenses and the Company’s share in NPI depreciation and amortization. We define adjusted net income (loss) as net loss adjusted by adding amortization attributable to intangible assets acquired in business combination, net of tax. We define adjusted EPS as adjusted net income (loss) divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding. We define revenues growth measured in constant currency as revenue adjusted by using the average foreign exchange rates for fiscal year 2023, as reported by third parties, when converting revenues recorded in foreign currencies to US dollar. We believe E(L)BIT, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss) and revenues growth measured in constant currency are useful in evaluating our operating performance, as they are regularly used by security analysts, institutional investors and others in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss) and revenues growth measured in constant currency are not intended to be a substitute for any IFRS financial measure and, as calculated, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of performance of other companies in other industries or within the same industry.

Refer to note (13) in the ""Notes to the Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section below for additional discussion. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS Total revenues were $498 million in fourth-quarter 2023, a decrease of 10% compared to $556 million in fourth-quarter 2022. This decrease was primarily attributable to decreased revenues from the Generic Pharmaceuticals and Sterile Injectables segments, partially offset by increased revenues from the Branded Pharmaceuticals segment. Reported loss from continuing operations in fourth-quarter 2023 was $2,441 million compared to reported loss from continuing operations of $245 million in fourth-quarter 2022. This change was driven by adjustments to our estimated allowed claims, including with respect to certain litigation matters and debt obligations. The allowed claims will be reduced to reflect actual payments upon Chapter 11 emergence, which is expected to occur in second-quarter 2024. Adjusted income from continuing operations in fourth-quarter 2023 was $151 million compared to $190 million in fourth-quarter 2022. This change was primarily driven by decreased revenues. BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS SEGMENT Fourth-quarter 2023 Branded Pharmaceuticals segment revenues were $246 million compared to $224 million during fourth-quarter 2022. Specialty Products revenues increased 16% to $188 million in fourth-quarter 2023 compared to $162 million in fourth-quarter 2022. This change was primarily due to an increase in XIAFLEX® revenues, partially offset by a decrease in SUPPRELIN® LA revenues mainly driven by lower volumes. Fourth-quarter 2023 XIAFLEX® revenues were $148 million, a 29% increase compared to fourth-quarter 2022 driven by increased net selling price and increased volumes. The increase in net selling price was primarily attributable to reversing approximately $14 million of reserves recorded during the first three quarters of 2023 following application of the final Inflation Reduction Act vial-wastage rebate determination. STERILE INJECTABLES SEGMENT Fourth-quarter 2023 Sterile Injectables segment revenues were $96 million, a decrease of 11% compared to $108 million during fourth-quarter 2022. This decrease was primarily attributable to competitive pressure on VASOSTRICT® and ADRENALIN®. GENERIC PHARMACEUTICALS SEGMENT Fourth-quarter 2023 Generic Pharmaceuticals segment revenues were $139 million, a decrease of 32% compared to $205 million during fourth-quarter 2022. This decrease was primarily attributable to competitive pressure on varenicline tablets, the generic version of Chantix®, and lubiprostone capsules, the authorized generic of Mallinckrodt's Amitiza®, partially offset by revenue from dexlansoprazole delayed release capsules, the generic version of Dexilant®, which launched during fourth-quarter 2022. INTERNATIONAL PHARMACEUTICALS SEGMENT Fourth-quarter 2023 International Pharmaceuticals segment revenues were $17 million, a decrease of 14% compared to $20 million during fourth-quarter 2022. This decrease was primarily attributable to competitive pressure on several products. 2024 FINANCIAL EXPECTATIONS Endo is providing financial guidance for the full-year ending December 31, 2024, which contemplates key uncertainties, including competitive assumptions related to VASOSTRICT® ready-to-use, ADRENALIN ® and generic Dexilant ® products.

Some or all of the adequate protection payments may later be recharacterized as interest expense and/or as operating cash outflows depending upon certain developments in the Chapter 11 proceedings, which could result in increases in interest expense and/or decreases in operating cash flows in future periods that may be material.

These non-GAAP financial measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for GAAP net income and its components and diluted net income per share amounts. Despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement, the Company stresses that these are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of the non-standardized definitions, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP adjusted net income from continuing operations and its components (unlike GAAP net income from continuing operations and its components) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. However, the Company does not provide reconciliations of projected non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, nor does it provide comparable projected GAAP financial measures for such projected non-GAAP financial measures. The Company is unable to provide such reconciliations without unreasonable efforts due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations, including adjustments that could be made for asset impairments, contingent consideration adjustments, legal settlements, gain / loss on extinguishment of debt, adjustments to inventory and other charges reflected in the reconciliation of historic numbers, the amounts of which could be significant.

Return on average equity reported at 26.4% for Q4 and 13.9% for the full year. Gross premiums written at $433.8 million for Q4 and $1,951.0 million for the full year. Combined ratio of 90.2% for Q4 and 90.1% for the full year. Positive growth in net premiums written and earned across International and Bermuda Segments. Investments and shareholders' equity increased with total invested assets and cash at $4.0 billion and total shareholders' equity at $2.0 billion. Book value per share increased to $18.58 compared to $16.14 in 2022, marking a 15.1% growth. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results by Hamilton Insurance Group show a substantial year-over-year improvement. A notable net income increase of $356.7 million from a loss in the previous year to a profit indicates a significant turnaround. The combined ratio, a key indicator of profitability in the insurance industry, improved from 102.8% to 90.1%, suggesting effective cost management and underwriting discipline. The annualized return on average equity (ROAE) of 13.9% for the full year, compared to a negative return in the previous year, reflects a robust recovery in profitability.From an investment perspective, the increase in book value per share by 15.1% is a strong signal of value creation for shareholders. The growth in gross premiums written, both in the International and Bermuda Segments, indicates market expansion and possibly improved pricing conditions. However, it's important to monitor the sustainability of these growth rates and the potential for market saturation or increased competition.It's also worth noting the income tax benefit of $35.1 million, which has positively impacted net income due to the enactment of the Bermuda Corporate Income Tax Act of 2023. Investors should consider the potential for future tax changes that could affect profitability. Insurance Industry Analyst The reported combined ratio of 90.1% is significantly lower than the 100% breakeven point; this indicates that Hamilton is earning more in premiums than it's paying out in claims and expenses, which is commendable in the current market. The decrease in catastrophe loss ratio from the previous year suggests either a lower incidence of catastrophic events or better risk management and reinsurance strategies.Hamilton's growth in gross premiums written and net premiums earned across both segments is indicative of successful expansion efforts and could be attributed to strategic underwriting and favorable market conditions. However, the increase in net investment income is also significant, as it suggests an effective investment strategy, particularly with the Two Sigma Hamilton Fund's contribution.Despite the positive results, the slight uptick in the combined ratio for the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year might raise questions about whether expense management or loss ratios could be further optimized. Risk Management Analyst The catastrophe losses reported, including those from the Hawaii wildfires and the March Storms, highlight the importance of robust risk management practices in the insurance industry. Hamilton's ability to maintain a combined ratio below 100% despite these losses suggests effective use of reinsurance and other risk mitigation strategies.Additionally, the favorable attritional loss ratio improvements suggest that Hamilton is experiencing lower than expected claims costs, which could be due to conservative reserving practices or an improved risk selection process. The favorable prior year reserve development indicates that claims reserves set aside in previous years were higher than necessary, which may release capital for future underwriting opportunities or return to shareholders.Investors should appreciate the company's risk management but remain vigilant about potential future risks that could impact the loss ratios, such as climate change, which could lead to more frequent or severe catastrophic events. 03/06/2024 - 04:15 PM PEMBROKE, Bermuda--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Hamilton Insurance Group, Ltd.

Some of the measurements are considered non-GAAP financial measures under SEC rules and regulations. In this press release, we present underwriting income (loss), a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in Item 10(e) of SEC Regulation S-K. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures, which may be defined and calculated differently by other companies, help explain and enhance the understanding of our results of operations. However, these measures should not be viewed as a substitute for those determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Where appropriate, reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP figures are included below. Underwriting Income (Loss) We calculate underwriting income (loss) on a pre-tax basis as net premiums earned less losses and loss adjustment expenses, acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses (net of third party fee income). We believe that this measure of our performance focuses on the core fundamental performance of the Company’s reportable segments in any given period and is not distorted by investment market conditions, corporate expense allocations or income tax effects. The following table reconciles underwriting income (loss) to net income (loss), the most comparable GAAP financial measure: For the Three Months Ended For the Years Ended ($ in thousands) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Underwriting income (loss) $ 36,028 $ 38,605 $ 129,851 $ (31,717 ) Total net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments and net investment income (loss) 120,254 (59,585 ) 239,855 64,870 Net gain on sale of equity method investment 211 6,991 211 6,991 Other income (loss), excluding third party fee income 312 (55 ) 397 (315 ) Net foreign exchange gains (losses) (2,230 ) (9,245 ) (6,185 ) 6,137 Corporate expenses (44,858 ) (4,208 ) (76,691 ) (20,142 ) Impairment of goodwill — (24,082 ) — (24,082 ) Amortization of intangible assets (2,914 ) (2,957 ) (10,783 ) (12,832 ) Interest expense (5,428 ) (4,485 ) (21,434 ) (15,741 ) Income tax (expense) benefit 31,974 (1 ) 25,066 (3,104 ) Net income (loss), prior to non-controlling interest $ 133,349 $ (59,022 ) $ 280,287 $ (29,935 ) Third Party Fee Income Third party fee income includes income that is incremental and/or directly attributable to our underwriting operations. It is primarily comprised of fees earned by the International Segment for management services provided to third party syndicates and consortia and by the Bermuda Segment for performance based management fees generated by our third party capital manager, Ada Capital Management Limited. We believe that this measure is a relevant component of our underwriting income (loss). The following table reconciles third party fee income to other income, the most comparable GAAP financial measure: For the Three Months Ended For the Years Ended ($ in thousands) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Third party fee income $ 10,480 $ 2,254 $ 18,234 $ 11,631 Other income (loss), excluding third party fee income 312 (55 ) 397 (315 ) Other income (loss) $ 10,792 $ 2,199 $ 18,631 $ 11,316 Other Underwriting Expenses Other underwriting expenses include those general and administrative expenses that are incremental and/or directly attributable to our underwriting operations. While this measure is presented in Note 10, Segment Reporting in the consolidated financial statements, it is considered a non-GAAP financial measure when presented elsewhere. Corporate expenses include holding company costs necessary to support our reportable segments. As these costs are not incremental and/or directly attributable to our underwriting operations, these costs are excluded from other underwriting expenses, and therefore, underwriting income (loss). General and administrative expenses, the most comparable GAAP financial measure to other underwriting expenses, also includes corporate expenses. The following table reconciles other underwriting expenses to general and administrative expenses, the most comparable GAAP financial measure: For the Three Months Ended For the Years Ended ($ in thousands) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Other underwriting expenses $ 56,923 $ 38,184 $ 183,165 $ 157,540 Corporate expenses 44,858 4,208 76,691 20,142 General and administrative expenses $ 101,781 $ 42,392 $ 259,856 $ 177,682 Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This information may contain forward-looking statements which reflect the Company's current views with respect to future events and financial performance and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are made based on management's current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects upon Hamilton. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting Hamilton will be those anticipated by management. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, all matters that are not historical facts. These forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of future performance and involve risk and uncertainties, and there are certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ, possibly materially, from expectations or estimates reflected in such forward-looking statements, including the following: our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by unpredictable catastrophic events, global climate change or emerging claim and coverage issues; our business could be materially adversely affected if we do not accurately assess our underwriting risk, our reserves are inadequate to cover our actual losses, our models or assessments and pricing of risks are incorrect or we lose important broker relationships; the insurance and reinsurance business is historically cyclical and the pricing and terms for our products may decline, which would affect our profitability and ability to maintain or grow premiums; we have significant foreign operations that expose us to certain additional risks, including foreign currency risks and political risk; we do not control the allocations to and/or the performance of the Two Sigma Hamilton Fund, LLC (""TS Hamilton Fund"")’s investment portfolio, and its performance depends on the ability of its investment manager, Two Sigma, to select and manage appropriate investments and we have a limited ability to withdraw our capital accounts; Two Sigma Principals, LLC, Two Sigma and their respective affiliates have potential conflicts of interest that could adversely affect us; the historical performance of Two Sigma Investments, LP (""Two Sigma"") is not necessarily indicative of the future results of the TS Hamilton Fund’s investment portfolio or of our future results; our ability to manage risks associated with macroeconomic conditions resulting from geopolitical and global economic events, including public health crises, current or anticipated military conflicts, terrorism, sanctions, rising energy prices, inflation and interest rates and other global events; our ability to compete successfully with more established competitors and risks relating to consolidation in the reinsurance and insurance industries; downgrades, potential downgrades or other negative actions by rating agencies; our dependence on key executives, including the potential loss of Bermudian personnel as a result of Bermuda employment restrictions, and the inability to attract qualified personnel, particularly in very competitive hiring conditions; our dependence on letter of credit facilities that may not be available on commercially acceptable terms; our potential need for additional capital in the future and the potential unavailability of such capital to us on favorable terms or at all; the suspension or revocation of our subsidiaries’ insurance licenses; risks associated with our investment strategy, including such risks being greater than those faced by competitors; changes in the regulatory environment and the potential for greater regulatory scrutiny of the Company going forward; a cyclical downturn of the reinsurance industry; operational failures, failure of information systems or failure to protect the confidentiality of customer information, including by service providers, or losses due to defaults, errors or omissions by third parties or our affiliates; we are a holding company with no direct operations, and our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends and other distributions to us is restricted by law; risks relating to our ability to identify and execute opportunities for growth or our ability to complete transactions as planned or realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or other investments; our potentially becoming subject to U.S. federal income taxation, Bermuda taxation or other taxes as a result of a change of tax laws or otherwise; the potential characterization of us and/or any of our subsidiaries as a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC; our potentially becoming subject to U.S. withholding and information reporting requirements under the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA, provisions; our costs will increase as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to complying with public company regulations; if we were to identify a material weakness and were unable to remediate such material weakness, or fail to achieve and maintain effective internal controls, our operating results and financial condition could be impacted and the market price of our Class B common shares may be negatively affected; the lack of a prior public market for our Class B common shares means our share price may be volatile and anti-takeover provisions contained in our organizational documents could delay management changes; the potential that the market price of our Class B common shares could decline due to future sales of shares by our existing shareholders; applicable insurance laws, which could make it difficult to effect a change of control of our company; investors may have difficulties in serving process or enforcing judgments against us in the United States; and other factors affecting future results disclosed in the Company’s filing with the SEC, including the Form 10-K.

Non-episodic admissions grew 34.2% in the quarter, driving total admission growth of 3.9% year over year. Revenue per episode decreased year over year primarily due to patient mix. Cost per visit remained flat year over year as the reduction in nursing contract labor offset the impact of merit and market increases.

Revenue per day increased primarily due to changes in our estimated recoverability of net service revenue and increased Medicare reimbursement rates. Adjusted EBITDA increased year over year primarily due to increased revenue per day and a reduction in general and administrative expenses. Cost per day increased year over year primarily due to increased labor costs resulting from the implementation of the new case management staffing model, including costs associated with dedicated on-call and triage nurses. General and administrative expenses decreased year over year primarily due to reduced headcount at hospice branch locations resulting from implementation of the case management staffing model.

OTHER INFORMATION Note regarding presentation and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures The financial data contained in this press release and supplemental information includes non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)) financial measures as defined in Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted EPS, and Adjusted free cash flow. See “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures exclude significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance and should therefore not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or alternative to the GAAP financial measures presented in this press release. The non-GAAP financial measures in the press release may differ from similar measures used by other companies. The Company is unable to reconcile the guidance for Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS to their corresponding GAAP measures without unreasonable effort due to the inherent difficulty in predicting, with reasonable certainty, the future impact of items that are outside the control of the Company or otherwise non-indicative of its ongoing operating performance. Accordingly, the Company relies on the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K. Such items include, but are not limited to, gains or losses related to hedging instruments; loss on early extinguishment of debt; adjustments to its income tax provision (such as valuation allowance adjustments and settlements of income tax claims); and items related to corporate and facility restructurings. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Note regarding presentation of same-store comparisons The Company uses “same-store” comparisons to explain the changes in certain performance metrics and line items within its financial statements. Same-store comparisons are calculated based on home health and hospice locations open throughout both the full current period and the immediately prior period presented. These comparisons include the financial results of market consolidation transactions in existing markets, as it is difficult to determine, with precision, the incremental impact of these transactions on the Company’s results of operations.

Initiated a cash dividend of $0.38 per share and announced an agreement to acquire CSI Compressco. 2024 Adjusted EBITDA guidance of $460 million to $490 million. Negative None. Financial Analyst Kodiak Gas Services' financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 demonstrates a significant revenue increase compared to the previous year, signaling a positive trajectory for the company's growth. The reported increase in total revenues from $707.9 million in 2022 to $850.4 million in 2023, coupled with a growth of 12.3% in Compression Operations segment revenues, reflects robust demand for their services. The announcement of a dividend suggests a confidence in cash flow sustainability and a commitment to returning value to shareholders. However, the net loss in Q4, primarily due to a loss on derivatives, warrants attention as it underscores the risks associated with hedging strategies in volatile energy markets. The leverage ratio of 3.96x and the issuance of senior unsecured notes could raise concerns about the company's debt profile, although the ratings by major credit agencies indicate a moderate risk level.Investors should closely monitor the acquisition of CSI Compressco, as it is expected to be accretive to Discretionary Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow per share. The transaction could enhance Kodiak's market position, but integration risks and the impact on the company's financial leverage post-acquisition are factors to consider. The guidance for 2024 Adjusted EBITDA and Discretionary Cash Flow suggests management's confidence in continued operational efficiency and financial performance. However, the reliance on the Permian Basin and the natural gas sector ties the company's fortunes to the cyclical nature of the energy market and regulatory changes. Market Research Analyst The energy infrastructure sector, particularly in the Permian Basin, is experiencing strong demand, which is reflected in Kodiak's near-total horsepower utilization rate of 99.9%. This indicates a tight supply-demand balance and the potential for pricing power, which could bode well for future revenue growth. The acquisition of CSI Compressco positions Kodiak to capitalize on this demand by creating the industry's largest contract compression fleet, potentially offering economies of scale and improved bargaining power with suppliers and customers. However, market dynamics, including fluctuations in natural gas prices and the pace of LNG export project approvals, could impact the long-term demand for Kodiak's services. The company's focus on safety and sustainability, as highlighted by the CEO, aligns with increasing investor scrutiny on environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors, which could enhance its appeal to a broader investor base. Energy Sector Analyst Kodiak's operational highlights, such as the high Adjusted Gross Margin Percentage in the Compression Operations segment, indicate operational efficiency and cost management effectiveness. The energy sector, particularly natural gas compression services, is capital-intensive with high barriers to entry. Kodiak's investment in fleet growth and maintenance, as evidenced by their capital expenditures, is critical for maintaining service quality and mechanical availability. The pending acquisition of CSI Compressco could further strengthen Kodiak's competitive position in the contract compression market. However, investors should be aware of the inherent risks in the energy sector, such as commodity price volatility, regulatory changes and technological advancements that could disrupt traditional compression services. The company's strategic focus on large horsepower compression infrastructure is a bet on continued natural gas demand, particularly for LNG exports, which is linked to global energy trends and geopolitical factors. 03/06/2024 - 04:15 PM THE WOODLANDS, Texas, March 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Kodiak Gas Services, Inc.

""Financially, we set new annual revenue and Adjusted EBITDA records while at the same time maintaining capital discipline and generating a new Kodiak record level of Free Cash Flow. Our fourth quarter results continued to reflect the strength of our customer-focused strategy with record Adjusted EBITDA and margin improvement in both our Compression Operations and Other Services segments. Kodiak's record-setting year would not have been possible without the tireless efforts of our approximately 800 highly-capable employees to provide our customers with unequaled service quality. ""As we look forward, customer demand for large horsepower compression infrastructure continues to be strong, particularly in the Permian Basin, where over 70% of our horsepower is deployed. Our fleet is effectively fully utilized, and we expect this trend to last given the robust multi-year outlook for natural gas to supply the coming wave of LNG export projects. Our pending acquisition of CSI Compressco will give us the largest contract compression fleet in the industry and enhance both our service offerings and the scale of those offerings. Kodiak is fully contracted on our 2024 new unit deliveries, and deep in discussions with our customers on their 2025 needs. In closing, we remain committed to having the safest and most sustainable contract compression fleet in the industry and delivering the high quality of service and industry-leading mechanical availability that our customers have come to expect.""

U-Haul Holding Company Announces Quarterly Cash Dividend,2024-03-06T21:15:00.000Z,Low,Very Positive,"U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE: UHAL) declares a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share on its Series N Non-Voting Common Stock, marking the sixth dividend under the Company's policy announced in October 2022.","U-Haul Holding Company Announces Quarterly Cash Dividend Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE: UHAL) declares a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share on its Series N Non-Voting Common Stock, marking the sixth dividend under the Company's policy announced in October 2022. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a quarterly cash dividend by U-Haul Holding Company signifies a distribution of earnings to shareholders and is often seen as a sign of financial health and confidence in future earnings. The modest amount of $0.05 per share indicates a conservative approach, possibly aiming to maintain a stable cash reserve while still rewarding investors. It is essential to consider the dividend yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the share price. Compared to industry standards, this figure can help investors understand the attractiveness of U-Haul's dividend in relation to its stock price.Furthermore, the consistency of dividend payments since the policy's inception in October 2022 can be interpreted as a commitment to shareholders and could enhance investor sentiment. However, it's important to assess the payout ratio, which is the portion of earnings paid out as dividends. A sustainable payout ratio ensures that the company can continue to invest in growth while providing returns to shareholders. Market Research Analyst The impact of dividend announcements can extend beyond immediate financial implications to affect stock market performance. Dividends are often factored into the valuation models used by investors, such as the Dividend Discount Model (DDM), which values a stock based on the present value of future dividends. Therefore, a consistent dividend policy could lead to a more stable stock price for U-Haul Holding Company.Additionally, market perception of the company's growth prospects could be inferred from the dividend amount. A lower dividend might suggest that the company is retaining more earnings for reinvestment into its diverse business operations, including real estate and insurance, which could indicate a strategy focused on long-term growth over short-term cash returns to shareholders. 03/06/2024 - 04:15 PM RENO, Nev.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE: UHAL, UHAL.B), parent of U-Haul International, Inc., Oxford Life Insurance Company, Repwest Insurance Company and Amerco Real Estate Company, on March 6, 2024 declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share on its Series N Non-Voting Common Stock (NYSE: UHAL.B).

The dividend will be paid on March 28, 2024, to holders of record on March 18, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Hess Corporation's regular quarterly dividend is a key indicator of the company's financial health and its commitment to returning value to shareholders. A dividend is a portion of earnings distributed to shareholders and can signal confidence in the company's profitability and stability. The current dividend rate of 43.75 cents per share reflects the company's earnings and cash flow position, which are crucial for investors assessing the sustainability of these payouts. Investors often view regular and consistent dividends as a sign of a company's mature and stable financial position, which can be attractive to income-focused investors.Furthermore, the dividend yield, calculated by annualizing the quarterly dividend and dividing it by the stock price, is a critical metric for comparing the income provided by Hess Corporation to that of other companies in the energy sector. It's important to consider how this yield stacks up against industry averages and fixed income alternatives, especially in varying interest rate environments. The timing of the dividend also suggests the company's adherence to a disciplined capital allocation strategy, balancing reinvestment in operations with shareholder returns. Market Research Analyst The energy sector is highly cyclical and influenced by global supply-demand dynamics, geopolitical events and regulatory changes. Hess Corporation operates within this volatile environment and its ability to maintain a regular dividend can be seen as a positive signal to the market. The declaration of the dividend may also reflect the company's operational efficiency and its ability to manage costs and capital expenditures effectively, especially in light of fluctuating oil and gas prices.Investors and analysts closely monitor dividend announcements as they can impact stock market performance. A stable or increasing dividend can lead to positive investor sentiment, potentially boosting the stock price. Conversely, a cut or omission of a dividend can signal financial distress, leading to negative market reactions. The impact on Hess Corporation's stock will depend on how this dividend aligns with market expectations and the company's historical payout patterns. Energy Sector Analyst Dividend announcements in the energy sector, particularly from independent exploration and production companies like Hess Corporation, can be influenced by the volatility in commodity prices. The ability to maintain or increase dividends during periods of price instability can indicate a robust hedging strategy and a diversified asset portfolio. It's essential to analyze Hess Corporation's production mix, reserve replacement ratio and cost structure to gauge the long-term sustainability of its dividend policy.Additionally, given the increasing focus on sustainability and the energy transition, it's relevant to consider how Hess Corporation's investment in renewable energy sources and carbon reduction initiatives may affect its financials and, consequently, its ability to sustain dividends. The company's approach to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors can also influence investor perception and appeal to a broader base of ESG-conscious investors. 03/06/2024 - 04:15 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Board of Directors of Hess Corporation (NYSE: HES) today declared a regular quarterly dividend of 43.75 cents per share payable on the Common Stock of the Corporation on March 28, 2024 to holders of record at the close of business on March 18, 2024.

Net loss decreased to $(3.2) million, or $(0.26) per diluted share, from $(9.0) million, or $(0.73) per diluted share, in the prior-year period. The effective tax rate for the quarter was negative (47.5%) due to the company's income mix between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. The company ended the quarter with $12.6 million in cash and total liquidity of $38.8 million. CEO Iv Culp highlighted revenue growth in both mattress fabrics and upholstery fabrics segments despite industry challenges. Focus on new fabric placements and cost efficiencies drove performance improvements in both business segments. Strategic financial management and working capital support continued business needs and investments for future growth. Negative None. Financial Analyst An increase in net sales by 15.0 percent for Culp, Inc. is a notable positive development, particularly with the mattress fabrics sales surging by 21.6 percent. This suggests that the company is gaining market share or benefiting from an uptick in industry demand. The improvement in gross margin to 12.7% from a mere 4.0% in the previous year indicates significant progress in cost management or a shift towards higher-margin products. However, the persistence of a net loss, albeit reduced from the prior year, raises concerns about the company's ability to translate top-line growth into bottom-line profitability.The lack of outstanding borrowings and a solid cash position provide financial flexibility, which can be advantageous for future investments or to weather potential market downturns. The reported total liquidity of $38.8 million also affords the company a cushion to manage operational needs or strategic initiatives.Investors would be keen on the company's future outlook, especially considering the CEO's optimism and focus on improvement initiatives. The ability to maintain a strong balance sheet while investing in capital expenditures and working capital is a delicate balance that requires careful financial planning and execution. Market Research Analyst The reported year-over-year revenue growth in both core business segments of Culp, Inc. indicates resilience in the face of a challenging demand environment in the bedding and furniture industries. This implies that the company's product offerings are well-aligned with market needs or that it has successfully adapted to changing consumer preferences.However, the mention of market weakness in the bedding industry and internal efficiency issues suggests that there are broader sectoral headwinds and operational challenges that need to be addressed. The company's ability to navigate these, while also capitalizing on opportunities such as the timing of the Chinese New Year holiday and customer demand shifts, will be critical for sustained growth.It is also important to consider the impact of external factors such as weather-related events and supply chain issues on the hospitality/contract business. These can have a material effect on sales and operations and require strategic management to mitigate risks. Economist The negative effective tax rate of (47.5) percent reported by Culp, Inc. reflects the interplay of taxable income across different jurisdictions and may indicate the utilization of tax credits or losses carried forward from previous periods. This tax position could represent a temporary financial benefit to the company, but it also points to underlying profitability issues that must be addressed for sustainable fiscal health.The company's performance must be contextualized within the broader economic environment, including consumer spending patterns, raw material costs and supply chain dynamics. The CEO's reference to a focus on new fabric and cover placements that are priced with proper margins suggests a strategic response to inflationary pressures and cost volatility, which are critical factors impacting the industry at large.Long-term stakeholder value will depend on the company's ability to adapt to economic cycles, manage operational efficiency and maintain a competitive edge through innovation and market responsiveness. 03/06/2024 - 04:15 PM HIGH POINT, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Culp, Inc. (NYSE: CULP) (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “CULP”) today reported financial and operating results for the third quarter ended January 28, 2024. Fiscal 2024 Third Quarter Financial Summary Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 were $60.4 million, up 15.0 percent compared with the prior-year period, with mattress fabrics sales up 21.6 percent, and upholstery fabrics sales up 9.2 percent. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was 12.7%, compared with 4.0% for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Loss from operations was $(1.7) million (which included $111,000 in restructuring and related credits during the period), compared with a loss from operations of $(7.8) million for the prior-year period (which included $711,000 relating to certain restructuring expenses during the period). Net loss was $(3.2) million, or $(0.26) per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $(9.0) million, or $(0.73) per diluted share, for the prior-year period. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was negative (47.5) percent, reflecting the company’s mix of taxable income between its U.S. and foreign jurisdictions during the period. The company maintained a solid financial position, with its balance sheet reflecting $12.6 million of total cash and no outstanding borrowings as of January 28, 2024. Total liquidity as of January 28, 2024, was $38.8 million (consisting of $12.6 million in cash and $26.2 million in borrowing availability under the company's domestic credit facility). CEO Commentary Commenting on the results, Iv Culp, president and chief executive officer of Culp, Inc., said, “We are pleased to report continued year-over-year and sequential improvement in our consolidated sales and operating performance for the third quarter. Both of our core business segments reported increased revenue year-over-year, which is impressive considering the challenging demand environment in the bedding and furniture industries. Additionally, our consolidated operating performance for the quarter was better than our revised outlook announced on January 17, 2024, due to stronger improvement in our upholstery fabrics segment. ""Culp upholstery fabrics achieved a year-over-year increase in residential sales for the first quarterly period since the end of last fiscal year, driven by both the timing of the Chinese New Year holiday and some improvement during the quarter in customer demand for residential fabric products. While this increase in residential sales was offset somewhat by lower sales in our hospitality/contract business due partly to weather-related events in January and shortterm supply chain issues that affected Read Window, overall demand remains solid for our hospitality/contract business. Also, our upholstery fabrics segment once again saw a significant improvement in operating performance, driven primarily by higher sales, a more profitable mix of sales, and fixed cost savings. ""In our mattress fabrics segment, we continued our significant year-over-year improvement in sales and operating performance, driven largely by a focus on new fabric and cover placements that are priced with proper margins and in line with current raw material costs. However, the sequential results for this segment, as compared to the second quarter, reflect ongoing market weakness in the bedding industry, as well as internal efficiency issues primarily related to the start-up and production of certain new products and costs for these program launches that occurred during the quarter. “We maintained our solid balance sheet during the quarter, with a continued focus on prudent financial management, while allowing for critical capital expenditures and ensuring a strategic level of working capital to support the needs of our businesses. We ended the quarter with $12.6 million in cash, no outstanding borrowings, and $26.2 million in borrowing availability under our domestic credit facility. “As we enter the fourth quarter, we continue to implement improvement initiatives within our mattress fabrics segment to support future profitable sales growth and enhance operating efficiencies. We are diligently focused on winning new placements to drive revenue and increase margins, and we are optimistic about mid-to-long term growth potential for this business. However, while we knew the timing of Chinese New Year would be an impact on quarterly revenue, the industry demand backdrop in both of our businesses has deteriorated further than expected during the first few weeks of the fourth quarter, especially in our upholstery fabrics segment. ""We remain confident in our market position in both of our businesses, but to maintain our sequential progress, we need some macro-industry and end-consumer support. Also, the internal inefficiencies relating to the start up and production of certain new products in mattress fabrics during the third quarter will also affect operating performance during the fourth quarter. As a result of these challenges, we now expect that our return to consolidated operating profitability will be delayed into fiscal 2025. ""In the face of various ongoing macro-economic headwinds, our attention is on managing the aspects of our business we can control. With the uncertainty of consumer demand in the near term, we are also evaluating strategic actions to adjust and right-size our global platform to align with current demand levels, while still supporting our valued customers. Importantly, we remain well positioned for the long term with our solidly performing upholstery fabrics business and a recovering mattress fabrics business. We are committed to taking steps to position our business for renewed profitability in fiscal 2025, and we are confident in our ability to leverage our competitive advantages, including our innovative product offerings, creative designs, global manufacturing and sourcing platform, and solid financial management, to support our future growth, especially when market conditions improve,"" added Culp. Business Segment Highlights Mattress Fabrics Segment (“CHF”) Summary Sales for this segment were $30.0 million for the third quarter, up 21.6 percent compared with sales of $24.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The higher sales, as compared to the prior-year period, were primarily driven by new fabric and sewn cover placements that are priced in line with current costs. Operating loss was $(1.6) million for the third quarter, a significant improvement compared to the $(4.2) million operating loss in the prior-year period. This reduction in losses was driven by higher sales, coming mostly from better pricing and a more favorable product mix. These factors were partially offset by production inefficiencies relating to the start up of certain new product launches, as well as higher SG&A business investments during the period. Upholstery Fabrics Segment (“CUF”) Summary Sales for this segment were $30.4 million for the third quarter, up 9.2 percent compared with sales of $27.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Sales for CUF's residential fabric business were higher than the prior-year period, driven by improved residential home furnishing sales, as well as the timing of the Chinese New Year holiday (which this year fell primarily in the fourth quarter, rather than the third quarter). Sales for CUF's hospitality/contract business were moderately lower than the prior-year period due primarily to the impact of winter weather events and short-term supply chain issues that affected production in our Read Window business, as well as some impact from increased construction costs affecting demand for new and ongoing hospitality/contract projects. Sales for the hospitality/contract business accounted for approximately 26 percent of CUF's total sales during the quarter. Operating income was $2.1 million for the third quarter, up significantly compared with an operating loss of $(420,000) in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Operating margin for the third quarter was 6.9 percent, again a significant improvement compared to the prior-year period. Operating performance for the third quarter was positively affected by higher sales volume; a more profitable mix of sales; a more favorable foreign exchange rate associated with CUF's operations in China; and lower fixed costs resulting from the previous restructuring of CUF's cut and sew platforms. These factors were partially offset by higher SG&A business investments during the period. Balance Sheet, Cash Flow, and Liquidity As of January 28, 2024, the company reported $12.6 million in total cash and no outstanding debt. Cash flow from operations and free cash flow were negative $(6.0) million and negative $(8.2) million, respectively, for the first nine months of fiscal 2024. (See reconciliation table at the back of this press release.) As expected, the company’s cash flow from operations and free cash flow during the period were affected by operating losses and planned strategic investments in capital expenditures mostly related to the CHF transformation plan. Capital expenditures for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 were $3.2 million. The company continues to manage capital investments, focusing on projects that will increase efficiencies and improve quality, especially for the CHF segment. As of January 28, 2024, the company had approximately $38.8 million in liquidity, consisting of $12.6 million in total cash and $26.2 million in borrowing availability under the company's domestic credit facility. Share Repurchases The company did not repurchase any shares during the third quarter of fiscal 2024, leaving approximately $3.2 million available under the current share repurchase program as of January 28, 2024. Despite the current share repurchase authorization, the company does not expect to repurchase any shares during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Financial Outlook Due to the uncertainty in the macro-environment, the company is only providing financial guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. The company’s consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter are expected to be lower as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. This is due partly to the timing of the Chinese New Year holiday (which this year falls primarily in the fourth quarter, as compared to the third quarter last year), as well as weakness in the industry demand environment that is expected to pressure sales in both of the company's business segments, especially in the residential upholstery fabrics business. The company also expects a consolidated operating loss (loss from operations) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 that is comparable to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The company’s expectations are based on information available at the time of this press release and reflect certain assumptions by management regarding the company’s business and trends and the projected impact of the ongoing headwinds. Conference Call Culp, Inc. will hold a conference call to discuss financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 on March 7, 2024, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

Forward Looking Statements This release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934). Such statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events and results to differ materially from such statements. Further, forward looking statements are intended to speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we disclaim any duty to update such statements to reflect any changes in management’s expectations or any change in the assumptions or circumstances on which such statements are based, whether due to new information, future events, or otherwise. Forward-looking statements are statements that include projections, expectations, or beliefs about future events or results or otherwise are not statements of historical fact. Such statements are often but not always characterized by qualifying words such as “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “project,” and their derivatives, and include but are not limited to statements about expectations, projections, or trends for our future operations, strategic initiatives and plans, production levels, new product launches, sales, profit margins, profitability, operating income, capital expenditures, working capital levels, cost savings, income taxes, SG&A or other expenses, pre-tax income, earnings, cash flow, and other performance or liquidity measures, as well as any statements regarding dividends, share repurchases, liquidity, use of cash and cash requirements, borrowing capacity, investments, potential acquisitions, future economic or industry trends, public health epidemics, or future developments. There can be no assurance that we will realize these expectations or meet our guidance, or that these beliefs will prove correct. Factors that could influence the matters discussed in such statements include the level of housing starts and sales of existing homes, consumer confidence, trends in disposable income, and general economic conditions. Decreases in these economic indicators could have a negative effect on our business and prospects. Likewise, increases in interest rates, particularly home mortgage rates, and increases in consumer debt or the general rate of inflation, could affect us adversely. The future performance of our business depends in part on our success in conducting and finalizing acquisition negotiations and integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations. Changes in consumer tastes or preferences toward products not produced by us could erode demand for our products. Changes in tariffs or trade policy, including changes in U.S. trade enforcement priorities, or changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies, could affect our financial results because a significant portion of our operations are located outside the United States. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies could make our products less competitive on the basis of price in markets outside the United States, and strengthening of currencies in Canada and China can have a negative impact on our sales of products produced in those places. In addition, because our foreign operations use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, changes in the exchange rate between the local currency of those operations and the U.S dollar can affect our reported profits from those foreign operations. Also, economic or political instability in international areas could affect our operations or sources of goods in those areas, as well as demand for our products in international markets. The impact of public health epidemics on employees, customers, suppliers, and the global economy, such as the global coronavirus pandemic currently affecting countries around the world, could also adversely affect our operations and financial performance. In addition, the impact of potential asset impairments, including impairments of property, plant, and equipment, inventory, or intangible assets, as well as the impact of valuation allowances applied against our net deferred income tax assets, could affect our financial results. Increases in freight costs, labor costs, and raw material prices, including increases in market prices for petrochemical products, can also significantly affect the prices we pay for shipping, labor, and raw materials, respectively, and in turn, increase our operating costs and decrease our profitability. Finally, our success in diversifying our supply chain with reliable partners to effectively service our global platform could affect our operations and adversely affect our financial results. Further information about these factors, as well as other factors that could affect our future operations or financial results and the matters discussed in forward-looking statements, is included in Item 1A “Risk Factors” in our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A forward-looking statement is neither a prediction nor a guarantee of future events or circumstances, and those future events or circumstances may not occur. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know about or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also affect our business operations and financial results. CULP, INC.

(KRO) reported a net loss of $5.3 million in Q4 2023, an improvement from Q4 2022, but a full-year net loss of $49.1 million compared to net income in 2022. The company faced challenges due to lower sales volumes, TiO2 selling prices, and production volumes. Positive None. Negative Kronos Worldwide, Inc. reported a significant net loss for the full year of 2023 compared to the previous year. The company's TiO2 segment experienced losses in both Q4 2023 and full-year 2023, indicating operational challenges. Production curtailments and cost reduction initiatives negatively impacted the company's results of operations in 2023. Lower sales volumes and average TiO2 selling prices contributed to the decline in net income for the full year of 2023. The company operated its production facilities at reduced capacity in 2023 due to lower demand and maintenance activities. Financial Analyst The reported financials of Kronos Worldwide, Inc. indicate a significant swing from net income in the previous year to a net loss in the current year. This reversal from a profit of $104.5 million to a loss of $49.1 million warrants an examination of the underlying factors contributing to the volatility in earnings. The decline in net income for the full year is primarily attributed to reduced sales volumes and lower average selling prices for Titanium Dioxide (TiO2), alongside higher production costs. Such a trend could signal a challenging market environment for TiO2 products, potentially impacting the broader chemical sector, which relies on this compound for various applications including paint and coatings.Furthermore, the strategic response by Kronos Worldwide to curtail production in light of decreased demand is a critical move that investors should assess for its long-term implications. While it has helped manage inventory levels and preserve liquidity, the unabsorbed fixed production costs present a concern. These costs could indicate inefficiencies that may need to be addressed to improve profitability. Additionally, the fluctuation in currency exchange rates, particularly the euro, has had a mixed impact on the company's financials, which is a factor that international investors should closely monitor.From a financial perspective, the shift in EBITDA from a positive $202.5 million to a negative $7.2 million suggests that the company's operational performance has deteriorated significantly. This could potentially affect the company's stock price and investor sentiment. The detailed breakdown of operational challenges and cost management strategies provides insights into the company's adaptability in a fluctuating market, which is essential for stakeholders making informed decisions. Market Research Analyst The reported increase in TiO2 sales volumes in the fourth quarter, despite a year-long decline, indicates a potential recovery in market demand, particularly in Europe and North America. This uptick could be a sign of a rebound in industries that are major consumers of TiO2, such as the automotive and construction sectors. However, the continued lower average TiO2 selling prices suggest that the market may still be experiencing pricing pressures, possibly due to oversupply or intensified competition. This could impact the profitability of companies within the TiO2 market and may lead to further strategic consolidations or shifts in the industry.Additionally, the positive contribution of complementary business segments to net sales highlights the importance of diversification within the company's portfolio. This diversification can act as a buffer against volatility in the core TiO2 segment and is a strategic aspect that stakeholders should consider when evaluating the company's resilience in the face of sector-specific challenges.The market dynamics of TiO2 and its derivatives are complex and influenced by global economic factors, environmental regulations and technological advancements. Understanding these intricacies is crucial for stakeholders to anticipate future trends and the potential for market recovery or further disruption. Economist The reported financials reflect broader economic trends, such as the impact of global demand fluctuations and currency exchange rate volatility on multinational corporations. The production curtailments in response to decreased demand for TiO2 products may be indicative of a cyclical downturn or structural changes within the industry. Economically, such adjustments in production capacity are vital for aligning supply with demand, yet they often come with short-term financial repercussions as seen in the unabsorbed fixed production costs.The role of currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the euro, has had a nuanced effect on the company's financials. While it has increased net sales, it has also decreased the loss from operations, which underscores the importance of currency risk management for companies operating in the international arena. The interplay between these rates and the company's financial performance offers a lesson in the complexities of international business and its susceptibility to currency market movements.Long-term economic implications of the company's cost reduction initiatives and restructuring, including workforce reductions, could result in improved operational efficiency. However, these measures may also have adverse effects on the company's innovation capacity and employee morale. The balance between cost management and investment in growth is a delicate one that can significantly influence the company's future trajectory in the context of global economic conditions. 03/06/2024 - 04:15 PM Dallas, Texas, March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kronos Worldwide, Inc. (NYSE:KRO) today reported a net loss of $5.3 million, or $.05 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to a net loss of $19.9 million, or $.18 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year of 2023, Kronos Worldwide reported a net loss of $49.1 million, or $.43 per share, compared to net income of $104.5 million, or $.90 per share for the full year of 2022. Net income increased in the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 primarily due to higher income from operations as a result of the net effect of higher sales volumes, lower average TiO2 selling prices and lower production costs (primarily raw material costs). Net income decreased in the full year of 2023 as compared to the full year 2022 primarily due to lower income from operations as a result of lower sales volumes, lower average TiO2 selling prices and reduced production volumes. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022 and continuing through 2023, we implemented production curtailments in response to a sharp decline in demand for TiO2 products occurring in all major markets. In addition, throughout 2023 we implemented cost reduction initiatives and other strategies designed to improve our long-term cost structure and preserve liquidity. Through these actions we successfully reduced our finished goods inventory levels and maintained significant liquidity, although our results of operations were negatively impacted by certain cost reduction initiatives and the significant unabsorbed fixed production costs incurred due to the curtailments, as discussed further below. Comparability of our results was also impacted by the effects of changes in currency exchange rates. Net sales of $400.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $57.7 million, or 17%, higher than in the fourth quarter of 2022. Net sales of $1.7 billion in the full year of 2023 were $263.7 million, or 14%, lower than in the full year of 2022. Net sales increased in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 due to the net effects of higher sales volumes due to strengthening demand for TiO2 in our primary markets of Europe and North America and lower average TiO2 selling prices. Net sales decreased in the full year of 2023 compared to the full year of 2022 due to the effects of lower sales volumes in all our major markets and lower average TiO2 selling prices. TiO2 sales volumes were 29% higher in the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 and 13% lower in the full year of 2023 as compared to the full year of 2022. Average TiO2 selling prices were 11% lower in the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 and 4% lower in the full year of 2023 as compared to the full year of 2022. Average TiO2 selling prices at the end of 2023 were 13% lower than at the end of 2022. Changes in product mix positively contributed to net sales, primarily due to higher average selling prices and sales volumes in our complementary businesses which somewhat offset declines in TiO2 sales volumes in the full year of 2023. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates (primarily the euro) also affected net sales comparisons, increasing net sales by approximately $10 million in both the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 as compared to the same periods in 2022. The table at the end of this press release shows how each of these items impacted net sales. Our TiO2 segment loss (see description of non-GAAP information below) in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1.3 million as compared to our TiO2 segment loss of $15.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year of 2023, the Company’s segment loss was $39.8 million as compared to segment profit of $175.9 million in the full year of 2022. Segment loss decreased in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to a lower loss from operations due to the net effects of higher sales volumes and lower average TiO2 selling prices. Segment profit decreased in the full year of 2023 as compared to the full year of 2022 primarily due to lower income from operations as a result of the combination of lower sales volumes, higher production costs and lower average TiO2 selling prices. In addition, cost of sales in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 includes $22 million and $96 million, respectively, of unabsorbed fixed production and other manufacturing costs associated with production curtailments at our facilities during the full year of 2023 as we adjusted our TiO2 production volumes to align inventory levels with lower demand. TiO2 production volumes were 15% higher in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 but 19% lower in the full year of 2023 compared to the full year of 2022. As a result of reduced demand and scheduled maintenance activities, we operated our production facilities at 72% of practical capacity utilization in the full year of 2023 (76%, 64%, 73% and 75% in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2023, respectively) compared to 89% in the full year of 2022 (100%, 95%, 93% and 65% in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2022, respectively). Fluctuations in currency exchange rates (primarily the euro) decreased our loss from operations by approximately $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and by approximately $16 million in the full year of 2023 as compared to the same prior year periods. Our net income (loss) before interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization expense (EBITDA) (see description of non-GAAP information below) in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $6.9 million compared to EBITDA of $(8.2) million in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year of 2023, the Company’s EBITDA was $(7.2) million compared to EBITDA of $202.5 million in the full year of 2022. Our loss from operations in the full year of 2023 includes an insurance settlement gain related to a 2020 business interruption insurance claim of $2.5 million ($2.0 million, or $.02 per share, net of income tax expense), a fixed asset impairment related to the write-off of certain costs resulting from a capital project termination of $3.8 million ($2.8 million, or $.02 per share, net of income tax expense) and restructuring costs related to workforce reductions of $5.8 million ($4.3 million, or $.04 per share, net of income tax expense). Income from operations in the full year of 2022 includes a gain related to the 2020 business interruption insurance claim noted above of $2.7 million ($2.2 million, or $.02 per share, net of income tax expense). Other components of net periodic pension and OPEB cost in the full year of 2023 includes a $1.3 million settlement loss incurred in the second quarter of 2023 related to the termination and buy-out of our UK pension plan ($.9 million, or $.01 per share, net of income tax expense). The statements in this release relating to matters that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements that represent management's beliefs and assumptions based on currently available information. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot give any assurances that these expectations will prove to be correct. Such statements by their nature involve substantial risks and uncertainties that could significantly impact expected results, and actual future results could differ materially from those described in such forward-looking statements. While it is not possible to identify all factors, we continue to face many risks and uncertainties. The factors that could cause actual future results to differ materially include, but are not limited to, the following: Future supply and demand for our productsOur ability to realize expected cost savings from strategic and operational initiativesThe extent of the dependence of certain of our businesses on certain market sectorsThe cyclicality of our businessCustomer and producer inventory levelsUnexpected or earlier-than-expected industry capacity expansionChanges in raw material and other operating costs (such as energy and ore costs)Changes in the availability of raw materials (such as ore)General global economic and political conditions that harm the worldwide economy, disrupt our supply chain, increase material and energy costs or reduce demand or perceived demand for our TiO2 products or impair our ability to operate our facilities (including changes in the level of gross domestic product in various regions of the world, natural disasters, terrorist acts, global conflicts and public health crises)Operating interruptions (including, but not limited to, labor disputes, leaks, natural disasters, fires, explosions, unscheduled or unplanned downtime, transportation interruptions, certain regional and world events or economic conditions and public health crises)Technology related disruptions (including, but not limited to, cyber attacks; software implementation, upgrades or improvements; technology processing failures; or other events) related to our technology infrastructure that could impact our ability to continue operations, or at key vendors which could impact our supply chain, or at key customers which could impact their operations and cause them to curtail or pause ordersCompetitive products and substitute productsCustomer and competitor strategiesPotential consolidation of our competitorsPotential consolidation of our customersThe impact of pricing and production decisionsCompetitive technology positionsPotential difficulties in upgrading or implementing accounting and manufacturing software systemsThe introduction of trade barriers or trade disputesFluctuations in currency exchange rates (such as changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and each of the euro, the Norwegian krone and the Canadian dollar and between the euro and the Norwegian krone), or possible disruptions to our business resulting from uncertainties associated with the euro or other currenciesOur ability to renew or refinance credit facilitiesChanges in interest ratesOur ability to maintain sufficient liquidityThe ultimate outcome of income tax audits, tax settlement initiatives or other tax matters, including future tax reformOur ability to utilize income tax attributes, the benefits of which may or may not have been recognized under the more-likely-than-not recognition criteriaEnvironmental matters (such as those requiring compliance with emission and discharge standards for existing and new facilities)Government laws and regulations and possible changes therein including new environmental health and safety, sustainability or other regulations (such as those seeking to limit or classify TiO2 or its use)Pending or possible future litigation or other actions. Should one or more of these risks materialize (or the consequences of such a development worsen), or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from those forecasted or expected. The Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of changes in information, future events or otherwise. In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the Company's results of operations as determined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), the Company has disclosed certain non-GAAP information which the Company believes provides useful information to investors: The Company discloses segment profit, which is used by the Company’s management to assess the performance of the Company’s TiO2 operations. The Company believes disclosure of segment profit provides useful information to investors because it allows investors to analyze the performance of the Company’s TiO2 operations in the same way that the Company’s management assesses performance. The Company defines segment profit as net income before income tax expense and certain general corporate items. These general corporate items include corporate expense and the components of other income (expense) except for trade interest income; andThe Company discloses EBITDA, which is also used by the Company’s management to assess the performance of the Company’s TiO2 operations. The Company believes disclosure of EBITDA provides useful information to investors because it allows investors to analyze the performance of the Company’s TiO2 operations in the same way that the Company’s management assesses performance. The Company defines EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization expense.

(KAI) raises its quarterly dividend to $0.32 per share, reflecting a positive outlook on the company's financial health. The dividend will be paid on May 8, 2024, to stockholders of record as of April 10, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Kadant Inc. of an increased quarterly cash dividend to $0.32 per share represents a positive signal to the market regarding the company's financial health and confidence in its future earnings potential. Dividends are typically sourced from profits and a company raising its dividend payout can often be interpreted as having a stable or growing profit stream. This action could attract income-focused investors and potentially support the stock price.However, it is also crucial to consider the payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends to shareholders. An excessively high payout ratio can be unsustainable in the long run, as it may limit the funds available for reinvestment into the company's growth. Investors should assess this ratio in the context of Kadant's earnings to determine the sustainability of the new dividend rate. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Kadant's decision to raise its dividend could be reflective of its sector's performance and the broader economic environment. Companies within stable industries may raise dividends when they experience consistent cash flows and have a positive outlook. This move by Kadant might suggest a robust position within its industry, which could be indicative of how it is managing operational costs, competition and market demand.It is also worth analyzing the market's reaction to the dividend increase. If the stock market views the dividend raise as a sign of strength, it could lead to a favorable response in Kadant's stock price. Conversely, if the market perceives this as a move to compensate for lackluster growth prospects, the reaction could be muted or even negative. Economist Examining the broader economic context is essential when a company like Kadant raises its dividend. The decision to increase dividends might be occurring in an economic climate characterized by interest rate changes, inflationary pressures, or shifting investor preferences towards defensive stocks that provide steady income. In a low-interest-rate environment, for example, higher dividends can make equities more attractive relative to bonds.Furthermore, the company's statement that future dividends are subject to Board approval and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change introduces an element of uncertainty. This caveat highlights the importance of monitoring economic indicators and sector trends that could impact Kadant's financial performance and, consequently, its ability to maintain or increase dividends in the future. 03/06/2024 - 04:24 PM Raises Quarterly Dividend to $0.32 per ShareWESTFORD, Mass., March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kadant Inc.

Despite lower sales, the company saw favorable impacts from reduced expenses and higher interest income. Positive None. Negative Decrease in net sales by 11.2% for 2023 compared to 2022 Net income decreased by 12.1% for 2023 compared to 2022 Financial Analyst The reported financials from Omega Flex, Inc. indicate a contraction in both net sales and net income. A 11.2% decrease in annual net sales and a 12.1% decrease in net income year-over-year suggest a challenging market environment, potentially leading to a bearish outlook among investors. The decline in housing starts, as mentioned, is a key indicator of reduced demand for the company's products. This data is critical for stakeholders as it points towards a potential need for strategic adjustments to counteract market headwinds.It's also worth noting the company's operational efficiencies, as evidenced by the reduced product liability reserves and expenses. However, these efficiencies were not enough to offset the decline in sales volume. The financial health of Omega Flex can be seen as a microcosm of the broader construction and manufacturing sectors, which are sensitive to economic cycles. As such, it's imperative to monitor these sectors for signs of recovery or further decline, which will invariably affect the company's performance. Market Research Analyst The data on Omega Flex's performance reveals underlying market trends. The decrease in housing starts is a significant factor for companies like Omega Flex, which supply construction-related products. This metric is often seen as a leading indicator for the construction industry and, by extension, for businesses that serve as suppliers. The company's adaptation to these market conditions, including managing inventory provisions for MediTrac® corrugated medical tubing products, can be crucial for maintaining operational resilience.Moreover, the shift in sales unit volumes and the strategic reduction in certain expenses reflect a potential repositioning in response to market pressures. Understanding these dynamics is essential for stakeholders who are evaluating the company's long-term growth prospects and competitive positioning within the industry. Economist The financial results provided by Omega Flex offer insights into broader economic trends, particularly in the construction and manufacturing sectors. The decline in housing starts can be indicative of a broader economic slowdown, which affects consumer spending and investment in infrastructure. This has a cascading effect on companies like Omega Flex that are dependent on such investments.The company's ability to navigate these economic headwinds by adjusting its cost structure, as seen with the lower marketing commissions and freight costs, is commendable. However, the long-term economic outlook will be a determining factor in the company's ability to sustain profitability. Stakeholders should consider macroeconomic indicators and policy decisions that may influence the rate of recovery in the housing and construction markets. 03/06/2024 - 04:15 PM OMEGA FLEX, INC.

Rivest, CEO, announced that net sales of Omega Flex, Inc. (the “Company” or “Omega Flex”) for 2023 and 2022 were $111,465,000 and $125,487,000, respectively, decreasing 11.2%. Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2023 were 8.7% lower than during the same period in 2022. The decrease in net sales was mainly due to lower sales unit volumes as a result of the overall market continuing to be suppressed because of, among other factors, a decline in housing starts. The Company’s net income for 2023 was $20,763,000 compared to $23,622,000 during 2022, decreasing $2,859,000 or 12.1%, mainly due to the decrease in net sales. Although net sales were lower, the results for 2023 were favorably impacted by lower product liability reserves and expenses, lower marketing commissions and freight, higher interest income, and lower executive incentive compensation partly offset by higher marketing salary related expenses and travel and the provision for excess inventories for MediTrac® corrugated medical tubing products.

The company's Core FFO guidance for 2024 is $0.98 - $1.04 per share. Operating metrics show positive trends in NOI, rental revenue, and leasing transactions. Positive Record occupancy of 94.2% and GAAP leasing spreads of nearly 22% in Q4 2023. Revenue increased by over 5% year-over-year. Core FFO per diluted share for Q4 2023 was $0.24, up from $0.23 in Q4 2022. Same-Store NOI grew by 2.4% in Q4 2023. Full-year 2023 revenues were $147.0 million, up from $139.4 million in 2022. Net income attributable to common shareholders was $19.2 million for 2023. 2024 Core FFO guidance is $0.98 - $1.04 per diluted share. Quarterly cash distribution increased by 3.13% for the second quarter of 2024. Whitestone had total debt of $640.5 million and undepreciated real estate assets of $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2023. The company owns 55 Community-Centered Properties™ with approximately 5.0 million square feet of GLA. Conference call with CEO Dave Holeman scheduled for March 7, 2024, to discuss financial results. Negative None. Financial Analyst Whitestone REIT's report of a record occupancy rate of 94.2% and a GAAP leasing spread of nearly 22% indicates a robust demand for their properties, particularly in the Sunbelt region. This is a positive signal for investors as high occupancy rates often correlate with stable revenue streams. However, it's important to note a discrepancy in net income, which decreased from $19.9 million in Q4 2022 to $1.5 million in Q4 2023, potentially raising concerns about the company's profitability despite revenue increases. The dividend growth of 3% could be perceived as a commitment to returning value to shareholders, though the decline in net income warrants a closer examination of the underlying factors affecting profitability.Furthermore, the guidance for 2024 with Core FFO per share estimated between $0.98 and $1.04 suggests cautious optimism, reflecting a potential increase from the 2023 figure of $0.91. The projected same-store net operating income growth and a stable net debt to EBITDAre ratio indicate a solid financial structure, although the range provided for bad debt as a percentage of revenue may suggest uncertainty in the collectability of rents. Investors should monitor these metrics closely as they can affect the company's financial health and stock performance. Real Estate Market Analyst The details provided on Whitestone's Community-Centered Properties™ and their strategic locations in high-traffic, high-household-income areas underscore the company's targeted approach to real estate investment. The growth in net effective annual base rental revenue per leased square foot by 6.2% is a strong indicator of the company's ability to command higher rents, which is a direct contributor to revenue growth. This metric is particularly relevant in the context of the Sunbelt's growing markets, where population and economic growth can drive demand for retail space.However, the decrease in net income year-over-year, despite revenue growth, could suggest rising operational costs or one-time expenses that investors should be aware of. The balance between new leases and renewals also points to a healthy tenant mix, which is crucial for the stability of rental income. The diversified tenant base, with no single tenant exceeding 2.1% of total revenues, helps mitigate the risk of significant revenue loss should any single tenant default or vacate. Investment Strategist From an investment strategy perspective, the 3% dividend increase announced by Whitestone REIT is a positive development, signaling confidence in future cash flows. However, the decline in FFO per diluted share from $1.03 in 2022 to $0.88 in 2023 raises questions about the REIT's operational efficiency and the sustainability of dividend payouts. The guidance for 2024 appears conservative, possibly reflecting management's caution in the face of economic uncertainties or potential market shifts.The debt metrics reveal a slight increase in leverage, with the net debt to EBITDAre ratio expected to improve in 2024. This improvement must be balanced against the interest expense forecasts, which could impact net income. Investors should consider the company's debt management strategies and the implications of interest rate changes on the cost of capital. The availability of credit under the revolving facility provides liquidity, but it's also essential to assess the terms and the REIT's plans for utilizing this capital. 03/06/2024 - 04:15 PM HOUSTON, March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Whitestone REIT (NYSE: WSR) (“Whitestone” or the “Company”) today announced its operating and financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures This release contains supplemental financial measures that are not calculated pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) including EBITDAre, FFO, NOI and net debt. Following are explanations and reconciliations of these metrics to their most comparable GAAP metric. EBITDAre: The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines EBITDAre as net income computed in accordance with GAAP, plus interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and impairment write-downs of depreciable property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciable property in the affiliate, plus or minus losses and gains on the disposition of depreciable property, including losses/gains on change in control and adjustments to reflect the entity’s share of EBITDAre of the unconsolidated affiliates and consolidated affiliates with non-controlling interests. The Company calculates EBITDAre in a manner consistent with the NAREIT definition. Management believes that EBITDAre represents a supplemental non-GAAP performance measure that provides investors with a relevant basis for comparing REITs. There can be no assurance the EBITDAre as presented by the Company is comparable to similarly titled measures of other REITs. EBITDAre should not be considered as an alternative to net income or other measurements under GAAP as indicators of operating performance or to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as measures of liquidity. EBITDAre does not reflect working capital changes, cash expenditures for capital improvements or principal payments on indebtedness. FFO: Funds From Operations: The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines FFO as net income (loss) (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains or losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, and impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity. We calculate FFO in a manner consistent with the NAREIT definition and also include adjustments for our unconsolidated real estate partnership. Core Funds from Operations (“Core FFO”) is a non-GAAP measure. From time to time, we report or provide guidance with respect to “Core FFO” which removes the impact of certain non-recurring and non-operating transactions or other items we do not consider to be representative of our core operating results including, without limitation, default interest on debt of real estate partnership, extinguishment of debt cost, gains or losses associated with litigation involving the Company that is not in the normal course of business, and proxy contest professional fees. Management uses FFO and Core FFO as a supplemental measure to conduct and evaluate our business because there are certain limitations associated with using GAAP net income (loss) alone as the primary measure of our operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Because real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, management believes that the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting is insufficient by itself. In addition, securities analysts, investors and other interested parties use FFO and Core FFO as the primary metric for comparing the relative performance of equity REITs. FFO and Core FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income or other measurements under GAAP, as an indicator of our operating performance or to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity. FFO and Core FFO do not reflect working capital changes, cash expenditures for capital improvements or principal payments on indebtedness. Although our calculation of FFO is consistent with that of NAREIT, there can be no assurance that FFO and Core FFO presented by us is comparable to similarly titled measures of other REITs. NOI: Net Operating Income: Management believes that NOI is a useful measure of our property operating performance. We define NOI as operating revenues (rental and other revenues) less property and related expenses (property operation and maintenance and real estate taxes). Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating NOI and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to other REITs. Because NOI excludes general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, equity or deficit in earnings of real estate partnership, interest expense, interest, dividend and other investment income, provision for income taxes, gain on sale of property from discontinued operations, management fee (net of related expenses) and gain or loss on sale or disposition of assets, and includes NOI of real estate partnership (pro rata) and net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year-over-year, reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating commercial real estate properties and the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. We use NOI to evaluate our operating performance since NOI allows us to evaluate the impact that factors such as occupancy levels, lease structure, lease rates and tenant base have on our results, margins and returns. In addition, management believes that NOI provides useful information to the investment community about our property and operating performance when compared to other REITs since NOI is generally recognized as a standard measure of property performance in the real estate industry. However, NOI should not be viewed as a measure of our overall financial performance since it does not reflect the level of capital expenditure and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, including general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, equity or deficit in earnings of real estate partnership, interest expense, interest, dividend and other investment income, provision for income taxes, gain on sale of property from discontinued operations, management fee (net of related expenses) and gain or loss on sale or disposition of assets. Same Store NOI: Management believes that Same Store NOI is a useful measure of the Company’s property operating performance because it includes only the properties that have been owned for the entire period being compared, and it is frequently used by the investment community. Same Store NOI assists in eliminating differences in NOI due to the acquisition or disposition of properties during the period being presented, providing a more consistent measure of the Company’s performance. The Company defines Same Store NOI as operating revenues (rental and other revenues, excluding straight-line rent adjustments, amortization of above/below market rents, and lease termination fees) less property and related expenses (property operation and maintenance and real estate taxes), Non-Same Store NOI, and NOI of our investment in Pillarstone OP (pro rata). We define “Non-Same Stores” as properties that have been acquired since the beginning of the period being compared and properties that have been sold, but not classified as discontinued operations. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating Same Store NOI, and accordingly, the Company's Same Store NOI may not be comparable to that of other REITs. Net debt: We present net debt, which we define as total debt net of insurance financing less cash plus our proportional share of net debt of real estate partnership, and net debt to pro forma EBITDAre, which we define as net debt divided by EBITDAre because we believe they are helpful as supplemental measures in assessing our ability to service our financing obligations and in evaluating balance sheet leverage against that of other REITs. However, net debt and net debt to pro forma EBITDAre should not be viewed as a stand-alone measure of our overall liquidity and leverage. In addition, other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating net debt and net debt to pro forma EBITDAre, and accordingly our net debt and net debt to pro forma EBITDAre may not be comparable to that of other REITs.

(RGNX) plans to offer $125 million of its common stock in a public offering, with underwriters having a 30-day option to purchase additional shares. The offering is subject to market conditions, and the final terms will be disclosed in a prospectus supplement. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by REGENXBIO Inc. of its intention to offer and sell $125 million of common stock is a significant capital-raising activity that could impact the company's financial structure and market perception. The offering's success will depend on market conditions, investor appetite and the perceived growth potential of REGENXBIO. If successful, the influx of capital could support the company's research and development activities, potentially leading to advancements in their product pipeline. However, investors should be aware of the dilutive effect of such offerings, which could lead to a decrease in earnings per share and existing shareholders' stake being reduced.Additionally, the 30-day option for underwriters to purchase an additional 15% of common shares provides a buffer for additional capital but also introduces further potential dilution. The involvement of established financial institutions like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs could be seen as a positive indicator of the offering's credibility. Investors should closely monitor the final terms of the offering, disclosed in the final prospectus supplement, for a clearer understanding of the offering's impact on the company's valuation and market position. Market Research Analyst The biotechnology sector, where REGENXBIO operates, is highly competitive and capital-intensive. The decision to raise additional capital through a public offering is a common strategic move for biotech companies seeking to fund ongoing research, clinical trials, or expand their operations. It is important for stakeholders to consider the company's current pipeline and stage of development to assess the potential return on investment from such a capital infusion. Market response to this offering could also serve as a barometer for investor confidence in the biotech industry's growth prospects, particularly in the therapeutic areas REGENXBIO targets.Furthermore, the timing of the offering could be influenced by broader market trends and the current investment climate in the healthcare sector. Considering the volatility of biotech stocks, potential investors should evaluate the risk-reward profile of REGENXBIO's stock offering in the context of both the company's performance and the overall market conditions. Legal Expert The offering is being conducted under a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which expedites the process of securities sales by already having a registration statement filed and automatically effective with the SEC.

It is critical to understand that the press release is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy; such transactions are strictly regulated and subject to the completion of legal requirements, including the registration or qualification under the applicable securities laws.Prospective investors should consult the final prospectus supplement for the definitive terms of the offering, including the risk factors associated with the securities being offered.

Net loss for Q4 was $5.5 million, while the full year saw a net loss of $60.1 million. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 2023 was $11.5 million, a significant improvement from the previous year. RSI's revenue guidance for full year 2024 is between $770 and $830 million. Adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2024 is expected to be between $35 and $45 million. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported 17% year-over-year revenue increase for Rush Street Interactive is a notable indicator of growth, especially in the competitive online casino and sports betting industry. This performance may be attributed to strategic market expansion and effective user acquisition strategies. The substantial decrease in net loss from the previous year suggests improved operational efficiency and a more controlled spending approach, particularly in advertising and promotions, which saw a 45% decrease in Q4 and a 27% decrease for the full year.With the company's expansion into Delaware and the reported increase in Monthly Active Users, especially the 33% year-over-year growth in Latin America, there appears to be a successful penetration into emerging markets. However, the Average Revenue per Monthly Active User (ARPMAU) indicates a significant disparity between the United States and Canada versus Latin America, highlighting potential differences in market maturity and consumer spending power.Investors may find the forward-looking revenue guidance for 2024 and the projected increase in Adjusted EBITDA to be positive signs of the company's growth trajectory and management's confidence in operational scaling. However, the reliance on existing markets for this guidance suggests a cautious approach to further geographic expansion or regulatory changes. Financial Analyst The introduction of Adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2024, with an expected increase of over 390% at the midpoint, signals a significant anticipated improvement in profitability. This level of growth in Adjusted EBITDA, if realized, would be exceptional and indicates that the company's management is expecting substantial operational leverage gains. The reduction in advertising and promotional expenses as a percentage of revenue is a key factor here, as it suggests the company is moving beyond the customer acquisition phase and beginning to realize the benefits of scale.From a financial perspective, the strong cash and cash equivalents position provides the company with a buffer to fund operations and invest in strategic initiatives without the immediate need for external financing. Investors should monitor the company's ability to maintain this cash position while continuing to grow revenue and improve profitability.It is critical to note that these figures are non-GAAP measures, which can provide additional insights into the company's performance but should be considered alongside GAAP results for a complete financial analysis. Non-GAAP measures often exclude certain expenses that are deemed non-recurring or not indicative of future operating performance, but these exclusions might also mask underlying costs that are important to consider. Gaming Industry Consultant The online gaming and sports betting sector is characterized by high customer acquisition costs and significant regulatory hurdles. Rush Street Interactive's reported decrease in advertising and promotions expenses suggests an effective cost management strategy that could be a competitive advantage. Their ability to grow revenue while simultaneously reducing these costs is noteworthy in an industry where customer loyalty is challenging to maintain.The reported performance indicates a strong user engagement, as evidenced by the 7% increase in MAUs in the United States and Canada and a more pronounced 33% increase in Latin America. The company's successful launch in Delaware adds to its portfolio of operational states, which could further enhance its market share.For stakeholders, the expansion into new jurisdictions like Delaware and the growth in Latin America are likely to be seen as positive developments. However, it's important to remain cautious about regulatory risks, as changes in gaming laws can significantly impact operations. The company's guidance assumes continued operations in current markets, which might be affected by future regulatory shifts. 03/06/2024 - 04:15 PM - Fourth Quarter Revenue of $194 Million, up 17% Year-over-Year -- Full Year 2023 Revenue of $691 Million, up 17% -- Fourth Quarter and Full Year Net Loss of $5.5 Million and $60.1 Million, respectively -- Fourth Quarter and Full Year Adjusted EBITDA of $11.5 Million and $8.2 Million, respectively -- Strong Fourth Quarter 2023 Momentum Reflected in Full Year 2024 Revenue Guidance of Between $770 and $830 Million -- Initiating Full Year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA Guidance of Between $35 and $45 Million - CHICAGO, March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rush Street Interactive, Inc.

At the midpoint of this range, Adjusted EBITDA of $40 million represents over 390% year-over-year growth when compared to $8.2 million of Adjusted EBITDA for 2023.These guidance ranges are based on certain assumptions, including that (i) only operations in live jurisdictions as of today’s date are included, and (ii) RSI continues to operate in markets in which it is live today. 1 This is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information about this non-GAAP financial measure and “Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for any applicable reconciliation of the most comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP to this non-GAAP financial measure.

For the year, we grew revenue to $691 million on strong customer engagement and retention. At the same time, we improved our Adjusted EBITDA by $100 million compared to the prior year. These results and the ensuing momentum have carried into strong guidance for the new year, reflecting our longstanding customer-centric principles and obsession with developing innovative and differentiated user experiences. “With a substantial cash balance and no debt, our financial wherewithal provides us the luxury of being able to continue executing on our long-term strategy and investing appropriately in new markets. Our strong launch in Delaware exemplifies our ability to identify and grow new and exciting markets, including the opportunities we are pursuing across the Americas.” Earnings Conference Call and Webcast Details RSI will host a conference call and audio webcast today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (4:00 p.m. Central Time), during which management will discuss fourth quarter and full year results and provide commentary on business performance and its current outlook for 2024.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to providing financial measurements based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), this press release includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating Costs and Expenses, Adjusted Net Loss Per Share, Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Weighted Average Common Shares Outstanding, each of which is a non-GAAP performance measure that RSI uses to supplement its results presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure can be found below. RSI believes that presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding RSI’s results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by its public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any GAAP financial measures and, as calculated, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of performance of other companies in other industries or within the same industry. By providing full year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA guidance, RSI provided its expectation of a forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure. Information reconciling full year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, net income (loss), is unavailable to RSI without unreasonable effort due to, among other things, the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying the comparable GAAP measure and the applicable adjustments and other amounts that would be necessary for such a reconciliation, and certain of these amounts are outside of RSI’s control and may be subject to high variability or complexity. Preparation of such reconciliations would also require a forward-looking balance sheet, statement of operations and statement of cash flows, prepared in accordance with GAAP, and such forward-looking financial statements are unavailable to RSI without unreasonable effort. RSI provides a range for its Adjusted EBITDA forecast that it believes will be achieved; however, RSI cannot provide any assurance that it can predict all of the components of the Adjusted EBITDA calculation. RSI provides a forecast for Adjusted EBITDA because it believes that Adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with RSI’s results calculated in accordance with GAAP, provides useful information for the reasons noted herein. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or cash flow from operating activities or as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity. RSI defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, adjustments for certain one-time or non-recurring items and other adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain expenses that are required in accordance with GAAP because certain expenses are either non-cash (i.e., depreciation and amortization, and share-based compensation) or are not related to our underlying business performance (i.e., interest income or expense). RSI defines Adjusted Operating Costs and Expenses as RSI’s GAAP operating costs and expenses adjusted to exclude the impacts of share-based compensation, certain one-time or non-recurring items and other adjustments. Adjusted Operating Costs and Expenses excludes certain expenses that are required in accordance with GAAP because certain expenses are either non-cash (i.e., share-based compensation) or are not related to our underlying business performance. RSI defines Adjusted Earnings (Loss) Per Share as Adjusted Net Income (Loss) divided by Adjusted Weighted Average Common Shares Outstanding. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is defined as net loss attributable to Rush Street Interactive, Inc. as used in the basic and diluted net loss per share calculations, adjusted for the reallocation of net loss attributable to non-controlling interests, share-based compensation, certain one-time or non-recurring items and other adjustments. Adjusted Weighted Average Common Shares Outstanding is defined as the weighted average number of common shares outstanding as used in the basic and diluted net loss per share calculation, adjusted for the assumed conversion of the non-controlling interest’s Rush Street Interactive, LP Class A units to Class A common stock of RSI on a one-to-one-basis, and in periods of Adjusted Net Income, incremental shares from assumed conversion of stock options and restricted stock units. RSI includes these non-GAAP financial measures because management uses them to evaluate RSI’s core operating performance and trends and to make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and new investments. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful information on RSI’s past financial and operating performance, enable comparison of financial results from period-to-period where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by RSI’s management in operating our business. Management also believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry, as these metrics generally eliminate the effects of certain items that may vary from company to company for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. Key Metrics RSI provides certain key metrics, including Monthly Active Users (“MAUs”) and ARPMAU, in this press release. RSI defines MAUs as the number of unique users per month who have placed at least one real-money bet across one or more of our online casino or online sports betting offerings, and it defines ARPMAU as average revenue for the applicable period divided by the average MAUs for the same period. The numbers RSI uses to calculate MAUs and ARPMAU are based on internal RSI data. While these numbers are based on what RSI believes to be reasonable judgments and estimates of its customer base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement with respect to RSI’s online offerings across its customer base. Such challenges and limitations may also affect RSI’s understanding of certain details of its business. In addition, RSI’s key metrics and related estimates, including the definitions and calculations of the same, may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly-titled metrics of its competitors due to differences in operations, offerings, methodology and access to information. RSI regularly reviews, and may adjust its processes for calculating, its internal metrics to improve their accuracy. Forward-Looking Statements This press release includes ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the ""safe harbor"" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. RSI's actual results may differ from their expectations, estimates and projections and consequently, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Words such as ""expect,"" ""estimate,"" ""project,"" ""budget,"" ""forecast,"" ""anticipate,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""may,"" ""will,"" ""could,"" ""should,"" ""believes,"" ""predicts,"" ""potential,"" “propose”, ""continue,"" and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding revenue and Adjusted EBITDA guidance, RSI’s future results of operations, financial condition, cash flows or profitability (whether on a GAAP or non-GAAP basis), currency fluctuations, RSI’s strategic plans and focus, anticipated launches or withdrawals of RSI’s current or new offerings in existing or future jurisdictions, player growth and engagement, product initiatives, outcomes of current or future regulatory developments and the objectives of management for future operations. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the expected results. Most of these factors are outside RSI's control and are difficult to predict. Factors that may cause such differences include, without limitation: changes in applicable laws or regulations; RSI’s ability to manage and sustain growth; RSI’s ability to execute its business plan, meet its projections and obtain relevant market access and/or gaming licenses; unanticipated product or service delays; general economic and market conditions impacting the demand for RSI’s products and services; economic and market conditions in the gaming, entertainment and leisure industry in the markets in which RSI operates; the potential adverse effects of general economic conditions, inflation and interest rates and unemployment on RSI’s liquidity, operations and personnel; and other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in RSI's filings with the SEC. RSI cautions that the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. RSI cautions readers not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. RSI does not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in its expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except as required by law.

BankUnited N.A. is the sole arranger. The LOC is secured by joint venture equity investments, with a deficiency guaranty from the general partner's affiliate. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP regarding the expansion of its secured revolving Line of Credit (LOC) facility by $10 million to a new maximum of $50 million is a significant liquidity event that merits attention. The involvement of a new lender signifies market confidence in the Partnership's creditworthiness and strategic direction. From a financial standpoint, the increased LOC enhances the company's financial flexibility, allowing for more robust responses to investment opportunities or unforeseen expenses.It is important to note that the LOC is secured by the Partnership's joint venture equity investments, which implies that these assets are considered sufficiently valuable by the lending institutions to warrant the extension of additional credit. This can be interpreted as a positive indicator of the underlying value of the Partnership's investments. However, it also means that in the event of a default, these assets could be at risk.BankUnited N.A.'s role as sole arranger and administrative agent is also noteworthy, as it suggests a streamlined process for the Partnership in managing its credit facility. The deficiency guaranty provided by an affiliate of the general partner adds an extra layer of security for the lender, potentially leading to more favorable credit terms for the Partnership. Market Research Analyst The strategic move by Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP to increase its LOC signals a proactive approach to capital management. This could be interpreted by the market as a precursor to future growth initiatives or acquisitions, which may be particularly relevant in the context of the housing market. Given the cyclical nature of real estate, access to additional liquidity can be crucial in capitalizing on market downturns or in pursuing development projects that align with the Partnership's investment thesis.Market participants often view such credit facility expansions as an indication of a company's operational strength and strategic foresight. It is essential to consider the potential impact on the Partnership's debt-to-equity ratio and overall leverage, as these factors can influence investor perception and the company's stock price. Additionally, the terms of the credit facility, such as interest rates and covenants, are critical in assessing the long-term cost of capital and financial health of the Partnership. Economist The broader economic implications of Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP's increased LOC should be considered in the context of current interest rate trends and the economic environment. If the decision to expand the credit facility was made in anticipation of rising interest rates, it could be seen as a strategic move to lock in lower rates and hedge against future borrowing costs. Moreover, the ability to secure additional funds from a new lender may reflect a favorable lending climate and financial stability within the real estate sector.On the other hand, an increase in available credit could lead to higher leverage, which may become a concern if economic conditions deteriorate. The Partnership's management will need to balance the benefits of immediate liquidity against the potential risks associated with increased debt levels, especially in a sector known for its sensitivity to economic cycles. 03/06/2024 - 04:15 PM OMAHA, Neb., March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP (NYSE: GHI) (the “Partnership”) announced today that on March 4, 2024, it closed on a $10 million increase in the maximum available commitment of its secured revolving Line of Credit facility (“LOC”) to up to $50 million. The additional $10 million commitment was provided by a new lender to the Partnership. BankUnited N.A. serves as sole arranger and administrative agent. The LOC is secured by the Partnership’s joint venture equity investments. An affiliate of the Partnership’s general partner provides a deficiency guaranty for the facility. “The increase in LOC commitment provided by a new lender further enhances our available liquidity and demonstrates the Partnership’s ability to obtain additional credit from lenders,” said Kenneth C. Rogozinski, Chief Executive Officer of the Partnership. About Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP was formed in 1998 under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act for the primary purpose of acquiring, holding, selling and otherwise dealing with a portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds which have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing for affordable multifamily, seniors and student housing properties.

Negative Revenue decline of 19.2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2023. Year-over-year and sequential declines in DTC orders and active customers. Plastic intensity increase for Grove Brands due to recycled plastic trash bags. Negative net loss margin and adjusted EBITDA margin figures. Expected revenue decline in the first quarter of 2024. Financial Analyst The recent financial results from Grove Collaborative Holdings, Inc. suggest several key indicators that are critical for evaluating the company's performance and future outlook. The reported positive Adjusted EBITDA for two consecutive quarters, coupled with an increase in Operating Cash Flow and a record Net Revenue per Order, indicates a positive trend in the company’s operational efficiency. This is particularly noteworthy given the broader context of a year-over-year revenue decline of 19.2% and a decrease in Direct to Consumer orders.From a financial standpoint, the improvement in Gross Margin by 740 basis points year-over-year is significant, suggesting effective cost management and potentially higher profitability per sale. The increase in Operating Expenses, however, could be a concern, especially if it outpaces revenue growth in the future. Investors should monitor whether the company's cost optimization efforts can sustain the improved EBITDA margins, especially given the company's guidance for a revenue decline in Q1 2024 followed by expected sequential growth in the second half of the year.Regarding the financial outlook for 2024, the projected net revenue of $215 to $225 million and an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 0.0% to 1.0% provide a clear framework for expectations. However, the anticipated revenue decline in Q1 2024 suggests that the path to profitability may be challenging and will require close attention to cost management and operational efficiency. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Grove Collaborative's focus on sustainability and the expansion of third-party product offerings are strategic moves that align with current consumer trends towards eco-friendly products. The company's emphasis on increasing the percentage of orders containing wellness products and the establishment of a Health and Wellness Advisory Board indicate a targeted approach to capitalize on the growing health-conscious consumer segment.However, the decrease in Direct to Consumer orders due to lower advertising spend raises questions about the company's long-term customer acquisition and retention strategies. The shift towards existing customer orders and the increase in the average number of units per order may compensate for the lower order volume to some extent, but it is critical to assess if these trends can continue without robust advertising support.Investors should consider the competitive landscape of the sustainable consumer products market, as well as the potential impact of economic factors on consumer spending habits. The company's ability to differentiate itself and maintain customer loyalty in a market with increasing competition will be key to its long-term success. Sustainability Expert On the sustainability front, Grove Collaborative's Plastic Intensity Score and their Beyond Plastic™ badging system are innovative approaches to reduce environmental impact and enhance brand value. The reported improvement in plastic intensity from 1.11 pounds to 1.07 pounds of plastic per $100 in net revenue quarter-over-quarter demonstrates a commitment to sustainability. This improvement, despite the year-over-year increase in plastic intensity for Grove Brands due to the inclusion of recycled plastic trash bags, indicates a nuanced approach to product sustainability.While the company's efforts to reduce plastic usage are commendable, it is important to evaluate the effectiveness of these initiatives in driving customer loyalty and whether they can be leveraged to gain a competitive edge in the market. Additionally, the ongoing exploration of ways to reduce plastic in product categories must balance environmental goals with customer satisfaction and product efficacy.Investors should consider the potential long-term cost savings and brand enhancement that could result from these sustainability initiatives, as well as their appeal to a growing demographic of environmentally conscious consumers. 03/06/2024 - 04:05 PM Fourth Quarter Adjusted EBITDA of $0.1 million, positive for the second quarter in a row Positive Fourth Quarter Operating Cash Flow of $1.1M Record Net Revenue per Order of $66.83 Announces Fiscal 2024 Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA Guidance SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Grove Collaborative Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: GROV) (“Grove” or “the Company”), a leading sustainable consumer products company and certified B Corporation, today reported fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023. Grove Collaborative’s fourth quarter 2023 financial results include several milestones for the Company, including its second consecutive quarter of positive Adjusted EBITDA, positive Operating Cash Flow, and a new record for Net Revenue per Order. These results reflect progress in improving bottom-line-results, and set the Company up to deliver profitable sequential revenue growth in the second half of 2024. “I’m incredibly proud of the Grove Collaborative team and their hard work to deliver positive Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter in a row, and Operating Cash Flow in two of the last three quarters, building momentum for the future as we continue on our path to being the most trusted brand for conscientious customers who are making the right choices for their families and the planet,” said Jeff Yurcisin, Chief Executive Officer of Grove Collaborative. “This past quarter has been the start of a critical business transformation as we create incentives for customers to build the most wallet- and planet-friendly box possible, and roll out a robust product pipeline prioritizing sustainability and convenience. We have an unyielding resolve to drive profitable, sustainable growth and shareholder value by putting the customer at the center of everything that we do and, as a result, in the second half of 2024, we expect to deliver sequential quarterly revenue growth. Moreover, we expect to be Adjusted EBITDA positive for the full year and expect the momentum to continue into 2025 where we plan to be growing and profitable for the entire year.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Revenue, Net was $59.9 million, down 3.1% from the third quarter of 2023, and down 19.2% year-over-year. The sequential and year-over-year declines were driven by a decrease in Direct to Consumer (“DTC”)1 orders from lower advertising spend throughout 2022 and 2023, partially offset by an increase in DTC net revenue per order. Gross Margin was 54.4%, improving 60 basis points from the third quarter of 2023 and 740 basis points year-over-year. The sequential and year-over-year improvements were mostly due to the sell-through of previously reserved inventory. Operating Expenses were $40.5 million, increasing 8.5% from the third quarter of 2023, but down 35.9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Fourth quarter operating expenses include $3.3 million of restructuring expenses and an increase of $1.5 million in stock-based compensation charges due to an accounting true up in the third quarter. Net Loss Margin was (15.8%), compared to (15.9%) in the third quarter of 2023 and (17.1%) in the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA Margin2 was 0.2%, positive for the second quarter in a row, down 10 basis points from the third quarter of 2023, but up 1,310 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2022. The Company ended the fourth quarter of 2023 with $94.9 million in Cash, Cash equivalents, and Restricted Cash, an increase of $0.2 million versus the prior quarter, primarily driven by $1.1 million of operating cash flow offset by $0.5 million of capital expenditures. __________________ 1 Direct to Consumer is defined as our website and mobile application. 2 Adjusted EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a description of adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss in the table at the end of this press release. Fourth Quarter 2023 Key Business Highlights: (in thousands, except DTC Net Revenue Per Order and percentages) Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Financial and Operating Data Grove Brands % Net Revenue 44 % 46 % DTC Total Orders 864 1,132 DTC Active Customers 920 1,377 DTC Net Revenue Per Order $ 67 $ 63 Grove Brands % of Net Revenue represented 44% of net revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023, down 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 70 basis points year-over-year. The sequential and year-over-year declines were largely due to a decrease in Grove Brand products in existing customer orders as we continued to expand our third-party product offering, especially our product selection in the Health and Wellness category, relative to Grove Brand products. Direct to Consumer (DTC) Total Orders were 0.9 million, down 5.8% quarter-over-quarter and 23.7% year-over-year. The year-over-year and sequential declines were due to lower advertising spend throughout 2022 and 2023. DTC Active Customers were 0.9 million, down 9.7% quarter-over-quarter and 33.2% year-over-year. The year-over-year and sequential declines were due to lower advertising spend. DTC Net Revenue Per Order was $66.83 in the fourth quarter of 2023, another record for Grove, up 2.4% quarter-over-quarter and 5.4% year-over-year. The year-over-year improvement was due to a mix shift towards existing customer orders (as opposed to first orders) and an increase in the average number of units per order. Plastic Intensity Score3 Plastic Intensity Across the Entire Grove Business - including both Grove Brands and third-party products through online sales and retail partners - was 1.07 pounds of plastic4 per $100 in net revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023, an improvement from 1.11 pounds in the third quarter of 2023 and 1.08 pounds in the fourth quarter of 2022. Plastic Intensity for Grove Brands Only across online and retail sales was 1.07 pounds of plastic per $100 in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023, an improvement from 1.14 pounds in the third quarter of 2023, but up from 0.98 pounds in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our Grove Co. 100% Recycled Plastic Trash Bags are the primary driver of the year-over-year plastic intensity increase for our Grove Brands. Excluding this product category, Grove Brands plastic intensity was 0.57 pounds in the fourth quarter of 2023, an improvement from the third quarter of 2023 of 0.63 pounds but slightly up from 0.56 pounds in the fourth quarter of 2022. We are continuing to explore ways to reduce plastic in this category while providing customers with an effective product experience, but we see recycled plastic as the current, best available material. _____________________ 3 Grove defines plastic intensity as pounds of plastic used per $100 in revenue as a way to hold itself accountable for the pace at which it decouples revenue from the use of plastic. 4 To calculate plastic intensity, Grove Collaborative defines ""plastic"" as any of the following materials within both products and packaging: plastic resin codes #1-7 (from the ASTM International Resin Identification Coding System), inclusive of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, PVOH, PVAl), silicone, bioplastics, and any plastic liners, coatings, and resins Fourth Quarter 2023 Operational Highlights Our strategic pillars, which we announced in the third quarter of 2023 to drive continued success and work towards profitable growth, are our customer, sustainability, and profitability. We are excited to share the following related updates for Q4: Customer-driven growth: Highlights from the fourth quarter related to our customer priorities include: Changing Our Growth Model: Began implementing a significant and transformative shift in our business model that more closely aligns with ecommerce best practices and first order customer experiences while creating incentives for customers to opt into a program that allows them to subscribe and save on individual products. The program is foundational to enabling customers to receive the most planet- and wallet-friendly box possible. Third-Party Category and Selection Expansion: Expanded our assortment of third-party brands to include selections from Ancient Nutrition, Compostic, The Honest Company, and WishGardens, as well as dozens of new products from existing third-party brands. Grove Co. Product Innovation: Launched our Grove Co. Bottle Wash Power Packs and streamlined our Grove Brands strategy to consolidate under our flagship Grove Co. brand. Health and Wellness Growth: Grew the percentage of orders containing a wellness product in the fourth quarter of 2023 by more than 75% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, and established a dedicated Health and Wellness Advisory Board of medical clinicians to guide our continued growth in this category. Improved Customer Experience: Made changes to our website experience by improving personalized product recommendations that appear on a customer’s individual homepage. VIP Program Updates: Announced exclusive pricing in our VIP Shop for themed product assortments and bundles each month, including discounts up to 40% off for our most loyal customers. Sustainability: Highlights from the fourth quarter related to our sustainability priorities include: 15 Millions Pounds of Plastic Collected: Recovered 15 million pounds of nature- and ocean-bound single-use plastic since 2020 through our plastic neutrality commitment and ongoing partnership with plastic recovery platforms. Beyond Plastic™ Badging5: Launched a digital badging system on products across our site that meet Grove’s Beyond Plastic™ standard, including 100% Plastic Free, 95%+ Plastic Free, and No Single Use Plastic. Profitability: Highlights from the fourth quarter related to our profitability priorities include: Ongoing improvement of operating costs: Executed initiatives, including vendor, partner, and contract negotiations, to increase our operating leverage and improve profitability. We also took additional action in the first quarter of 2024 to further optimize our operating costs and expense structure, including the reduction of our headquarters lease footprint and optimization of our fulfillment network footprint. __________________ 5 For each product sold on our website, Grove Collaborative collects product and packaging data from our suppliers and/or brand partners to calculate the total plastic weight and determines what percentage of the product is plastic by weight. We also evaluate if the product contains durable or reusable plastic, defined by the Environmental Protection Agency as lasting 3 years or more, to determine if a product contains no single-use plastic. This information is then used to determine if each product meets our Beyond Plastic TM standard and qualifies for one of our three digital badges: “100% Plastic Free”, “95%+ Plastic Free” and “No Single Use Plastic.” Full Year 2023 Financial Results Net revenue of $259.3 million, which landed within the Company’s full-year guidance range, decreased 19.4% year-over-year, driven by a decrease in DTC orders from a reduction in advertising spend, offset by an increase in DTC net revenue per order. Gross margin of 53.0%, up 490 basis points year-over-year driven by the full year impact of the online order related fees that we began charging in the fourth quarter of 2022, a decrease in lower margin first orders, and sell-through of previously reserved for inventory. Operating Expenses of $172.6 million, down 41.6% year-over-year due to lower advertising expenses, product development expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses. Net loss margin of (16.7%), an improvement of 1,060 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin6 of (3.5%), an improvement of 2,130 basis points year-over-year. Plastic Intensity of 1.10 pounds of plastic per $100 of revenue in 2023, a decrease compared to 1.17 pounds in 2022. _________________ 6 Adjusted EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a description of adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss in the table at the end of this press release. Financial Outlook: Chief Financial Officer Sergio Cervantes commented, “2023 was a step-change year for the Company where we made significant strides towards sustainable profitability, delivering positive Adjusted EBITDA in the third and fourth quarters, a strong result and a demonstration of our ability to manage our cost structure and commitment to the long term health of the business. As we look forward to 2024, revenue will decline again in the first quarter, but we expect to deliver sequential revenue growth in the second half of the year, while also balancing advertising efficiency and profitability. We believe that the transformational changes during 2023 and early 2024 have set us up well to achieve this outcome.” Grove is providing the following guidance: For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2024, we expect: Net revenue of $215 to $225 million, and Adjusted EBITDA margin of 0.0% to 1.0% Conference Call Information: The Company will host an investor conference call and webcast to review these financial results at 5:00pm ET / 2:00pm PT on March 6, 2024.

The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on our current expectations and beliefs in light of our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments and their potential effects on the Company as well as other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting the Company will be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements, including changes in business, market, financial, political and legal conditions; legal and regulatory matters and developments, risks relating to the uncertainty of the projected financial information; our ability to successfully expand our business; competition; the uncertain effects of the COVID-19 pandemic; risks relating to inflation and interest rates; effectiveness of our ecommerce platform and selling efforts; demand for our products and other brands that we sell and those factors discussed in documents we have filed, or to be filed, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements in this press release are made as of the date hereof, based on information available to Grove as of the date hereof, and Grove assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Some of the financial information and data contained in this press release, such as Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, have not been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). These non-GAAP measures, and other measures that are calculated using such non-GAAP measures, are an addition to, and not a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to revenue, operating income, profit before tax, net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of historical adjusted EBITDA to Net Income is provided in the tables at the end of this press release. The reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA Margin to the closest corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable effort on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability, complexity, and low visibility with respect to the charges excluded from these non-GAAP measures, such as the impact of depreciation and amortization of fixed assets, amortization of internal use software, the effects of net interest expense (income), other expense (income), and non-cash stock based compensation expense. Grove believes these non-GAAP measures of financial results, including on a forward-looking basis, provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to Grove’s financial condition and results of operations. Grove’s management uses these non-GAAP measures for trend analyses and for budgeting and planning purposes. Grove believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating projected operating results and trends in and in comparing Grove’s financial measures with other similar companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. Management of Grove does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-GAAP measures and their nearest GAAP equivalents. Other companies may calculate non-GAAP measures differently, or may use other measures to calculate their financial performance, and therefore Grove’s non-GAAP measures may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude: stock-based compensation expense; depreciation and amortization; remeasurement of convertible preferred stock warrant liability; changes in fair values of derivative liabilities; transaction costs allocated to derivative liabilities upon closing of the transaction where we became a publicly traded company; interest income; interest expense; restructuring and severance related costs; loss on extinguishment of debt; provision for income taxes and certain litigation and legal settlement expenses. We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenue. Because Adjusted EBITDA excludes these elements that are otherwise included in our GAAP financial results, this measure has limitations when compared to net loss determined in accordance with GAAP. Further, Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. For these reasons, investors should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation from, or as a substitute for, net loss determined in accordance with GAAP. Grove Collaborative Holdings, Inc.

Adjusted pre-tax income was $16.0 million, or $2.88 per diluted share. The company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share. Revenues increased to $34.5 million, driven by growth in asset management, new issue and advisory, and principal transactions. The company's focus on expanding capital markets and asset management services has positioned it well for the future. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported net income of $4.5 million by Cohen & Company for the fourth quarter of 2023 is a significant turnaround from the net loss of $0.4 million in the previous quarter and the net loss of $3.0 million in the same quarter of the previous year. This improvement is largely attributable to the successful closing of four investment banking transactions and income from equity method investments in SPACs. The adjusted pre-tax income of $16.0 million is a key indicator of operational efficiency, excluding non-recurring items, which investors look for as a more consistent measure of profitability.It is important to note that the increase in net trading revenue and the substantial new issue and advisory revenue reflect a strong performance in Cohen & Company's capital markets services. However, the decrease in net trading revenue from the previous year indicates potential volatility in trading operations, which stakeholders should monitor. The declaration of a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share signals confidence in the company's liquidity and commitment to shareholder returns, a positive sign for investors. Market Research Analyst The financial results of Cohen & Company, particularly the growth in new issue and advisory revenue, suggest a robust demand for capital markets services amid a challenging interest rate environment. This resilience could indicate a competitive edge and effective adaptation to market conditions. The expansion of the trading platform, as indicated by the recent appointment of a new Managing Director, points towards strategic growth initiatives that could enhance the company's market position.Furthermore, the significant contribution from equity method investments in SPACs underscores the importance of strategic investments and diversification in the company's revenue streams. The SPAC market has been volatile and the success of these investments in the reported quarter may not necessarily be indicative of future performance. Investors should assess the sustainability of such income sources in light of the broader SPAC market trends. Legal Expert Income from equity method investments, particularly in SPACs, can be subject to complex accounting and legal considerations. The $17.2 million income from equity method investments reported by Cohen & Company reflects the closing of business combinations by SPACs, which often lead to significant changes in the value of founder shares. These transactions can have material impacts on financial statements and require careful legal scrutiny to ensure compliance with regulatory standards.The company's decision to discontinue quarterly conference calls could raise questions about transparency and communication with investors. While this move might streamline operations, it could also limit opportunities for investors to engage with management and seek clarifications on the company's performance and strategic direction. 03/06/2024 - 04:05 PM Fourth Quarter Net Income Attributable to Cohen & Company Inc. of $4.5 Million, or $2.97 per Diluted Share Fourth Quarter Adjusted Pre-Tax income of $16.0 Million, or $2.88 per Diluted Share Board Declares Quarterly Dividend of $0.25 per Share PHILADELPHIA and NEW YORK, March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cohen & Company Inc.

See Note 1 below. Lester Brafman, Chief Executive Officer of Cohen & Company, said, “During most of 2023, the high interest rate environment negatively impacted our investment banking, trading, and commercial real estate businesses, however, Cohen & Company Capital Markets was able to close four significant investment banking transactions in the fourth quarter. Also, we recognized substantial income from our equity method investments in the sponsors of four SPACs that closed their business combinations during the fourth quarter. The banking transactions and the earnings from our equity method investments drove our $16 million of adjusted pre-tax income in the quarter. In addition, recently we announced the appointment of George Holstead as Managing Director and Head of the Middle Markets Group in JVB’s Boca Raton office, and we are excited to expand our trading platform. Looking ahead, we believe that we are well positioned going into the new year, and we remain focused on enhancing long-term, sustained value for our stockholders, including through continued payment of our quarterly dividend.” Financial Highlights Net income attributable to Cohen & Company Inc. was $4.5 million, or $2.97 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to net loss of $0.4 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and net loss of $3.0 million, or $2.10 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Adjusted pre-tax income was $16.0 million, or $2.88 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to adjusted pre-tax loss of $8.4 million, or $1.52 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and adjusted pre-tax loss of $6.1 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Adjusted pre-tax income (loss) and adjusted pre-tax income (loss) per diluted share are not measures recognized under GAAP. See Note 1 below.Revenues were $34.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $17.1 million for the prior quarter and $12.5 million for the prior year quarter. Net trading revenue was $7.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, up $0.3 million from the prior quarter and down $1.8 million from the prior year quarter. The increase from the prior quarter was due primarily to higher trading revenue by our corporate, agency, and municipal groups, partially offset by our mortgage groups. The decrease from the prior year quarter was due primarily to lower trading revenue by our mortgage groups, partially offset by our agency and municipal groups.Asset management revenue was $1.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, up slightly from both the prior and prior year quarters. The increase from both prior quarters is primarily related to increased assets under management in our European funds as well as a commercial real estate servicing agreement entered into in November 2023.New issue and advisory revenue was $18.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, up $11.5 million from the prior quarter and $14.5 million from the prior year quarter. In the current quarter, the Cohen & Company Capital Markets investment banking team generated $18.6 million and the insurance origination team generated $0.1 million of the new issue and advisory revenue. Principal transactions and other revenue was $6.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $0.6 million in the prior quarter and negative $3.2 million in the prior year quarter. In all quarters presented, the principal transactions and other revenue was primarily due to mark-to-market adjustments on the Company’s principal investment portfolio. Compensation and benefits expense during the three months ended December 31, 2023 increased $1.1 million from the prior quarter and $7.4 million from the prior year quarter. The number of Company employees was 118 as of December 31, 2023, compared to 114 as of September 30, 2023, and 121 as of December 31, 2022. Interest expense during the three months ended December 31, 2023 was comparable to the prior quarter and increased $0.4 million from the prior year quarter. The increase from the prior year quarter was primarily due to higher interest on our trust preferred securities debt and redeemable financial instrument.Income from equity method affiliates for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was $17.2 million, compared to loss from equity method affiliates of $0.7 million for the prior quarter and loss from equity method affiliates of $6.4 million for the prior year quarter. The increase in the current quarter was primarily driven by $17.5 million of income from our equity method investments in the sponsors of four special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) that closed their business combinations during the fourth quarter of 2023, which resulted in an increase in value of the founder shares to which we are entitled to an allocation from the sponsors. For the three months ended December 31, 2023, there was an offsetting credit recorded in the net income (loss) attributable to the non-convertible non-controlling interest line item of $4.9 million related to the four SPACs that closed their business combinations during the fourth quarter of 2023.Income tax expense for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was $0.2 million, compared to income tax benefit of $0.8 million in the prior quarter, and income tax expense of $1.3 million in the prior year quarter. The Company will continue to evaluate its operations on a quarterly basis and may adjust the valuation allowance applied against the Company's net operating loss and net capital loss tax assets. Future adjustments could be material and may result in additional tax benefit or tax expense. Total Equity and Dividend Declaration As of December 31, 2023, total equity was $91.8 million, compared to $94.0 million as of December 31, 2022; the non-convertible non-controlling interest component of total equity was $9.6 million as of December 31, 2023 and $17 thousand as of December 31, 2022. Thus, the total equity excluding the non-convertible non-controlling interest component was $82.2 million as of December 31, 2023, an $11.8 million decrease from $94.0 million as of December 31, 2022.The Company’s Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, payable on April 5, 2024, to stockholders of record as of March 22, 2024. The Board of Directors will continue to evaluate the dividend policy each quarter, and future decisions regarding dividends may be impacted by quarterly operating results and the Company’s capital needs.

Adjusted pre-tax income (loss) represents net income (loss) attributable to Cohen & Company Inc., computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding income tax expense (benefit), plus the net income (loss) attributable to the convertible non-controlling interest. Income tax expense (benefit) has been excluded because a pre-tax measurement of enterprise earnings that includes net income (loss) attributable to the convertible non-controlling interest is a useful and appropriate measure of performance. Furthermore, our income tax expense (benefit) has been, and we expect it will continue to be, a substantially non-cash item for the foreseeable future, generated from adjustments in our valuation allowance applied to the Company’s gross deferred tax assets. Convertible non-controlling interest is added back to adjusted pre-tax income because the underlying Cohen & Company, LLC equity units are convertible into Cohen & Company Inc. shares. Adjusted pre-tax income (loss) per diluted share is calculated by dividing adjusted pre-tax income (loss) by diluted shares outstanding, both of which include adjustments used in the corresponding calculation in accordance with GAAP. We present adjusted pre-tax income (loss) and related per diluted share amounts in this release because we consider them to be useful and appropriate supplemental measures of our performance. Adjusted pre-tax income (loss) and related per diluted share amounts help us to evaluate our performance without the effects of certain GAAP calculations that may not have a direct cash or recurring impact on our current operating performance. In addition, our management uses adjusted pre-tax income (loss) and related per diluted share amounts to evaluate the performance of our enterprise operations. Adjusted pre-tax income (loss) and related per diluted share amounts, as we define them, are not necessarily comparable to similarly named measures of other companies and may not be appropriate measures for performance relative to other companies. Adjusted pre-tax income (loss) should not be assessed in isolation from or construed as a substitute for net income (loss) attributable to Cohen & Company Inc. prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted pre-tax income (loss) is not intended to represent and should not be considered to be a more meaningful measure than, or an alternative to, measures of operating performance as determined in accordance with GAAP.

Earnings discussion via webcast scheduled for March 8, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of quarterly cash dividends by Oil-Dri Corporation signifies a continuation of the company's long-standing policy to return value to its shareholders. The consistency in dividend payments, particularly the annual increase for two decades, is indicative of a stable and potentially growing cash flow position. This consistency often serves as a signal to the market of the company's financial health and management's confidence in future earnings.Investors typically view such announcements positively, as they provide a direct income stream. However, it is crucial to analyze the dividend yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the price per share. A high yield relative to industry peers might indicate an undervalued stock, or conversely, a potential red flag if the company is stretching to maintain dividends at the expense of long-term growth or debt reduction. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Oil-Dri's announcement prior to their earnings report could be strategically timed to maintain investor interest and confidence, especially if the upcoming earnings report is expected to be mixed or below market expectations. The historical increase in dividends can be a cushion against negative market reactions to short-term earnings volatility.Additionally, the sector in which Oil-Dri operates, presumably the oil industry, is subject to cyclical trends and geopolitical influences that can impact profitability. Investors should be attentive to these factors, as they could affect future dividend sustainability. The company's performance relative to the broader market indices and sector-specific benchmarks will be critical for stakeholders to monitor. 03/06/2024 - 04:08 PM CHICAGO, March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Board of Directors of Oil-Dri Corporation of America (NYSE: ODC) today declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.29 per share of the Company’s Common Stock and $0.218 per share of the Company’s Class B Stock.

(CORZ) announces a multi-year contract with CoreWeave for up to 16 MW of data center infrastructure in Austin, TX, potentially generating over $100 million in revenue. The contract is expected to be accretive to earnings by 2024. Core Scientific's strategic move broadens its revenue model to include high-performance computing (HPC) alongside bitcoin mining. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The announcement of Core Scientific's multi-year contract with CoreWeave represents a strategic pivot towards diversifying its revenue streams beyond bitcoin mining. The focus on High-Performance Computing (HPC) and specialized GPU cloud services is a response to the growing demand for these technologies in fields such as artificial intelligence, scientific research and complex data analysis. The contract's potential revenue exceeding $100 million underscores the significance of this deal for Core Scientific.The expansion into HPC hosting leverages existing infrastructure and expertise, potentially increasing asset utilization and revenue per megawatt. This move can be seen as a hedge against the volatility of the cryptocurrency market, which has historically impacted companies involved in bitcoin mining. Diversifying into HPC may provide more stable and predictable revenue, which is often favored by investors.For stakeholders, the short-term benefits include the potential for increased earnings as early as 2024. In the long-term, Core Scientific's ability to flex its asset base and maximize revenue could enhance its market position. It's noteworthy that the company has managed to deliver a higher hash rate utilization than its peers, indicating operational efficiency that could translate well into their HPC endeavors. Financial Analyst The financial implications of Core Scientific's new contract with CoreWeave are multifaceted. With the contract valued at over $100 million, it is expected to be accretive to Core Scientific's earnings in 2024. This suggests a positive impact on the company's profitability and could lead to a favorable response from the stock market in anticipation of higher future earnings.Investors will likely scrutinize the company's capital expenditures associated with the expansion and how it plans to finance the 372 MW of bitcoin mining infrastructure expansion. The company's operational efficiency in bitcoin mining, as evidenced by its production exceeding that of other North American miners, may instill confidence in its ability to execute the expansion effectively.However, it's important to consider the risks associated with the HPC market, such as rapid technological changes and intense competition. Core Scientific's success will hinge on its ability to maintain high uptime, responsiveness and cost-efficiency. Their past performance in hosting CoreWeave's GPU hardware and the stated commitment to innovation and scaling high-value compute are positive indicators, but the execution of their growth plan will be key to realizing the potential benefits. Technology Industry Analyst The significance of Core Scientific's strategic move into HPC and GPU cloud compute is underscored by the industry's trajectory. HPC is crucial for solving complex scientific problems and specialized GPU cloud services are increasingly in demand for machine learning and other intensive computational tasks. Core Scientific's lease of a tier 3 data center, which provides redundancy and less than 1.6 hours of downtime annually, is indicative of the high standards required to support such workloads.The partnership with CoreWeave, a leading GPU cloud provider, also highlights the importance of strategic alliances in the tech industry. CoreWeave's emphasis on massive scale GPU compute resources aligns well with Core Scientific's infrastructure capabilities. This synergy could lead to enhanced service offerings and potentially attract other customers seeking similar compute solutions.It is also worth noting the strategic location of Core Scientific's data centers, which are situated in proximity to major metropolitan areas with access to high-bandwidth telecommunications infrastructure. This geographical positioning is critical for latency-sensitive applications that are typical in HPC and GPU cloud computing environments. 03/06/2024 - 04:10 PM Strategic extension of data center hosting business levers Core Scientific’s expertise in high value compute to broaden revenue model to customers engaged in rapidly growing High-Performance Computing (“HPC”) Core Scientific leases Austin, TX data center formerly housing Hewlett Packard; provides basis for potential growth opportunities with expanded infrastructure The Company expects this contract to be accretive to 2024 earnings AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Core Scientific, Inc. (Nasdaq: CORZ) (“Core Scientific” or “the Company”), a leader in bitcoin mining and digital infrastructure for emerging high-value compute, and CoreWeave, the leading specialized GPU cloud provider, today announced a multi-year contract for Core Scientific to supply up to 16 MW of data center infrastructure to CoreWeave. The total potential revenue associated with the contract is more than $100 million. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240306345567/en/Core Scientific is a leader in bitcoin mining and digital infrastructure for emerging high-value compute (Graphic: Core Scientific) Under the terms of the contract, Core Scientific will deliver up to 16 MW of capacity at its new Austin, TX data center to host CoreWeave’s infrastructure. Core Scientific is leasing a tier 3 data center in Austin that formerly housed Hewlett Packard to expand its hosting business to include HPC. “CoreWeave delivers massive scale GPU compute resources on top of the industry's fastest and most flexible infrastructure,” said Michael Intrator, CoreWeave CEO. “Our strong business relationship with Core Scientific is based on years of demonstrated responsiveness, high uptime data centers, professionalism and trust. Both companies share a core belief in accelerating innovation, which our collaboration will help to achieve in rapidly growing applications in AI and high-performance computing.” “At Core Scientific, we deploy our unique asset base strategically to achieve our mission: to accelerate digital innovation by scaling high-value compute rapidly, efficiently and responsibly,” said Core Scientific CEO, Adam Sullivan. “Our new data center in Austin will support CoreWeave’s near-term requirements while also expanding and diversifying Core Scientific’s hosting customer portfolio across two categories of high value compute: bitcoin mining and specialized GPU cloud compute. We look forward to exceeding CoreWeave’s expectations, helping them achieve their business objectives and exploring opportunities to expand our relationship in alignment with our infrastructure expansion plans.” Core Scientific hosted CoreWeave’s GPU processing hardware in its data centers from 2019 through 2022. Core Scientific operates more than 300 MW of energized infrastructure in proximity to major metropolitan areas and with access to high-bandwidth telecommunications infrastructure, both necessary requirements to support GPU cloud compute workloads. “We believe today’s Core Scientific has the valuable ability to flex our asset base in order to maximize revenue and earnings. Our diversified business model and leading scale enable us to continue operating as a low-cost bitcoin miner while also expanding our hosting customer base and diversifying our earnings streams,” added Sullivan. As of January 31, 2024, Core Scientific operated seven data centers in five U.S. states, most with minimum operating capacity of 100MW, for a total operating capacity of 724 MW. The Company’s stated growth plan calls for 372 MW of bitcoin mining infrastructure expansion at its two Texas data centers, equivalent to more than 20 exahash of mining capacity. Core Scientific’s self-mining business produced more bitcoin in 2021, 2022 and 2023 than any other listed bitcoin miner in North America. The Company consistently delivers higher hash rate utilization than the average for its North American peer group and for bitcoin miners at scale.

INOVIO reduced its 2023 operating expenses by 48% from 2022, ended 2023 with $145.3 million in cash, and projects cash runway into the second quarter of 2025. Financially, the company reported a decrease in R&D and G&A expenses for Q4 and full year 2023, with a net loss of $25.0 million for Q4 and $135.1 million for the full year. INOVIO effected a reverse stock split in January 2024 and estimates its cash runway to extend into the second quarter of 2025. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The announcement by INOVIO regarding its lead program, INO-3107, for the treatment of Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (RRP) is a significant milestone in the medical field, especially considering the Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA and the Orphan Drug Designation by the European Union. These designations not only expedite the review process but also highlight the unmet medical need for effective RRP treatments. The reduction in surgical interventions post-treatment, as indicated by the Phase 1/2 trial results, suggests a substantial improvement in patient quality of life and a potential decrease in long-term healthcare costs associated with RRP management. Furthermore, the immune response generated by INO-3107, evidenced by activated T cells, points to the underlying mechanism of action of the DNA medicine platform that INOVIO is harnessing. This could have broader implications for the company's pipeline, particularly for other HPV-related diseases and infectious diseases where cellular immunity plays a crucial role. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, INOVIO's strategic focus on advancing candidates with strong commercial potential is reflected in their operational highlights. The planned submission of a Biological License Application (BLA) under the FDA's accelerated approval program in the second half of 2024 for INO-3107 could lead to a faster path to market and revenue generation. The company's financial discipline is evident in the significant reduction of operating expenses by 48% from 2022, which, in conjunction with a cash runway into Q2 2025, provides a sound financial footing as they transition towards commercialization. However, investors should note the substantial decrease in revenue from 2022 to 2023, primarily due to the discontinuation of the COVID-19 vaccine candidate, INO-4800. This pivot highlights the company's strategy to concentrate resources on promising programs with a clearer path to commercial success. The collaboration with Coherus BioSciences for INO-3112's development further diversifies INOVIO's portfolio and may enhance investor confidence in the company's ability to bring multiple products to market. Market Research Analyst Looking at the market dynamics, INOVIO's progress in developing treatments for diseases with high unmet needs such as RRP and HPV-related throat cancer positions the company favorably in niche markets. The Orphan Drug and Breakthrough Therapy designations not only offer regulatory advantages but also marketing exclusivity benefits upon approval. This exclusivity can lead to a competitive edge in the market and potentially higher pricing power. The company's focus on commercialization readiness, including distribution, payor engagement and sales force design, is crucial for market penetration and uptake of their products upon approval. The positive Phase 1b results for INO-4201 as an Ebola vaccine booster also indicate potential for INOVIO in the infectious disease countermeasure market, which has received increased attention due to global health concerns. 03/06/2024 - 04:05 PM Announced substantial progress with lead program, INO-3107, as potential treatment for Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (RRP)Positive data announced from Phase 1/2 trialOrphan Drug Designation granted by European Union Breakthrough Therapy Designation granted by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)Received FDA feedback that data from completed Phase 1/2 trial can be used to submit Biological License Application (BLA) under accelerated approval programAnnounced plan to submit BLA to FDA under accelerated approval program in second half of 2024Announced clinical collaboration and supply agreement with Coherus BioSciences to advance development of INO-3112 in combination with LOQTORZI™ (toripalimab-tpzi)Combination therapy to be evaluated in a planned Phase 3 trial in patients with locoregionally advanced, high-risk, HPV-16/18-positive throat cancerClinical trial design submitted to FDA in first quarter 2024; feedback expected in second quarterReported positive Phase 1b results for INO-4201 as a potential Ebola booster vaccine for rVSV-ZEBOV (Ervebo®)Prioritized pipeline and reduced 2023 operating expenses by 48% from 2022Ended 2023 with $145.3 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investmentsProjects cash runway into second quarter 2025Management will host conference call today at 4:30 p.m. ETPLYMOUTH MEETING, Pa., March 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- INOVIO (NASDAQ:INO), a biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing DNA medicines to help treat and protect people from HPV-related diseases, cancer, and infectious diseases, today announced its financial results and operational highlights for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. INOVIO's President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Jacqueline Shea, said, ""The past year has been transformative as we've reshaped INOVIO into a company that is focused on commercializing its first product candidate and bringing the benefits of DNA medicine to patients. We've done so by focusing on the strengths of our platform and our strategic objectives: advancing candidates with scientific promise, achievable pathways to market, and strong commercial potential, and maintaining an ongoing commitment to financial discipline and operational excellence."" Dr. Shea continued, ""In the past year we have taken our lead candidate, INO-3107 for RRP, from positive Phase 1/2 trial results to Breakthrough Therapy designation and an established path to BLA submission under the FDA's accelerated approval program. We've also announced a new clinical collaboration and supply agreement with Coherus BioSciences to advance our development of INO-3112 in combination with LOQTORZI™ (toripalimab-tpzi) for throat cancer, shared encouraging results for INO-4201 as an Ebola vaccine booster, continued to advance other clinical-stage candidates, and progressed important preclinical research opportunities. The year ahead will provide a critical opportunity to carry this positive momentum forward across our pipeline, particularly for INO-3107 as we prepare for BLA submission and the initiation of a confirmatory trial in the second half of 2024 and accelerate commercialization efforts for a potential 2025 launch."" Operational Highlights INO-3107 – Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (RRP)INOVIO made significant progress with INO-3107 as a potential treatment for RRP. Key milestones included positive clinical results, regulatory progress, and the acceleration of commercialization efforts to be prepared to launch in 2025. INOVIO announced and published positive data from a completed Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating INO-3107 for the treatment of HPV-6 and HPV-11-related RRP in adults.In the trial, 81.3% (26/32) of patients had a decrease in surgical interventions in the year after INO-3107 administration compared to the year prior to treatment, including 28.1% (9/32) that required no surgical intervention during or after the dosing window.Patients in the trial had a median range of 4 surgeries (2-8) in the year prior to dosing. After dosing, there was a median decrease of 3 surgical interventions (95% confidence interval -3, -2).Prior to the outset of the trial (Day 0), patients had RRP tissue surgically removed, but any surgery performed after Day 0 during the dosing window was counted against the efficacy endpoint.Treatment with INO-3107 generated a strong immune response in the trial, inducing activated CD4 T cells and activated CD8 T cells with lytic potential. T-cell responses were also observed at Week 52, indicating a persistent cellular memory response.INO-3107 was well tolerated by participants in the trial, resulting in mostly low-grade (Grade 1) treatment-emergent adverse effects such as injection site pain and fatigue.This data was presented at the 103rd Annual Meeting of the American Broncho-Esophageal Association at the 2023 Combined Otolaryngology Spring Meetings in May 2023, and published in The Laryngoscope in June 2023.INOVIO announced its plans to submit its BLA for INO-3107 in the second half of 2024.Breakthrough Therapy designation was granted by the FDA in September 2023.FDA advised in October 2023 that INOVIO's completed Phase 1/2 trial could be used to submit its BLA under the accelerated approval program.European Commission granted Orphan Drug designation in May 2023, building upon the U.S. Orphan Drug designation granted by the FDA in 2020 and the CE marking issued by the European Union in 2018 to INOVIO's delivery device, CELLECTRA®.INOVIO has accelerated its commercialization strategy to support a product launch in 2025 if regulatory approval is obtained on the anticipated timeline.Plans underway include strategies for product distribution and logistics, payor engagement and reimbursement, specialty pharmacy identification, customer service programs, field force design, and other sales and marketing activities.Continuing to deepen its market understanding of RRP as a disease, including patient and healthcare provider needs.INO-3112 – Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OPSCC)In January 2024, INOVIO announced a clinical collaboration and supply agreement with Coherus BioSciences, Inc. to evaluate the combination of INO-3112 and LOQTORZI as a potential treatment for patients with locoregionally advanced, high-risk, HPV-16/18 positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), a type of head and neck cancer commonly known as throat cancer. Under the terms of the agreement, Coherus will provide LOQTORZI for a planned clinical trial at no cost to INOVIO. LOQTORZI is a PD-1 inhibitor recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of recurrent locally advanced/metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma.INO-3112 is a DNA medicine candidate targeting HPV-16/18 combined with a DNA plasmid for IL-12 as an immune activator.INOVIO has submitted the proposed design of a Phase 3 trial to the FDA with the intent to evaluate the clinical benefit of INO-3112 in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor. Feedback on the clinical development plan is expected in the second quarter of 2024. If cleared to proceed by the FDA, the trial will investigate if LOQTORZI can help boost the tumor-infiltrating abilities of the antigen-specific T cells generated by INO-3112.INO-4201 – Ebola Booster for rVSV-ZEBOV (Ervebo®)INOVIO announced results from a Phase 1b clinical trial in healthy adult participants who previously received a single injection of Ervebo. In the trial, INO-4201 was well tolerated and boosted humoral responses in 100% (36 of 36) of treated participants. INOVIO believes these data indicate that DNA medicines could be an important part of global medical countermeasures against infectious diseases, either as primary vaccines or boosters to existing vaccines. The FDA has provided feedback on a potential development pathway to licensure and INOVIO expects to finalize these plans and discuss with collaborators and potential partners in the first half of 2024. INO-5401 – Glioblastoma (GBM)INOVIO is finalizing its clinical study report from a Phase 1/2 trial of INO-5401 and INO-9012 in combination with Regeneron's PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo® (cemiplimab) in newly diagnosed GBM patients. The data from this trial showed encouraging median overall survival results from 52 patients and evidence of antigen-specific T cells that may infiltrate GBM tumors. Through 2023, patients involved in the trial continued to receive drug. In the first half of 2024, INOVIO expects to finalize next steps for further development of INO-5401 in conjunction with Regeneron and investigators.

Financial Analyst Analyzing Zymeworks Inc.'s reported cash resources of $456.3 million, the company appears to have a robust financial position with a cash runway extending into the second half of 2027. This projection is buoyed by anticipated regulatory milestone payments, which are critical in sustaining operations for clinical-stage biotech companies. The initiation of a rolling BLA for zanidatamab indicates a strategic move forward in the regulatory process, potentially enhancing the company's valuation upon approval. Furthermore, the increased enrollment in the HERIZON-GEA-01 trial to improve statistical power for the OS endpoint demonstrates a commitment to solidifying the drug's clinical evidence base, which could positively influence investor confidence and the company's stock performance. Medical Research Analyst The advancement of zanidatamab, a HER2-targeted bispecific antibody, into the rolling BLA phase for biliary tract cancers signifies a pivotal step in the drug's development pathway. The increased patient enrollment for the HERIZON-GEA-01 trial underscores the company's efforts to ensure robust clinical trial outcomes, particularly for overall survival, a key metric for oncology treatments. Additionally, the presentation of favorable data at international conferences, such as durable tumor responses and manageable safety profiles, is indicative of zanidatamab's therapeutic potential. The progression of Zymeworks' R&D programs, including two planned IND submissions, reflects a strategic pipeline expansion that could address unmet medical needs and drive long-term growth. Market Research Analyst The strategic research collaboration with Jazz Pharmaceuticals and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, along with the anticipated regulatory submissions in both the US and China, positions Zymeworks well within the global oncology market. The focus on HER2-expressing cancers, a domain with significant competitive interest, suggests potential for market penetration and future revenue streams, contingent upon successful clinical outcomes and regulatory approvals. Moreover, the company's presentation of five abstracts at the AACR Annual Meeting is expected to enhance its scientific credibility and visibility among potential collaborators and investors, potentially influencing market dynamics in the biotech sector. 03/06/2024 - 04:09 PM Reported $456.3 million in cash resources as of December 31, 2023, which when combined with certain anticipated regulatory milestone payments provides projected cash runway into 2H 2027Initiation of rolling biologics license application (BLA) filing with the FDA for zanidatamab as second-line treatment for biliary tract cancers (BTC) in the United States (US) with anticipated completion of regulatory submission in 1H 2024 by our partner, Jazz PharmaceuticalsInitiation of Phase 3 confirmatory trial for zanidatamab as first-line treatment in BTC by our partner Jazz PharmaceuticalsExpected submission of BLA for zanidatamab with the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in China for treatment of HER2-amplified inoperable and advanced or metastatic BTC in 2H 2024 by our partner BeiGeneTargeting HERIZON-GEA-01 pivotal Phase 3 readout in late 2024 and increased enrollment of patients to improve the statistical power for overall survival (OS) endpoint Two planned investigational new drug (IND) submissions or foreign equivalents in 2024 for ZW191 and ZW171Acceptance of five abstracts to be presented at American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) in April 2024 to highlight R&D pipelineWill host conference call with management today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zymeworks Inc. (Nasdaq: ZYME), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing a diverse pipeline of novel, multifunctional biotherapeutics to improve the standard of care for difficult-to-treat diseases, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, and provided a summary of recent business highlights. “We begin 2024 in a very strong position, with the initiation of the rolling BLA submission for zanidatamab in second-line BTC in the United States, and a projected cash runway to support the development of our expanded portfolio of clinical and preclinical product candidates into the second half of 2027,” said Kenneth Galbraith, Chair and Chief Executive Officer of Zymeworks. “We look ahead to a potentially transformative year for Zymeworks; both through potential upcoming regulatory approvals, and more broadly through executing on our development strategy for our early-stage product pipeline of antibody-drug conjugates and multispecific antibodies.” Galbraith continued, “We remain on track with our goal of completing two IND submissions this year, with multiple data catalysts highlighting the innovation within our pipeline. These IND submissions, along with additional planned submissions over the next two years, provide multiple opportunities for business development and collaborations. We remain committed to executing on our development strategy for our pipeline of unencumbered product candidates, all of which have the potential to improve the standard of care for patients in disease areas with high unmet need, and commercially attractive targets.” Recent Highlights and Current Developments Zanidatamab Continues to Advance with Multiple Catalysts In November 2023, our partner Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (“Jazz”) and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center announced a five-year strategic research collaboration agreement to evaluate zanidatamab, an investigational human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted bispecific antibody, in multiple HER2-expressing cancers.In December 2023, response rates in the HERIZON-BTC-01 Asian subgroup cohort were presented at the European Society of Medical Oncology Asia Conference, highlighting consistency across subgroups with durable tumor responses (overall response rate of 42% [95% CI: 28, 57], median duration of response 7.4 [3.9- Not Estimable] months) and a tolerable safety profile (no patients in the Asia subgroup experienced grade 4 or 5 treatment related adverse events).In December 2023, progression free survival (PFS) for zanidatamab in combination as chemotherapy-free regime was presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. Data from 51 patients with heavily pretreated HER2+/HR+ metastatic breast cancer who were treated with zanidatamab plus palbociclib and fulvestrant demonstrated a PFS at six months of 67% (n=34) [95% CI: 52, 79]. Secondary endpoint findings included a median PFS of 12 months [95% CI: 8, 15] and a confirmed objective response rate of 35% [95% CI: 21, 50] with a median duration of response of 15 months. The combination regimen was well tolerated with a manageable safety profile.In January 2024 at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Gastrointestinal (GI) Symposium, Patient-Reported Outcomes from HERIZON-BTC-01 demonstrate patients who responded to zanidatamab had less pain and pain interference compared to their baseline levels.In January 2024, our partner Jazz highlighted that for the HERIZON-GEA-01 trial, enrollment will be increased from 714 to 918 patients to improve the statistical power, for the OS endpoint only. This update allows Jazz to maintain the previously guided top-line readout, targeted for late 2024, which will continue to be based on the original enrollment numbers. Discussions with FDA and other regulatory agencies were held in advance of the decision to increase enrollment for the OS endpoint analysis. Jazz also announced that the rolling submission of the BLA submission for zanidatamab in second-line BTC has been initiated, with the intention of completing the BLA submission in the first half of 2024.In February 2024, our partner Jazz disclosed that they have initiated a Phase 3 confirmatory trial to evaluate zanidatamab as first-line treatment for patients with metastatic BTC.In February 2024, our partner BeiGene updated guidance on the expected timing of the BLA filing for zanidatamab with the NMPA for treatment of HER2-amplified inoperable and advanced or metastatic BTC in China during the second half of 2024. Progression of Research & Development Programs In February 2024, we published a manuscript in the American Association for Cancer Research Molecular Cancer Therapeutics Journal on the screening and selection process for our novel topoisomerase-1 inhibitor (“TOPO1i”) payload known as ZD06519. Our novel camptothecin analogue ZD06519 was selected based on its favorable properties as a free molecule and as an antibody conjugate, which include moderate free payload potency (~1 nM), low hydrophobicity, strong bystander activity, robust plasma stability, and high-monomeric antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) content. When conjugated to different antibodies using a clinically validated MC-GGFG-based linker, ZD06519 demonstrated impressive efficacy in multiple CDX models and noteworthy tolerability in healthy mice, rats, and non-human primates.Five abstracts accepted for presentation at the AACR Annual Meeting taking place April 5-10 in San Diego, CA. Abstracts accepted include two presentations from our multispecific antibody therapeutics (MSAT) program: DLL3 TriTCE Co-Stim: A next generation trispecific T-cell engager with integrated CD28 costimulation for the treatment of DLL3-expressing cancers (Abstract #6716)TriTCE Co-Stim: A next generation trispecific T-cell engager platform with integrated CD28 costimulation, engineered to improve responses in the treatment of solid tumors (Abstract #6719) and three presentations from our ADC program: ZW191 – a FRα-targeting antibody drug conjugate with strong preclinical activity across multiple FRα-expressing indications (Abstract #1862)Screening novel format antibodies to design bispecific ADCs that address target heterogeneity (Abstract #2052)Development of three-dimensional cancer cell line spheroid models for the in vitro functional characterization of cytotoxic antibody-drug conjugates (Abstract #3127) Zanidatamab zovodotin (ZW49) remains ready for a Phase 2 clinical trial, in combination with pembrolizumab, with the recommended Phase 2 dose of 2.5 mg/kg every three weeks. However, the initiation of the planned Phase 2 study has been deprioritized, pending more clarity from the evolving clinical landscape. We continue to explore potential development and commercial collaborations for zanidatamab zovodotin.On track to submit two IND or foreign equivalent submissions for ZW191 and ZW171 in 2024. “We have significantly accelerated the development timeline for our early stage ‘5 by 5’ programs, with four of the five IND candidates now nominated, the most recent being ZW251, our GPC3 targeting ADC being developed for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinomas,” stated Paul Moore, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer at Zymeworks. “We remain on track to accomplish our goal of submitting IND or foreign equivalent submissions in 2024 for both ZW191 and ZW171, in 2025 for ZW220 and ZW251, and to nominate our fifth IND candidate during 2024, with a planned IND filing in 1H 2026. We are also working on the next generation of ADC and MSATs beyond the ‘5 by 5’ portfolio, which we look forward to talking about in more detail later this year.” Business Updates & Corporate Developments Addition to the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (Nasdaq: NBI) effective prior to the market open on Monday, December 18, 2023.Completion of a securities purchase agreement with funds affiliated with EcoR1 Capital, LLC (“EcoR1 Capital”), for the sale of an aggregate of 5,086,521 pre-funded warrants to purchase 5,086,521 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.0001 per share.

Dr. Cesano succeeds Dr. Kenneth Hillan, who stepped down effective February 8, 2024 after a successful seven-year tenure as a director of Zymeworks.Appointment of Mr. Scott Platshon to the board of directors effective February 22, 2024. Scott Platshon is a Partner at EcoR1 Capital. Financial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2023 Revenue was $76.0 million in 2023 compared to $412.5 million in 2022. Revenue for 2023 included $71.5 million for development support and drug supply revenue from Jazz and $4.5 million from our other partners for research support and other payments. Revenue for 2022 included $375.0 million in upfront fees from Jazz, $24.3 million development support payments from Jazz, and a $5.0 million upfront fee from Atreca as well as $8.2 million in research support and other payments from our other partners. Research and development expense was $143.6 million in 2023 compared to $208.6 million in 2022. In 2023, research and development expense included a non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $2.4 million comprised of a $2.1 million expense from equity classified awards (2022 – $3.2 million expense) and a $0.3 million expense from the non-cash mark-to-market revaluation of certain historical liability classified awards (2022 - $0.8 million recovery). Excluding stock-based compensation and 2022 restructuring expense, research and development expense decreased on a non-GAAP basis by $59.3 million in 2023 compared to 2022. The decrease in research and development expense was primarily due to a decrease in expenses for zanidatamab as a result of transfer of this program to Jazz per our transfer agreement and amended and restated collaboration agreement with Jazz. This decrease, compared to 2022, was partially offset by an increase in preclinical expenses, primarily with respect to preclinical product candidates ZW171 and ZW191, and in higher zanidatamab zovodotin program costs, as a result of amendments to clinical development program agreements in 2022. In addition, salaries and benefits expenses decreased compared to the same period in 2022, due to lower headcount in 2023 and lower non-recurring severance expenses. General and administrative expense was $70.4 million in 2023 compared to $73.4 million in 2022. In 2023, general and administrative expense included a non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $5.3 million comprised of a $6.6 million expense from equity-classified awards (2022 – $4.1 million expense) and a $1.3 million recovery from the non-cash mark-to-market revaluation of certain historical liability-classified awards (2022 – $2.9 million recovery). Excluding stock-based compensation and 2022 restructuring expense, general and administrative expense decreased on a non-GAAP basis by $3.8 million in 2023 compared to 2022. The decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily due to a decrease in salaries and benefits expenses due to lower headcount and due to lower non-recurring severance expenses in 2023, as well as due to a decrease in expenses for professional services. This was partially offset by an increase in other expenses related to higher depreciation on facilities and higher technology spend in 2023. Other income, net increased by $14.1 million in 2023 compared to 2022. Other income, net for 2023 included $19.7 million of interest income partially offset by a $0.9 million in other expenses which includes foreign exchange losses partially offset by other miscellaneous income. Higher interest income in 2023 was due to income earned on higher cash resources and at higher rates of return in 2023. Other income, net for 2022 included $3.6 million of interest income and a net foreign exchange gain of $1.2 million primarily due to the revaluation of Canadian denominated items. Income tax expense decreased by $11.5 million in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to a reduction in U.S. taxes under the global intangible low-taxed income rules, in 2023. In 2023 we incurred a net loss compared to a net income in 2022, primarily due to the Jazz partnership. Net loss was $118.7 million in 2023 compared to net income of $124.3 million in 2022. Net loss in 2023 as opposed to net income in 2022 was primarily due to non-recurring upfront fee revenue from our collaboration agreement with Jazz in 2022, which was partially offset by higher collaboration revenue, lower operating expenses, higher interest income and lower income tax expenses in 2023. “We are happy to report a continued reduction of our operating cash burn and operating losses during 2023 compared to 2022,” said Chris Astle, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Zymeworks. “Our strategy of re-focusing the business and building a diverse clinical-stage product pipeline of ADCs and multispecific antibody therapeutics continues to provide a strong foundation, helping to achieve our long-term goal of identifying additional product candidates and seeking valuable partnership options, while also maintaining our cash runway.” As of December 31, 2023, we had $456.3 million of cash resources consisting of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, comprised of $157.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $298.7 million in marketable securities. For 2023, our cash used in operations was negatively impacted by working capital movements, primarily due to lower levels of payables as of December 31, 2023 compared to 2022. Based on current operating plans and receipt of certain anticipated regulatory milestones, we expect our existing cash resources as of December 31, 2023, when combined with certain anticipated regulatory milestone payments, will enable us to fund planned operations into the second half of 2027.

These non-GAAP financial measures are not defined by GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net loss, net loss per share or any other indicator of Zymeworks’ performance required to be reported under GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP or adjusted measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our adjusted measures as tools for comparison. Investors and others are encouraged to review Zymeworks’ financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. As defined by Zymeworks, adjusted expenses represent total research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses adjusted for non-cash stock-based compensation expenses for equity and liability classified equity instruments as well as expenses incurred in relation to the restructuring program completed in 2022. As defined by Zymeworks, adjusted net loss per share – Basic represents net loss per share – Basic adjusted for non-cash stock-based compensation expenses for equity and liability classified equity instruments on a per share basis as well as restructuring expenses incurred in relation to the restructuring program completed in 2022 on a per share basis, and adjusted net loss per share – Diluted represents net loss per share – Diluted adjusted for non-cash stock-based compensation expenses for equity and liability classified equity instruments on a per share basis as well as restructuring expenses incurred in relation to the restructuring program implemented in 2022 on a per share basis. As defined by Zymeworks, net operating cash burn represents net operating loss less cash used in the acquisition of property, equipment and intangible assets. Adjusted expenses and adjusted net loss per share (basic and diluted) are non-GAAP measures that Zymeworks believes may be helpful to investors because they provide consistency and comparability with past financial performance. Net operating cash burn is a non-GAAP measure that Zymeworks believes has been helpful to investors because it provided information about the cash resources used in funding our operations. As previously announced in our August 2023 earnings release, we are focused on our long-term cash resource plan to fund our operations, and due to available GAAP measures that convey similar information, we intend that the disclosure of our non-GAAP net operating cash burn included in this press release will be our last time reporting this information and will discontinue reporting of our non-GAAP net operating cash burn beginning with our results for the first quarter of 2024.

Non-GAAP Financial and Performance Measures Curaleaf reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP and uses a number of financial measures and ratios when assessing its results and measuring overall performance. Some of these financial measures and ratios are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. Curaleaf refers to certain non-GAAP financial measures and ratios, such as ""adjusted gross profit"", ""adjusted gross margin"", ""adjusted net loss from continuing operations attributable to Curaleaf Holdings, Inc."", ""adjusted net loss per share"", ""adjusted EBITDA"" and ""adjusted EBITDA margin"". These measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. The Company defines ""adjusted gross profit"" as gross profit net of cost of goods sold and related other add-backs. ""Adjusted gross margin"" is defined by Curaleaf as adjusted gross profit divided by total revenues. ""Adjusted net loss from continuing operations attributable to Curaleaf Holdings, Inc."" is defined by Curaleaf as net loss adjusted to remove the impact of discontinued operations and less other add-backs. ""Adjusted net loss per share"" is defined by Curaleaf as adjusted net loss from continuing operations attributable to Curaleaf Holdings, Inc. divided by the weighted average shares outstanding during the applicable period. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined by Curaleaf as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization less share-based compensation expense and other add-backs related to business development, acquisition, financing and reorganization costs. ""Adjusted EBITDA margin"" is defined by Curaleaf as adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. ""Free cash flow from operations"" is defined by Curaleaf as Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less the Purchases of property, plant and equipment, net of proceeds from disposals (i.e. net capital expenditures). Curaleaf considers these measures to be an important indicator of the financial strength and performance of our business. We believe the adjusted results presented provide relevant and useful information for investors, because they clarify our actual operating performance, make it easier to compare our results with those of other companies and allow investors to review performance in the same way as our management.

Adjusted gross profit from continuing operations net of add-backs for the fourth quarter was $160.4 million compared with $152.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted gross profit margin from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 46%, an increase of 80 basis points compared with the third quarter of 2023. The quarter-over-quarter increase in adjusted gross profit margin was due to an improvement in non-absorption costs partially offset by price compression and discounting.

Key highlights include improved outcomes in KRAS-mutant mCRC patients not exposed to bevacizumab, robust antitumor activity of onvansertib in RAS wild-type colorectal cancer, and promising synergies with paclitaxel in small cell lung cancer and carboplatin/gemcitabine in platinum-resistant ovarian carcinoma. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The recent findings from Cardiff Oncology highlight the potential of onvansertib, a Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) inhibitor, in improving treatment outcomes for various cancers. PLK1 is a protein that plays a crucial role in cell division and its inhibition can lead to the disruption of cancer cell proliferation. In KRAS-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), the combination of onvansertib with FOLFIRI/bevacizumab has shown to not only inhibit tumor growth but also to modulate the hypoxia pathway, which is critical for tumor survival and angiogenesis. This dual mechanism of action suggests a significant therapeutic advancement, considering the limited options available for Bev-naïve mCRC patients.Furthermore, the preclinical efficacy of onvansertib in combination with cetuximab for RAS wild-type colorectal cancer and with paclitaxel for small cell lung cancer (SCLC) indicates a broader clinical application. The robust antitumor activity in patient-derived xenograft models, including those resistant to standard therapies, is particularly promising. This could lead to new treatment paradigms in cancers that are notoriously difficult to treat, like SCLC. Medical Research Analyst Cardiff Oncology's strategic focus on PLK1 inhibition is validated by the compelling preclinical and early clinical data. The high objective response rates and progression-free survival observed in Bev-naïve patients suggest that onvansertib may address a significant unmet need in second-line treatment of KRAS-mutant mCRC. This has potential market implications, as the drug could become a preferred option in this setting, subject to further clinical validation and regulatory approval.Additionally, the potential of onvansertib in platinum-resistant high-grade ovarian carcinoma represents a noteworthy development. Platinum resistance is a major hurdle in ovarian cancer treatment and the preclinical data indicating enhanced efficacy of standard chemotherapeutics when combined with onvansertib could translate into a new hope for patients with limited treatment options. The tolerability of the combination is also a critical aspect, as it could lead to better patient compliance and outcomes. Market Research Analyst The oncology market is highly competitive and the success of new therapeutics depends on their efficacy, safety and ability to address gaps in existing treatment regimens. Cardiff Oncology's onvansertib represents a strategic entry into this market, targeting specific mutations and resistance mechanisms. The differentiation of onvansertib in terms of its dual action on tumor growth and the hypoxia pathway could position it favorably against competitors, especially if these preliminary findings translate into clinical success.The anticipation of these study results could influence Cardiff Oncology's stock performance, as investors often react to potential breakthroughs in cancer therapy. The specificity of onvansertib's mechanism also aligns with the industry's shift towards personalized medicine, potentially opening additional avenues for growth and collaboration in the biotechnology sector. 03/06/2024 - 04:05 PM SAN DIEGO, March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cardiff Oncology, Inc. (Nasdaq: CRDF), a clinical-stage biotechnology company leveraging PLK1 inhibition to develop novel therapies across a range of cancers, today announced publications of five abstracts that will be presented in a poster session at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting, taking place from April 5-10, 2024, in San Diego, California. “The posters we will be presenting at this year’s AACR meeting represent a broad view of the potential of onvansertib in several different cancer indications, including RAS-mutant mCRC, RAS-wild type mCRC, small cell lung cancer and ovarian cancer,” said Mark Erlander, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Cardiff Oncology. “In RAS-mutated mCRC, we are showing the underlying mechanism through which the combination of onvansertib and bevacizumab targets the hypoxia response pathway. We believe this mechanism explains the strong clinical results we have seen in both our Phase 1b/2 and ONSEMBLE second-line RAS-mutated mCRC clinical trials. The additional posters provide new insights and rationale for future clinical trials in other cancer indications.” Details on the posters and corresponding abstracts are shown below. Poster Title: A phase 1b/2 clinical study of onvansertib in combination with FOLFIRI/bevacizumab revealed a new role of PLK1 in regulating the hypoxia pathway in KRAS-mutant colorectal cancerSession Title: Microenvironment, Immunity, and DNA Repair in Therapeutic ResponseSession Date and Time: Monday Apr 8, 2024: 9:00 AM - 12:30 PM PTLocation: Poster Section 27, Poster Board #14, Abstract Number #2031 This abstract presents updated clinical data and biomarker analysis from the Phase 1b/2 study evaluating onvansertib in combination with FOLFIRI/bevacizumab for second-line treatment of KRAS-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. Analysis of patient baseline characteristics revealed superior clinical benefit in patients not exposed to bevacizumab in first-line treatment (Bev-naïve) compared to Bev-exposed patients. Bev-naive patients exhibited higher objective response rates (73.3% versus 15.7%) and longer median progression-free survival (14.9 versus 7.8 months) compared to Bev-exposed patients. Preclinical studies, using KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer mouse models revealed robust antitumor activity of onvansertib in combination with bevacizumab and a novel role of onvansertib in regulating tumor vascularization. Further preclinical investigations showed that PLK1 regulates the hypoxia pathway in KRAS-mutant CRC cells through the modulation of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha, HIF1α, emphasizing the potential crosstalk between PLK1 and angiogenesis. These findings reinforce the rationale for exploring onvansertib in combination with FOLFIRI/bevacizumab for Bev-naïve mCRC patients with KRAS mutation. Poster Title: The PLK1 inhibitor, onvansertib, is active as monotherapy and in combination with cetuximab in RAS wild-type colorectal cancer patient-derived xenograftsSession Title: Drug Resistance 2: Ras GTPaseSession Date and Time: Monday Apr 8, 2024: 9:00 AM - 12:30 PM PTLocation: Poster Section 24, Poster Board #12, Abstract Number #1934 This abstract focuses on the preclinical assessment of onvansertib’s antitumor activity in RAS wild-type colorectal cancer, as both a monotherapy and in combination with cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Employing patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, the study highlights the robust antitumor efficacy of onvansertib monotherapy, in cetuximab-sensitive and -resistant RAS wild-type colorectal cancer models. Furthermore, the combination of onvansertib and cetuximab was highly effective, resulting in tumor regression in 90% of the PDXs. These compelling data strongly support the clinical development of onvansertib as a potential treatment for RAS wild-type colorectal cancer. Poster Title: A phase 2, randomized, open-label study of onvansertib in combination with standard-of-care (SoC) versus SoC alone for first-line treatment of RAS-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer(mCRC)Session Title: Phase II and Phase III Clinical Trials in ProgressSession Date and Time: Tuesday, Apr 9, 2024: 1:30 PM - 5:00 PM PTLocation: Poster Section 50, Poster Board #5, Abstract Number #CT275 This abstract describes a clinical trial in progress. Poster Title: The PLK1 inhibitor, onvansertib, synergizes with paclitaxel in small cell lung cancerSession Title: Kinase and Phosphatase Inhibitors 1Session Date and Time: Sunday Apr 7, 2024: 1:30 PM - 5:00 PM PTLocation: Poster Section 25, Poster Board #16, Abstract Number #606 This abstract outlines preclinical studies showing the promising potential of combining onvansertib with paclitaxel for small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The research reveals significant synergy of the combination in SCLC cell lines and demonstrates its robust antitumor activity in patient-derived xenograft models, including models resistant to the standard therapy cisplatin. Further insights into the combination's mechanism of action will be presented. These findings support that combining onvansertib with paclitaxel could emerge as a highly promising treatment strategy for SCLC.

The company's ability to successfully navigate the regulatory landscape and bring Niyad™ to market could capture significant market share and generate substantial revenue. However, it's essential to analyze the competitive landscape, potential market size and reimbursement scenarios for the new therapy to fully understand the potential business impact of these developments. 03/06/2024 - 04:05 PM Company rebranding and corporate transformation to Talphera completed in Q1 2024 First patient enrollment in the NEPHRO CRRT registrational study expected in Q1 2024 with a projected PMA submission by the end of 2024 Cash and investments at December 31, 2023 of $9.4 million together with the royalty and equity financings completed in January 2024 expected to provide cash runway to a potential Niyad™ approval in Q2 2025 Conference call and webcast to be held Wednesday, March 6, 2024 at 4:30 pm ET SAN MATEO, Calif., March 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Talphera, Inc. (Nasdaq: TLPH), (""Talphera""), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for use in medically supervised settings, today announced fourth quarter 2023 financial results and provided a corporate update. ""We are excited about our company transformation to Talphera earlier this year. With the divestment of DSUVIA last year and priority focus on our new lead asset, Niyad, we expect a series of significant upcoming milestones. This transformation has generated new interest and investments in Talphera, which has provided us with the capital and commitments projected to support the development of Niyad through a potential FDA approval by the middle of next year,"" commented Vince Angotti, Chief Executive Officer of Talphera. ""With three decades of nafamostat use in Japan and South Korea, we are looking forward to having the first patient enrolled in the NEPHRO CRRT registrational study, which is expected in the coming weeks. Our priority this year is the successful completion of this trial and the submission of a PMA to the FDA by the end of 2024,"" Angotti continued. Fourth quarter 2023 and recent highlights In January of this year, the Company announced a corporate rebranding, changing its name from AcelRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to Talphera, Inc. (""Talphera""). The decision to rebrand was made following the divestment of assets indicated for acute pain and the shift in focus to its new lead asset, Niyad, reinforcing the Company's vision of developing and commercializing products to support healthcare providers in optimizing outcomes in medically supervised settings. Talphera began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under the ticker symbol ""TLPH"" on January 10, 2024.In January 2024, Talphera announced a total of $26 million in committed capital, including (i) $8 million from a partial monetization of DSUVIA royalties and milestones with Xoma Royalty, and (ii) $18 million in total equity from two existing investors structured as $6 million of equity issued at the first closing, $10 million of committed capital upon the announcement of positive NEPHRO registration trial data, and an additional $2 million commitment if Talphera stock trades above a specified price following that announcement.In December, Talphera hosted a Key Opinion Leader (KOL) panel discussion on Niyad (nafamostat) for use as an anticoagulant in dialysis circuits. The panel featured two thought-leaders in the nephrology and critical care fields, Laurence Busse M.D., M.B.A. (Emory University School of Medicine) and David W. Boldt, M.D. (UCLA Medical Center), who also were co-authors on a recently published market research study reporting current issues with anticoagulants in the dialysis circuit. These KOLs are also principal investigators in the NEPHRO study. To listen to a replay of the event, click here.Also in December, Talphera announced the publication in the journal Renal Failure of a quantitative market research study evaluating current U.S. physician anticoagulation use during continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in patients with acute kidney injury in the intensive care unit. In the study, a total of 150 U.S. board-certified physicians consisting of critical care medicine specialists and nephrologists who specialize in CRRT were queried about their current CRRT anticoagulation practices. The study resulted in a number of key findings related to physicians' concerns about currently available therapies, heparin and citrate, as well as the consequences resulting from use of no anticoagulation. The study, lead-authored by Dr. David Boldt, is entitled ""Anticoagulation Practices for Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy: A Survey of Physicians from the United States.""In October, Talphera announced the approval of a Niyad Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) by the FDA, allowing the Company to advance Niyad into a single registrational trial. This study – the NEPHRO CRRT study - will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Niyad to support a Premarket Approval application (PMA) projected to be submitted to the FDA by the end of 2024.Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Information The cash and cash equivalents balance was $9.4 million as of December 31, 2023. The senior debt with Oxford was fully repaid in the second quarter of 2023.Revenues of $0.3 million for the fourth quarter primarily represent the revenue earned on the sales of DSUVIA by Alora, principally driven by sales to the Department of Defense. Revenues in the prior period are included within the net loss from discontinued operations line item of the Statement of Operations.Combined R&D and SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 totaled $4.6 million compared to $5.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Excluding non-cash stock-based compensation expense, these amounts were $4.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $5.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease in combined R&D and SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 was primarily due to a reduction in business development and headcount-related expenses, partially offset by an increase in Niyad-related research and development costs.The divestment of DSUVIA represents a discontinued operation; accordingly, all historical operating results for the business are reflected within discontinued operations. For the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized net loss from continuing operations of $4.5 million. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized a net loss from continuing operations of $5.9 million.Net loss attributable to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $4.5 million, or $0.25 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $7.5 million, or $1.00 per basic and diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2022.Conference Call and Webcast Information Talphera will hold a conference call and webcast at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time/1:30 p.m. Pacific Standard Time to discuss the results and provide an update on the Company's business.

AIU Announces Receipt of NYSE Non-compliance Letter Regarding ADS Trading Price,2024-03-06T21:05:00.000Z,Low,Negative,Meta Data Limited (NYSE: AIU) received a letter from the NYSE stating non-compliance due to low trading price of ADSs. The company must raise share price above $1 within six months to avoid delisting.,"AIU Announces Receipt of NYSE Non-compliance Letter Regarding ADS Trading Price Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Meta Data Limited (NYSE: AIU) received a letter from the NYSE stating non-compliance due to low trading price of ADSs. The company must raise share price above $1 within six months to avoid delisting. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The notification received by Meta Data Limited from the NYSE regarding non-compliance due to its trading price is a critical financial event. This situation, often referred to as a 'below dollar' issue, is significant because it can affect investor perception, impact liquidity and potentially lead to delisting if not rectified. The six-month cure period is a grace interval allowing the company to address the issue, either through operational improvements that enhance investor confidence and share value or through a reverse stock split, which reduces the number of shares outstanding to increase the share price.From a financial perspective, the key metrics to monitor would be the company's performance indicators such as earnings, revenue growth and operational efficiency. These factors could provide insights into whether the share price decline is a temporary market reaction or indicative of deeper issues within the company. Moreover, the company's ability to maintain other listing requirements suggests that the 'below dollar' issue is isolated and may be resolved without further listing complications. Market Research Analyst Examining the broader market context is essential to understand the potential implications of Meta Data Limited's share price issue. The company's sector performance, competitive landscape and overall market trends could have contributed to the decline in share price. For instance, if the technology sector, in which Meta Data presumably operates, is experiencing a downturn, this may be a sector-wide challenge rather than a company-specific one.Additionally, investor sentiment towards small-cap or international companies, particularly in volatile market conditions, can lead to rapid sell-offs, driving down share prices. Understanding the market dynamics and investor behavior is crucial to anticipate whether Meta Data Limited's share price could recover within the stipulated timeframe. It is also important to consider the potential impact on the company's strategic partnerships, customer base and future financing opportunities if the share price remains depressed. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the NYSE's compliance rules serve to maintain market integrity and protect investors. The sub-dollar rule helps ensure that companies listed on the exchange maintain a minimum level of market capitalization and liquidity, which are important for the orderly trading of securities. Meta Data Limited's receipt of the non-compliance notice triggers disclosure obligations and may necessitate shareholder communication to explain the steps the company will take to address the issue.Furthermore, the company must be mindful of the legal implications if it fails to regain compliance, including the procedures for challenging a delisting decision. It is also important to consider the potential legal ramifications of any corporate action taken to increase the share price, such as a reverse stock split, which requires shareholder approval and could lead to legal challenges if not executed properly. 03/06/2024 - 04:05 PM Hong Kong, March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Meta Data Limited (NYSE: AIU) (“Meta Data” or the “Company”) today announced the Company has received a letter from the New York Stock Exchange (the ""NYSE"") dated March 4, 2024, notifying the Company that it is below compliance standards due to the trading price of AIU's American depositary shares (the ""ADSs""). Pursuant to NYSE rule 802.01C, a company will be considered to be below compliance standards if the average closing price of a security as reported on the consolidated tape is less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period. Once notified, the company must bring its share price and average share price back above $1.00 by six months following receipt of the notification. The company can regain compliance at any time during the six-month cure period if on the last trading day of any calendar month during the cure period the company has a closing share price of at least $1.00 and an average closing share price of at least $1.00 over the 30 trading-day period ending on the last trading day of that month. In the event that at the expiration of the six-month cure period, both a $1.00 closing share price on the last trading day of the cure period and a $1.00 average closing share price over the 30 trading-day period ending on the last trading day of the cure period are not attained, the NYSE will commence suspension and delisting procedures. The notice has no immediate impact on the listing of the Company’s ADSs, which will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE during the cure period subject to continued compliance with the other listing requirements of the NYSE.

What is the consequence of the share price falling below $1 for Meta Data Limited? If the share price remains below $1 for Meta Data Limited, the NYSE may commence suspension and delisting procedures after a six-month cure period. How can Meta Data Limited regain compliance with NYSE rules? Meta Data Limited can regain compliance by ensuring the share price and average share price are both above $1 over a 30 trading-day period before the end of the six-month cure period."

(SPIR) reports record revenue for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 with impressive growth and improved operating and net losses. The company focuses on providing space-based data and services, highlighting achievements in climate change and global security sectors. Positive Record revenue of $27.7M in Q4 and $105.7M for FY 2023, showing 32% YOY growth. Improved GAAP operating loss to ($8.2M) in Q4, 50% YOY improvement. Positive adjusted EBITDA of $2.1M in Q4, reflecting a $9.4M YOY improvement. Awarded contracts by NOAA, Lacuna Space, and EUMETSAT for significant data services. Guidance for Q1 2024 and FY 2024 includes revenue growth and focus on profitability. Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed to supplement GAAP results for investor understanding. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financials indicate significant year-over-year improvements in revenue growth, operating loss reduction and positive adjusted EBITDA, which are key indicators of Spire Global's operational efficiency and financial health. The company's focus on space-based data, analytics and services is particularly relevant given the increasing global emphasis on climate change and security. The impressive 32% revenue growth aligns with the company's target and reflects strong market demand for their offerings. Additionally, the transition from a GAAP operating loss to positive adjusted EBITDA suggests effective cost management and a potential path to profitability.Investors should note the positive cash flow from operations, which demonstrates the company's ability to generate sufficient cash to fund its operations without external financing. However, the negative free cash flow indicates ongoing investments, likely in capital expenditures or satellite launches, which are essential for future revenue streams but also suggest that the company is not yet self-sustaining in terms of its cash flow. The forward-looking guidance provided for 2024, with projected revenue growth and reduced non-GAAP operating losses, indicates management's confidence in continued growth and operational improvements. Market Research Analyst Spire Global's sustained revenue growth over ten consecutive quarters showcases the company's expanding market presence and the increasing applicability of its space-based data solutions in various industries. The company's strategic contracts with agencies like NOAA and EUMETSAT, as well as the launch of its High-Resolution Weather Forecast model, highlight its ability to secure high-value, long-term contracts that enhance forecasting accuracy and provide valuable data for climate research.The company's offerings are becoming increasingly relevant in today's data-driven economy, where timely and accurate data can significantly impact decision-making processes across sectors. The positive market reception, as evidenced by the contract awards and service expansions, underscores the potential for Spire's continued growth and the increasing reliance on space-based data services for both commercial and governmental applications. Legal Expert While the financial and market analysis provides insights into Spire Global's business performance and market position, it is also important to consider the regulatory landscape that the company operates within. The space industry is subject to complex regulatory environments, including compliance with domestic and international space laws, export controls and frequency spectrum regulations. Spire Global's ability to navigate these legal complexities, as evidenced by their contracts with NOAA and EUMETSAT, is crucial for their sustained growth and expansion.Furthermore, the company's use of non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow, provides additional lenses through which to evaluate its performance. However, investors should be aware of the limitations of these measures and the importance of also considering GAAP results to gain a comprehensive understanding of the company's financial health. 03/06/2024 - 04:05 PM Tenth consecutive quarter of record revenue; fourth quarter revenue of $27.7M; full year 2023 revenue growth of 32% Improved GAAP operating loss in fourth quarter to ($8.2M), 50% year-over-year (“YOY”) improvement, and lowered Non-GAAP operating loss1 to ($3.6M), 65% YOY improvement Improved net loss in fourth quarter to ($12.2M); 30% YOY improvement, and achieved positive adjusted EBITDA1 of $2.1M Achieved positive cash flow from operations of $4.1M and free cash flow1 of ($2.2M) during the fourth quarter VIENNA, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Spire Global, Inc. (NYSE: SPIR) (“Spire” or “the Company”), a leading provider of space-based data, analytics and space services, today announced results for its quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. The Company will hold a webcast at 5:00 pm ET today to discuss the results. ""Over the past quarter and throughout 2023, we continually demonstrated our ability to achieve our business objectives, fueling results that met or surpassed our expectations,” said Peter Platzer, Spire CEO. “The continued growth we see is driven by issues that impact all of humanity, such as climate change and global security. We are honored, and encouraged, to see businesses and organizations increasingly relying on our differentiated, highly valuable data to gain meaningful insights that help create a safer, more prosperous, and sustainable future on Earth."" “Spire achieved a strong finish to 2023 with positive cash flow from operations and positive adjusted EBITDA,” said Leo Basola, Spire CFO. “With a $9.2 million sequential improvement in cash flow from operations, and non-GAAP operating loss and adjusted EBITDA each exceeding the high end of our guidance range, the results for the quarter surpassed our expectations. As we focus on 2024, we expect to deliver positive free cash flow in the summer of 2024 and make progress towards refinancing our existing debt.” Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Highlights Financial: Fourth quarter 2023 revenue was $27.7 million, representing the 10th consecutive quarter of record revenue. Full year 2023 revenue was $105.7 million, representing 32% year-over-year growth, and meeting our objective of over 30% annual revenue growth. Fourth quarter 2023 U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) operating loss was $8.2 million, a 50% improvement year-over-year, and full year 2023 GAAP operating loss was $44.6 million, a 35% improvement. Fourth quarter 2023 non-GAAP operating loss was $3.6 million, a 65% improvement year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. Full year 2023 non-GAAP operating loss was $25.8 million, a 42% improvement year-over-year. We believe these results reflect strong execution on our path to profitability. Fourth quarter 2023 net loss was $12.2 million, a $5.3 million year-over-year improvement. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter 2023 was positive $2.1 million, a $9.4 million improvement year-over-year and over $1 million above the high end of our guidance range. Fourth quarter 2023 cash flow from operations was positive $4.1 million, a sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement of $9.2 million. Fourth quarter 2023 free cash flow was ($2.2) million, reflecting a $13.9 million sequential improvement quarter-over-quarter. 1 Non-GAAP Financial Measure, please see section titled Non-GAAP Financial Measures for the definition of such measures and the reconciliation tables at the end of this release for reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Business: In early January 2024, Spire was awarded $9.4 million by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to provide radio occultation (RO) data for an eight-month period. The near-real-time RO data provided by Spire will be used for NOAA’s operational weather forecasts, space weather models and climate research, among other applications. The Company’s RO data consists of vertical profiles of atmospheric measurements, including pressure, humidity and temperature across all points of the globe, including in the most remote regions and open oceans. During the fourth quarter, Spire announced it was awarded a Space Services contract by Lacuna Space, a leading satellite IoT connectivity provider. Under the agreement, Spire will initially build and launch six satellites carrying Lacuna Space’s payload and antenna, with the opportunity to scale the constellation to dozens of satellites. In December, Spire announced it was awarded a multi-million euro contract by EUMETSAT, Europe’s meteorological satellite agency, to provide RO data. The contract is for an initial period of two years, from 2024-2026, with three optional, one-year extensions. The award follows a successful pilot program, which demonstrated the benefits of Spire's RO data for weather forecasting accuracy and value. During the fourth quarter, Spire announced the launch of its High-Resolution Weather Forecast model, a differentiated regional high-resolution weather forecasting service. The solution provides precise and customizable weather forecasts extending up to six days, with the capability to be run at resolutions as fine as one kilometer, covering any point on the globe. Built upon seven years of research and development by Spire’s team of scientists and engineers, the High-Resolution Weather Forecast is powered by the Company’s proprietary RO technology, ocean wind and soil moisture data. Financial Outlook Spire is providing the following guidance for the first quarter 2024 and for the full year ending December 31, 2024: Q1'24 Ranges FY'24 Ranges Low High Low High Revenue (millions) $ 27.0 $ 29.0 $ 138.0 $ 148.0 Y/Y Growth 12 % 20 % 31 % 40 % Non-GAAP Operating Loss (millions) $ (8.0 ) $ (6.0 ) $ (5.5 ) $ 2.5 Adjusted EBITDA (millions) $ (2.0 ) $ 0.0 $ 13.0 $ 19.0 Non-GAAP (Loss) Income Per Share $ (0.36 ) $ (0.27 ) $ (0.24 ) $ 0.11 Basic Weighted Average Shares (millions) 22.0 22.0 22.5 22.5 The non-GAAP operating loss/income, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP loss/income per share included in the table above are non-GAAP measures. Please see the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for the definition of such measures. Spire has provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in the tables included in this press release for its fourth quarter and full year 2022 and 2023 results, as well as its outlook for such measures for the first quarter and full year 2024. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, this press release and the accompanying tables contain, and the conference call will contain, non-GAAP financial measures, including free cash flow, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margins, non-GAAP research and development, non-GAAP sales and marketing, non-GAAP general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating loss/income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net loss/income, and non-GAAP net loss/income per share. Spire’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes they are useful to investors, as a supplement to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, in evaluating its ongoing operational performance and trends and in comparing its financial measures with other companies in the same industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to help investors understand the operational performance of their businesses. However, it is important to note that the particular items Spire excludes from, or includes in, its non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the items excluded from, or included in, similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies in the same industry. In addition, other companies may utilize metrics that are not similar to Spire’s. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only and is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. There are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures since they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in Spire’s financial statements. Investors should note that the excluded items may have had, and may in the future have, a material impact on our reported financial results. Please see the reconciliation tables at the end of this release for the reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results. Management encourages investors and others to review Spire’s financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. Spire adjusts the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP financial measures: Loss on satellite deorbit, launch failure and decommissioning. Spire excludes loss on satellite deorbit, launch failure and decommissioning because if there was no loss, the expense would be accounted for as depreciation and would also be excluded as part of its EBITDA calculation. Change in fair value of warrant liabilities and contingent earnout liability. Spire excludes these items as they do not reflect the underlying cash flows or operational results of the business. Other (expense) income, net. Spire excludes other (expense) income, net because it includes unusual items that do not reflect the underlying operational results of its business. Examples of such expenses include prepayment penalties on outstanding debt and vendor dispute legal settlements. Stock-based compensation. Spire excludes stock-based compensation expenses primarily because they are non-cash expenses that it excludes from its internal management reporting processes. Spire also finds it useful to exclude these expenses when management assesses the appropriate level of various operating expenses and resource allocations when budgeting, planning, and forecasting future periods. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under FASB ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation, Spire believes excluding stock-based compensation expenses allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between its recurring core business operating results and those of other companies. Amortization of purchased intangibles. Spire incurs amortization expense for purchased intangible assets in connection with acquisitions of certain businesses and technologies. Amortization of intangible assets is a non-cash expense and is inconsistent in amount and frequency because it is significantly affected by the timing, size of acquisitions and the inherent subjective nature of purchase price allocations. Because these costs have already been incurred and cannot be recovered, and are non-cash expenses, Spire excludes these expenses for its internal management reporting processes. Spire's management also finds it useful to exclude these charges when assessing the appropriate level of various operating expenses and resource allocations when budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods. It is important to note that while this amortization expense is excluded for purposes of non-GAAP presentation, the revenue of the acquired businesses is reflected in the non-GAAP measures and that the assets contribute to revenue generation. Other acquisition accounting amortization. Spire incurs amortization expense for purchased data rights in connection with the acquisition of exactEarth and certain technologies. Amortization of this asset is a non-cash expense that can be significantly affected by the inherent subjective nature of the assigned value and useful life. Because this cost has already been incurred and cannot be recovered, and is a non-cash expense, Spire excludes this expense for its internal management reporting processes. Spire's management also finds it useful to exclude this charge when assessing the appropriate level of various operating expenses and resource allocations when budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods. It is important to note that while this expense is excluded for purposes of non-GAAP presentation, the revenue of the acquired companies is reflected in the non-GAAP measures and that the assets contribute to revenue generation. Mergers and acquisition related expenses. Spire excludes these expenses as they are transaction costs and expenses associated with the transaction that are generally infrequent in nature and not reflective of the underlying operational results of Spire’s business. Examples of these types of expenses include legal, accounting, regulatory, other consulting services, severance, and other employee costs. Loss on extinguishment of debt. Spire excludes this as it does not reflect the underlying cash flows or operational results of the business. Foreign exchange gain/loss. Spire is exposed to foreign currency gains or losses on outstanding foreign currency denominated receivables and payables related to certain customer sales agreements, product costs and other operating expenses. As Spire does not actively hedge these currency exposures, changes in the underlying currency rates relative to the U.S. dollar may result in realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses between the time these receivables and payables arise and the time that they are settled in cash. Since such realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses are the result of macro-economic factors and can vary significantly from one period to the next, Spire believes that exclusion of such realized and unrealized gains and losses is useful to management and investors in evaluating the performance of its ongoing operations on a period-to-period basis. Other unusual and infrequent costs. Spire excludes these as they are unusual items that do not reflect the ongoing operational results of its business. Examples of these types of expenses include accounting, legal and other professional fees associated with the preparation and filing of Spire’s September 2022 Form S-3 shelf registration statement and “at-the-market” offering prospectus supplement, and the December 2022 warrant exchange. Our additional non-GAAP measures include: Free Cash Flow. Spire defines free cash flow as net cash provided by/used in operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. EBITDA. Spire defines EBITDA as net income (loss), plus depreciation and amortization expense, plus interest expense, and plus the provision for (or minus benefit from) income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA. Spire defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted for loss on satellite deorbit, launch failure and decommissioning, change in fair value of warrant liabilities, change in fair value of contingent earnout liability, other (expense) income, net, stock-based compensation, loss on extinguishment of debt, foreign exchange gain/loss, other acquisition accounting amortization, mergers and acquisition related expenses, and other unusual costs. Spire believes Adjusted EBITDA can be useful in providing an understanding of the underlying results of operations and trends and an enhanced overall understanding of its financial performance and prospects for the future. While Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized measure under GAAP, management uses this financial measure to evaluate and forecast business performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income/loss as it does not take into account certain requirements, such as capital expenditures and related depreciation, principal and interest payments, and tax payments. Adjusted EBITDA is not a presentation made in accordance with GAAP, and Spire’s use of the term Adjusted EBITDA may vary from the use of similarly titled measures by others in its industry due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation. Conference Call Spire will webcast a conference call to discuss the results at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time today. The webcast will be available on Spire’s Investor Relations website at ir.spire.com. A replay of the call will be available on the site for three months.

Financial Analyst The reported fourth quarter net sales of $21.2 million and full year net sales of $83.6 million, representing a 16% year-over-year increase, indicate a solid revenue growth trajectory for ChromaDex Corp. The substantial improvement in gross margin to 61.0% and the achievement of positive Adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 million are particularly noteworthy, as they suggest enhanced profitability and operational efficiency. It's also significant that the company has maintained positive operating cash flows for four consecutive quarters, ending the year with a robust cash position of $27.3 million and no debt. These factors collectively suggest a strong financial position, which could potentially lead to increased investor confidence and a positive impact on the stock's valuation. Market Research Analyst Analyzing the company's product performance, Tru Niagen® has been a key revenue driver, with sales up by 16% to $69.5 million. This reflects not only the product's market acceptance but also the effectiveness of the company's marketing strategies. The introduction of the clinical strength Tru Niagen® Pro and the expansion of ChromaDex’s worldwide reach through platforms like iHerb, as well as the entry into the pet longevity category via partnership with Zesty Paws, could open new market segments and drive future sales. The positive outcomes from clinical studies published in peer-reviewed journals add credibility to Niagen® and could further enhance brand reputation and consumer trust, potentially influencing future sales and market share. Medical Research Analyst The clinical study findings published in 'Nature Communications' and 'Movement Disorders' journals indicating that Niagen® supplementation may improve conditions such as Ataxia Telangiectasia and Parkinson's Disease are significant. These studies could have implications for the company's product development and marketing strategies. If the findings lead to increased product demand or new applications for Niagen®, this could result in a long-term revenue stream for ChromaDex. Moreover, the continued investment in the ChromaDex External Research Program (CERP™) signals a commitment to scientific discovery that could yield additional health benefits of Niagen®, potentially expanding its use cases and consumer base. 03/06/2024 - 04:04 PM Fourth quarter net sales of $21.2 million, gross margin of 61.0%, and net income of $0.1 million. Full year net sales of $83.6 million, up 16% from the prior year, gross margin of 60.8%, net loss of only $4.9 million, positive Adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 million and positive operating cash flows. LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ChromaDex Corp. (NASDAQ:CDXC) today announced fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 financial results. Fourth Quarter 2023 and Recent Highlights Total net sales of $21.2 million, with $17.6 million from Tru Niagen®, up 1% and 9%, respectively, from the prior year quarter. Delivered strong gross margin of 61.0%, an increase of 380 basis points, compared to 57.2% from the prior year quarter. Achieved net income of $0.1 million, a $1.5 million improvement from a net loss of $1.4 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was a positive $1.2 million, a $0.9 million improvement from the prior year quarter. Maintained positive operating cash flows for a fourth consecutive quarter, ending with $27.3 million in cash and no debt. In October 2023, launched clinical strength Tru Niagen® Pro 1,000 mg, proven to elevate NAD+ levels by 150% in three weeks. In November 2023, phase II clinical study published in the peer-reviewed journal, Movement Disorders, found that supplementation with Niagen® increased whole blood NAD+ levels up to fourfold, improved coordination and eye movement while maintaining biomarkers of stable liver and kidney function in Ataxia Telangiectasia (AT) patients. In November 2023, clinical trial published in the peer-reviewed journal, Nature Communications, found that high-dosages of Niagen® induces a potent NAD+ response and is associated with mild improvement in Parkinson's Disease. Full Year 2023 Highlights Delivered on latest financial outlook to investors across all metrics, and exceeded targets for gross margin and general and administrative expense. Total net sales of $83.6 million, with $69.5 million from Tru Niagen®, each increasing 16% year-over-year. Gross margin of 60.8%, an improvement of 140 basis points from 59.4% in the prior year. Selling and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales improved 770 basis points year-over-year. General and administrative expense decreased $3.3 million year-over-year. Net loss of $4.9 million or $0.07 loss per share, an $11.6 million improvement, or $0.17 per share, year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was a positive $1.9 million, a $11.9 million improvement year-over-year. In August 2023, expanded ChromaDex’s worldwide reach launching Tru Niagen® on iHerb, a global destination for supplements. In October 2023, Zesty Paws, a prominent name in pet supplements, partnered with ChromaDex to launch a Healthy Aging NAD+ Precursor supplement for pets, featuring Niagen®. This partnership marks the entry into the longevity category for pets and extends the power of Niagen® to animal companions. ChromaDex External Research Program (CERP™) celebrated its 10th anniversary, signing more than 275 global research agreements with over 235 independent, expert investigators to uncover the full potential of NAD+ with Niagen®. This research has shown that the health benefits of Niagen® translate from preclinical models to human clinical studies for brain, heart and muscle health with remarkable consistency. Looking to the next 10 years, there is great anticipation for emerging benefits in sensory, infant, maternal and reproductive health to be translated from preclinical to human studies. “ChromaDex had its strongest year yet, achieving $83.6 million in revenue, up 16% year-over-year, with positive adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 million, and consistent positive operating cash flows each quarter. Additionally, the fourth quarter marked an important milestone with the company achieving positive net income,” said Rob Fried, ChromaDex Chief Executive Officer. “Ending the year with $27.3 million in cash and no debt underscores our financial strength. This solid foundation, paired with continued investments in our future, fuels our optimism as we set the stage for accelerated growth in 2024 and beyond. We're confident in our trajectory and excited about the new market opportunities ahead.” Results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year quarter ChromaDex reported net sales of $21.2 million, an increase of $0.2 million, or 1%. The increase was driven by a $1.5 million increase in Tru Niagen® sales, largely offset by a decline of $1.2 million in Niagen® ingredient sales since the prior year period included a $2.0 million upfront minimum purchase from Nestle Health Science. Gross margin percentage improved 380 basis points to 61.0%. The increase in gross margin percentage is largely attributable to a shift in business and customer mix and benefits from economies of scale. Operating expense decreased $0.4 million to $13.1 million driven by a reduction in general and administrative expense of $0.6 million and research and development of $0.1 million, partially offset by $0.3 million of higher selling and marketing expense. Delivered net income of $0.1 million, translating to $0.00 earnings per share, compared to a net loss of $1.4 million, or $0.02 loss per share in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was a positive of $1.2 million, a $0.9 million improvement from the fourth quarter of 2022. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year ChromaDex reported net sales of $83.6 million, an increase of $11.5 million, or 16%, driven by higher Tru Niagen® and ingredient sales of $9.4 million and $2.4 million, respectively, slightly offset by lower analytical and reference standards sales. Gross margin percentage improved by 140 basis points to 60.8% compared to 59.4% in the prior year. The increase in gross margin percentage is attributable to a shift in customer mix, supply chain management optimization efforts, and benefits from economies of scale. Operating expense decreased $5.0 million to $56.4 million driven by $3.3 million in lower general and administrative expense paired with a $1.9 million reduction in selling and marketing expense, partially offset by a slight increase in research and development expense. Net loss was $4.9 million, or $0.07 loss per share, compared to a net loss of $16.5 million, or $0.24 loss per share, in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was a positive $1.9 million, an improvement of $11.9 million from the prior year. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Net cash inflow from operating activities was $7.1 million, showing a significant improvement compared to a net cash outflow of $15.1 million in the prior year. This increase is largely due to improvements in net loss of $11.6 million and positive impacts from changes in working capital. ChromaDex ended fiscal year 2023 with $27.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and no debt. 2024 Outlook Looking forward, for the full year, the Company expects the trajectory of revenue growth to continue, projecting a higher rate of revenue growth than the prior year growth of 16%. This outlook assumes continued revenue growth through our e-commerce business as well as established partnerships, and assumes upside from opportunities with new partnerships, channels, and products. The Company projects that gross margin will improve slightly year-over-year driven by continued supply chain optimization efforts and cost savings, along with overall scale. Moreover, selling and marketing expense will increase in absolute dollars but remain stable as a percentage of net sales, as the Company continues to make focused investments to drive brand awareness and support new market launches, while maintaining efficiency. The Company plans to increase investments in research and development to drive future innovation and expects an increase in general and administrative expense of $1.5 million - $2.5 million to support growth.

ChromaDex believes the presentation of such non-GAAP financial measure provides important supplemental information to management and investors and enhances the overall understanding of the Company’s historical and current financial operating performance. The Company believes disclosure of the non-GAAP financial measure has substance because the excluded expenses are infrequent in nature, are variable in nature or do not represent current cash expenditures. Further, such non-GAAP financial measure is among the indicators the Company uses as a basis for evaluating the Company’s financial performance as well as for planning and forecasting purposes. Accordingly, disclosure of this non-GAAP financial measure provides investors with the same information that management uses to understand the Company’s economic performance year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before (a) interest, (b) depreciation, (c) amortization, (d) non-cash share-based compensation costs, (e) severance and restructuring expense and (f) Other income from the Employee Retention Tax Credit. While ChromaDex believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of such measure. This measure is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the method of calculation. Management compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Company’s GAAP results and by using Adjusted EBITDA only supplementally and by reviewing the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to its most comparable GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measure is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with the company’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Reiterated full-year 2024 revenue guidance of $197.0 million to $200.0 million, projecting 32% to 34% growth compared to 2023. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in OrthoPediatrics Corp.'s full-year revenue by 22% signifies a robust performance in the pediatric orthopedics market. This growth trajectory, particularly in the domestic market, suggests a strong demand for the company's specialized products. The 20% and 26% upticks in domestic and international revenue, respectively, indicate successful market penetration and potential for global expansion.The record adjusted EBITDA of $5.0 million, a substantial rise from the previous year's $0.2 million, reflects improved operational efficiency and cost management. This is a critical metric for investors as it demonstrates the company's ability to generate profit while managing expenses. It's also noteworthy that the gross profit margin improved slightly, which could be attributed to a strategic shift in sales or improved cost structures. The balance sheet has been strengthened with $80 million in debt financing, which could support future growth but also adds leverage that needs to be monitored. Medical Device Market Analyst OrthoPediatrics' launch of 8 new products in 2023, including innovative systems like the RESPONSE™ Power Scoliosis System, indicates a commitment to maintaining a competitive edge through R&D. This strategy can contribute to sustained growth as new products often carry higher margins and can drive market share gains. The acquisition of Boston Orthotics & Prosthetics is a strategic move, diversifying the company's portfolio and potentially opening new revenue streams through its pediatric orthotics management business.However, the segment-specific performance, with Trauma and Deformity outperforming Scoliosis internationally, suggests varying growth rates across product lines. This could imply the need for targeted strategies in different regions and product categories. The company's guidance for 2024 forecasts significant revenue growth, which may reflect confidence in their product pipeline and market strategy but should be viewed with cautious optimism by stakeholders. Healthcare Industry Economist The financial results of OrthoPediatrics underscore the economic implications of specializing in niche medical markets like pediatric orthopedics. The company's ability to nearly double its adjusted EBITDA margin indicates not only a growing market but also an effective response to the economic challenges of scaling up operations in a specialized field. The investment in R&D, product development and strategic acquisitions could be seen as a long-term economic investment in maintaining a competitive advantage in a healthcare sector that may have lower price sensitivity due to the specialized nature of the products.However, the increased operating expenses highlight the economic trade-offs associated with expansion. While necessary for growth, they must be carefully balanced against revenue growth to ensure long-term financial sustainability. The forward-looking revenue guidance suggests an optimistic economic outlook for the company, though it must be aware of broader economic conditions that could affect hospital budgets and, consequently, demand for medical devices. 03/06/2024 - 04:05 PM Record full year 2023 revenue of $148.7 million increased 22% compared to prior yearWARSAW, Ind., March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OrthoPediatrics Corp.

Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial ResultsTotal revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $37.6 million, a 21% increase compared to $31.0 million for the same period last year. The increase in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 was driven primarily by growth across Global Trauma and Deformity, Domestic Scoliosis, and OPSB, offset by lower growth in International Scoliosis. U.S. revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $28.3 million, a 24% increase compared to $22.7 million for the same period last year, representing 75% of total revenue. The increase in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 was driven primarily by growth across Trauma and Deformity, Scoliosis, and OPSB. International revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $9.4 million, a 13% increase compared to $8.3 million for the same period last year, representing 25% of total revenue. Growth in the quarter was primarily driven by Trauma and Deformity, offset by lower Scoliosis sales to stocking distributors in South America. Total revenue for the full year 2023 was $148.7 million, a 22% increase compared to $122.3 million in 2022. Full year U.S. revenue was $111.0 million, a 20% increase compared to $92.4 million in 2022, representing 75% of total revenue. International revenue for the full year 2023 was $37.7 million, a 26% increase compared to $29.9 million in 2022, representing 25% of total revenue. Trauma and Deformity revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $27.1 million, a 23% increase compared to $22.1 million for the same period last year. Revenue was driven by growth from Pega products, Trauma, Ex-Fix, and OPSB. Scoliosis revenue was $9.7 million, a 20% increase compared to $8.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Scoliosis growth was driven primarily by increased U.S. growth across the Response and ApiFix non-fusion system, partially offset by cancelled cases from late December RSV infections and lower than expected orders in Latin and South America. Sports Medicine/Other revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $0.9 million, compared to $0.9 million for the same period last year. Trauma and Deformity revenue for the full year 2023 was $106.8 million, a 26% increase compared to $85.1 million in 2022.

The slight increase in gross profit margin was driven primarily by lower set sales to international stocking distributors. Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $34.8 million, a $5.2 million increase compared to $29.5 million for the same period last year. Full year operating expenses were $138.0 million, a 19% increase compared to $116.1 million in 2022. The increase was mainly driven by volume of units sold, increased volume related commission, as well as incremental personnel required to support the growth of the company. Sales and marketing expenses increased $1.5 million, or 14%, to $12.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. For the full year 2023, sales and marketing expense increased $6.3 million, or 14%, to $51.4 million. The increase was primarily driven by increased sales commission expenses. General and administrative expenses increased $3.0 million, or 18%, to $19.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. For the full year 2023, general and administrative expense increased $16.0 million, or 27%, to $75.4 million. The fourth quarter and full year increases were driven primarily by the addition of personnel and resources to support the continued expansion of the business and an increase in depreciation and amortization. Total other income was $1.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $0.4 million for the same period last year, and was $5.4 million for 2023 compared to $21.7 million for 2022.

Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond OrthoPediatrics’ control. Important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including, among others: the risks related to COVID-19, the impact such pandemic may have on the demand for our products, and our ability to respond to the related challenges; and the risks, uncertainties and factors set forth under ""Risk Factors"" in OrthoPediatrics’ Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 1, 2023, as updated and supplemented by our other SEC reports filed from time to time. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. OrthoPediatrics assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, subsequent events, or circumstances or other changes affecting such statements except to the extent required by applicable securities laws. Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThis press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted diluted (loss) earnings per share and Adjusted EBITDA, which differ from financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Adjusted loss per share in this press release represents diluted (loss) earnings per share on a GAAP basis, plus the accreted interest attributable to acquisition installment payables, the fair value adjustment of contingent consideration, trademark impairment, acquisition related costs, non-recurring Pega conversion fees, and minimum purchase commitment costs. The fair value adjustment of contingent consideration is associated with our estimates of the value of earn-outs in connection with certain acquisitions. We believe that providing the non-GAAP diluted (loss) earnings per share excluding these expenses, as well as the GAAP measures, assists our investors because such expenses are not reflective of our ongoing operating results. Adjusted EBITDA in this release represents net loss (income), plus interest expense, net plus other expense, provision for income taxes (benefit), depreciation and amortization, trademark impairment, stock-based compensation expense, fair value adjustment of contingent consideration, acquisition related costs, nonrecurring Pega conversion fees, and the cost of minimum purchase commitments. The Company believes the non-GAAP measures provided in this earnings release enable it to further and more consistently analyze the period-to-period financial performance of its core business operating performance. Management uses these metrics as a measure of the Company’s operating performance and for planning purposes, including financial projections. The Company believes these measures are useful to investors as supplemental information because they are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in its industry. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to, or superior to, net income or loss as a measure of financial performance or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, and it should not be construed to imply that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. In addition, the measure is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management’s discretionary use, as it does not reflect certain cash requirements such as debt service requirements, capital expenditures and other cash costs that may recur in the future. Adjusted EBITDA contains certain other limitations, including the failure to reflect our cash expenditures, cash requirements for working capital needs and other potential cash requirements. In evaluating these non-GAAP measures, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. The Company’s presentation of non-GAAP diluted (loss) earnings per share or Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that its future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on the Company’s GAAP results in addition to using these adjusted measures on a supplemental basis. The Company’s definition of these measures is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation. The schedules below contain reconciliations of reported GAAP diluted (loss) earnings per share to non-GAAP diluted (loss) earnings and net (loss) income to non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA.

The Company reduced its development program to two drilling rigs and one frac crew for 2024. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported financial and operating results of HighPeak Energy, Inc. indicate a substantial growth trajectory, particularly noting the 86% year-over-year production increase and the surpassing of $1 billion in revenues for 2023. Such performance metrics are vital for investors as they reflect the company's operational efficiency and market positioning. The 34% increase in sales volumes, with a composition of 81% crude oil and 92% liquids, underscores a strong product mix that aligns well with current market demands for energy resources.Furthermore, the establishment of a $100 million super priority revolving credit facility and the increase in net acreage position through acquisitions demonstrate strategic capital management and expansion efforts. These moves are likely to provide HighPeak with additional liquidity and the capability to leverage its increased acreage for future production growth, which could be appealing to investors seeking companies with robust expansion strategies.HighPeak's 2024 guidance, with an emphasis on capital discipline and free cash flow generation, signals a mature approach to growth that prioritizes shareholder value. This is further supported by the announcement of a 60% increase in quarterly dividends and a share repurchase authorization, actions that typically resonate positively with the stock market as they directly impact shareholder returns. Financial Analyst The financial results, including a net income of $95.0 million and EBITDAX of $241.6 million for the fourth quarter, reflect strong profitability and operational cash flow. The company's cash operating margin of $54.27 per Boe, representing 83% of the average realized price per Boe, is indicative of a healthy margin that can support future growth and investor returns. It is also important to note the company's hedging strategy, which includes a mix of swaps, collars and puts, aimed at managing price volatility and providing some predictability to cash flows, a prudent approach given the historically volatile nature of commodity prices.Investors would also be interested in the reserve replacement ratio of 295%, which suggests that HighPeak is replacing its produced reserves at nearly three times its production rate. This is a strong indicator of sustainability and potential for long-term growth. The reported PV-10 value of approximately $2.9 billion provides a measure of the present value of the company's proven reserves, which is a critical metric for assessing the financial health and future prospects of an energy company. Energy Sector Analyst HighPeak Energy's operational update and development outlook provide significant insights into the company's strategic direction and operational capabilities within the energy sector. The planned average production rate of 43,000 – 47,000 Boe/d for 2024 and the capital expenditure forecast, offer a clear picture of the company's production and investment strategies. The focus on maintaining a disciplined capital budget of $500 - $585 million, while ensuring operational efficiency, is likely to be well-received by stakeholders who are increasingly looking for companies that balance growth with financial prudence.The reference to geopolitical risks and the dynamic nature of the global economy suggests that HighPeak is aware of external factors that could impact its operations. The flexibility to adjust development activity in response to these factors is a testament to the company's agile approach to business strategy. Additionally, the mention of strategic alternatives being pursued with the assistance of Texas Capital Securities and Wells Fargo Securities could imply potential mergers, acquisitions, or other transactions that may significantly influence the company's future trajectory and investor sentiment. 03/06/2024 - 04:02 PM FORT WORTH, Texas, March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HighPeak Energy, Inc. (“HighPeak” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: HPK) today announced financial and operating results for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition, HighPeak provided its 2024 guidance and capital budget, as approved by its Board of Directors. HighlightsFourth Quarter 2023 The Company surpassed the milestone of $1 billion in revenues in 2023 and generated free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure defined and reconciled below) of $33.7 million in the fourth quarter.Sales volumes, consisting of 81% crude oil and 92% liquids, averaged 50.0 thousand barrels of crude oil equivalent per day (“MBoe/d”), representing a 34% increase over fourth quarter 2022. Volumes were approximately 3,300 Boe/d lower than expected due to weather and unscheduled midstream maintenance interruptions.Net income and EBITDAX (a non-GAAP financial measure defined and reconciled below) were $95.0 million and $241.6 million, respectively.The Company significantly increased its net acreage position to approximately 132,000 total net acres primarily through acquisitions in northern Flat Top, where production profiles in the Wolfcamp A and Lower Spraberry zones are expected to resemble its core Flat Top operating area.Realized price averaged $65.53 per Boe, or 83% of the weighted average of NYMEX WTI crude oil prices, excluding the effects of derivatives.Cash operating margin averaged $54.27 per Boe, or 83% of the average realized price per Boe, excluding the effects of derivatives.On November 1st, the Company completed a $100 million super priority revolving credit facility with $75.0 million of initial commitments, which provides the Company with additional liquidity and flexibility. The facility matures in September 2026, simultaneous with the Company’s $1.2 billion term loan. Recent Events On February 5, 2024, the Company announced both a 60% increase to its quarterly dividend, from $.025 to $0.04 per common share outstanding, and a share repurchase authorization of up to $75.0 million of common stock. HighPeak Chairman and CEO, Jack Hightower, said, “2023 was a transformational year for HighPeak and we are continuing to carry positive momentum into 2024. We were within the range on our annual production and budget guides while growing our production 86% year over year, which is a testament to the quality of our asset base and the caliber of our operations team. In 2024, now that HighPeak is an established player in the Permian, our focus shifts to a steadfast commitment of maintaining capital discipline, generating free cash flow and returning value to shareholders. In addition, we have engaged Texas Capital Securities and Wells Fargo Securities to assist us in our pursuit of strategic alternatives. In a market landscape where oily, high-margin production and premier inventory are being pursued aggressively, we consider ourselves extremely fortunate to possess assets that meet these criteria.” 2024 Development Outlook The Company expects to average two (2) drilling rigs and one (1) frac crew during 2024 under its current development plan, assuming commodity prices and capital costs continue to stay in their current ranges. Given the dynamic nature of the global economy and current geopolitical risks, the Company will remain flexible to increase or decrease its development activity as merited.

Fourth quarter sales volumes consisted of approximately 81% crude oil and 92% liquids. Full-year 2023 sales volumes averaged 45.6 thousand Boe/d, an 86% increase over 2022 sales volumes. The Company averaged three drilling rigs and one and a half frac crews during the fourth quarter, drilled 18 gross (17.9 net) horizontal wells and completed 24 gross (23.8 net) operated producing wells. At December 31, 2023, the Company had 22 gross (22.0 net) operated horizontal wells in various stages of drilling and completion. In February 2024, the Company reduced its development drilling program to two drilling rigs and is currently running one frac crew and may add a second frac crew periodically throughout the year as needed. HighPeak President, Michael Hollis, commented, “Our 2024 capital budget will be slightly front half weighted as we carried in a higher cadence of activity from 2023. Our infrastructure budget this year includes the expansion of our current system to reach wells drilled on newly acquired acreage. The infrastructure spend in future years is expected to trend downward to approximately half of this year’s budgeted amount. This year, HighPeak Energy is laser-focused on our commitment to capital and operational efficiency. We are working diligently to reduce both operating and capital costs, resulting in even greater free cash flow generation which is essential for achieving our corporate objectives of funding our operations through cash flow, paying down debt, and returning value to our shareholders. As we move forward, we are committed to navigating this landscape with unwavering capital discipline.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results HighPeak reported net income of $95.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, or $0.66 per diluted share, and EBITDAX of $241.6 million, or $1.68 per diluted share. Fourth quarter average realized prices were $79.24 per barrel (“$/Bbl”) of crude oil, $19.93 per barrel of NGL and $1.51 per Mcf of natural gas, resulting in an overall realized price of $65.53 per Boe, or 83% of the weighted average of NYMEX crude oil prices, excluding the effects of derivatives.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements The information in this press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. When used in this document, the words “believes,” “plans,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “forecasts,” “intends,” “continue,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “future,” “potential,” “estimate” or the negative of such terms and similar expressions as they relate to HighPeak Energy, Inc. (“HighPeak Energy,” the “Company” or the “Successor”) are intended to identify forward-looking statements, which are generally not historical in nature. The forward-looking statements are based on the Company's current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about the Company and the industry in which the Company operates. Although the Company believes that the expectations and assumptions reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made, they involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, in many cases, beyond the Company's control. For example, the Company’s review of strategic alternatives may not result in a sale of the Company, a recommendation that a transaction occur or result in a completed transaction, and any transaction that occurs may not increase shareholder value, in each case as a result of such risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, among other things, the results of the strategic review being undertaken by the Company’s Board and the interest of prospective counterparties, the Company’s ability to realize the results contemplated by its 2024 guidance, volatility of commodity prices, product supply and demand, the impact of a widespread outbreak of an illness, such as the coronavirus disease pandemic, on global and U.S. economic activity, competition, the ability to obtain environmental and other permits and the timing thereof, other government regulation or action, the ability to obtain approvals from third parties and negotiate agreements with third parties on mutually acceptable terms, litigation, the costs and results of drilling and operations, availability of equipment, services, resources and personnel required to perform the Company's drilling and operating activities, access to and availability of transportation, processing, fractionation, refining and storage facilities, HighPeak Energy's ability to replace reserves, implement its business plans or complete its development activities as scheduled, access to and cost of capital, the financial strength of counterparties to any credit facility and derivative contracts entered into by HighPeak Energy, if any, and purchasers of HighPeak Energy's oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production, uncertainties about estimates of reserves, identification of drilling locations and the ability to add proved reserves in the future, the assumptions underlying forecasts, including forecasts of production, expenses, cash flow from sales of oil and gas and tax rates, quality of technical data, environmental and weather risks, including the possible impacts of climate change, cybersecurity risks and acts of war or terrorism. These and other risks are described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K and other filings with the SEC. The Company undertakes no duty to publicly update these statements except as required by law. Reserve engineering is a process of estimating underground accumulations of hydrocarbons that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data, the interpretation of such data and price and cost assumptions made by reserve engineers. Reserves estimates included herein may not be indicative of the level of reserves or PV-10 value of oil and natural gas production in the future, as they are based on 2023 SEC prices which are different than current commodity prices. In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production activities may justify revisions of estimates that were made previously. If significant, such revisions could impact HighPeak’s strategy and change the schedule of any further production and development drilling. Accordingly, reserve estimates may differ significantly from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. Use of Projections The financial, operational, industry and market projections, estimates and targets in this press release and in the Company’s guidance (including production, operating expenses and capital expenditures in future periods) are based on assumptions that are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the Company’s control. The assumptions and estimates underlying the projected, expected or target results are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic, regulatory and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the financial, operational, industry and market projections, estimates and targets, including assumptions, risks and uncertainties described in “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” above. These projections are speculative by their nature and, accordingly, are subject to significant risk of not being actually realized by the Company. Projected results of the Company for 2024 are particularly speculative and subject to change. Actual results may vary materially from the current projections, including for reasons beyond the Company’s control. The projections are based on current expectations and available information as of the date of this release. The Company undertakes no duty to publicly update these projections except as required by law. Drilling Locations The Company has estimated its drilling locations based on well spacing assumptions and upon the evaluation of its drilling results and those of other operators in its area, combined with its interpretation of available geologic and engineering data. The drilling locations actually drilled on the Company’s properties will depend on the availability of capital, regulatory approvals, commodity prices, costs, actual drilling results and other factors. Any drilling activities conducted on these identified locations may not be successful and may not result in additional proved reserves. Further, to the extent the drilling locations are associated with acreage that expires, the Company would lose its right to develop the related locations.

Financial Analyst An examination of AudioEye's reported financial results reveals several key indicators of financial health and operational efficiency that are pertinent to investors and analysts. The reported 32nd consecutive period of record revenue is a significant milestone, demonstrating the company's consistent top-line growth. This is further corroborated by a year-over-year increase in total revenue and gross profit margin, which are critical metrics for evaluating a company's profitability and scalability.Moreover, the improvement in net loss and a positive adjusted EBITDA suggest a strong turnaround in profitability, which could signal a positive trajectory for future earnings. The company's ability to reduce operating expenses by 16% while still achieving revenue growth is indicative of operational efficiency gains, which are often rewarded by the market. The increase in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) also points to a sustainable revenue model, which is a key factor in the valuation of SaaS companies.Given these financials, the impact on the stock market could be positive, as investors typically look for growth coupled with profitability in SaaS stocks. However, it's important to monitor how the market responds to the guidance provided for 2024, as forward-looking statements can significantly influence investor sentiment. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, AudioEye's positioning within the enterprise SaaS accessibility space is noteworthy. Their leadership in G2's Winter 2024 Reports for Digital Accessibility Platforms and Tools suggests a strong market presence and product competitiveness. The emphasis on usability and implementation aligns with customer priorities in software adoption, which can lead to higher customer retention and lower churn rates.The strategic decisions, such as the share repurchase program and the appointment of an industry veteran as Chief Accessibility Officer, indicate a commitment to shareholder value and industry leadership. These moves could enhance investor confidence and potentially attract more institutional investors. Additionally, the customer base growth is a positive sign of market penetration and could be a driver for future revenue growth, especially in a market that values customer acquisition metrics. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the details surrounding the term loan agreement entered into with SG Credit Partners are of interest. The intended use of proceeds for share repurchases, funding contingent consideration of an acquisition and general corporate purposes is a strategic move that can have implications for shareholder equity and the company's leverage ratio. It is crucial for investors to understand the terms of such agreements, as they can affect the company's financial flexibility and debt covenants.Furthermore, the appointment of a Chief Accessibility Officer with a significant background in policy and legislation highlights AudioEye's focus on compliance and industry standards. This is particularly relevant given the increasing legal requirements for digital accessibility, which can impact the company's risk profile and operational priorities. 03/06/2024 - 04:01 PM Thirty-Second Consecutive Period of Record Revenue TUCSON, Ariz., March 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- AudioEye, Inc. (NASDAQ: AEYE) (""AudioEye"" or the ""Company""), the industry-leading enterprise SaaS accessibility company, reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. ""I want to thank our employees for all their hard work in dramatically improving our efficiency, including revenue per employee, gross margins, and non-GAAP operating margin. Our efficiency metrics are now in the top tier of SaaS companies. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we delivered record adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 million, a 17% margin, adjusted earnings per share of $0.11, and an improved GAAP loss per share of $(0.04),"" said AudioEye CEO David Moradi. ""We are entering 2024 with strong business momentum. In addition to continued operating margin improvement, we expect revenue growth to accelerate throughout the year. We are confident in our expectations and have introduced guidance for 2024."" Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Total revenue increased 2% to a record $7.87M from $7.74M in the same prior year period.Gross profit increased to $6.2M (78% of total revenue) from $6.0M (77% of total revenue) in the same prior year period. The increase in gross profit was due to continued revenue growth and decreases in the cost of revenue from improved automation in product offerings.Total operating expenses decreased 16% to $6.7M from $7.9M in the same prior year period. The decrease in operating expenses was due primarily to increased efficiency in all departments.Net loss available to common stockholders improved 72% to $0.5M, or $(0.04) per share, from a net loss of $1.9M, or $(0.17) per share, in the same prior year period. The improvement in net loss was primarily due to increases in revenue and gross profit as well as increased efficiencies in sales and marketing, R&D, and G&A expenses.Adjusted EBITDA in Q4 2023 was $1.3M, or adjusted EPS of $0.11, compared to $0.2M, or adjusted EPS of $0.01, in the same prior year period. For Q4 2023, the adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS performance reflect adjustments primarily for stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, and non-cash valuation adjustments to liabilities.Annual Recurring Revenue (""ARR"") as of December 31, 2023, increased sequentially to $31.2M from $30.5M as of September 30, 2023.As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $9.2M in cash, compared to $3.3M as of September 30, 2023. The increase in cash was primarily due to a $7.0M term loan entered into on November 30, 2023, and cash provided by operating activities of $0.8M, offset by $0.5M of software development costs and $1.1M of share repurchase.Full Year 2023 Financial Results Total revenue increased 5% to a record $31.3M in 2023 from $29.9M in 2022.Gross profit increased to $24.3M (78% of total revenue) in 2023 from $22.7M (76% of total revenue) in 2022.With revenue growing 5% in 2023, total operating expenses for 2023 decreased $2.8M from $33.1M to $30.3M. The decrease in total operating expense was primarily driven by efficiencies in sales and marketing and G&A, partially offset by investments in R&D.Net loss available to common stockholders was $5.9M, or $(0.50) per share, compared to a net loss of $10.4M, or $(0.91) per share, in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to revenue growth and decreased expenses discussed above.The Company achieved adjusted EBITDA of $1.3M, or adjusted EPS of $0.11, in 2023, compared to a negative adjusted EBITDA of $(0.9M), or adjusted EPS of $(0.08), in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS reflect adjustments for stock-based compensation, litigation expense, and other non-recurring items.Other Updates On November 30, 2023, AudioEye entered into a three-year loan agreement with SG Credit Partners for $7.0M. The proceeds of the term loan will be used for share repurchases of the Company's common stock, to fund the contingent consideration associated with the BOIA acquisition, and for working capital and general corporate purposes.In the fourth quarter of 2023, AudioEye and its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5M of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock expiring in December 2025. As of March 5, 2024, the Company had repurchased 437,000 shares at an average price of $4.87.In January 2024, AudioEye appointed Accessibility Industry Veteran Mike Paciello as Chief Accessibility Officer. Paciello brings over 40 years of expertise to this critical role, including authoring the first book on web accessibility, founding The Paciello Group (a pioneering accessibility solutions provider), and co-founding/co-chairing accessibility industry committees to drive advancements in policy and legislation. As the former co-chair of the United States Federal Access Board's Telecommunications and Electronic and Information Technology Advisory Committee (TEITAC) and recognized by President Bill Clinton for his contribution to the W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), Paciello has played a pivotal role in shaping accessibility standards and practices.In January 2024, AudioEye announced the Company had been recognized as a leader in 16 of G2's Winter 2024 Reports for Digital Accessibility Platforms and Digital Accessibility Tools. The Company ranked first in the categories of implementation (how quickly and easily customers can go-live) and usability (a measure of the overall ease of use). Additionally, AudioEye earned 13 leader badges, including easiest setup and highest user adoption.As of December 31, 2023, AudioEye had approximately 110,000 customers, up 3,000 sequentially and 24,000 year over year. The increase in customer count was driven by additions in Partner and Marketplace customers.Financial OutlookThe Company expects to generate revenue of between $8.0 million and $8.1 million in the first quarter and between $34.0 million and $34.4 million for the full year 2024. Management also expects adjusted EBITDA of between $700,000 and $900,000 for the first quarter and between $3.5 million and $4.5 million for the full year 2024.

About Key Operating MetricsWe consider annual recurring revenue (""ARR"") as a key operating metric and a key indicator of our overall business. We also use ARR as one of the primary methods for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating, on at least a quarterly and annual basis, actual results against such expectations. We manage customers through two primary channels, Enterprise and Partner and Marketplace. Enterprise channel consists of our larger customers and organizations, including those with non-platform custom websites, who generally engage directly with AudioEye sales personnel for custom pricing and solutions. This channel also includes federal, state and local government agencies. The Partner and Marketplace channel consists of our CMS partners, platform & agency partners, authorized resellers and our marketplace. This channel serves small and medium sized businesses who are on a partner or reseller's web-hosting platform or who purchase an AudioEye solution from our marketplace. We define ARR as the sum of (i) for our Enterprise channel, the total of the annual recurring fee under each active contract at the date of determination, plus (ii) for our Partner and Marketplace channel, the monthly fee for all active customers at the date of determination, in each case, assuming no changes to the subscription, multiplied by 12. This determination includes both annual and monthly contracts for recurring products. Some of our contracts are cancelable, which may impact future ARR. ARR excludes revenue from our PDF remediation services business, one-time Website and Mobile App report services business and other miscellaneous non-recurring services. Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresFrom time to time, we review adjusted financial measures that assist us in comparing our operating performance consistently over time, as such measures remove the impact of certain items, as applicable, such as our capital structure (primarily interest charges), items outside the control of the management team (taxes), and expenses that do not relate to our core operations, including significant transaction and litigation-related expenses and other costs that are expected to be non-recurring. In order to provide investors with greater insight and allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the information used in our financial and operational decision-making, the Company has supplemented the consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis in this press release with the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Adjusted earnings (loss) per diluted share. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Company results as reported under GAAP. The Company compensates for such limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only as supplemental data. We also provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures used. Investors are encouraged to carefully review this reconciliation. In addition, because these non-GAAP measures are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and are susceptible to varying calculations, these measures, as defined by us, may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and Adjusted Earnings (Loss) per Diluted ShareWe define: (i) Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), plus (less) interest expense (income), plus depreciation and amortization expense, plus stock-based compensation expense, plus non-cash valuation adjustment to contingent consideration, plus certain litigation expense, plus certain acquisition expense, plus executive team restructuring cost, and plus loss on disposal or impairment of long-lived assets; (ii) Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of GAAP revenue; and (iii) Adjusted earnings (loss) per diluted share as net income (loss) per diluted common share, plus (less) interest expense (income), plus depreciation and amortization expense, plus stock-based compensation expense, plus non-cash valuation adjustment to contingent consideration, plus certain litigation expense, plus certain acquisition expense, plus executive team restructuring cost, and plus loss on disposal or impairment of long-lived assets, each on a per share basis. Adjusted earnings per diluted share would include incremental shares in the share count that are considered anti-dilutive in a GAAP net loss position. However, no incremental shares apply when there is an Adjusted loss per diluted share, as is the case for one of the periods presented in this press release. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Adjusted earnings (loss) per diluted share are used to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period and provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than GAAP measures alone. All of the items adjusted in the Adjusted EBITDA to net loss and the Adjusted earnings (loss) per share calculations are either recurring non-cash items, or items that management does not consider in assessing our on-going operating performance. In the case of the non-cash items, such as stock-based compensation expense and valuation adjustments to assets and liabilities, management believes that investors may find it useful to assess our comparative operating performance because the measures without such items are expected to be less susceptible to variances in actual performance resulting from expenses that do not relate to our core operations and are more reflective of other factors that affect operating performance. In the case of items that do not relate to our core operations, management believes that investors may find it useful to assess our operating performance if the measures are presented without these items because their financial impact does not reflect ongoing operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of liquidity under GAAP, or otherwise, and is not an alternative to cash flow from continuing operating activities, despite the advantages regarding the use and analysis of these measures as mentioned above. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Adjusted earnings (loss) per diluted share, as disclosed in this press release, have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP; nor are these measures intended to be measures of liquidity or free cash flow for our discretionary use. To properly and prudently evaluate our business, we encourage readers to review the consolidated GAAP financial statements included elsewhere in this press release, and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. The following table sets forth reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP-based measure, as well as Adjusted earnings (loss) per diluted share to net loss per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP-based measure. We strongly urge readers to review these reconciliations, along with the financial statements included elsewhere in this press release.

Financial Analyst The reported growth in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) and Net Retention Rate (NRR) for OneSpan Inc. indicates a solidifying customer base and increasing revenue predictability, which are positive indicators for investor confidence. The ARR's 11% year-over-year growth, coupled with an NRR of 110%, suggests that not only is the customer base expanding, but existing customers are spending more over time. This is a critical metric as it underscores the company's success in cross-selling and up-selling its product suite.However, the non-GAAP net income figures, which exclude certain expenses, show a stark contrast between quarterly and yearly performance. The impressive fourth-quarter non-GAAP net income jump to $7.5 million from the prior year's $1.2 million reflects strong cost management and operational efficiency. In contrast, the full-year non-GAAP net income breaking even, compared to a net loss the previous year, may raise questions about the company's ability to maintain profitability throughout an entire fiscal year.The share repurchase program, with $29.2 million used to buy back shares, can be seen as a signal of self-confidence from the management in the company's valuation and future prospects. This action might be appealing to investors as it often leads to earnings per share (EPS) accretion and can be indicative of a management's perspective on stock undervaluation. Market Research Analyst OneSpan's focus on digital agreements and security solutions positions the company in two rapidly growing markets, driven by increasing global demand for digital transformation and cybersecurity. The reported revenue increases in these segments by 17% and 10% year-over-year, respectively, reflect the company's alignment with market trends and its ability to capitalize on emerging business opportunities.Despite the overall positive revenue growth, it's important to note that the gross margin has slightly decreased from 68% to 67% year-over-year. Margins are a key indicator of pricing power and operational efficiency and even small changes can have significant implications for profitability. This slight decrease could suggest increased costs or competitive pressures that may require strategic adjustments.The projected revenue for 2024 indicates a conservative growth outlook, aligning with the company's aim for low to mid-single digit growth. This suggests a cautious approach, possibly due to market saturation, increased competition, or strategic focus on profitability over top-line growth. Economist OneSpan's financial results and forward-looking statements should be contextualized within the broader economic environment. The company's performance, particularly its ability to generate cash flow and improve its adjusted EBITDA margin, suggests resilience amidst economic uncertainties that may include fluctuating interest rates and varying corporate investment levels in IT security.The emphasis on efficient revenue growth and profitability, especially in light of the recent cost reduction actions, is indicative of a strategic pivot towards operational excellence and margin improvement. This pivot is often seen in companies aiming to weather economic downturns or preparing for less favorable market conditions.The company's guidance for 2024, with adjusted EBITDA margins anticipated to be in the range of 20% to 23%, signals an optimistic outlook on maintaining cost efficiencies. This target margin is significant as it would represent a substantial improvement from the current year, which could suggest an expectation of stable or improving economic conditions that would support such profitability. 03/06/2024 - 04:01 PM Fourth quarter revenue grew 11% year-over-year to $62.9 million; full year revenue grew 7% year-over-year to $235.1 million Fourth quarter subscription revenue grew 15% year-over-year to $27.3 million; full year subscription revenue grew 19% year-over-year to $106.4 million Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) grew 11% year-over-year to $154.6 million1 Net Retention Rate (NRR) of 110%2 BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- OneSpan Inc.

These include subscription, term-based license, and maintenance and support contracts and exclude one-time fees. To the extent that we are negotiating a renewal with a customer within 90 days after the expiration of a recurring contract, we continue to include that revenue in ARR if we are actively in discussion with the customer for a new recurring contract or renewal and the customer has not notified us of an intention to not renew. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for additional information describing how we define ARR, including how ARR differs from GAAP revenue. NRR is defined as the approximate year-over-year growth in ARR from the same set of customers at the end of the prior year period. An explanation of the use of Non-GAAP financial measures is included below under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” A reconciliation of each Non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure has also been provided in the tables below. We are not providing a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA guidance to GAAP net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, because we are unable to predict certain items included in GAAP net income without unreasonable efforts.

In conjunction with the strategic transformation plan and to enable a more efficient capital deployment model, effective with the quarter ended June 30, 2022, we began reporting under the following two lines of business, which are our reportable operating segments: Digital Agreements and Security Solutions. Digital Agreements. Digital Agreements consists of solutions that enable our clients to secure and automate business processes associated with their digital agreement and customer transaction lifecycles that require consent, non-repudiation and compliance. These solutions, which are largely cloud-based, include OneSpan Sign e-signature, OneSpan Notary and OneSpan Trust Vault. This segment also includes costs attributable to our transaction cloud platform. Security Solutions. Security Solutions consists of our broad portfolio of software products, software development kits (SDKs) and Digipass authenticator devices that are used to build applications designed to defend against attacks on digital transactions across online environments, devices, and applications. The software products and SDKs included in the Security Solutions segment are largely on-premises software products and include identity verification, multi-factor authentication and transaction signing solutions, such as mobile application security and mobile software tokens. Segment operating income consists of the revenues generated by a segment, less the direct costs of revenue, sales and marketing, research and development expenses, amortization expense, and restructuring and other related charges that are incurred directly by a segment. Unallocated corporate costs include costs related to administrative functions that are performed in a centralized manner that are not attributable to a particular segment. Prior to 2023, the Company allocated certain cost of goods sold and operating expenses to its two reportable operating segments using a direct cost allocation and an allocation based on revenue split between the segments. As a result of the ongoing strategic transformation, the Company refined its operating segment allocation methodology to better align internal and external costs more directly to where the employee efforts are being spent on each segment moving forward. The revised methodology was applied on a prospective basis beginning in 2023. As a result of this change, there was an increase in cost of goods sold and operating expenses being allocated to the Digital Agreements segment, which better aligns with the investments the Company is making to grow that segment as compared to its Security Solutions segment.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures We report financial results in accordance with GAAP. We also evaluate our performance using certain Non-GAAP financial metrics, namely Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) and Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) Per Diluted Share. Our management believes that these measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial metrics, provide useful supplemental information regarding the performance of our business, as further discussed in the descriptions of each of these Non-GAAP metrics below. These Non-GAAP financial measures are not measures of performance under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives or substitutes for the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. While we believe that these Non-GAAP financial measures are useful for the purposes described below, they have limitations associated with their use, since they exclude items that may have a material impact on our reported results and may be different from similar measures used by other companies. Additional information about the Non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures appear below. Adjusted EBITDA We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, long-term incentive compensation, restructuring and other related charges, and certain non-recurring items, including acquisition related costs, rebranding costs, and non-routine shareholder matters. We use Adjusted EBITDA as a simplified measure of performance for use in communicating our performance to investors and analysts and for comparisons to other companies within our industry. As a performance measure, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA presents a view of our operating results that is most closely related to serving our customers. By excluding interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, long-term incentive compensation, restructuring costs, and certain other non-recurring items, we are able to evaluate performance without considering decisions that, in most cases, are not directly related to meeting our customers’ requirements and were either made in prior periods (e.g., depreciation, amortization, long-term incentive compensation, non-routine shareholder matters), deal with the structure or financing of the business (e.g., interest, one-time strategic action costs, restructuring costs, impairment charges) or reflect the application of regulations that are outside of the control of our management team (e.g., taxes). In addition, removing the impact of these items helps us compare our core business performance with that of our competitors. Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands, unaudited) Three Months Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net income (loss) $ 441 $ (3,097 ) $ (29,799 ) $ (14,434 ) Interest income, net (415 ) (398 ) (2,090 ) (595 ) Provision for income taxes 917 496 2,486 2,741 Depreciation and amortization of intangible assets (1) 1,955 1,375 6,479 7,066 Long-term incentive compensation (2) 4,136 3,197 14,562 8,813 Restructuring and other related charges 4,235 1,482 17,311 13,310 Other non-recurring items (3) (112 ) 127 3,048 (10,505 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 11,157 $ 3,182 $ 11,997 $ 6,396 (1) Includes cost of sales depreciation and amortization expense directly related to delivering cloud subscription revenue of $0.8 million and $1.5 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, and $0 for the three months and year ended December 31, 2022. Costs are recorded in “Cost of goods sold - Services and other” on the consolidated statements of operations. (2) Long-term incentive compensation includes immaterial expense for cash incentive grants awarded to employees located in jurisdictions where we do not issue stock-based compensation due to tax, regulatory or similar reasons. The expense associated with these cash incentive grants was less than $0.1 million for both the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $0.3 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. (3) For the three months ended December 31, 2023, other non-recurring items consist of an inventory write-off reversal of $1.4 million, offset by $1.4 million of fees related to non-recurring items, primarily severance payable to our former chief executive officer. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, other non-recurring items consist of $0.1 million of outside services related to our strategic action plan. For the year ended December 31, 2023, other non-recurring items consist of $1.6 million of fees related to non-recurring projects and our acquisition of ProvenDB, and $1.4 million of fees related to non-recurring items, primarily severance payable to our former chief executive officer. For the year ended December 31, 2022, other non-recurring items consist of $4.3 million of outside services related to our strategic action plan, and a $(14.8) million non-operating gain on the sale of our investment in Promon AS. Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) and Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) Per Diluted Share We define Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) and Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) Per Diluted Share as net income (loss) or net income (loss) per diluted share, as applicable, before the consideration of long-term incentive compensation expenses, the amortization of intangible assets, restructuring costs, and certain other non-recurring items. We use these measures to assess the impact of our performance excluding items that can significantly impact the comparison of our results between periods and the comparison to competitor results. We exclude long-term incentive compensation expense because our long-term incentives generally reflect the use of restricted stock unit grants or cash incentive grants, including incentives directly tied to the performance of the business, while other companies may use different forms of incentives that have different cost impacts, which makes comparison difficult. We exclude amortization of intangible assets as we believe the amount of such expense in any given period may not be correlated directly to the performance of the business operations and that such expenses can vary significantly between periods as a result of new acquisitions, the full amortization of previously acquired intangible assets, or the write down of such assets due to an impairment event. However, intangible assets contribute to current and future revenue, and related amortization expense will recur in future periods until expired or written down. We also exclude certain non-recurring items including one-time strategic action costs and non-recurring shareholder matters, as these items are unrelated to the operations of our core business. By excluding these items, we are better able to compare the operating results of our underlying core business from one reporting period to the next. We make a tax adjustment based on the above adjustments resulting in an effective tax rate on a Non-GAAP basis, which may differ from the GAAP tax rate. We believe the effective tax rates we use in the adjustment are reasonable estimates of the overall tax rates for the Company under its global operating structure.

Cyngn's successful completion of multiple trial deployments of DriveMod Autonomous Vehicles with leading manufacturers in early 2024 indicates potential growth and market acceptance. Cyngn's patent portfolio growth with 19 granted patents and additional pending patents reflects the company's focus on innovation and intellectual property protection. The absence of debt for Cyngn in both 2022 and 2023 highlights a strong financial position and reduced financial risks for the company. The increase in total costs and expenses from $19.7 million in 2022 to $24.8 million in 2023 may raise concerns about the company's cost management strategies and operational efficiency. A decrease in revenue from $262 thousand in Q4 2022 to $40.4 thousand in Q4 2023 could indicate challenges in maintaining consistent revenue streams or market demand for Cyngn's products. The decline in unrestricted cash and short-term investments from $22.6 million in 2022 to $8.2 million in 2023 may raise liquidity concerns and affect the company's ability to fund future operations. The net loss per share increasing from $(0.55) in 2022 to $(0.57) in 2023 may indicate profitability challenges and financial performance issues for Cyngn. The reduction in G&A expenses in Q4 2023 and the recognition of an Employee Retention Credit could positively impact the company's bottom line and operational efficiency. Negative The decrease in working capital from $22.4 million in 2022 to $7.4 million in 2023 raises concerns about Cyngn's liquidity position and ability to meet short-term financial obligations. The net loss per share increasing from $(0.15) in Q4 2022 to $(0.12) in Q4 2023 may indicate ongoing profitability challenges and financial performance issues for Cyngn. The decline in total stockholders' equity from $24.1 million in 2022 to $10.6 million in 2023 could signal potential shareholder value dilution or financial instability. The decrease in revenue from $262 thousand in Q4 2022 to $40.4 thousand in Q4 2023 may raise concerns about Cyngn's ability to sustain revenue growth and profitability in the future. The increase in total costs and expenses from $19.7 million in 2022 to $24.8 million in 2023 may indicate challenges in cost management and operational efficiency for Cyngn. The decline in unrestricted cash and short-term investments from $22.6 million in 2022 to $8.2 million in 2023 may raise liquidity concerns and impact Cyngn's financial flexibility. Financial Analyst The financial results presented by Cyngn Inc. indicate a substantial year-over-year revenue increase from $262 thousand to $1.5 million, primarily attributed to Non-Recurring Engineering contracts. However, the company's net loss widened from $(19.2) million in 2022 to $(22.8) million in 2023, despite the revenue growth. This discrepancy suggests that the increased revenue is not translating into bottom-line profitability, which could be a red flag for investors. The increased R&D expenses, which rose by $3.2 million, are reflective of the company's investment in advancing its autonomous vehicle (AV) technology. While such investments are critical for long-term growth, they do impact short-term financial stability.The decline in unrestricted cash and short-term investments from $22.6 million to $8.2 million, coupled with a decrease in total stockholders' equity from $24.1 million to $10.6 million, indicates significant cash burn. This scenario could potentially lead to liquidity concerns if the company does not manage to scale revenue at a faster pace or secure additional funding. The lack of debt is a positive sign, suggesting Cyngn is not over-leveraged, which provides some financial flexibility. Market Research Analyst Cyngn’s strategic partnerships with leading OEMs like Motrec and BYD and technology alignment with Ouster's LiDAR sensors and Nvidia's AI computation capabilities, highlight its integration within the AV ecosystem. The company's focus on AI-driven autonomous vehicle software solutions positions it within a high-growth potential market, as the demand for automation and efficiency in industries like logistics and transportation is increasing. The successful trial deployments and anticipated initial deployments of DriveMod Autonomous Forklifts in the second half of the year could be pivotal in establishing Cyngn's market presence.However, the market for autonomous industrial vehicles is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, with significant R&D investments required to stay at the forefront. Cyngn's ability to convert trial deployments into follow-on sales and scale up production will be crucial for market penetration and revenue growth. Investors should monitor the company's customer acquisition rate and the effectiveness of its go-to-market strategy. Legal Expert The Nasdaq extension for continued exchange listing provided to Cyngn is a critical aspect that allows the company to maintain its public company status and access capital markets for potential future fundraising. However, it is essential to recognize that such extensions are typically granted when a company is at risk of not meeting the exchange's listing requirements, which can be a concern for investors regarding the company's financial health.The acquisition of 19 patents and numerous pending patents both in the U.S. and internationally signifies a strong intellectual property (IP) portfolio, which is a valuable asset for technology companies. A robust IP portfolio can provide competitive advantages and potential revenue streams through licensing agreements. Nevertheless, it is also important to consider the costs associated with maintaining these patents and the potential for IP litigation, which is common in the tech industry. 03/06/2024 - 04:01 PM MENLO PARK, Calif., March 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Cyngn Inc.

To learn more, watch our 2023 year in review video here. 2023 Financial Review: 2023 revenue was $1.5 million compared to $262 thousand in 2022, the majority of which was substantially the result of NRE (Non-Recurring Engineering) contracts in both years.Total costs and expenses in 2023 were $24.8 million, an increase from $19.7 million in 2022. This increase was primarily related to R&D expenses, up $3.2 million due to increased technical staffing to support our AV technology offset by the recognition of an Employee Retention Credit of $572 thousand and capitalized software of $885 thousand. G&A expenses increased by $898 thousand year-over-year related to increased staffing to support public company responsibilities, increased marketing, advertising and other general and administrative expenses offset by the recognition of an Employee Retention Credit of $192 thousand. Cost of revenue increased by $1.0 million primarily from higher engineering development resources and hardware costs to support the completion of the final phases of NRE contracts. Headcount, including full time contractors, at the end of 2023 was 81 versus 79 from the prior year.Net loss for 2023 was $(22.8) million compared to $(19.2) million in 2022. 2023 net loss per share was $(0.57), based on basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 40.0 million. This compares to a net loss per share of $(0.55) in 2022, based on approximately 34.9 million basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding.Q4 2023 Financial Review: Fourth quarter revenue was $40.4 thousand compared to $262 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2022. Fourth quarter 2023 revenue was derived primarily from EAS software subscriptions from DriveMod Stock chaser vehicle deployments whereas prior year revenue was primarily the result of NRE contracts.Total costs and expenses in the fourth quarter were $5.4 million, down from $6.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. This decrease was primarily due to a $635 thousand reduction in G&A expenses, partially due to the recognition of an Employee Retention Credit of $192 thousand. In addition, cost of revenue decreased by $86 thousand and R&D expenses increased by $204 thousand. The increase in R&D expense was primarily driven by commercial deployments, offset by the recognition of an Employee Retention Credit of $572 thousand and $123 thousand of capitalized software.Net loss for the fourth quarter was $(5.4) million compared to $(5.5) million in the corresponding quarter of 2022. Fourth quarter 2023 net loss per share was $(0.12), based on basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 46.0 million in the quarter. This compares to a net loss per share of $(0.15) in the fourth quarter of 2022, based on approximately 37.7 million basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding.Balance Sheet Highlights:Cyngn's unrestricted cash and short-term investments at the end of 2023 total $8.2 million compared to $22.6 million as of December 31, 2022.

(MG: NYSE) reported a Q4 2023 revenue of $182.1 million, up 8.2%, with a net loss of $2.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $19.2 million, up 22.0%. Full Year 2023 saw revenue of $705.5 million, up 2.6%, with a net loss of $17.5 million. The company anticipates revenue between $725-$750 million and Adjusted EBITDA between $84-$89 million for 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported Q4 2023 revenue growth of 8.2% to $182.1 million suggests a positive trend in MISTRAS Group's sales performance, indicating an expanding market presence, especially considering the notable growth in the Oil & Gas, Aerospace and Defense and Industrials sectors. The Adjusted EBITDA increase of 22.0% to $19.2 million highlights effective cost management and operational leverage, which could signal to investors the company's improving efficiency and potential for margin expansion. However, the reported net loss of $2.5 million, primarily due to reorganization and other costs, may raise concerns about near-term profitability and the impact of these non-recurring expenses on the bottom line.The full-year net cash provided by operating activities remaining consistent with the prior year at $26.7 million demonstrates stability in cash generation capabilities. However, the decrease in Free Cash Flow to $3.1 million, compared to $13.0 million in the previous year, reflects increased capital expenditures aimed at strategic growth, which investors should monitor to assess the effectiveness of these investments in driving future revenue growth.The company's preliminary 2024 outlook, with expected revenue between $725-$750 million and Adjusted EBITDA between $84-$89 million, suggests confidence in continued growth and operational improvements. The anticipated Free Cash Flow of $34-$38 million also points to a significant improvement from 2023, which could be a positive indicator for the company's financial health and its ability to fund future growth initiatives without additional financing. Market Research Analyst The industry-specific growth figures, with a 13.4% increase in the Oil & Gas industry, a 15.3% increase in Aerospace and Defense and a 24.3% growth in Industrials, indicate a robust demand in these sectors. This aligns with broader market trends where these industries are experiencing a resurgence, likely due to increased capital spending and technological advancements. MISTRAS Group's ability to capitalize on these trends could position it favorably against competitors. However, the decline in the Power Generation industry due to the completion of specific projects may indicate a need for diversification and the pursuit of new contracts to mitigate the risk of revenue concentration.With Project Phoenix aimed at improving profitability, the company's focus on efficiency and cost savings could enhance its competitive edge. The anticipated SG&A reduction to approximately 21% of full-year 2024 revenue from 23.6% in 2023 reflects a strategic move to streamline operations. This could positively influence the company's market position by allowing it to operate more leanly and responsively to industry demands. Legal Expert The disclosure of $6.3 million in reorganization costs associated with Project Phoenix for Q4 2023 and $12.3 million for the full year, which includes costs related to the separation of the former President and CEO, professional fees and restructuring charges, underscores the legal and administrative complexities involved in corporate reorganization. While these costs have impacted net earnings, it is crucial for stakeholders to understand that such reorganization efforts can lead to long-term cost savings and improved operational efficiency. The legal implications of these changes, such as severance agreements and potential contractual disputes, are typically one-time expenses that should be factored into the company's future financial health assessments. 03/06/2024 - 04:01 PM Q4 2023 Revenue of $182.1 million, up 8.2% Q4 2023 Net Loss of $2.5 million reflecting $6.3 million of reorganization and other costs and $1.2 million of foreign currency exchange losses Q4 2023 Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) of $19.2 million compared to $15.7 million in the prior year, up 22.0%; highest Q4 result historically Full Year 2023 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities of $26.7 million consistent with the prior year, whereas Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP) of $3.1 million was lower than the prior year, reflecting increased strategic spend in expanding growth areas PRINCETON JUNCTION, N.J., March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MISTRAS Group, Inc. (MG: NYSE), a leading ""one source"" multinational provider of integrated technology-enabled asset protection solutions, reported financial results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. “I am pleased to report strong top and bottom-line growth in the fourth quarter of 2023. Although a small sample, our fourth quarter performance is evidence of the effectiveness of Project Phoenix initiatives to improve profitability and Adjusted EBITDA through meaningful margin improvement and steps to achieve sustained cost savings. More importantly, this provides momentum heading into 2024, where we expect to realize the majority of the financial benefits from the implementation in 2023 of the initiatives that Project Phoenix has driven throughout the organization. Consequently, I am reiterating our expectation that fiscal 2024 Adjusted EBITDA will be one of our all-time high performance years,” said Manny N. Stamatakis, Interim President and Chief Executive Officer. Edward Prajzner, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, commented, “Fourth quarter results clearly demonstrate that we can drive significant bottom line growth by leveraging improved sales efficiency and enhanced operational productivity. Despite headwinds faced earlier in the year, we saw positive momentum in the second half of 2023 and our fourth quarter results are a tangible example of the momentum we have built heading into 2024. We are pleased by the early success achieved on our Project Phoenix objectives, but also recognize this is only the beginning and our job is not yet complete. The entire organization is re-energized and intently focused on finding new opportunities to efficiently leverage our core competencies.” Highlights for the Fourth Quarter 2023* Revenue of $182.1 million, an increase of 8.2%Gross profit of $53.6 million, an increase of 5.3%, with gross profit margin of 29.5%, a decrease of 80 basis points due to an unfavorable sales mix and higher employee benefit credits in the prior year periodSelling, general and administrative expenses of $42.9 million, up 1.7%, due to higher foreign currency exchange losses and other discrete items, offset by savings associated with Project Phoenix actions and other cost reduction measuresNet loss of $2.5 million, or ($0.08) per share, reflecting reorganization and other costs of $6.3 million; Net income excluding special items (non-GAAP) of $2.9 million, or $0.10 per shareAdjusted EBITDA of $19.2 million, an increase of 22.0%, as a result of operating leverage and cost controls * All comparisons are consolidated and versus the equivalent prior year period, unless otherwise noted. For the fourth quarter of 2023, consolidated revenue was $182.1 million, an increase of 8.2% from the fourth quarter of 2022. Revenue growth in the fourth quarter was led by a 13.4% increase in the Oil & Gas industry, a 15.3% increase in the Aerospace and Defense industry and 24.3% growth in the Industrials industry, which represent our three largest industries. Growth in the Oil & Gas industry was led by strong turnaround activity, which is expected to continue into the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Revenue in the Company’s other industries, primarily Power Generation, was down from the prior year period primarily due to the completion of certain projects. Fourth quarter 2023 gross profit increased 5.3%, although gross profit margin was down compared to the year ago period. Gross profit improved from the increase in revenues, while gross profit margin decreased due to an unfavorable sales mix and higher employee benefit credits in the prior year period. Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $42.9 million, up 1.7% from the year ago period, due to higher foreign currency exchange losses and other discrete items, offset by savings associated with Project Phoenix actions and other cost reduction measures. Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, the Company expects SG&A to be significantly below comparable year levels due to Project Phoenix actions completed in 2023. The Company anticipates that SG&A will reduce to approximately 21% of full year 2024 revenue, from 23.6% in full year 2023. The Company reported a quarterly net loss of $2.5 million, or $0.08 loss per share, which included $6.3 million of reorganization and related costs and $1.2 million of foreign currency exchange losses. Net income excluding special items (non-GAAP) was $2.9 million, or $0.10 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $0.09 per share in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA was $19.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $15.7 million in the prior year, an increase of 22.0%. Highlights for Full Year 2023* Revenue of $705.5 million, an increase of 2.6% and exceeding the high end of the Company’s revised Guidance Gross profit of $203.8 million, with gross profit margin of 28.9%, an increase of 10 basis points due to improved revenue mix for the year, partially offset by higher employee benefit credits in the prior year period SG&A of $166.7 million, up marginally, less than 1%, due to higher foreign currency exchange losses and other discrete items, which offset the savings associated with our Project Phoenix initiatives Net loss of $17.5 million, or ($0.58) per share, primarily due to reorganization and other costs of $12.3 million and a $13.8 million non-cash goodwill impairment chargeAdjusted EBITDA of $65.8 million, an increase of 13.2% and in line with the Company’s revised Guidance * All comparisons are consolidated and versus the equivalent prior year period, unless otherwise noted. For the full year, revenue increased 2.6%. Revenue growth was primarily driven by a 7.3% increase in the Oil and Gas industry, with growth in all sub-categories of Upstream, Midstream, and Downstream in addition to a 10.3% increase in the Industrials industry. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue in the Power Generation industry due the completion of certain contracts and declines in Other Process Industries and Aerospace & Defense. Aerospace and Defense revenue decreased compared to the prior full year period but rebounded with robust growth during the fourth quarter of 2023. For the full year 2023, gross profit increased $5.6 million, or 2.8%, with gross profit margin of 28.9%, a slight increase from 28.8% in the prior year. On a full year basis in 2023, SG&A was essentially flat. Net loss was $17.5 million for the full year 2023, compared to net income of $6.5 million in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $65.8 million, up 13.2% from $58.2 million in 2022. Cash Flow and Balance SheetThe Company generated $26.7 million of net cash from operating activities in 2023, compared to $26.4 million in 2022. Free cash flow was $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $13.0 million in the prior year. The Company’s decreased cash flow in 2023 was primarily attributable to a significant increase in capital expenditures during the current year of $10.2 million as compared to 2022. The Company is intently focused on organic growth investments via strategic capital expenditures and improved commercial functions, in order to foster revenue growth in expanding areas including Aerospace shop laboratories and Data Analytical Solutions. The Company’s gross debt was $190.4 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $191.3 million as of December 31, 2022 and $193.9 million as of September 30, 2023. Reorganization and OtherFor the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company recorded $6.3 million of reorganization costs related to on-going efficiency and productivity initiatives, primarily related to overhead cost savings achieved via Project Phoenix. For the fourth quarter of 2023, these charges included costs associated with the separation of the Company’s former President and CEO, professional fees and certain restructuring charges associated with changes made in the Company’s organizational structure. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded $12.3 million of total reorganization costs. Refer to the Company’s press release associated with Project Phoenix released on November 2, 2023 for additional details associated with this important initiative. Preliminary 2024 Outlook The Company reiterates the preliminary guidance released in conjunction with the release of its financial results for the third quarter of 2023. For 2024, the Company anticipates full year revenue between $725-$750 million and Adjusted EBITDA between $84-$89 million. The Company additionally expects to generate Free Cash Flow of between $34-$38 million. This outlook for 2024 includes approximately $20 million in incremental benefit from savings associated with Project Phoenix initiatives in 2024. Mr. Stamatakis concluded, “I am extremely encouraged by the strong early returns from the Project Phoenix related actions. The increased discipline and accountability implemented throughout the organization in connection with Project Phoenix have resulted in an increased focus on achieving the goals we have set for revenue growth, efficiency improvements and increased profitability. We are now firmly set on a course to achieve continuous improvement, further integrate Data Analytical Solutions, and uncover other opportunities where our proprietary technologies and extensive knowledge and know-how can solve problems for our customers and create value for our shareholders.” Conference Call In connection with this release, MISTRAS will hold a conference call on March 7, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. (Eastern).To listen to the live webcast of the conference call, visit the Investor Relations section of MISTRAS Group’s website at www.mistrasgroup.comNote there is a new process to participate in the live question and answer session.

A list, description and discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties can be found in the ""Risk Factors"" section of the Company's 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K dated March 15, 2023, as updated by our reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn addition to financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP), this press release also contains adjusted financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and that we believe provide investors and management with supplemental information relating to operating performance and trends that facilitate comparisons between periods and with respect to trends and projected information. The term ""Adjusted EBITDA"" used in this release is a financial measurement not calculated in accordance with GAAP and is defined by the Company as net income attributable to MISTRAS Group, Inc. plus: interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, certain acquisition related costs (including transaction due diligence costs and adjustments to the fair value of contingent consideration), foreign exchange (gain) loss, non-cash impairment charges, reorganization and related charges and, if applicable, certain additional special items which are noted. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income (Loss) as computed under GAAP is set forth in a table attached to this press release. The Company also uses the term “net debt”, a non-GAAP financial measurement the Company defines as the sum of the current and long-term portions of long-term debt, less cash and cash equivalents and the term “free cash flow”, a non-GAAP financial measurement the Company defines as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures (which is classified as an investing activity). A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measurements to GAAP are also set forth in tables attached to this press release. In the tables attached is also a table reconciling “Segment and Total Company Income (Loss) from Operations (GAAP) to Income (Loss) from Operations before Special Items (non-GAAP)”, “Net Loss (GAAP) and Diluted EPS (GAAP) to Net Loss Excluding Special Items (non-GAAP) and Diluted EPS Excluding Special Items (non-GAAP)” which reconciles the non-GAAP amounts to the GAAP financial measurement. Each of these non-GAAP financial measurements has material limitations as a performance or liquidity measure and should not be considered alternatives to Net Income (Loss) or any other measurements derived in accordance with GAAP. Because Income (loss) from operations before special items and other non-GAAP financial measurements used in this press release may not be calculated in the same manner by all companies, these measurements may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measurements used by other companies.

Introduction of innovative metal payment card products in 2023. Expectation of another record year in 2024 with strategic capital allocation focus. Liquidity improvement with $41.2 million cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2023. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in Q4 net sales by 7% to $100 million and net income surge of 39% to $31 million for CompoSecure is a robust indicator of the company's growth trajectory, particularly in the metal payment card sector. The significant rise in net income can be attributed to effective cost management and operational efficiencies. Additionally, the adjusted EBITDA growth of 22% to $37 million reflects a strong operational performance, which is critical for investors assessing the company's profitability margins.The announcement of a securities repurchase program of up to $40 million signals strong confidence by the management in the company's valuation and financial health. This buyback could potentially lead to earnings per share (EPS) accretion and reflects a shareholder-friendly capital allocation policy. However, investors should consider the opportunity cost of such a program, as the funds used for repurchases might alternatively be invested in growth initiatives or debt reduction. Market Research Analyst CompoSecure's performance in the metal payment card market, particularly its ongoing domestic growth, underscores the company's competitive positioning and ability to capitalize on U.S. consumer trends. Despite a challenging international sales environment, the company's strategic partnerships with major financial institutions like JP Morgan Chase and American Express have likely contributed to its resilience. The product and innovation highlights, such as the Echo Mirror™ Card and LED Card, suggest a focus on differentiating their offerings in a crowded market. This innovation is critical for maintaining market leadership and could drive future revenue growth. Debt Analyst The reduction in CompoSecure's secured debt leverage ratio from 1.62x to 1.39x is a positive development for debt stakeholders, indicating an improved debt servicing capability. The company's balance sheet shows a strengthened cash position from $13.6 million to $41.2 million and a decrease in total debt from $363.1 million to $340.3 million year-over-year, which suggests a more robust financial structure. This improved liquidity and deleveraging are essential for assessing the company's creditworthiness and could impact future borrowing costs and financial flexibility. 03/06/2024 - 04:01 PM Q4 Net Sales up 7% to $100 Million; Q4 Net Income up 39% to $31 Million; Q4 Adj. EBITDA up 22% to $37 Million Issues 2024 Guidance of Net Sales Between $408-$428 Million; Adj. EBITDA Between $147-$157 Million Announces up to $40 Million Securities Repurchase Program to Capitalize on Strong Financial Position SOMERSET, N.J., March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CompoSecure, Inc. (Nasdaq: CMPO), a leader in metal payment cards, security, and authentication solutions, today announced its financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. “Our fourth quarter provided a strong close to 2023, capping off another year of record revenue and profitability. In addition, profitability was in-line with our original guidance issued in March 2023,” said Jon Wilk, President and CEO of CompoSecure. “Sustained U.S. customer demand continued to drive our domestic net sales, which highlighted a record quarter and was up 9% for the year."" “We have a long history of delivering profitable growth while maintaining our leadership position in the global metal payment card market, which we do not believe is fully reflected in the valuation of our securities. I am excited to announce that the CompoSecure board of directors has approved a repurchase program for up to $40 million of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock, warrants and/or convertible notes over the next three years to provide us with a new mechanism to unlock shareholder value.” Mr. Wilk added: “Looking ahead, we expect to maintain a strategic approach to capital allocation that continues to focus on driving organic growth and paying down debt but now also includes additional flexibility to repurchase securities or other opportunities to deliver shareholder value. We believe CompoSecure is well-positioned for another record year as we execute on our growth and profitability objectives.” Q4 2023 Financial Highlights (vs. Q4 2022) Net Sales: Net Sales increased 7% to $99.9 million compared to $93.8 million. The increase was driven by continued domestic growth in CompoSecure’s metal payment card business, partially offset by select clients more tightly managing inventory, and lower international sales which is a more variable market due to global economic uncertainty.Gross Profit: Gross Profit increased to $52.9 million or 52.9% of Net Sales, compared to $50.3 million or 53.6%.Net Income/EPS: Net Income increased 39% to $31.0 million compared to $22.4 million. The increase was primarily driven by prudent operating expense controls, as reflected by a reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses, as well as changes to the fair value of warrant liabilities, earnout consideration liability and derivative liability. Net Income per share attributable to class A common shareholders was $0.17 (Basic) and (Diluted), compared to $0.14 (Basic) and (Diluted) in the year-ago period.Adjusted Net Income/Adjusted EPS: Adjusted Net Income (a non-GAAP measure) increased 30% to $23.1 million compared to $17.7 million in the year-ago period. Adjusted EPS (a non-GAAP measure), which includes both class A and class B shares, was $0.29 (Basic) and $0.26 (Diluted) compared to $0.23 (Basic) and $0.20 (Diluted) in the year-ago period (see reconciliation of non-GAAP measures shown in table below).Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) increased 22% to $37.2 million compared to $30.6 million, with the increase driven by net sales growth and operating expense reductions. FY 2023 Financial Highlights (vs. FY 2022) Net Sales: Net Sales increased 3% to $390.6 million compared to $378.5 million. The increase was primarily driven by continued domestic growth in CompoSecure’s metal payment card business, which was up 9%. This was offset by lower international sales.Gross Profit: Gross Profit was $209.1 million or 53.5% of Net Sales, compared to $219.6 million or 58.0%. The decrease was primarily due to lower production efficiencies from new and innovative card constructions, as well as the impact of inflationary pressure on wages and materials.Net Income/EPS: Net Income was $112.5 million compared to $131.8 million. The decrease was due to lower gross profit, changes to the fair value of warrant liabilities, earnout consideration liability and derivative liability, offset by a decrease in operating expenses. Net Income per share attributable to class A common stockholders was $1.03 (Basic) and $0.96 (Diluted), compared to $1.21 (Basic) and $1.13 (Diluted) in the year-ago period.Adjusted Net Income/Adjusted EPS: Adjusted Net Income (a non-GAAP measure) was $88.0 million compared to $83.0 million in the year-ago period. Adjusted EPS (a non-GAAP measure), which includes both class A and class B shares, was $1.12 (Basic) and $0.97 (Diluted) compared to $1.10 (Basic) and $0.94 (Diluted) in the year-ago period (see reconciliation of non-GAAP measures shown in table below).Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) increased 6% to $145.0 million compared to $136.2 million. Liquidity and Capital Structure Balance Sheet: At December 31, 2023, CompoSecure had $41.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and $340.3 million of total debt, which included $210.3 million of term loan, and $130.0 million of exchangeable notes. This compares to cash and cash equivalents of $13.6 million and total debt of $363.1 million at December 31, 2022. CompoSecure’s secured debt leverage ratio has decreased to 1.39x at December 31, 2023 compared to 1.62x at December 31, 2022 and 2.8x at December 31, 2021.Shares Outstanding: At December 31, 2023, CompoSecure had 79.4 million shares outstanding which included 19.4 million class A shares and 60.0 million class B shares (for more information on shares outstanding, both Basic and Diluted, please refer to CompoSecure’s 10-K and the accompanying earnings presentation).

Securities Repurchase Program CompoSecure has a long history of delivering profitable growth and leading the global market for metal payment cards, which the Company does not believe is fully reflected in the valuation of its securities. To provide a new mechanism to unlock investor value, an independent committee of CompoSecure’s board of directors has approved a repurchase program for up to $40 million of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock, warrants and/or notes exchangeable for shares of common stock. The repurchase program is effective March 7, 2024 through March 7, 2027. Repurchases under this program may be made from time to time in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions, tender offers, or otherwise, and will be made as permitted by the terms and conditions of the Company’s senior credit facility and indenture for its exchangeable notes, as applicable. Repurchases of common stock will be conducted in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. To facilitate equity repurchases, the Company expects to enter into a Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan with a third-party broker to allow the Company to repurchase equity at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of trading blackout periods imposed under the Company’s Insider Trading Policy. Any exchangeable note or warrant repurchases will be conducted in accordance with applicable insider trading laws and the Company’s Insider Trading Policy. Any shares of common stock repurchased under the program may either be returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock or held as treasury stock of the Company. Subject to applicable law, the Company may elect to amend or cancel the repurchase program or amend the terms thereof. The Company also entered into an amendment to the Company’s senior credit facility which enables the Company to implement the repurchase program in compliance with the senior credit facility.

Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of management. Although CompoSecure believes that its plans, intentions, and expectations reflected in or suggested by these forward-looking statements are reasonable, CompoSecure cannot assure you that it will achieve or realize these plans, intentions, or expectations. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Generally, statements that are not historical facts, including statements concerning CompoSecure’s possible or assumed future actions, business strategies, events, or results of operations, are forward-looking statements. In some instances, these statements may be preceded by, followed by or include the words “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “projects,” “forecasts,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “plans,” “scheduled,” “anticipates” or “intends” or the negatives of these terms or variations of them or similar terminology. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. You should not put undue reliance on these statements which speak only as of the date hereof. You should understand that the following important factors, among others, could affect CompoSecure’s future results and could cause those results or other outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied in CompoSecure’s forward-looking statements: the ability of CompoSecure to implement the repurchase program as contemplated consistent with CompoSecure’s strategic initiatives described above and the impact of the repurchase program on CompoSecure; the ability of CompoSecure to grow and manage growth profitably, maintain relationships with customers, compete within its industry and retain its key employees; the possibility that CompoSecure may be adversely impacted by other global economic, business, competitive and/or other factors; the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against CompoSecure or others; future exchange and interest rates; and other risks and uncertainties, including those under “Risk Factors” in filings that have been made or will be made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. CompoSecure undertakes no obligations to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThis press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and that may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. CompoSecure believes EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, and Free Cash Flow are useful to investors in evaluating CompoSecure’s financial performance. CompoSecure uses these measures internally to establish forecasts, budgets and operational goals to manage and monitor its business, as well as evaluate its underlying historical performance and/or to measure incentive compensation, as we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures depict the true performance of the business by encompassing only relevant and controllable events, enabling CompoSecure to evaluate and plan more effectively for the future. Due to the forward-looking nature of the financial guidance included above, specific quantification of the charges excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures included in such financial guidance, including with respect to depreciation, amortization, interest, and taxes, that would be required to reconcile the non GAAP financial measures included in such financial guidance to GAAP measures are not available, so it is not feasible to provide accurate forecasted non-GAAP reconciliations without unreasonable effort. Consequently, no disclosure of estimated comparable GAAP measures is included, and no reconciliation of the forward looking non-GAAP financial measures is included. In addition, CompoSecure’s debt agreements contain covenants that use a variation of these measures for purposes of determining debt covenant compliance. CompoSecurebelieves that investors should have access to the same set of tools that its management uses in analyzing operating results. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, and Free Cash Flow should not be considered as measures of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and the items excluded from EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, and Free Cash Flow are significant components in understanding and assessing CompoSecure’s financial performance. Accordingly, these key business metrics have limitations as an analytical tool. They should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of CompoSecure’s liquidity and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Please refer to the tables below for the reconciliation of GAAP measures to these non-GAAP measures for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The company announced positive data for DCCR in treating Prader-Willi syndrome, with plans to submit an NDA in mid-2024. They closed a public offering raising $129 million and strengthened their leadership team. Financially, Soleno had $169.7 million in cash as of December 31, 2023, with increased R&D and administrative expenses compared to the previous year. Positive Positive top-line data from Study C602 for DCCR in PWS Planned NDA submission for DCCR in mid-2024 Successful public offering raising $129 million Strengthened leadership team appointments Cash and cash equivalents of $169.7 million as of December 31, 2023 Negative Increasing research and development expenses Higher general and administrative expenses Obligation to make cash payments for commercial milestones Net loss increased compared to the previous year Financial Analyst The financial results reported by Soleno Therapeutics indicate a significant increase in both research and development (R&D) and general and administrative (G&A) expenses year-over-year. The increased R&D expenditure, from $15.3 million in 2022 to $25.2 million in 2023, reflects the company's investment in late-stage clinical development of DCCR for Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). This investment aligns with the typical lifecycle of biopharmaceutical companies, where spending escalates as a product candidate approaches the regulatory submission phase.The successful public offering and concurrent private placement, resulting in gross proceeds of approximately $129 million, alongside the $43.1 million from warrant exercises, have bolstered Soleno's cash position to $169.7 million. This strong cash reserve is crucial as it provides the financial runway needed to support the NDA submission and potential commercialization of DCCR. However, investors should be aware of the contingent consideration payable upon achieving certain commercial milestones, which stands at a fair value of $11.5 million, reflecting the company's expectations of DCCR's market performance.Despite the strengthened balance sheet, Soleno reported a net loss increase to $39.0 million in 2023 from $24.1 million in 2022. The reported net loss per share also increased, although the comparison is somewhat skewed by the difference in the number of shares outstanding due to the recent financing activities. These losses are typical for clinical-stage biopharmaceutical companies prior to product commercialization. Stakeholders should weigh the potential future revenues against the increased operational costs and the inherent risks of the biopharmaceutical development process. Medical Research Analyst The announcement of positive top-line data from the randomized withdrawal period of Study C602 is a significant milestone for Soleno Therapeutics, as it supports the safety and efficacy profile of DCCR for the treatment of PWS. The primary endpoint being met with high statistical significance (p=0.0022) is a strong indicator of DCCR's potential therapeutic benefit. Furthermore, the secondary endpoints, while not meeting the conventional threshold for statistical significance (p<0.05), show trends towards efficacy that may be clinically relevant.Prader-Willi syndrome is a complex genetic disorder and the development of effective treatments is challenging. DCCR's mechanism of action, which involves the modulation of ATP-sensitive potassium channels, represents a novel approach in the PWS therapeutic landscape. The implications of a new treatment option are substantial for patients and caregivers, given the limited therapies currently available. If DCCR is approved, it could address a significant unmet medical need and potentially improve the quality of life for individuals with PWS.However, the path to regulatory approval is not guaranteed. The planned NDA submission in mid-2024 is a critical step and the FDA's review will be a decisive factor in DCCR's future. The company's focused preparation for the NDA submission, leveraging the extensive clinical data, is essential to optimize the likelihood of approval. The medical community and potential investors will be closely monitoring the FDA's feedback post-submission, as it will impact Soleno's strategic direction and the commercial potential of DCCR. Market Research Analyst The biopharmaceutical sector is highly competitive, especially in the rare disease space where companies like Soleno Therapeutics operate. The successful completion of a public offering and private placement indicates investor confidence in Soleno's potential, particularly in its lead product candidate, DCCR. The strengthened leadership team, with strategic appointments in commercial operations and human resources, suggests that Soleno is gearing up for the potential market entry of DCCR.Market dynamics for rare disease treatments often involve high pricing strategies due to the small patient populations and significant R&D investments. If DCCR is approved, Soleno may leverage orphan drug exclusivity and other incentives to maximize its commercial success. However, the company must navigate complex reimbursement landscapes and ensure access to treatment for patients. The potential for DCCR to meet a critical unmet need in PWS could drive market adoption, but Soleno will need to effectively communicate the value proposition to payers and clinicians.Furthermore, the financial health of the company, as indicated by the cash reserves post-financing, provides a lens into its ability to sustain operations through the commercial launch phase. Investors and analysts should monitor the burn rate and anticipate future capital needs, as well as the execution of the commercial strategy upon potential approval. The contingent milestone payments to former Essentialis stockholders also underscore the importance of DCCR's commercial performance post-launch. 03/06/2024 - 04:05 PM REDWOOD CITY, Calif., March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Soleno Therapeutics, Inc. (Soleno) (NASDAQ: SLNO), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics for the treatment of rare diseases, today provided a corporate update, and reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2023. Full Year 2023 and Recent Corporate Highlights Announced positive statistically significant top-line data from the randomized withdrawal period of Study C602, a long-term treatment study of DCCR (Diazoxide Choline) Extended-Release tablets for the treatment of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) in September 2023. The study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a highly statistically significant difference in change from baseline in HQ-CT total score for DCCR compared to placebo (p=0.0022).Secondary endpoints of Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) and Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) both showed strong trends towards worsening in the placebo group compared to DCCR (p=0.08 and 0.09), respectively.DCCR continued to be generally well-tolerated in the randomized withdrawal period with no new or unexpected safety signals. Planned submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) for DCCR in PWS remains on track for mid-2024, after receipt of pre-NDA meeting minutes from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA stated that the potential for data from the DCCR clinical program to provide substantial evidence of effectiveness will be a matter of review following the submission of an NDA.Closed on gross proceeds of approximately $129 million from an underwritten public offering of common stock and concurrent private placement of common stock and pre-funded warrants in October 2023, and received $43.1 million from the sale and exercise of warrants issued in connection with the December 2022 Securities Purchase Agreement.Strengthened leadership team with appointments of Meredith Manning, M.B.A as Chief Commercial Officer, Dairine Dempsey, Ph.D. as Vice President, Europe and Lauren Budesheim, M.S. as Vice President of Human Resources. “Following recent feedback from the FDA, Soleno remains focused on preparing an NDA submission for DCCR in PWS mid-2024,” said Anish Bhatnagar, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Soleno Therapeutics. “We believe data from our extensive clinical program, including highly statistically significant top-line results from the randomized withdrawal period of Study C602, supports that DCCR has the potential to be a safe and effective therapy for patients with PWS. With our strengthened leadership team and balance sheet, we are ideally positioned to carry out our corporate strategy and, if approved, deliver a new treatment option for PWS patients.” Financial ResultsSoleno’s current research and development efforts are primarily focused on advancing its lead product candidate, DCCR, for the treatment of PWS, through late-stage clinical development. Fourth Quarter and Full Year Ended December 31, 2023 Financial Results As of December 31, 2023, Soleno had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $169.7 million, which includes $129 million received upon the closing of the public offering and concurrent private placement in October 2023, and $43.1 million received from the sale and exercise of warrants issued in connection with the December 2022 Securities Purchase Agreement. The Company may receive an additional $16.9 million from the exercise of the remaining warrants issued pursuant to the December 2022 Securities Purchase Agreement. Research and development expenses were $8.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to $3.8 million in the same period of 2022, and $25.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $15.3 million for the year ended 2022. The increase was primarily due to increased clinical trials costs, manufacturing efforts, and expenditures in support of our NDA submission. General and administrative expenses were $4.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to $2.4 million in the same period of 2022, and $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $9.8 million for the year ended 2022. The increase was primarily related to higher stock-based compensation expense, higher costs because of an increase in headcount and higher professional and consulting expenses in 2023. Soleno is obligated to make cash payments of up to a maximum of $21.2 million to the former Essentialis stockholders upon the achievement of certain commercial milestones associated with the future sales of DCCR in accordance with the terms of Soleno’s 2016 merger agreement with Essentialis. The fair value of the liability for the contingent consideration payable by the Company upon achieving two commercial sales milestones of $100 million and $200 million in revenue in future years was estimated to be $11.5 million as of December 31, 2023, a $1.1 million increase from the estimate as of September 30, 2023. Total other income (expense), net, was $2.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, and $0.1 million in the same period of 2022. For the year, total other income (expense), net, was $2.4 million for 2023, and $0.3 million for 2022. Other income (expense) consists of interest income and changes in the fair value of the Company’s warrant liability. Net loss was approximately $11.3 million, or $0.33 per basic and diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, and $5.5 million, or $0.58 per basic and diluted share, in the same period of 2022. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023, was approximately $39.0 million, or $2.36 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of approximately $24.1 million, or $2.87 per basic and diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2022. About PWSThe Prader-Willi Syndrome Association USA estimates that PWS occurs in one in every 15,000 live births. The hallmark symptom of this disorder is hyperphagia, a chronic and life-threatening feeling of intense, persistent hunger, food pre-occupation, extreme drive to food seek and consume food that severely diminish the quality of life for patients with PWS and their families. Additional characteristics of PWS include behavioral problems, cognitive disabilities, low muscle tone, short stature (when not treated with growth hormone), the accumulation of excess body fat, developmental delays, and incomplete sexual development. Hyperphagia can lead to significant morbidities (e.g., obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease) and mortality (e.g., stomach rupture, choking, accidental death due to food seeking behavior). In a global survey conducted by the Foundation for Prader-Willi Research, 96.5% of respondents (parent and caregivers) rated hyperphagia and 92.9% rated body composition as either the most important or a very important symptom to be relieved by a new medicine. There are currently no approved therapies to treat the hyperphagia/appetite, metabolic, cognitive function, or behavioral aspects of the disorder. About DCCR (Diazoxide Choline) Extended-Release TabletsDCCR is a novel, proprietary extended-release dosage form containing the crystalline salt of diazoxide and is administered once-daily. The parent molecule, diazoxide, has been used for decades in thousands of patients in a few rare diseases in neonates, infants, children and adults, but has not been approved for use in PWS. Soleno conceived of and established extensive patent protection for the therapeutic use of diazoxide, diazoxide choline and DCCR in patients with PWS. The DCCR development program is supported by data from five completed Phase 1 clinical studies in healthy volunteers and three completed Phase 2 clinical studies, one of which was in patients with PWS. In the PWS Phase 3 clinical development program, DCCR showed promise in addressing hyperphagia, the hallmark symptom of PWS, as well as several other symptoms such as aggressive/destructive behaviors, fat mass and other metabolic parameters. Diazoxide choline has received Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of PWS in the U.S. and E.U., and Fast Track Designation in the U.S. About Soleno Therapeutics, Inc.Soleno is focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for the treatment of rare diseases. The company’s lead candidate, DCCR extended-release tablets, a once-daily oral tablet for the treatment of PWS, recently completed its Phase 3 development program to support a planned NDA submission.

CBIZ sees the acquisition as a strategic move to meet growing demand for these services. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of CompuData by CBIZ, Inc. represents a strategic move to enhance the company's service offerings in cloud computing, accounting ERP software, managed IT and security. This acquisition is significant as it signals CBIZ's commitment to expanding its technology solutions, which is a growing demand in the market. The addition of CompuData's expertise, particularly as a Sage Diamond Partner and a Microsoft Partner, is likely to strengthen CBIZ's competitive position within the financial, insurance and advisory sectors.From a market perspective, the integration of CompuData's services could enable CBIZ to offer a more comprehensive suite of solutions to its clients. Given that CompuData has established a strong reputation and a $20 million annual revenue stream, the acquisition could potentially lead to increased market share and revenue growth for CBIZ. This move might also appeal to investors looking for companies with diversified and modernized service portfolios. Financial Analyst The financial implications of the acquisition of CompuData by CBIZ include the potential for enhanced earnings per share and improved operational efficiencies. CBIZ's investment in a technology solutions provider suggests an expectation for a return on investment through cross-selling opportunities and expanded client services. The mention of a 'high demand across the country' for services offered by CompuData implies that CBIZ is aiming to meet market needs on a larger scale, which could positively impact its financial performance.However, the costs associated with integrating CompuData, such as potential restructuring expenses and the alignment of corporate cultures, will need to be carefully managed. Investors should monitor the short-term financial metrics post-acquisition, such as changes in operating margins and cash flow, to assess the immediate impact. In the long term, the success of the acquisition will be measured by sustained revenue growth and the successful leveraging of CompuData's client relationships and technological capabilities. Legal Expert The acquisition of CompuData by CBIZ involves legal and regulatory considerations that must be carefully navigated to ensure compliance and minimize risk. Given the industries involved, including financial services and technology, there are likely to be stringent data privacy and cybersecurity regulations that will need to be addressed. The alignment of legal frameworks and the harmonization of compliance standards between CBIZ and CompuData are crucial for the smooth continuation of services to clients.Additionally, due diligence would have been a critical component of the acquisition process, assessing any potential legal liabilities that CompuData may bring. The legal teams will play a pivotal role in the integration phase, ensuring that all contractual obligations with existing clients are maintained and that intellectual property rights are secured. The legal expertise is also essential in navigating any antitrust considerations, although, given the size of the entities involved, significant antitrust hurdles are unlikely. 03/06/2024 - 04:05 PM CLEVELAND, March 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- CBIZ, Inc.

Strong customer demand for new products and efficient inventory management contributed to the company's success.","Lulus Reports Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2023 Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Lulu’s Fashion Lounge Holdings, Inc. (LVLU) reported impressive financial results for Q4 2023 and FY 2023, with significant growth in gross margin, net cash provided by operating activities, and free cash flow. The CEO highlighted the focus on brand awareness, customer reach, and positive revenue momentum. Strong customer demand for new products and efficient inventory management contributed to the company's success. Positive Expanded gross margin in Q4 2023 by 180 bps compared to Q4 2022 Increased net cash provided by operating activities by 149% to $9.2 million in FY 2023 from FY 2022 Grew free cash flow by 867% to $10.3 million in FY 2023 from FY 2022 CEO emphasized focus on improving brand awareness and broadening customer reach Positive sales in high-volume categories and strong reorder product funnel Efficient inventory management in line with sales in Q4 Reduced revolver balance by $17 million in 2023 Negative None. Financial Analyst The substantial expansion in gross margin by 180 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2023 is a strong indicator of Lulus's operational efficiency and pricing strategy effectiveness. This margin improvement suggests that the company has been successful in managing its cost of goods sold or has achieved higher sales prices without proportionately increasing costs. The impact on the stock market can be significant as investors often view gross margin improvements as a sign of potential increased profitability and better financial health.Furthermore, the dramatic increase in net cash provided by operating activities by 149% and free cash flow by 867% in fiscal year 2023 is indicative of robust operational performance. Free cash flow is a crucial metric for investors as it represents the cash a company can generate after accounting for capital expenditures to maintain or expand its asset base. This substantial increase in free cash flow provides the company with greater flexibility for strategic initiatives, such as paying down debt, which is evidenced by the $17 million reduction in the company's revolver balance. This debt reduction can improve the company's leverage ratios and potentially lead to credit rating improvements, which could lower borrowing costs and be favorably received by the market. Market Research Analyst The CEO's focus on core strategic pillars, such as improving brand awareness and broadening customer touchpoints, is crucial for sustaining growth in the highly competitive fashion industry. The reported sequential upward revenue momentum indicates that the company's strategies are resonating with consumers. This is further supported by strong customer demand for new and novelty products, which is a positive sign for future sales trajectories as it feeds into the reorder product funnel.Inventory levels being in line with sales in Q4 reflects the company's data-driven business model, which is pivotal in the fashion industry where trends are transient and inventory mismanagement can lead to markdowns and profit erosion. A data-driven approach can help in accurately forecasting demand and optimizing stock levels, leading to reduced costs and improved customer satisfaction by having the right products available. This operational agility can be a key differentiator for Lulus in the market and may attract investor attention due to its potential to sustainably support growth. Economist The reported financial results of Lulus reflect broader economic trends such as consumer spending patterns and discretionary income allocation. The increase in sales and improved inventory management may suggest a favorable economic environment for the fashion sector, or it could indicate that Lulus is outperforming its competitors. Economic factors such as inflation, employment rates and consumer confidence can have direct impacts on companies like Lulus, which operate in the consumer discretionary sector.Additionally, the ability to significantly reduce debt while expanding operations is an indicator of strong financial discipline and economic foresight. It suggests that the company is not only capitalizing on current market conditions but is also preparing for future economic shifts. The reduction in debt also has macroeconomic implications, as it may contribute to a healthier corporate debt market and reflect positively on consumer discretionary spending resilience. 03/06/2024 - 04:05 PM Expanded Gross Margin in Fourth Quarter 2023 by 180 bps, compared to Fourth Quarter 2022 Grew Fiscal Year 2023 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities by 149%, $9.2 million from Fiscal Year 2022 Grew Fiscal Year 2023 Free Cash Flow by 867%, $10.3 million from Fiscal Year 2022 CHICO, Calif., March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lulu’s Fashion Lounge Holdings, Inc.

Tiffany Smith, CFO of Lulus, said: “The fourth quarter was consistent with seasonal trends for Lulus, marking our typically lowest sales and profit quarter of the year. Our fourth quarter net revenue of $75 million was in line with our expectations for the quarter, while Adjusted EBITDA was pressured due to the relative increase in fixed costs on a smaller base. We saw our Gross Margin expand in the fourth quarter by 180 basis points compared to the same quarter last year, driven mostly by lower promotional activity and by gains in our AOV resulting from higher price point product mix, which was partially offset by higher return rates.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Highlights: Net revenue of $75.0 million, an 18% decrease compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by a 22% decrease in Total Orders Placed with higher return rates offset by higher AOV compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.AOV of $136, an increase of 14% compared to $119 in the fourth quarter of 2022.Gross Margin increased 180 basis points to 39.1% and gross profit decreased 14%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.Net loss of $7.2 million, compared to $5.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022.Adjusted EBITDA of ($2.0) million, compared to ($1.0) million in the fourth quarter of 2022.Net cash used in operating activities was $5.7 million, compared to $10.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022.Free Cash Flow was ($6.7) million, compared to ($11.4) million in the fourth quarter of 2022.

Financial Outlook for Fiscal Year 2024: We expect net revenue to be between $350 million and $370 million, which represents between a -1.5% and 4.2% increase compared to 2023.We expect Adjusted EBITDA to be between $5 million and $8 million, which represents between a 55% and 148% increase compared to 2023.We expect capital expenditures to be between $5 million and $6 million, which represents between a 28% and 54% increase compared to 2023. Forecasting future results or trends is inherently difficult for any business, and actual results or trends may differ materially from those forecasted. Lulus’ outlook is based on current indications for its business. Lulus’ outlook factors in our current best estimates for anticipated headwinds, including those related to the level of demand, spending and returns by our customers, macroeconomic uncertainties, inflation, supply chain pressures, and shipping costs. Given the volatile nature of current consumer demand and potential for further impacts to consumer behavior due to pockets of continued inflation, higher interest rates, the resumption of student loan interest and payments, combined with less predictable consumer purchasing behavior, Lulus’ financial outlook is subject to change.

All statements other than statements of historical or current fact included in this press release are forward-looking statements, including but not limited to statements regarding our opportunities for growth in the coming quarters and our financial outlook for the fiscal year ending December 29, 2024. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees, but involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause Lulus’ actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including but not limited to the following: risks related to our operations and financial results; our ability to successfully maintain our desired merchandise assortment or manage our inventory effectively; demand for our products, including our ability to anticipate, identify, measure, and respond quickly to fashion trends, customer preferences and demands; our ability to anticipate, measure and establish appropriate policies for customer merchandise returns; general economic conditions, including inflation; our fluctuating operating results; seasonality in our business; our ability to acquire products on reasonable terms; our e-commerce business model; our ability to attract and retain customers in a cost effective manner; the strength of our brand; competition; fraud; system interruptions; system security risks including security breaches; and our ability to fulfill orders. These and other important factors discussed under the caption “Risk Factors” in Lulus’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and its other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements made in this press release. Any such forward-looking statements represent management’s estimates as of the date of this press release. While Lulus may elect to update such forward-looking statements at some point in the future, it disclaims any obligation to do so, except as required by law, even if subsequent events cause its views to change. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Operating Metrics To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), we reference in this press release and the accompanying tables the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Net Debt and Free Cash Flow. The presentation of this non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of our ongoing core operating performance. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when analyzing historical performance and liquidity and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures, please see the tables captioned “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” included at the end of this release. Definitions of our non-GAAP financial measures and other operating metrics are presented below. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA guidance to net (loss) income on a forward-looking basis cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts, as we are unable to provide reconciling information with respect to equity-based compensation expense and income tax, all of which are adjustments to Adjusted EBITDA. We also use certain key operating metrics, including Gross Margin, Active Customers, Average Order Value, and Total Orders Placed. Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net (loss) income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted to exclude the effects of equity-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by management to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis and, in the case of exclusion of the impact of equity-based compensation, excludes an item that we do not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA Margin Adjusted EBITDA Margin is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as Adjusted EBITDA (as defined above) as a percentage of our net revenue. Active Customers We define Active Customers as the number of customers who have made at least one purchase across our platform in the prior 12-month period. We consider the number of Active Customers to be a key performance metric on the basis that it is directly related to consumer awareness of our brand, our ability to attract visitors to our digital platform, and our ability to convert visitors to paying customers. Active Customer counts are based on de-duplication logic using customer account and guest checkout name, address, and email information. Average Order Value We define Average Order Value (“AOV”) as the sum of the total gross sales before returns across our platform in a given period, plus shipping revenue, less discounts and markdowns, divided by the Total Orders Placed (as defined below) in that period. AOV reflects average basket size of our customers. AOV may fluctuate as we continue investing in the development and introduction of new Lulus merchandise and as a result of our promotional discount activity. Free Cash Flow Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less cash used for capitalized software development costs and purchases of property and equipment. We view Free Cash Flow as an important indicator of our liquidity because it measures the amount of cash we generate. Gross Margin We define Gross Margin as gross profit as a percentage of our net revenue. Gross profit is equal to our net revenue less cost of revenue. Certain of our competitors and other retailers report cost of revenue differently than we do. As a result, the reporting of our gross profit and Gross Margin may not be comparable to other companies. Net Debt Net Debt is defined as total debt, which currently consists of the revolving line of credit, less cash and cash equivalents. We consider Net Debt to be an important supplemental measure of our financial position, which allows us to analyze our leverage. Total Orders Placed We define Total Orders Placed as the number of customer orders placed across our platform during a particular period. An order is counted on the day the customer places the order. We do not adjust the number of Total Orders Placed for any cancellation or return that may have occurred subsequent to a customer placing an order. We consider Total Orders Placed as a key performance metric on the basis that it is directly related to our ability to attract and retain customers as well as drive purchase frequency. Total Orders Placed, together with AOV, is an indicator of the net revenue we expect to generate in a particular period.

Projected capital investments of $50 - $60 million for 2024 to unlock asset value and enhance profitability. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results announced by Amplify Energy Corp. indicate a robust operational and financial performance for the fourth quarter and full-year 2023. Notably, the company's significant reduction in net debt by approximately $95 million and a net-debt-to-LTM Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.1x demonstrate a strong balance sheet and improved financial leverage. This could potentially enhance the company's creditworthiness and investment attractiveness. Furthermore, the initiation of the Beta development program and the Bairoil marketing process are strategic moves that could lead to future growth and value creation for shareholders. The company's focus on high-return development opportunities and cost reduction measures, such as the establishment of Magnify Energy Services, signal a proactive approach to operational efficiency and margin improvement.From an investor's perspective, the company's ability to generate substantial free cash flow ($38.0 million for the full year) is a positive indicator of financial health and operational efficiency. This free cash flow can be reinvested into the business for further growth or returned to shareholders, which could influence the stock's performance positively. The capital allocation strategy towards high-return development opportunities, particularly at the Beta asset, could lead to enhanced future cash flows, subject to successful execution and favorable market conditions. These factors combined with the company's guidance for 2024 suggest a forward-looking strategy that may be well-received by the market, potentially impacting the stock positively. Energy Market Analyst Amplify Energy Corp.'s report highlights several key operational achievements that are noteworthy from an energy market perspective. The company's year-end 2023 total proved reserves, with a PV-10 value of approximately $757 million at SEC pricing, reflect a solid reserve base that provides a degree of long-term stability and potential for revenue generation. The strategic focus on the Beta development program is particularly relevant given the current energy market dynamics. With an emphasis on enhancing future cash flows and completing emission reduction projects, Amplify is positioning itself to capitalize on the growing demand for cleaner energy solutions and improved operational efficiencies.The marketing process of assets in Bairoil, if successful, could result in asset divestiture that would allow Amplify to further reduce debt and improve its financial flexibility. This move aligns with industry trends where companies streamline their asset portfolios to focus on core areas with higher returns. Additionally, the company's proactive management of its Oklahoma and East Texas assets, as well as the participation in non-operated wells in the Eagle Ford, indicates a strategic approach to managing production and capitalizing on high-return opportunities across its portfolio.It is important to note that while the company's reserves and financial metrics appear strong, the energy sector is inherently volatile and subject to fluctuating commodity prices. Amplify's hedging strategy and its impact on realized prices will be critical in mitigating risks associated with price volatility. As such, the company's future performance will depend on its ability to execute its development plans effectively and navigate the changing energy landscape. Market Research Analyst Amplify Energy Corp.'s establishment of Magnify Energy Services represents a strategic move to improve operational risk management and control operating costs. This vertical integration allows the company to in-source specific oilfield services, which can lead to increased service reliability and reduced expenses, thereby potentially improving profit margins. The reported positive impact on results from Magnify Energy Services, expected to increase in 2024, suggests that the company is effectively leveraging its subsidiary to enhance operational efficiency and financial performance.The company's capital investment strategy, with a projected $50 – $60 million for 2024, focused primarily on the Beta development and facility projects, reflects a targeted approach to capital allocation. By prioritizing projects with high internal rates of return (IRRs) and expected paybacks of less than one year, Amplify is demonstrating a disciplined investment strategy aimed at maximizing shareholder value. The company's guidance for 2024, including capital investments and Adjusted EBITDA projections, provides a clear roadmap for investors and stakeholders, indicating management's confidence in the company's strategic direction and growth prospects.For stakeholders, the emphasis on reducing leverage and evaluating return of capital alternatives could signal potential future shareholder returns, which is an important consideration for investors. The company's strategic initiatives, such as the Beta development program and the Bairoil marketing process, are key factors that could drive substantial value creation. The effectiveness of these initiatives in delivering on their potential will be a critical determinant of the company's ability to sustain and enhance its competitive position in the market. 03/06/2024 - 04:05 PM HOUSTON, March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Amplify Energy Corp. (NYSE: AMPY) (“Amplify,” the “Company,” “us,” or “our”) announced today its operating and financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2023, year-end 2023 proved reserves and guidance for full-year 2024. Key Highlights 2024 strategic updates include: Commenced the Beta development program, with the first well spud in March 2024Initiated the previously announced Bairoil marketing process During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company: Achieved average total production of 20.8 MBoepdGenerated net cash provided by operating activities of $28.4 million and net income of $43.6 millionDelivered Adjusted EBITDA of $25.2 millionGenerated $14.4 million of free cash flow For full-year 2023, the Company: Achieved average total production of 20.5 MBoepdGenerated net cash provided by operating activities of $141.6 million and net income of $392.8 millionDelivered Adjusted EBITDA of $88.0 millionGenerated $38.0 million of free cash flowReduced net-debt by approximately $95 million Amplify’s year-end 2023 total proved reserves, utilizing Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) pricing of $78.22/Bbl for oil and NGLs and $2.64/MMBtu for natural gas, totaled 98 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe) and had a PV-10 value of approximately $757 million At February 22, 2024 strip pricing, the Company’s year-end 2023 proved reserves had a PV-10 value of approximately $574 million As of December 31, 2023, net debt was $94 million, consisting of $115 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility and $21 million of cash and cash equivalents Net Debt to Last Twelve Months (“LTM”) Adjusted EBITDA of 1.1x1 (1) Net debt as of December 31, 2023, and LTM Adjusted EBITDA as of the fourth quarter of 2023 Martyn Willsher, Amplify’s President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “I am proud of all we accomplished at Amplify in 2023, with the Company performing well both operationally and financially during the year. We returned Beta to production safely and effectively and have seen strong results with current average daily production exceeding pre-shutdown levels. We also formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Magnify Energy Services, to provide a variety of oilfield services to Amplify-operated wells, which allows us to better manage operating costs and operational risk. In late 2023, we began to see Magnify’s positive impact on our results, which we expect to increase in 2024. Further, we improved our balance sheet by reducing debt outstanding by approximately $95 million and established a new credit facility with a supportive bank group.” Mr. Willsher added, “We believe 2024 has the potential to be a transformative year for the Company as we execute our strategic initiatives to develop the prolific Beta asset, further reduce leverage, and continue our focus on reducing operating costs. This year we are primarily allocating capital to high-return development opportunities at Beta, which are expected to enhance future cash flows, and toward completing the emission reduction projects at Beta, which will drive further cost efficiencies. Additionally, we recently initiated the marketing process of our assets in Bairoil, the potential sale of which will allow us to further reduce debt outstanding and provide us with the flexibility to accelerate our evaluation of return of capital alternatives. With both the Beta development program and the Bairoil marketing process underway, we are eager to capitalize on these opportunities, which we expect will deliver substantial value to our shareholders.” 2023 Year-End Proved Reserve Update The Company’s estimated proved reserves at SEC pricing for year-end 2023 totaled 98 MMBoe, which consisted of 96 MMBoe of proved developed reserves and 2 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves. Total proved reserves were comprised of 42% oil, 20% NGLs, and 38% natural gas. Of the total proved reserves volumes, 30% are located in Oklahoma, 30% are in East Texas and Northern Louisiana, 24% are in Bairoil, 13% are at Beta, and 3% are in the Eagle Ford (Non-op). At year-end 2023, Amplify’s proved reserves and proved developed reserves had PV-10 values of approximately $757 million and $716 million, respectively, using SEC pricing. Utilizing strip pricing as of February 22, 2024, the Company’s proved reserves and proved developed reserves had PV-10 values of approximately $574 million and $545 million, respectively.

Key Financial Results During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company reported net income of approximately $43.6 million compared to a net loss of $13.4 million in the prior quarter. The increase was primarily attributable to non-cash unrealized gains on commodity derivatives during the period. Amplify generated $25.2 million of Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter, an increase of approximately $5.7 million from $19.5 million in the prior quarter, principally due to lower lease operating expenses and slightly higher oil production. Free cash flow was $14.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 136% versus the prior quarter.

The next regularly scheduled borrowing base redetermination is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2024. Corporate Production and Pricing Update During the fourth quarter of 2023, average daily production was approximately 20.8 MBoepd, an increase of 1% from 20.6 MBoepd in the prior quarter. Beta production was 12% higher than the prior quarter, partially offsetting natural declines in other parts of our portfolio. The Company’s product mix for the quarter was 41% crude oil, 18% NGLs, and 41% natural gas. For the full-year 2023, the Company produced 20.5 MBoepd which was within our full-year guidance range.

The Company also benefited from a $1.5 million accounting adjustment at Beta. For the full-year 2023, lease operating expenses were approximately $139.6 million, or $18.66 per Boe. Cost reduction efforts during the year allowed the Company to perform better than the mid-point of the guidance range. These efforts are expected to continue through 2024 and beyond. Severance and Ad Valorem taxes in the fourth quarter were approximately $5.9 million, an increase of $1.0 million compared to $4.9 million in the prior quarter. Severance and Ad Valorem taxes as a percentage of revenue were approximately 7.6% this quarter compared to 6.5% in the previous quarter. For the full-year 2023, Severance and Ad Valorem taxes were approximately $21.3 million, or 7.4% as a percentage of revenue, which was lower than the mid-point of our guidance range. Amplify incurred $5.1 million, or $2.66 per Boe, of gathering, processing and transportation expenses in the fourth quarter, compared to $5.0 million, or $2.63 per Boe, in the previous quarter. For the full-year 2023, gathering, processing and transportation expenses were approximately $20.8 million, or $2.78 per Boe, and were lower than the mid-point of our guidance range. Fourth quarter Cash G&A expenses were $6.2 million, a decrease of $0.3 million from $6.5 million in the prior quarter. For the full-year 2023, Cash G&A expenses were $26.4 million, or $3.53 per Boe, and were within our guidance range. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the fourth quarter totaled $7.6 million, or $4.00 per Boe, compared to $7.5 million, or $3.95 per Boe, in the prior quarter. Net interest expense was $3.8 million this quarter, a decrease of $0.7 million from $4.5 million in the prior quarter. Amplify recorded current income tax benefit of $2.3 million for the fourth quarter. In 2023, Amplify incurred approximately $4.8 million in cash income taxes. Going forward we expect to continue maintaining a cash income tax paying position. Capital Investment Update Cash capital investment during the fourth quarter of 2023 was approximately $7.1 million, a $2.6 million decrease from $9.7 million in the prior quarter. The majority of capital investment in the fourth quarter related to workover and facility projects at Beta. Also in the fourth quarter, the Company farmed out deep rights in certain acreage in East Texas for receipts of $1.2 million, which is reflected as a reduction to capital investments. For the full-year 2023, Amplify’s capital investments totaled $33.7 million, which was lower than the midpoint of our guidance. Capital was primarily directed to well workover projects, along with emissions and cost reducing facility projects at Beta. The following table details Amplify’s capital incurred during the fourth quarter and full-year 2023: Fourth Quarter Full-Year 2023 Capital 2023 Capital ($ MM) ($ MM)Bairoil $(0.1) $3.5 Beta $7.7 $19.0 Oklahoma $0.5 $4.7 East Texas / North Louisiana $(1.2) $(0.6)Eagle Ford (Non-op) $0.2 $7.1 Total Capital Invested $7.1 $33.7 2024 Operations & Development Plan The following table details Amplify’s 2024 projected capital investments of $50 – $60 million: Capital Investment by Type (% of Total): Beta Development 40% Beta Facility 26% Workovers & Other Facilities 29% Non-op Development 5% Total Capital Investments: 100% Amplify’s 2024 operations and development plan is designed to further unlock the underlying value of the Company’s assets. We intend to do this by executing a limited development program and completing the large facility projects at Beta, executing on low-cost, high-return workover projects, and continuing to reduce operating costs through cost saving initiatives utilizing Magnify Energy Services. In the first quarter of 2024, Amplify initiated the previously announced four-well development program at Beta. If successful, the program is expected to yield substantial upside for the Company and bolster long-term profitability and operating margins. Initial production results for the first two wells are expected in the second quarter of 2024, with the final two wells coming online in the fourth quarter. At current oil prices, these wells project IRRs in excess of 100% and expected paybacks of less than one year. Additionally, the Company is deploying capital to facility projects at Beta which will improve operational efficiencies, reduce power expenses and significantly reduce emissions. By the end of 2024, the Company expects to see an increase in oil production and a lower cost structure at Beta which will materially increase the long-term value of the asset. At Bairoil, we continue to focus on enhancing water-alternating-gas injection performance through targeted well recompletions and conversions, which helps offset the asset’s nominal production declines. Furthermore, prior facility investments and enhanced operational efficiencies have enabled the Company to reduce the frequency of planned maintenance turnarounds, which will substantially reduce capital costs and production downtime. Amplify’s operating strategy in Oklahoma remains focused on prioritizing a stable free cash flow profile by managing production through an active workover program, artificial lift enhancements, extending well run-times and continuing to reduce operating costs. In East Texas, we continue to focus on prudent management of the field, such as optimizing field compression, artificial lift enhancement, and equipment insourcing, which is expected to improve the production profile and lower lease operating costs. Should natural gas prices improve throughout the year, the Company has the ability to opportunistically exploit additional workover opportunities and participate in non-operated development prospects in the basin. In August 2023, we formed Magnify Energy Services to in-source specific oilfield services to improve service reliability and to reduce overall operating expenses for the Company. For 2023, Magnify added $0.5 million to Adjusted EBITDA. In 2024, we expect to invest $1.0 million of capital in Magnify, which is projected to generate approximately $2 – $3 million of Adjusted EBITDA and to partially offset operating expenses. In the Eagle Ford, Amplify expects to participate in approximately 0.5 – 1.0 net non-operated wells with highly accretive returns, which are currently scheduled to be drilled in late 2024 and completed in the first half of 2025. Full-Year 2024 Guidance The following guidance is subject to the cautionary statements and limitations described under the ""Forward-Looking Statements"" caption at the end of this press release. Amplify's 2024 guidance is based on its current expectations regarding capital investment levels and flat commodity prices for crude oil of $75/Bbl (WTI) and natural gas of $2.50/MMBtu (Henry Hub), and on the assumption that market demand and prices for oil and natural gas will continue at levels that allow for economic production of these products. Additionally, the Company expects to invest 85% to 95% of its capital in the first three quarters of the year primarily in connection with the Beta development program. A summary of the guidance is presented below: FY 2024E Low High Net Average Daily Production Oil (MBbls/d) 8.0 - 8.9 NGL (MBbls/d) 3.0 - 3.3 Natural Gas (MMcf/d) 47.0 - 52.5 Total (MBoe/d) 19.0 - 21.0 Commodity Price Differential / Realizations (Unhedged) Oil Differential ($ / Bbl) ($2.75) - ($3.50) NGL Realized Price (% of WTI NYMEX) 27% - 30% Natural Gas Realized Price (% of Henry Hub) 85% - 92% Other Revenue Magnify Energy Services ($ MM)$2 - $4 Gathering, Processing and Transportation Costs Oil ($ / Bbl) $0.70 - $0.90 NGL ($ / Bbl) $2.75 - $3.75 Natural Gas ($ / Mcf) $0.55 - $0.75 Total ($ / Boe) $2.30 - $2.90 Average Costs Lease Operating ($ / Boe)$18.50 - $20.50 Taxes (% of Revenue)(1) 6.5% - 7.5% Cash General and Administrative ($ / Boe)(2)(3)$3.30 - $3.80 Adjusted EBITDA ($ MM)(2)(3)$90 - $110 Cash Interest Expense ($ MM)$10 - $15 Capital Expenditures ($ MM)$50 - $60 Free Cash Flow ($ MM)(2)(3)$20 - $40 (1) Includes production, ad valorem and franchise taxes(2) Refer to “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for Amplify’s definition and use of Cash G&A, Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow, non-GAAP measures (cash income taxes, which are not included in free cash flow, are expected to range between $4 - $8 million for the year)(3) Amplify believes that a quantitative reconciliation of such forward-looking information to the most comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP cannot be made available without unreasonable efforts. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures would require Amplify to predict the timing and likelihood of future transactions and other items that are difficult to accurately predict.

Amplify defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss, plus interest expense; income tax expenses; depreciation, depletion and amortization; accretion of asset retirement obligations; gains or losses on commodity derivatives; cash settlements received on or paid expired commodity derivatives; amortization of gains associated with terminated commodity derivatives; acquisition and divestiture related costs; share-based compensation expenses; exploration costs; loss on settlement of AROs; bad debt expense; pipeline incident loss; pipeline incident settlement; LOPI-timing differences; litigation settlement; and net operating cash flows, effective date to closing for acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA is commonly used as a supplemental financial measure by management and external users of Amplify’s financial statements, such as investors, research analysts and rating agencies, to assess: (1) its operating performance as compared to other companies in Amplify’s industry without regard to financing methods, capital structures or historical cost basis; (2) the ability of its assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest and support Amplify’s indebtedness; and (3) the viability of projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities. Since Adjusted EBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income or loss and because these measures may vary among other companies, the Adjusted EBITDA data presented in this press release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow. Amplify defines free cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA, less cash interest expense and capital expenditures. Free cash flow is an important non-GAAP financial measure for Amplify’s investors since it serves as an indicator of the Company’s success in providing a cash return on investment. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to free cash flow are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Net debt. Amplify defines net debt as the total principal amount drawn on the revolving credit facility less cash and cash equivalents. The Company uses net debt as a measure of financial position and believes this measure provides useful additional information to investors to evaluate the Company's capital structure and financial leverage.PV-10. PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents the present value of estimated future cash inflows from proved oil and natural gas reserves that are calculated using the unweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-the-month prices for the prior 12 months, less future development and operating costs, discounted at 10% per annum to reflect the timing of future cash flows. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to PV-10 is standardized measure. PV-10 differs from standardized measure in its treatment of estimated future income taxes, which are excluded from PV-10. Amplify believes the presentation of PV-10 provides useful information because it is widely used by investors in evaluating oil and natural gas companies without regard to specific income tax characteristics of such entities. PV-10 is not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated proved reserves. PV-10 should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure as defined under GAAP. The Company also presents PV-10 at strip pricing, which is PV-10 adjusted for price sensitivities. As GAAP does not prescribe a comparable GAAP measure for PV-10 of reserves adjusted for pricing sensitivities, it is not practicable for us to reconcile PV-10 at strip pricing to a standardized measure or any other GAAP measure. Cash G&A. Amplify defines Cash G&A as general and administrative expense, less share-based compensation expense; acquisition and divestiture costs; bad debt expense; and severance payments. Cash G&A is an important non-GAAP financial measure for Amplify’s investors since it allows for analysis of G&A spend without regard to share-based compensation and other non-recurring expenses which can vary substantially from company to company. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to Cash G&A is total G&A expenses.

About Rhythm PharmaceuticalsRhythm is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to transforming the lives of patients and their families living with rare neuroendocrine diseases. Rhythm’s lead asset, IMCIVREE® (setmelanotide), an MC4R agonist designed to treat hyperphagia and severe obesity, is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for chronic weight management in adult and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with monogenic or syndromic obesity due to pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 (PCSK1) or leptin receptor (LEPR) deficiency confirmed by genetic testing, or patients with a clinical diagnosis of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS). Both the European Commission (EC) and the UK’s Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) have authorized setmelanotide for the treatment of obesity and the control of hunger associated with genetically confirmed BBS or genetically confirmed loss-of-function biallelic POMC, including PCSK1, deficiency or biallelic LEPR deficiency in adults and children 6 years of age and above. Additionally, Rhythm is advancing a broad clinical development program for setmelanotide in other rare diseases, as well as investigational MC4R agonists LB54640 and RM-718, and a preclinical suite of small molecules for the treatment of congenital hyperinsulinism. Rhythm’s headquarters is in Boston, MA. Setmelanotide IndicationIn the United States, setmelanotide is indicated for chronic weight management in adult and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with monogenic or syndromic obesity due to POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR deficiency as determined by an FDA-approved test demonstrating variants in POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR genes that are interpreted as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or of uncertain significance (VUS) or BBS. In the European Union, setmelanotide is indicated for the treatment of obesity and the control of hunger associated with genetically confirmed BBS or loss-of-function biallelic POMC, including PCSK1, deficiency or biallelic LEPR deficiency in adults and children 6 years of age and above. In Europe, setmelanotide should be prescribed and supervised by a physician with expertise in obesity with underlying genetic etiology. Limitations of Use Setmelanotide is not indicated for the treatment of patients with the following conditions as setmelanotide would not be expected to be effective: Obesity due to suspected POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR deficiency with POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR variants classified as benign or likely benignOther types of obesity not related to POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR deficiency, or BBS, including obesity associated with other genetic syndromes and general (polygenic) obesity. Contraindication Prior serious hypersensitivity to setmelanotide or any of the excipients in IMCIVREE. Serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) have been reported. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Skin Pigmentation and Darkening of Pre-Existing Nevi: Generalized increased skin pigmentation and darkening of pre-existing nevi have occurred because of its pharmacologic effect. Full body skin examinations prior to initiation and periodically during treatment should be conducted to monitor pre-existing and new pigmentary lesions. Heart rate and blood pressure monitoring: In Europe, heart rate and blood pressure should be monitored as part of standard clinical practice at each medical visit (at least every 6 months) for patients treated with setmelanotide. Disturbance in Sexual Arousal: Spontaneous penile erections in males and sexual adverse reactions in females have occurred. Patients who have an erection lasting longer than 4 hours should seek emergency medical attention. Depression and Suicidal Ideation: Depression and suicidal ideation have occurred. Patients should be monitored for new onset or worsening depression or suicidal thoughts or behaviors. Consideration should be given to discontinuing setmelanotide if patients experience suicidal thoughts or behaviors, or clinically significant or persistent depression symptoms occur. Hypersensitivity Reactions: Serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) have been reported. If suspected, advise patients to promptly seek medical attention and discontinue setmelanotide. Pediatric Population: The prescribing physician should periodically assess response to setmelanotide therapy. In growing children, the impact of weight loss on growth and maturation should be evaluated. In Europe, the prescribing physician should monitor growth (height and weight) using age- and sex-appropriate growth curves. Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative in Neonates and Low Birth Weight Infants: Setmelanotide is not approved for use in neonates or infants. Serious and fatal adverse reactions including “gasping syndrome” can occur in neonates and low birth weight infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs. ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥20%) included skin hyperpigmentation, injection site reactions, nausea, headache, diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, depression, and spontaneous penile erection. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Not recommended when breastfeeding.

Despite the decline, the company remains optimistic about future growth opportunities in the refrigerant industry.","Hudson Technologies Reports Fourth Quarter and Year End 2023 Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Hudson Technologies, Inc. reported a decrease in revenues for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023, attributed to lower selling prices for certain refrigerants. Despite the decline, the company remains optimistic about future growth opportunities in the refrigerant industry. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported decrease in revenues and gross margin for Hudson Technologies indicates a pressured fiscal environment, likely due to competitive pricing dynamics within the refrigerant industry. The 11% year-over-year decline in revenue and the reduction in gross margin from 50% to 39% suggest a significant impact on profitability. The drop in operating income from $131.5 million to $78.2 million underscores challenges in maintaining operational efficiency amid fluctuating market conditions.However, the company's ability to fully pay off its term loan debt and improve stockholders’ equity from $174.9 million to $228.8 million demonstrates a robust balance sheet and financial prudence. The cash flow from operations of $58.5 million is a positive sign of liquidity, which is critical for sustaining operations and investing in strategic initiatives.Investors should note the one-time increase in revenue from the DLA contract, which may not recur in 2024, potentially affecting future earnings. The company's optimism regarding the American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act and potential reclamation mandates could signal a strategic advantage for Hudson Technologies if regulatory changes increase demand for reclaimed refrigerants. Market Research Analyst The refrigerant industry is undergoing a transformation driven by environmental regulations and the shift towards greener refrigerants. Hudson Technologies' long-standing position and commitment to sustainable solutions position it well to capitalize on these trends. The AIM Act and proposed Refrigerant Management rule could stimulate the market for reclaimed refrigerants, offering growth opportunities for companies like Hudson that have established reclamation technologies.The company's anticipation of higher demand due to these regulations could be a key driver for future growth. However, investors should consider the potential for market saturation and competitive pressures as other players in the industry may also ramp up their reclamation capabilities in response to the legislative environment. Environmental Policy Expert The regulatory landscape for refrigerants is becoming increasingly stringent due to the global push to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The AIM Act's stepdown in HFC production and consumption aligns with international efforts under the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. Hudson's focus on reclaimed refrigerants is not only environmentally responsible but also strategically aligned with these regulatory changes.Understanding the nuances of the AIM Act and state-level legislation is crucial for stakeholders to assess Hudson's potential to benefit from increased demand for reclaimed refrigerants. The company's proactive approach to these regulations, through both technology and advocacy, could enhance its market position and create a competitive moat.While the environmental benefits of such legislation are clear, the economic implications for the refrigerant industry and for companies like Hudson Technologies will depend on the finalization and enforcement of the proposed rules. The speed at which the industry can adapt to these changes will also play a significant role in determining the long-term success of Hudson's business strategy. 03/06/2024 - 04:05 PM WOODCLIFF LAKE, N.J., March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hudson Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: HDSN) announced results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, Hudson reported revenues of $44.9 million, a decrease of 5% compared to revenues of $47.4 million in the comparable 2022 period. The decrease is primarily related to decreased selling prices for certain refrigerants, offset by slightly higher volume. Gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 31%, compared to 32% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Hudson reported operating income of $4.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to operating income of $7.1 million in the prior year period. The Company recorded net income of $3.9 million or $0.09 per basic and $0.08 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to net income of $5.1 million or $0.11 per basic and diluted share in the same period of 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2023, Hudson reported revenues of $289.0 million, a decrease of 11% compared to revenues of $325.2 million for full year 2022. Revenue for the full year 2023 declined primarily related to decreased selling prices for certain refrigerants. Included in the full year 2023 revenues was approximately $53 million from the Company’s Defense Logistics Agency (“DLA”) contract, which represented a record annual revenue from the contract. The Company estimates that approximately $20 million of 2023 DLA revenue is related to increased DLA-specific program activities that may not be repeated in 2024. Gross margin for full year 2023 was 39%, compared to gross margin of 50% in the prior year period. Hudson reported operating income of $78.2 million for full year 2023 compared to operating income of $131.5 million in the prior year. The Company recorded net income of $52.2 million or $1.15 per basic and $1.10 per diluted share in 2023, compared to a net income of $103.8 million or $2.31 per basic and $2.20 per diluted share in 2022. As previously announced, Hudson fully paid off its remaining $32.5 million of term loan debt during the third quarter of 2023. Stockholders’ equity improved to $228.8 million at December 31, 2023 compared to $174.9 million at December 31, 2022. Brian F. Coleman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Hudson Technologies commented, “We delivered a solid fourth quarter consistent with historical fourth quarter performance, which is typically our lowest revenue quarter because it falls outside of our nine-month selling season. Despite a 24% decline in pricing during Q4 2023 when compared to Q4 2022, revenues were only down 5%, stemming from higher volume and increased revenues from our DLA contract. Furthermore, for the full year 2023 the business generated cash flow from operations of $58.5 million.” “We remain optimistic that the ongoing stepdown in HFC production and consumption allowances and the proposed reclamation mandates as a result of the AIM Act will benefit our business. The stepdown in virgin production and consumption now represents 40% of the baseline for 2024 through 2028. As we’ve previously mentioned, we believe that the proposed Refrigerant Management rule will drive higher demand for our reclaimed refrigerants due to the mandates for the use of reclaimed refrigerants in certain sectors. We believe a final rule will be issued this summer. Likewise, we are encouraged by existing and proposed legislation at both the federal and various state levels that promotes the use of reclaimed refrigerant. “Hudson has held a leadership role in the refrigerant industry for more than thirty years, and we have long been committed to developing sustainable solutions around responsible refrigerant management and the adoption of reclamation. We are uniquely positioned to leverage our expertise and industry-leading reclamation technology to help drive the transition to more efficient cooling equipment and greener refrigerants, while also servicing the existing installed base with reclaimed refrigerants as the industry continues to evolve,” Mr. Coleman concluded.

Market Research Analyst GEN Restaurant Group's reported revenue growth of 10.4% year-over-year indicates an expanding market presence, particularly significant given the 1.7% decrease in comparable restaurant sales. The expansion strategy, as evidenced by the opening of six new restaurants, suggests a focus on geographical diversification and increased market penetration. However, the increased operating expenses, including higher payroll and occupancy costs, could signal margin pressures moving forward. The competitive landscape in the casual dining sector requires careful monitoring of cost structures to maintain profitability, especially in high-rent markets like Las Vegas and New York.Investors may view the mixed financial results—growth in revenue alongside a net income loss—as indicative of a transitional phase, with potential for future profitability hinging on successful management of operational costs and execution of the growth strategy. The emphasis on enhanced guest experiences and the transition to a new distribution partner could lead to improved operational efficiencies and customer loyalty, contributing positively to the long-term outlook. Financial Analyst The disclosed financials reveal that the total restaurant operating expenses before pre-opening expenses as a percentage of revenue have risen notably, which could be a concern for investors focused on cost control and margin improvement. The decrease in cost of goods sold due to favorable commodity pricing and vendor negotiations is a positive development, but the rise in payroll and benefits costs due to minimum wage increases and higher costs associated with training new staff is a potential headwind.Furthermore, the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue, while possibly indicative of investments in infrastructure and management, necessitates careful scrutiny to ensure these costs are aligned with long-term strategic goals. The reported adjusted EBITDA, a key metric for evaluating a company's operating performance, shows a modest figure when considering pre-opening expenses, which may affect investor confidence in the company's current profitability and cash flow generation capabilities. Legal Expert GEN Restaurant Group's reliance on non-GAAP measures such as adjusted EBITDA and restaurant-level adjusted EBITDA necessitates a clear understanding of these metrics. While these measures can provide insights into the company's operating performance by excluding certain non-cash and non-operational items, they are not standardized across the industry and can vary in calculation from one company to another. It is crucial for stakeholders to understand the adjustments made in these non-GAAP measures to fully assess the company's financial health and compare it accurately with peers.Investors should also consider the legal and regulatory environment surrounding the casual dining industry, particularly with respect to labor laws and minimum wage regulations, as these can have a direct impact on operating expenses and overall profitability. The company's proactive management of these factors, including its response to increased minimum wage rates, will be critical in mitigating legal and financial risks. 03/06/2024 - 04:05 PM CERRITOS, Calif., March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GEN Restaurant Group, Inc.

The following definitions apply to terms as used in this release: Comparable restaurant sales refers to the change in period-over-period sales for the comparable restaurant base. We include restaurants in the comparable restaurant base that have been in operation for at least 12 full months prior to the accounting period presented. Once a restaurant has been open 12 full months, it must have had continuous operations during both the current period and the prior year period being measured to remain a comparable restaurant. If operations were to be substantially impacted by unusual events that closed the location or significantly changed its capacity, that location is excluded from the comparable sales calculation until it has been operating continuously under normal conditions for both the current period and the prior year comparison period. Payback Period refers to the number of years required to recover the original cash investment. Total restaurant operating expenses includes food cost, payroll & benefits, occupancy, operating, depreciation and amortization, and pre-opening costs. Non-GAAP Measures Restaurant-level adjusted EBITDA represents income (loss) from operations plus adjustments to add-back the following expenses: depreciation and amortization, pre-opening costs, general and administrative expenses, related party consulting fees, management fees and non-cash lease expense. Management believes that restaurant-level adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because this measure highlights trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent to investors when relying solely on GAAP financial measures and enabling investors to more effectively compare the Company’s performance to prior and future periods. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and consulting fees paid to a related party and we also exclude non-recurring items, such as stock-based compensation expense, gain on extinguishment of debt, and Restaurant Revitalization Fund, or RRF, grants, employee retention credits, litigation accruals, aborted deferred IPO costs written off, non-cash lease expenses and non-cash lease expense related to pre-opening costs. Management believes that restaurant-level adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because this measure highlights trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent to investors when relying solely on GAAP financial measures and enabling investors to more effectively compare the Company’s performance to prior and future periods .

CEO David Heard highlighted strong performance, with expectations of revenue growth, margin expansion, and earnings per share growth for 2023. Positive None. Negative The Company disclosed material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, affecting disclosure controls and procedures. Ernst & Young LLP raised concerns regarding SSP methodology, revenue allocation, and documentation retention, leading to delays in filing financial reports. Infinera's outlook for Q1 2024 forecasts revenue of $320-350 million, GAAP net loss per diluted share of ($0.25)-($0.17), and non-GAAP net loss per diluted share of ($0.18)-($0.10). The Company faces challenges in maintaining effective internal controls and procedures due to identified material weaknesses. Financial Analyst Examining Infinera Corporation's preliminary financial results, a notable aspect is the revenue surpassing the previously provided outlook, indicating a positive trend in the company's sales performance. The increase in gross margin projections to near 40% suggests an improvement in cost management and profitability. However, the operating margin forecast shows a potential contraction, which could be a concern for operational efficiency. The forecasted GAAP net income per diluted share indicates a possible break-even scenario, which is critical for investor confidence.From a financial perspective, the company's ability to continue its revenue growth streak into a sixth year is commendable, especially in a competitive tech landscape. The mention of 'major hyperscale-influenced strategic wins' could signal significant future revenue streams, although the expected slow first half of the year warrants caution for short-term expectations. The preliminary cash and cash equivalents position provides insight into the company's liquidity status, which is crucial for meeting short-term obligations and funding ongoing operations. Market Research Analyst The telecommunications equipment sector, where Infinera operates, is highly sensitive to technological advancements and customer acquisition. The CEO's statement regarding 'design wins' and 'hyperscale-influenced strategic wins' suggests that Infinera is effectively leveraging industry trends, such as the demand for high-capacity networks driven by cloud computing and big data analytics. These wins could enhance the company's market share and brand reputation.However, the projected slow first half of the year reflects broader industry cycles and possibly macroeconomic factors affecting capital expenditure decisions by clients. Investors should consider these industry dynamics when evaluating Infinera's outlook. The anticipation of a stronger second half is a common cyclical pattern in tech industries, potentially aligning with budget cycles and project implementations. Legal Expert The disclosure of internal control weaknesses over financial reporting is a serious concern, as it raises questions about the reliability of financial statements. The acknowledgment of material weaknesses specifically related to revenue and inventory cycles could imply significant risks in financial reporting accuracy. This situation may attract regulatory scrutiny and necessitate remediation plans to restore stakeholder trust.Furthermore, the late filing notification and subsequent amendments to previous filings suggest potential compliance issues. These developments could impact investor sentiment and the company's reputation. It is essential for Infinera to address these concerns promptly and transparently to maintain regulatory compliance and investor relations. 03/06/2024 - 04:03 PM SAN JOSE, Calif., March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Infinera Corporation (NASDAQ: INFN) (""Infinera"" or the “Company”) today released preliminary financial results for its fourth quarter ended December 30, 2023.

Infinera CEO David Heard said, “We ended 2023 on a high note with a strong fourth quarter during which the midpoints of our preliminary revenue, gross margin, and earnings per share ranges are all expected to come in above those of our prior outlook ranges. For the full year of 2023, we expect to deliver our sixth consecutive year of revenue growth, expand gross margin to a level approaching 40%, and grow earnings per share on a year-over-year basis.” “As we look ahead, like the rest of the industry, we are expecting a slow first half of the year. Regardless, both the pace and scale of our design wins are accelerating. Already, in the first 60 days of 2024, we have achieved major hyperscale-influenced strategic wins, one of which is among the most significant in the Company’s history, based on our Systems and Subsystems solutions. These strategic wins, combined with our design win funnel, position us well to deliver a stronger second half and place us on a path to achieve our seventh consecutive year of revenue growth with continued margin and earnings per share expansion,” continued Mr. Heard.

Subsequently, EY raised questions regarding the Company’s stand-alone sales price (“SSP”) methodology as it relates to revenue allocation between product revenue, which is recognized upon delivery, and certain components of services revenue, which is amortized over a period of time. In addition, EY raised questions regarding the sufficiency of documentation retained by the Company related to the revenue portion of its quote to cash cycle (revenue cycle) and its inventory cycle. As a result of these queries, the Company reexamined its SSP methodology and engaged in an evaluation of its review procedures related to its revenue cycle and its inventory cycle. Subsequently, the Company’s management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, there were material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting related to its revenue cycle, inventory cycle, and with respect to these, its internal resources, expertise and policies required to maintain an effective control environment. As a result, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective, as of December 31, 2022, and continues to be ineffective, and these material weaknesses are unremediated to date. Furthermore, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have determined that because of these material weaknesses, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at a reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2022, April 1, 2023, July 1, 2023 and September 30, 2023. On February 29, 2024, the Company filed a Form 10-K/A for the period ended December 31, 2022, a Form 10-Q/A for the period ended April 1, 2023, a Form 10-Q/A for the period ended July 1, 2023 and a Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2023. The Company intends to delay the filing of its Form 10-K until the Company completes its year-end closing procedures in light of the delays caused by the circumstances described above.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information In addition to disclosing financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), this press release and the accompanying tables contain certain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude in certain cases stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and restructuring and other related costs. Infinera believes these adjustments are appropriate to enhance an overall understanding of its underlying financial performance and also its prospects for the future and are considered by management for the purpose of making operational decisions. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release are the primary indicators management uses as a basis for its planning and forecasting of future periods. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, operating margin, net income (loss) and net income (loss) per common share prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and are subject to limitations. Infinera has included forward-looking non-GAAP information in this press release, including an estimate of certain non-GAAP financial measures for the first quarter of 2024 that excludes stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and restructuring and other related costs. A reconciliation of preliminary GAAP to non-GAAP financials for the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024 is included in the table below.

(2) Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of customer relationships acquired in connection with the acquisition of Coriant. GAAP accounting requires that acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value and amortized over their useful lives. As this amortization is non-cash, Infinera has excluded it from its preliminary non-GAAP gross profit, operating expenses and net income measures. Management believes the amortization of acquired intangible assets is not indicative of ongoing operating performance and its exclusion provides a better indication of Infinera's underlying business performance. (3) Restructuring and other related costs are primarily associated with the reduction of operating costs and the reduction of headcount. Management has excluded the impact of these charges in arriving at Infinera's non-GAAP results as they are non-recurring in nature and its exclusion provides a better indication of Infinera's underlying business performance.

Zai Lab to Present Final Overall Survival (OS) Data from Phase 3 NORA Study of ZEJULA (niraparib) in Platinum-Sensitive Recurrent Ovarian Cancer (PSROC),2024-03-06T21:01:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Zai Lab Limited to present final overall survival data from the Phase 3 NORA study on ZEJULA at 2024 ESGO and SGO conferences, showcasing the benefit of niraparib maintenance therapy for Chinese patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer.","Zai Lab to Present Final Overall Survival (OS) Data from Phase 3 NORA Study of ZEJULA (niraparib) in Platinum-Sensitive Recurrent Ovarian Cancer (PSROC) Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags conferences clinical trial Rhea-AI Summary Zai Lab Limited to present final overall survival data from the Phase 3 NORA study on ZEJULA at 2024 ESGO and SGO conferences, showcasing the benefit of niraparib maintenance therapy for Chinese patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The final overall survival (OS) data from the NORA study on ZEJULA® (niraparib) is of particular interest to the field of gynecological oncology. The study's focus on platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer (PSROC) addresses a significant challenge in cancer treatment, as PSROC is known for its high relapse rate after initial chemotherapy. The use of niraparib, a PARP inhibitor, as maintenance therapy could potentially extend the time patients live without their cancer worsening. This is particularly noteworthy as the study indicates efficacy regardless of BRCA mutation status, which broadens the potential applicability of the treatment to a wider patient population.Understanding the nuances of individualized starting doses (ISD) based on patient weight and platelet count is crucial, as it suggests a tailored approach to treatment that could minimize side effects while maximizing efficacy. The absence of new safety signals in the long-term follow-up is reassuring for both patients and clinicians, as it suggests a stable safety profile for niraparib in this context. Medical Research Analyst The NORA study's final OS findings have implications for the future of PARP inhibitors in oncology. The data showing a favorable OS trend with niraparib maintenance therapy may influence clinical practice and treatment guidelines, potentially leading to increased usage of niraparib in the management of PSROC. It is essential to scrutinize the statistical significance of the OS trend and compare it with existing therapies to evaluate the true clinical benefit offered by niraparib.From a research perspective, the methodology of the study, including the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, lends credibility to the results. However, it is important to assess the generalizability of the findings to populations beyond the Chinese patients studied, considering genetic and environmental factors that may affect treatment response. Market Research Analyst The announcement of the final OS data for ZEJULA® in the PSROC setting could potentially impact Zai Lab Limited's market position. As a PARP inhibitor approved for maintenance monotherapy in both first-line and recurrent settings, ZEJULA® stands to gain a competitive edge in the oncology market if the final OS data confirms its clinical benefits. The market will be closely monitoring the detailed results and their implications for market share, pricing and insurance coverage.Investors will be interested in the potential for increased sales and market penetration, particularly in China, where the study was conducted, as well as in global markets. The ability to market ZEJULA® without biomarker status restrictions could significantly expand the target patient population, thereby influencing Zai Lab's financial outlook and stock performance. 03/06/2024 - 04:01 PM - Findings will be shared in oral presentations at the 2024 Congress of the European Society of Gynaecological Oncology (ESGO) and the 2024 Society for Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) Annual Meeting on Women’s Cancer - SHANGHAI & CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Zai Lab Limited (NASDAQ: ZLAB; HKEX: 9688) today announced that the final overall survival (OS) data from the Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled NORA study evaluating ZEJULA® (niraparib) in Chinese patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer (PSROC) will be shared in oral presentations at the 2024 Congress of the European Society of Gynaecological Oncology (ESGO), March 7-10, 2024, in Barcelona, Spain, and the 2024 Society for Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) Annual Meeting on Women’s Cancer, taking place March 16-18, 2024, in San Diego, CA. “Previous progression-free survival and interim OS data from the NORA study demonstrated the benefit of niraparib maintenance therapy with an individualized starting dose among Chinese patients with PSROC,” said Dr. Rafael Amado, President, Head of Global Oncology Research and Development, Zai Lab. “We look forward to sharing the final OS findings from this study at both the 2024 ESGO and SGO conferences. Based on these results, ZEJULA remains the only PARP inhibitor approved as maintenance monotherapy for ovarian cancer patients in both first-line and recurrent settings regardless of biomarker status.” In the NORA study, 265 patients with PSROC were randomized (2:1) to receive niraparib or placebo. The final OS analysis was conducted after ≥ 50% of OS events occurred in the intent-to-treat population. The ESGO presentation will feature data analyses showing that niraparib maintenance therapy with an individualised starting dose (ISD) based on patient weight and platelet count demonstrated a favorable OS trend versus placebo in this disease setting, regardless of BRCA-gene mutation status. No new safety signals were identified during the long-term follow up period subsequent to the primary analysis. Details regarding the oral presentation at the 2024 ESGO Congress are as follows: Title: Niraparib maintenance therapy using an individualised starting dose in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer (NORA): Final overall survival analysis of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial Presenter: Xiaohua Wu, M.D., PhD., Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China Date/Time: Saturday, March 9, 2024, 4:13 p.m. – 4:19 p.m. CET/Spain Location: Session Hall III (112) Details regarding the late-breaking oral presentation at the 2024 SGO Annual Meeting are as follows: Title: Niraparib maintenance therapy using an individualized starting dose in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer (NORA): Final overall survival analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial Presenter: Xiaohua Wu, M.D., PhD., Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China Date/Time: Monday, March 18, 2024, 3:24 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. Pacific Time Location: San Diego Convention Center, Hall F About Ovarian Cancer Ovarian cancer is one of the most common gynecologic cancers in China with more than 55,000 newly diagnosed cases and 37,000 deaths each year. While platinum-based chemotherapy is effective at inducing an initial response in ovarian cancer, the disease will recur in the majority of women. New agents that prolong the duration of response following platinum-based treatment and delay the inevitable relapse of ovarian cancer will benefit patients with ovarian cancer in China. About ZEJULA (niraparib) ZEJULA (niraparib) is an oral, once-daily small-molecule poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) 1/2 inhibitor. A PARP inhibitor blocks the ability of cancer cells to repair themselves after they have been damaged by radiation and certain chemotherapies. This inhibition of DNA damage repair can result in the inability of cancer cells to replicate themselves and in programmed cell death. Tumors that are deficient in key DNA damage repair pathways, such as BRCA1 mutant tumors, are particularly sensitive to ZEJULA. As maintenance therapy, ZEJULA is for women who have had prior chemotherapy treatment but are at high risk of cancer recurrence. ZEJULA is intended to avoid or slow a recurrence of the cancer if it is in remission after prior treatment. In the maintenance setting, ZEJULA does not require the addition of radiation or chemotherapies to kill tumor cells. As a first-line monotherapy maintenance treatment of patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer (collectively, ovarian cancer) following a response to platinum-based chemotherapy, ZEJULA was approved by the NMPA in September 2020 and included in the NRDL in December 2021. As a maintenance treatment of patients with platinum sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer, ZEJULA was approved by the NMPA in December 2019 and included in the NRDL in December 2020. Zai Lab has an exclusive license from GSK to develop and commercialize ZEJULA in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau.

Effective investment in inventory management and procurement strategies will be paramount in minimizing production bottlenecks and meeting the immediate demand anticipated by potential customers, thereby influencing the company's ability to capitalize on its innovative products. 03/06/2024 - 04:00 PM HALIFAX, NS / ACCESSWIRE / March 6, 2024 / Meta Materials Inc. (the ""Company"" or ""META"") (Nasdaq:MMAT), an advanced materials and nanotechnology company, today released the following message to shareholders.Dear Shareholders,Commercialization requires capital.That is a basic premise upon which we are requesting your approval at the upcoming special stockholders' meeting for an increase in the total number of common shares we are authorized to issue. We don't take this proposal lightly and intend to be judicious in issuing future shares to meet our commercialization and working capital needs.To date, we have several joint developments for manufacturing and production, including our collaboration with Panasonic Industry for high-volume manufacturing of 60-cm wide NANOWEB® material. We have some other developing relationships with industry heavyweights, who have requested confidentiality in the final stages of production testing.In the 2023 restructuring, we streamlined the business to focus on four core technologies. Every effort and resource has been allocated to commercialize META's cutting-edge innovations, and we are ready to launch several products (For a more comprehensive overview of our current product line-up, please view the META Investor Presentation released in January 2024 at www.metamaterial.com). Broad-scale production of our products is capital intensive, replete with long lead-time components, machinery and equipment costs and raw material sourcing unique to each product line. A few examples include:VLEPSIS flight testing should be completed in March 2024, with potential customers eagerly anticipating final results. To shorten the time between orders and delivery, we need to procure component and subassembly inventory to address the projected immediacy of demand.Several international currency suppliers want to adopt META's recently launched QUANTUM™ stripe security features. To meet burgeoning demand, we need to bolster production capabilities in our Thurso facility. We expect such efforts will increase volumes and yield higher margins for our authentication business.Notable global battery original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have been successfully using META's NPORE and NCORE products in limited runs. We now have production requests for different sizes and significantly higher quantities; plans to scale up production require investment.These few examples are illustrative of the positive demand metrics we see, constrained primarily by production limitations. As a result, we are relying on our shareholders to help us reach this next milestone that may put META on the path toward success.We are planning a Q&A in the coming days to add more detail to our business strategy about commercialization, as well as the authorized share increase proposal to be voted on at the special meeting. In early April, we plan to hold a webcast to provide a business update and discuss our 2023 results.At the end of the day, growth companies need access to capital. If META is constrained from bringing products to market, business viability would likely suffer. We hope you will consider joining your fellow stockholders in voting to approve this measure.Thank you for your time and consideration, and your support of META.Sincerely,Uzi SassonPresident and CEOAbout Meta Materials Inc.Meta Materials Inc.

The company also initiates CONNECT2-EDO51 trial, anticipates accelerated approval. Financially, PepGen raises $80 million in a follow-on offering, extending cash runway to 2026. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent announcement from PepGen Inc. concerning the completion of enrollment for a Phase 2 clinical trial and the initiation of another, alongside the successful capital raise of approximately $80 million, is of significant interest to investors and analysts monitoring the biotech sector. The capital raise is particularly noteworthy as it extends the company's cash runway into 2026, which is a critical factor in assessing the company's financial health and sustainability. The extended runway provides the company with a buffer to navigate the costly process of drug development without the immediate need for additional capital, which could dilute existing shareholders.Furthermore, the progression of clinical trials, especially those that have the potential to lead to accelerated approval, is a strong indicator of the company's potential future revenue streams. The preliminary data expected in mid-2024 will be a key milestone for the company and could significantly affect the stock's performance. It is important for investors to monitor the outcomes of these trials as positive results could lead to an increase in the company's valuation, while negative results could have the opposite effect. Medical Research Analyst The advancement of PepGen's Enhanced Delivery Oligonucleotide (EDO) therapeutic candidates into later-stage clinical trials represents a pivotal step in addressing unmet medical needs for diseases like Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and Myotonic Dystrophy 1 (DM1). The proprietary EDO technology aims to improve cellular uptake and distribution of oligonucleotides, which could potentially enhance the effectiveness of their drug candidates. The Fast Track Designation granted to PGN-EDODM1 underscores the urgency and importance of developing treatments for DM1, a disease with no current therapies targeting its root cause.From a medical research perspective, the data to be reported in mid-2024 will be crucial not only for understanding the safety and efficacy of the treatments but also for the broader oligonucleotide therapeutic space. The ability to skip specific exons like exon 51 and 53 in DMD or restore normal splicing function in DM1 could serve as a proof of concept for the EDO platform's versatility and potential applicability to other genetic disorders. Market Research Analyst The neuromuscular and neurological therapeutic market is a high-growth area, with increasing demand for innovative treatments. PepGen's focus on severe neuromuscular and neurological diseases positions the company in a niche yet potentially lucrative segment. The company's strategy to target the root cause of diseases like DMD and DM1 could set it apart from competitors and offer a competitive advantage if their clinical trials are successful.Investors should consider the prevalence of the targeted conditions and the current competitive landscape. With DMD affecting approximately 1 in 3,500 male births worldwide and DM1 being one of the most common forms of muscular dystrophy in adults, the market potential for effective therapies is substantial. The anticipation of preliminary data and the potential for accelerated approval could have a positive impact on the company's market share and investor sentiment, making PepGen a company to watch in the biotech sector. 03/06/2024 - 04:01 PM - Enrollment completed for PGN-EDO51 5 mg/kg cohort in CONNECT1-EDO51 Phase 2 clinical trial in DMD patients. The Company expects to announce preliminary data from the 5 mg/kg dose cohort in mid-2024 – - CONNECT2-EDO51 Phase 2 clinical trial in DMD patients open in the U.K. - Company believes this study could potentially support accelerated approval - - FREEDOM-DM1 Phase 1 clinical trial enrolling DM1 patients with preliminary data for at least the 5 mg/kg dose cohort expected in the second half of 2024 - - Gross proceeds of approximately $80 million from February 2024 follow-on offering extends projected operating cash runway into 2026 - BOSTON, March 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PepGen Inc. (Nasdaq: PEPG), a clinical-stage biotechnology company advancing the next generation of oligonucleotide therapies with the goal of transforming the treatment of severe neuromuscular and neurological diseases, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023, and highlighted recent corporate developments. “With important data readouts expected from our two lead programs, 2024 has the potential to be a transformational year for PepGen. In the last year, PepGen made meaningful advancements with our Enhanced Delivery Oligonucleotide (EDO) therapeutic candidates, including the initiation and dosing of patients in both our CONNECT1-EDO51 Phase 2 and FREEDOM-DM1 Phase 1 clinical trials,” said James McArthur, Ph.D., President and CEO of PepGen. “Following the recent completion of enrollment of cohort 1 of our CONNECT1-EDO51 trial, we look forward to sharing preliminary safety, exon 51 skipping, and dystrophin production data from the 5 mg/kg dose in mid-2024.” Dr. McArthur continued, “We continue to see encouraging enrollment in our ongoing FREEDOM-DM1 Phase 1 clinical trial. People with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) currently have no approved treatment options that target the root cause of the disease. We believe that PGN-EDODM1 has the potential to be disease-modifying and could generate meaningful, double-digit levels of splicing correction and corresponding correction of functional measures. We look forward to reporting preliminary data from at least the 5 mg/kg dose cohort later this year.” Recent Program Highlights PGN-EDO51: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) PGN-EDO51, PepGen’s lead investigational candidate in development for the treatment of DMD, utilizes the Company’s proprietary EDO technology to deliver a therapeutic oligonucleotide that is designed to target the root cause of this devastating disease. PGN-EDO51 is designed to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin transcript, an established therapeutic target for approximately 13% of people with DMD. Phase 2 CONNECT1-EDO51 Clinical Trial of PGN-EDO51 underway and 5 mg/kg cohort fully enrolled: In January 2024, PepGen announced that the first patient had been dosed in its Phase 2, open-label multiple ascending dose (MAD) CONNECT1-EDO51 clinical trial, being conducted in Canada, evaluating PGN-EDO51 in 10 male patients at least 8 years of age with DMD amenable to an exon 51-skipping approach. The starting dose will escalate from 5 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg with a potential for further dose escalations. All dose escalations will be determined based on evaluation of safety data from the prior dose cohort(s). PepGen is announcing that the 5 mg/kg PGN-EDO51 dose cohort is fully enrolled. PepGen expects to report preliminary data from this cohort in mid-2024, including initial safety, exon 51 skipping, and dystrophin production data. Initiation of CONNECT2-EDO51 Clinical Trial of PGN-EDO51: In March 2024, PepGen announced that it had received authorization from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to initiate its Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled MAD CONNECT2-EDO51 clinical trial in the United Kingdom evaluating PGN-EDO51 in approximately 20 male patients at least 6 years of age with DMD amenable to an exon 51-skipping approach. PepGen plans to extend this study to the United States and other countries, subject to regulatory authorizations. The CONNECT 2-EDO51 clinical trial, together with the data from CONNECT1-EDO51, is designed to potentially support a future accelerated approval pathway, subject to alignment with regulatory authorities. PGN-EDODM1: Myotonic Dystrophy 1 (DM1) PGN-EDODM1, PepGen’s second investigational candidate in development for the treatment of DM1, utilizes the Company’s proprietary EDO technology to deliver a therapeutic oligonucleotide that is designed to restore the normal splicing function of MBNL1. DM1 is a progressively disabling, life-shortening genetic disorder. DM1 is estimated to affect 40,000 people in the U.S., and over 74,000 people in Europe. Fast Track Designation granted to PGN-EDODM1: In February 2024, PepGen announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted Fast Track Designation to PGN-EDODM1 for the treatment of DM1. First Patient Dosed in Phase 1 FREEDOM-DM1 Clinical Trial of PGN-EDODM1: In December 2023, PepGen announced that the first patient had been dosed in its Phase 1 single ascending dose (SAD) FREEDOM-DM1 clinical trial evaluating PGN-EDODM1 in 24 adult patients with DM1 in the U.S., Canada, and the United Kingdom. The starting dose of 5 mg/kg can escalate to 10 mg/kg, and then 20 mg/kg based on evaluation of safety data from the prior dose cohort(s). PepGen anticipates reporting preliminary data from at least the 5 mg/kg PGN-EDODM1 dose cohort, including safety, splicing correction, and functional outcome measures, in the second half of 2024. In addition to the ongoing FREEDOM-DM1 trial, PepGen expects to open its FREEDOM2-DM1 placebo controlled, MAD clinical trial in DM1 patients in the second half of 2024. Preclinical PGN-EDO53: DMD PGN-EDO53 is PepGen’s third investigational candidate for the treatment of DMD that utilizes the Company’s proprietary EDO technology to deliver a therapeutic oligonucleotide that is designed to target the root cause of this devastating disease. PGN-EDO53 is designed to skip exon 53 of the dystrophin transcript, an established therapeutic target for approximately 8% of people with DMD. PepGen plans to advance PGN-EDO53 into investigational new drug (IND) and clinical trial application (CTA) enabling nonclinical studies. Additional Corporate Highlights $80 Million Underwritten Offering of Common Stock: In February 2024, PepGen priced an underwritten offering of 7,530,000 shares of common stock at a price to the public of $10.635 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds to PepGen of approximately $80 million, before deducting commissions and expenses payable by PepGen. Financial Results for the Three Months and Twelve Months ended December 31, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents were $110.4 million as of December 31, 2023. Based on the Company's current operating plan and projections, it believes that current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with the net proceeds from its recent common stock offering, will be sufficient to fund projected operating requirements into 2026.Research and development expenses were $16.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $13.2 million for the same period in 2022.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company (including BeiGene, Ltd. or Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd.), the performance of Otezla® (apremilast) (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), our acquisitions of Teneobio, Inc., ChemoCentryx, Inc., or Horizon Therapeutics plc (including the prospective performance and outlook of Horizon's business, performance and opportunities, any potential strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities expected as a result of such acquisition, and any projected impacts from the Horizon acquisition on our acquisition-related expenses going forward), as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems on our business, outcomes, progress, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to realize any of the strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities arising from the Horizon acquisition, and such benefits, synergies or opportunities may take longer to realize than expected. We may not be able to successfully integrate Horizon, and such integration may take longer, be more difficult or cost more than expected. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach of our information technology systems could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives. The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.

Negative None. Financial Analyst The substantial revenue growth of 89% reported by MDxHealth, with a 42% increase excluding the GPS segment, reflects a robust expansion trajectory in the precision diagnostics market. This performance is particularly noteworthy considering the broader economic context where many sectors face challenges. The company's strategic focus on commercial execution and operational discipline has evidently paid off, leading to a significant gross margin expansion of 10.7 percentage points year-over-year. Such margin improvements suggest that MDxHealth is not only increasing its sales but doing so more efficiently, which is a positive indicator for future profitability.Their transition to a sole NASDAQ listing could streamline investor relations and corporate governance, potentially reducing complexity and costs in the long term. However, the associated non-recurring expenses and increased operating costs, which rose by 25%, underscore the financial burden of strategic shifts and expansions, like the acquisition of the GPS test. Investors should monitor how these investments translate into sustained revenue growth and margin improvements over time.While the company projects continued topline growth and a path to adjusted EBITDA profitability in the first half of 2025, the net loss figures and a 2% decrease in net loss year-over-year reveal that MDxHealth is still in a phase of heavy investment and has not yet reached a profitable scale. The reported cash and cash equivalents of $22.4 million will be crucial for supporting operations until the company crosses the profitability threshold. Market Research Analyst MDxHealth's performance in the precision diagnostics sector is indicative of the high demand for personalized medical testing solutions. The company's successful Medicare coverage for its Select mdx test is a testament to the growing recognition and acceptance of such tests in the healthcare system. This coverage not only enhances the credibility of MDxHealth's offerings but also broadens the market potential for its products.The increase in gross profit by 129% for the full year suggests that MDxHealth's product mix, including the GPS and Confirm mdx tests, is well-received in the market, leading to higher sales volumes and better cost absorption. However, the competitive landscape in precision diagnostics is rapidly evolving, with new entrants and technologies constantly emerging. MDxHealth's ability to maintain its market position and continue to grow at a similar rate will depend on its ongoing R&D efforts and the successful commercialization of its pipeline products.The financial results also highlight the strategic importance of reimbursement and coverage expansion for diagnostic tests. As MDxHealth continues to secure coverage for its tests, it can expect to see a positive impact on revenue and further market penetration. Nevertheless, it's essential to balance these growth prospects against the risks associated with increased operating expenses and financial expenses, particularly as the latter increased significantly due to non-cash items related to the GPS contingent consideration. Healthcare Industry Analyst The reported revenue composition, with significant contributions from the GPS and Confirm mdx tests, underscores the market's demand for MDxHealth's portfolio of diagnostic solutions. The precision diagnostics industry is heavily reliant on technological advancements and payer acceptance, both of which appear to be working in MDxHealth's favor, as evidenced by the revenue growth and expanded gross margins.However, the industry also faces regulatory hurdles and reimbursement challenges. MDxHealth's success in securing Medicare coverage for the Select mdx test is a critical step that could lead to increased adoption rates and serve as a precedent for coverage of future diagnostic solutions. The company's strategic decision-making in this area will be a key factor in sustaining its current growth trajectory.It is also worth noting the potential impact of MDxHealth's operational decisions on its long-term financial health. The focus on cost management and operational discipline, as well as the expansion of coverage across its menu of tests, are likely to be central to the company's goal of achieving adjusted EBITDA profitability in the near future. Stakeholders should keep an eye on the company's ability to manage its R&D investments and operating expenses in a way that supports sustainable growth without compromising its financial stability. 03/06/2024 - 04:00 PM Mdxhealth Announces Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2023 Financial Results 2023 revenue grew by 89% to $70.2 million; excluding GPS, revenues up 42%2023 gross margin expanded by 10.7 percentage points over prior yearConference call with Q&A today at 4:30 PM EST / 22:30 CET IRVINE, CA, and HERSTAL, BELGIUM – March 6, 2024 (GlobeNewswire) – MDxHealth SA (NASDAQ: MDXH) (the ""Company"" or ""mdxhealth""), a commercial-stage precision diagnostics company, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023.

These statements are often, but are not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “potential,” “expect,” “will,” “goal,” “next,” “potential,” “aim,” “explore,” “forward,” “future,” and “believes” as well as similar expressions. Forward-looking statements contained in this release include, but are not limited to, statements regarding expected future operating results; expectations for development of new or improved products and services and their impact on patients; our strategies, positioning, resources, capabilities and expectations for future events or performance; and the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions, including estimated synergies and other financial impacts. Such statements and estimates are based on assumptions and assessments of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which were deemed reasonable but may not prove to be correct. Actual events are difficult to predict, may depend upon factors that are beyond the company’s control, and may turn out to be materially different. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements we make regarding expected future operating results, product development efforts, our strategies, positioning, resources, capabilities and expectations for future events or performance. Important factors that could cause actual results, conditions and events to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: our ability to successfully and profitably market our products; the acceptance of our products and services by healthcare providers; our ability to achieve and maintain adequate levels of coverage or reimbursement for our current and future solutions we commercialize or may seek to commercialize; the willingness of health insurance companies and other payers to cover our products and services and adequately reimburse us for such products and services; our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals and comply with applicable regulations; timing, progress and results of our research and development programs; the period over which we estimate our existing cash will be sufficient to fund our future operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements; the possibility that the anticipated benefits from our business acquisitions like our acquisition of the Oncotype DX® GPS prostate cancer business will not be realized in full or at all or may take longer to realize than expected; and the amount and nature of competition for our products and services. Other important risks and uncertainties are described in the Risk Factors sections of our most recent Annual Report on Form 20-F and in our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. MDxHealth expressly disclaims any obligation to update any such forward-looking statements in this release to reflect any change in its expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based unless required by law or regulation. This press release does not constitute an offer or invitation for the sale or purchase of securities or assets of MDxHealth in any jurisdiction. No securities of MDxHealth may be offered or sold within the United States without registration under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or in compliance with an exemption therefrom, and in accordance with any applicable U.S. securities laws. Non-IFRS Measures. The Company’s reference to adjusted EBITDA is a forward-looking statement about the Company’s future financial performance, and is a non-IFRS measure that excludes a number of expense items that are included in net loss, including adjustments for items like stock-based compensation, acquisition and integration costs, impairment of long-lived assets, fair-value adjustment, loan extinguishment costs, as well as other non-operating, non-recurring expenses that are difficult to predict for future periods because the nature of the adjustments pertain to events that have not yet occurred. As a result, positive adjusted EBITDA may be achieved while a significant net loss persists. Non-IFRS financial information has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with IFRS, and such information is referenced for supplemental information purposes only. Management does not forecast many of the excluded items for internal use, as these are difficult to predict for future periods because the nature of the adjustments pertain to events that have not yet occurred. Information reconciling forward-looking non-IFRS measures to IFRS measures is therefore not available without unreasonable effort, and is not provided. The occurrence, timing, and amount of any of the items excluded from IFRS to calculate non-IFRS measures could significantly impact the Company's IFRS results.

The $400,000 grant from Wells Fargo will support Elemental and NYCEEC in providing capital to climate tech projects. The partnership addresses a $150 billion financing gap for climate projects, focusing on reducing GHG emissions and fostering greener communities. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The initiation of the Capital Access for Climate Innovators program represents a strategic move by Wells Fargo, Elemental Excelerator and NYCEEC to fill a critical void in the financing of climate technology ventures. The $400,000 grant by Wells Fargo is a seed investment that could potentially unlock greater sums of debt financing for companies at the cusp of commercialization. This initiative is expected to enhance the financial viability of climate tech companies by providing them with much-needed capital to overcome the proverbial 'valley of death'—the challenging transition from prototype to market-ready product.From a financial perspective, the program could stimulate job creation and economic growth in communities by fostering local climate technology projects. The focus on traditionally excluded founders is also notable, as it may lead to a diversification of the entrepreneurial landscape in the climate tech sector. The success of this program could set a precedent for similar collaborations, potentially impacting the valuation of participating companies and the attractiveness of the sector to investors. Market Research Analyst The collaboration between these entities taps into the growing interest in sustainable investments and the increasing demand for climate technology solutions. As the market for clean technology expands, driven by both consumer demand and regulatory changes, such as the upcoming Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, companies that can scale effectively are poised to capture significant market share. This program could act as a catalyst for innovation and scalability, potentially leading to a more competitive and diverse market landscape.Moreover, the emphasis on community impact aligns with a broader trend towards ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) investing. Investors are increasingly looking for opportunities that not only provide financial returns but also deliver social and environmental benefits. The creation of financing tools and resources through this partnership could be instrumental in aligning investor capital with community-focused climate projects, which may, in turn, influence the flow of investments within the broader ESG space. Economist The collaboration's focus on addressing funding gaps for climate technology projects has significant implications for economic development and environmental sustainability. By providing debt capital to projects that demonstrate tangible community benefits, such as reduced utility bills and cleaner air, the program aims to encourage the adoption of green technologies. This could lead to a multiplier effect where initial investments spur further economic activity and investment in the sector.Additionally, the targeted support for founders who have been traditionally excluded from such financing opportunities could lead to a more equitable distribution of economic gains. The initiative could also contribute to long-term cost savings for communities by reducing energy expenditures and improving infrastructure resilience against climate change. The economic benefits derived from these projects could be substantial, potentially reducing the reliance on more expensive and polluting energy sources. 03/06/2024 - 02:45 PM The collaboration will fund climate technology companies scaling solutions focused on community impactNORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / March 6, 2024 / Wells Fargo, together with Elemental Excelerator, a leading nonprofit climate technology investor, and the New York City Energy Efficiency Corporation (NYCEEC), a leading nonprofit green bank, have joined forces to launch a new debt financing program, called the Capital Access for Climate Innovators. The Capital Access Program was created to pilot innovative lending and co-investing vehicles to catalyze climate technology projects with significant community benefits.This collaboration aims to address funding gaps faced by climate technology companies, and particularly those led by traditionally excluded founders. Elemental and NYCEEC are partnering to identify and provide capital to Elemental portfolio companies who face finance gaps on their path toward commercialization and where debt capital can catalyze scale. To support this effort, Wells Fargo has provided a $400,000 grant, which will allow Elemental and NYCEEC to identify and share best practices and build financing tools and resources for climate technology companies, community lenders, credit enhancement providers and other project investors.""There's an acute need for new kinds of financing and collaborations to support technology companies that are working to reduce GHG emissions,"" said Curtis Probst, CEO of NYCEEC. ""This partnership will help us create greener, cleaner and more affordable communities. We are excited to partner with Elemental to bring NYCEEC's green lending to Elemental's portfolio of climate tech innovators.""""At Elemental, we are profoundly aware of a $150 billion financing gap for climate technology projects scaling from early stage to widespread commercial adoption. With this partnership designed to reduce friction in accessing capital, we take an important step to bridge this gap and accelerate the deployment of climate projects with strong community benefits, like reduced utility bills, cleaner air, and more accessible transportation,"" said Dawn Lippert, Founder and CEO of Elemental Excelerator.Over the past decade, Elemental has supported over 150+ innovative climate technology companies through technical support and equity investments, while NYCEEC has provided debt financing to assist building owners, contractors, and developers in funding clean energy projects throughout NYC and the surrounding region. Through coordinated efforts, this partnership aims to supercharge the growth of climate technology companies and rapidly scale the number of projects they are able to deploy in communities throughout the country.""We are proud to work together with Elemental Excelerator and NYCEEC to help strengthen the pipeline that can deploy capital for climate resilience,"" said Robyn Luhning, Chief Sustainability Officer at Wells Fargo. ""Across the communities we serve, we seek to accelerate solutions that support access to clean, affordable energy technologies and economic opportunity.""The announcement comes in the lead up to the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and other important Inflation Reduction Act programs that will activate investors, from state and local green banks to community development finance institutions, to make climate solutions more affordable and accessible to low-income and other underserved communities across the country. Through this initiative, Elemental and NYCEEC will establish resources and frameworks that can be used across the climate tech investing ecosystem to support expanded funding opportunities that will be made available through the GGRF.About Elemental ExceleratorElemental is a nonprofit investor in climate technologies with deep community impact.
