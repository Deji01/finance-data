The company has signed an agreement for the first tranche of €1 billion, which will run from February 28 to June 5, 2024.

Financial Analyst Stellantis N.V.'s initiation of a €1 billion share buyback as part of its larger €3 billion program represents a significant capital allocation decision, reflecting the company's current financial health and management's confidence in its intrinsic value. The intention to cancel the majority of the acquired shares is a move typically aimed at enhancing shareholder value by reducing the number of shares outstanding, which can result in an increase in earnings per share (EPS) and potentially boost the stock price. This could be seen as a positive signal to the market, suggesting that the management believes the stock is undervalued.However, the impact of such buybacks on the company's balance sheet and future investment capacity must be considered. The capital used for share repurchases is capital not being invested in growth opportunities or held in reserve for potential downturns. It is essential to evaluate the company's debt levels, cash flow generation and investment needs to assess the sustainability of this program. Furthermore, the stipulation that a portion of the repurchased shares will be used for employee stock purchase plans and equity-based compensation can help align employee interests with those of shareholders, potentially driving performance improvements. Market Research Analyst The share buyback announcement by Stellantis N.V. aligns with broader market trends where companies use buybacks as a tool for returning excess capital to shareholders. The timing and size of the tranche, set to end by June 5, 2024, will influence Stellantis's stock liquidity and could lead to increased volatility in the short term. Market participants often react to such news with optimism, as buybacks can be perceived as a company's commitment to its shareholders.It is important to monitor the share price performance in the days following the announcement to gauge investor sentiment. Additionally, the price cap of 110% of the market price suggests a limit on the premium the company is willing to pay, which is a prudent measure to avoid overpaying for its shares. Market conditions, regulatory compliance and the remaining authorization for share buybacks will also play a crucial role in the program's execution and its eventual success. Legal Expert Stellantis's share buyback program must adhere to stringent regulatory frameworks, including the Market Abuse Regulation 596/2014 and the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1052, which govern the execution of buybacks in the European Union. These regulations ensure that the buyback is conducted in a transparent manner, preventing market manipulation and protecting investors. The independent agreement with an investment firm to make trading decisions is a measure to ensure that the buyback process is free from insider influence.The authorization by the general meeting of shareholders and the adherence to the maximum limit of 10% of the company's capital are also critical legal considerations. These safeguards are in place to prevent adverse effects on corporate governance and ensure that the buyback serves the best interest of all stakeholders. It is essential for investors to be aware of these legal frameworks as they provide a level of security and predictability in the execution of such financial operations. 02/28/2024 - 02:17 AM Stellantis Announces Launch of First Tranche of Its 2024 Share Buyback Program AMSTERDAM, February 28, 2024 - Stellantis N.V.

InterContinental Hotels Group PLC Announces Transaction in Own Shares - Feb 28,2024-02-28T07:00:00.000Z,Low,Positive,"InterContinental Hotels Group PLC announces the purchase of its own shares through Goldman Sachs International on the London Stock Exchange. The company bought 129,295 ordinary shares at prices ranging from £86.2000 to £86.8800 per share. The purchased shares will be canceled, leaving the company with 164,964,795 ordinary shares in circulation.","InterContinental Hotels Group PLC Announces Transaction in Own Shares - Feb 28 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary InterContinental Hotels Group PLC announces the purchase of its own shares through Goldman Sachs International on the London Stock Exchange. The company bought 129,295 ordinary shares at prices ranging from £86.2000 to £86.8800 per share. The purchased shares will be canceled, leaving the company with 164,964,795 ordinary shares in circulation. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The repurchase of shares by InterContinental Hotels Group PLC is a financial maneuver that can signal several strategic intentions. Firstly, share buybacks are often seen as a method of returning value to shareholders, as they can increase earnings per share (EPS) by reducing the number of shares outstanding. This, in turn, could potentially lead to a higher stock price.From a financial perspective, the decision to execute a buyback needs to be weighed against other potential uses of capital, such as investing in growth opportunities or paying down debt. The fact that the company is cancelling the purchased shares rather than holding them in treasury suggests a confidence in the company's current liquidity and a focus on long-term shareholder value, rather than retaining the shares for potential future use like employee compensation.It's also important to consider the average purchase price of £ 86.6596 per share in relation to the company's historical stock performance and current market conditions. If the shares were repurchased below intrinsic value, the buyback could be seen as a positive move. However, if the shares were bought at a premium to intrinsic value, it could indicate a lack of better investment opportunities or a desire to support the share price in the short term. Market Research Analyst When a company like InterContinental Hotels Group PLC engages in a share repurchase, market perception is an essential factor to consider. The buyback could be interpreted by the market as a positive signal that the company's leadership believes the stock is undervalued. This can often lead to a positive reaction in the stock market, as investors may read into the buyback as a sign of confidence from management.However, it's crucial to analyze the context in which this repurchase occurs. The hospitality industry faces cyclical demand and can be sensitive to economic downturns. If the repurchase was made during a period of economic optimism and growth in the travel sector, it could be seen as aligning with the industry's upward trend. Conversely, if the sector is facing headwinds, the repurchase might be viewed as a defensive move to prop up the stock price amidst broader industry concerns.Furthermore, the impact on the company's share liquidity should be considered. With fewer shares in circulation, the stock may become more volatile due to reduced liquidity, which could affect both current and potential investors. Economist The share repurchase by InterContinental Hotels Group PLC can also be analyzed from a macroeconomic standpoint. Share buybacks are often more prevalent during periods of low-interest rates, as companies can finance these repurchases through debt at a lower cost. Additionally, if the broader economy is performing well, companies may have excess cash on hand due to increased revenues, which can be used for share repurchases.It's also relevant to consider the timing of the buyback in relation to economic cycles. If the repurchase occurs during an economic expansion, it may be part of a broader trend of corporate optimism. However, if it coincides with a recession or economic uncertainty, it could be a move to reassure investors and stabilize the stock price.Finally, the scale of the repurchase relative to the company's market capitalization and the overall volume of buybacks in the market should be considered. A large-scale buyback could have a more significant impact on the market and might reflect broader economic trends or sector-specific developments. 02/28/2024 - 02:00 AM Purchase of own sharesLONDON, UK / ACCESSWIRE / February 28, 2024 / The Company announces that on 27 February 2024 it purchased the following number of its ordinary shares of 20340/399pence each through Goldman Sachs International (""GSI"") on the London Stock Exchange in accordance with the authority granted by shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2023 (the ""Purchase"").

Negative None. 02/28/2024 - 02:00 AM Claim Exchange Completed at WikieupBRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS / ACCESSWIRE / February 28, 2024 / Bradda Head Lithium Ltd (AIM:BHL)(TSX-V:BHLI), the North America-focused lithium development group, announces finalisation of the land exchange over the unpatented lode claims at the Wikieup clay project in Western Arizona as initially notified by the Company on 1 March 2023. This exchange is mutually beneficial to both parties avoiding litigation and disruption of exploration activities on highly perspective clay-hosted claims. As such, Bradda Head will retain 66 new claims equating to 1,302 acres (5.27 km2), which the Company staked in early 2019, and held in its subsidiary Zenolith (USA) LLC. In turn, Bradda has transferred 55 unpatented lode claims to Arizona Lithium's subsidiary, Big Sandy Inc., to the amount of roughly 1,136 acres (4.60 km2), per the terms of this settlement. This transaction is now legally binding pursuant to the Company's announcement on 1 March 2023 ('Settlement of Claim Dispute with Arizona Lithium'), and the exchange of claims has been completed by mutual agreement and all legal documents have been filed with both the BLM and respective county in Arizona to cement the transaction. This final exchange furthers Bradda's exposure to high-quality lithium-in-clay targets (proximal at < 1.0km to Arizona Lithium's Big Sandy clay discovery) and further enhances the Company's portfolio of this high-quality project. The new ground will, in due course, be explored with geological mapping and surface sampling for opportunities, developing priority drill targets potentially for later in year.Ian Stalker, Executive Chair, commented:""We thank Arizona Lithium and the countless hours of time undertaken to settle this matter without litigation and allow both companies to proceed with unobstructed exploration on their respective claim groups. This is new ground that has significant upside potential within the large, lithium-bearing clay-rich lacustrine basin and Bradda plans to capitalise on the finalisation of this settlement with renewed surface exploration.""For further information please visit the Company's website: www.braddaheadltd.com.Qualified Person (BHL)Joey Wilkins, B.Sc., P.Geo., is Chief Operating Officer at BHL and the Qualified Person who reviewed and approved the technical disclosures in this news release.

Net income and adjusted net income also declined. The company paid out over $350 million in dividends for the year. Positive ICL's annual sales for 2023 were $7,536 million, a decrease from the record $10,015 million in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for 2023 was $1,754 million compared to $4,007 million in 2022. Net income for 2023 was $647 million, down from $2,159 million in 2022. The company paid out more than $350 million in dividends for the year. ICL's operating cash flow for 2023 was $1,595 million, with free cash flow of $818 million. The Company's fourth-quarter sales were $1,690 million versus $2,091 million in the same period in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $357 million compared to $698 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Negative ICL's consolidated annual sales saw a significant decline in 2023 compared to the previous year. Net income and adjusted net income for 2023 also showed a notable decrease from 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for 2023 was substantially lower than in 2022. The Company's fourth-quarter sales and adjusted EBITDA were lower than the same period in 2022. Market Research Analyst The reported annual sales of ICL have shown a significant decrease from $10,015 million in 2022 to $7,536 million in 2023, which is a clear indication of a challenging market environment that the company faced over the past year. The drop in net income from $2,159 million to $647 million is particularly noteworthy, reflecting a substantial impact on profitability. This performance could be attributed to a variety of factors including market saturation, increased competition, or operational inefficiencies.Moreover, the reduction in adjusted EBITDA from $4,007 million to $1,754 million suggests that the company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization have been heavily affected, which is a critical metric for assessing a company's operating performance. The decline in diluted earnings per share (EPS) from $1.67 to $0.50 (adjusted from $1.82 to $0.55) is also a key concern for shareholders, as it directly affects the value of their investment.Despite the downturn, the company's strong cash generation of $818 million and the payment of over $350 million in dividends indicate a commitment to returning value to shareholders. However, the long-term sustainability of such dividends could be called into question if the company's financial performance does not improve. Financial Analyst ICL's financial results reveal a company that has faced significant headwinds, with both top-line and bottom-line figures retreating from the previous year's record highs. The decrease in sales and EBITDA margins from 50% and 40% in 2022 to 35% and 23% in 2023, respectively, suggests a contraction in operational efficiency and profitability. This contraction could be driven by external market conditions, such as pricing pressures in key commodities, or internal factors like increased production costs or lower productivity.From a shareholder perspective, the free cash flow of $818 million is a positive sign, as it reflects the company's ability to generate cash after accounting for capital expenditures. This is a crucial indicator of financial health and provides the company with the means to invest in growth opportunities, pay down debt, or return capital to shareholders. However, investors will be closely monitoring the company's future performance, especially given the guidance for 2024 which projects a narrower range of adjusted EBITDA for specialties-driven segments and potash sales volumes.It is also important to note the company's proactive measures to enhance transparency by changing its guidance practices. Providing more detailed guidance can help investors better understand the company's operational targets and set realistic expectations for future performance. Commodity Market Specialist ICL's report indicates a significant reduction in the average potash CIF price from $682 per tonne in 2022 to $393 in 2023, which has had a profound effect on the company's Potash segment EBITDA. This price drop could be a result of global market dynamics, including the softening of demand or an increase in supply. The Grain Price Index's decrease and the WASDE report's projected decline in the ratio of global grain inventories to consumption could imply a potential reduction in demand for fertilizers, which in turn affects potash prices.The geopolitical tensions causing disruptions in the Red Sea and Panama, leading to rerouted shipments, are external factors that can significantly impact transportation costs and supply chain efficiency. These disruptions can have a ripple effect on commodity prices and availability, which may have contributed to the financial outcomes reported by ICL.Looking at the broader commodity markets, the decrease in DAP subsidies by India and the reduction of CVDs by the US on OCP have created negative sentiment in the phosphate market. However, the decision by China to limit exports could have a counterbalancing effect on market liquidity. The volatility in raw material costs, such as the fluctuation in sulphur prices, further complicates the financial landscape for companies like ICL that are heavily reliant on commodity markets. 02/28/2024 - 02:10 AM Delivers annual sales of $7,536 million, with adjusted EBITDA of $1,754 million, and continued strong cash generation of $818 million TEL AVIV, Israel--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ICL (NYSE: ICL) (TASE: ICL), a leading global specialty minerals company, today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Consolidated annual sales were $7,536 million versus a record $10,015 million in 2022. Net income was $647 million versus $2,159 million, while adjusted net income was $715 million versus $2,350 million. Annual adjusted EBITDA was $1,754 million versus $4,007 million in 2022. Diluted earnings per share for 2023 were $0.50, while adjusted diluted EPS was $0.55. Operating cash flow was $1,595 million in 2023, while free cash flow was $818 million. For 2023, the Company paid out more than $350 million in dividends. For the fourth quarter of 2023, consolidated sales were $1,690 million versus $2,091 million. Net income was $67 million, with adjusted net income of $123 million, versus $331 million and $358 million, respectively, for fourth quarter 2022. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $357 million versus $698 million. Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.05, with adjusted diluted EPS of $0.10, versus $0.25 and $0.28, respectively. Operating cash flow was $415 million in the fourth quarter, while free cash flow was $160 million. “ICL delivered adjusted EBITDA of $1.8 billion and operating cash flow of $1.6 billion, on the backdrop of a record 2022. During 2023, we expanded into additional new end-markets, with the groundbreaking of new advanced facilities and the launch of new innovative products, which will have a long-term impact on growth. We executed against our cost reduction plan and launched further efficiency measures in the fourth quarter, as we continued to respond to challenging market conditions and remained resilient in the face of war,” said Raviv Zoller, president and CEO of ICL. “For the year, ICL delivered significant value to shareholders, with $818 million of free cash flow and more than $350 million in dividend payments, as we diligently managed the areas under our control, swiftly reacting to changing external conditions. We currently see improving demand in our key end-markets and, while we expect there will be new and continued challenges in 2024, we are looking forward to achieving our goals for the year, including inorganic growth.” The Company also announced it is making a change to guidance practices, in order to provide greater transparency for its shareholders. Going forward, the Company will be providing guidance for expected potash sales volumes and EBITDA guidance for all of its business segments other than potash, which will be referred to as specialties-driven business segments. For 2024, the Company expects the specialties-driven segments adjusted EBITDA to be between $0.7 billion to $0.9 billion. For potash, the Company expects 2024 sales volumes to be between 4.6 million metric tons and 4.9 million metric tons. The Company’s fourth quarter 2023 Potash segment EBITDA should give a good indication of EBITDA at current prices, and ICL expects every $20 change in the average potash CIF price from current levels to result in a $100 million annual impact to EBITDA (1a).

This was partially offset by lower sales volumes of phosphorus-based flame retardants, specialty minerals and clear brine fluids. Price – The negative impact on operating income was primarily due to lower selling prices of bromine and phosphorus-based flame retardants, bromine-based industrial solutions, and specialty minerals. Exchange rates – The favorable impact on operating income was mainly due to the positive impact on operational costs resulting from the depreciation of the average exchange rate of the Israeli shekel against the US dollar, as well as the positive impact on sales resulting from the appreciation of the average exchange rate of the euro against the US dollar. Raw materials – The positive impact on operating income was due to a decrease in raw material costs. Transportation – The positive impact on operating income was due to a decrease in marine and inland transportation costs. Potash The Potash segment produces and sells mainly potash, salts, magnesium, and electricity. Potash is produced in Israel using an evaporation process to extract it from the Dead Sea at Sodom and in Spain using conventional mining from an underground mine. The segment also produces and sells pure magnesium, magnesium alloys and chlorine. In addition, the segment sells salt products produced at its potash site in Spain. The segment operates a power plant in Sodom which supplies electricity and steam to ICL facilities in Israel, with surplus electricity sold to external customers.

Significant highlights ICL's potash price (CIF) per tonne of $345 in the quarter was 1% higher than the third quarter of 2023 and 42% lower year-over-year. The Grain Price Index decreased by 6.7% during the quarter due to decreased prices of wheat, corn and soybean by 16.2%, 12.8% and 8.5%, respectively, partially offset by an increase in prices of rice by 5.4%. The WASDE (World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates) report, published by the USDA in January 2024, showed a continued decrease in the expected ratio of global inventories of grains to consumption to 27.7% for the 2023/24 agriculture year, compared to 28.1% for the 2022/23 agriculture year and 28.4% for the 2021/22 agriculture year. Freight rates have been increasing, with disruptions in the Red Sea and in Panama. Suez Canal shipments have plummeted due to the security situation in the area with many vessels rerouted around southern Africa, and the Panama Canal is navigating a historic water crisis, limiting the number of ships crossing.

Price – The negative impact on operating income resulted primarily from a decrease of $249 in the potash price (CIF) per tonne, year-over-year. Exchange rates – The favorable impact on operating income was due to a positive impact on sales resulting from the appreciation of the average exchange rate of the euro and the British pound against the US dollar, as well as a positive impact on operational costs resulting from the depreciation of the average exchange rate of the Israeli shekel against the US dollar. Energy – The positive impact on operating income was primarily due to a decrease in electricity and gas prices. Operating and other expenses – The positive impact on operating income was primarily related to operational savings. Phosphate Solutions The Phosphate Solutions segment operates ICL's phosphate value chain and uses phosphate rock and fertilizer-grade phosphoric acid to produce phosphate-based specialty products with higher added value, as well as to produce and sell phosphate-based fertilizers. Phosphate specialties sales of $343 million and operating income of $38 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 were approximately 15% and 42% lower, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease in operating income was driven mainly by lower selling prices and sales volumes, partially offset by lower costs of raw materials. Sales of phosphate commodities amounted to $201 million, approximately 10% lower than in the fourth quarter of 2022. Operating income of $36 million decreased year-over-year by $14 million, primarily due to lower prices, partially offset by higher volumes sold and lower raw material costs, mainly sulphur.

For Q4 2022, comprised of $13 million in phosphate specialties and $36 million in phosphate commodities. Significant highlights White phosphoric acid (WPA): Sales decreased year-over-year, as higher volumes - mainly in Europe – only partially offset lower prices. Industrial specialties: Sales decreased year-over-year, with lower prices in key markets, partially offset by higher volumes globally. Food specialties: Volumes in Europe increased year-over-year, while global sales declined versus the prior year, due to lower volumes in the Americas related to a slower than expected recovery in consumer demand. A positive pricing effect continued into the fourth quarter of 2023 with prices up to 15% higher when compared to the third quarter average. Negative sentiment was generated early in the quarter due to a reduction of DAP subsidies by India and a reduction of countervailing duties (CVDs) by the US on OCP, partially offset by lower market liquidity due to China’s decision to limit exports. In India, DAP prices decreased by $7/t from the previous quarter to $593/t CFR, due to the government’s decision to reduce the DAP subsidy for the rabi crop, which lowered demand for imports. US phosphate imports remained firm in October 2023, as distributors continued to restock depleted inventories. DAP FOB Nola prices increased by 7% during the quarter, finishing the year at $623/t despite decreased volumes in November and December, and the US Department of Commerce’s decision to decrease OCP’s CVDs from 19.97% to 2.12%. In Brazil, MAP prices were 6% higher in the quarter, reaching $563/t at the end of December. A lack of prompt availability and poor weather, which created a delayed import window for soy planting, continued to support prices at a time when demand usually begins to wane. In November 2023, China’s economic planning committee, the NDRC, suspended review of new export applications until year-end, in an effort to lower domestic prices. Indian phosphoric acid prices are negotiated on a quarterly basis. The fourth quarter price was agreed at $985/t P2O5, up $135 from the third quarter price, reflecting a surge in DAP/MAP prices during the fourth quarter. The price for the first quarter of 2024 is still under negotiation. Spot sulphur FOB Middle East eased to $78/t at the end of December, down from $108/t at the beginning of the quarter, as concerns over Chinese demand and ample availability weighed on fundamentals.

This was partially offset by lower sales volumes of phosphate-based food additives and MAP used as raw material for energy storage solutions. Price – The negative impact on operating income was primarily due to lower selling prices of WPA, phosphate fertilizers and salts. Exchange rates – The favorable impact on operating income was mainly due to the positive impact on sales resulting from the appreciation of the average exchange rate of the euro against the US dollar which exceeded its negative impact on operational costs, as well as the positive impact on operational costs due to the depreciation of the average exchange rate of the Israeli shekel and the Chinese yuan against the US dollar. Raw materials – The positive impact on operating income was mainly due to lower costs of sulphur, potassium hydroxide (KOH) and caustic soda. Operating and other expenses – The positive impact on operating income was primarily related to lower maintenance and operational costs. Growing Solutions The Growing Solutions segment aims to achieve global leadership in plant nutrition by enhancing its position in its core markets of specialty agriculture, ornamental horticulture, turf and landscaping, fertilizers and FertilizerpluS, and by targeting high-growth markets such as Brazil, India, and China. The segment also looks to leverage its unique R&D capabilities, substantial agronomic experience, global footprint, backward integration to potash, phosphate and polysulphate and its chemistry know-how, as well as its ability to integrate and generate synergies from acquired businesses. ICL continuously works to expand its broad portfolio of specialty plant nutrition, plant stimulation and plant health solutions, which consist of enhanced efficiency and controlled release fertilizers (CRF), water-soluble fertilizers (WSF), liquid fertilizers and straights (MKP/MAP/PeKacid), FertilizerpluS, soil and foliar micronutrients, secondary nutrients, biostimulants, soil conditioners, seed treatment products, and adjuvants.

Turf and ornamental: Sales decreased year-over-year, with turf sales decreasing, while ornamental horticulture sales remained stable. Brazil: Weather-related challenges delayed fourth quarter orders, impacting both quarter and full year results. ICL Boulby: Production of Polysulphate decreased by 6% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, declining to 238 thousand tonnes. For 2023 production reached 1,009 thousand tonnes, an annual production record. FertilizerpluS: sales decreased year-over-year, as higher volumes only partially offset lower prices. Planned maintenance in certain facilities was shifted from the first quarter of 2024 to the fourth quarter of 2023, as a response to application delays in Europe, mainly due to weather, and Israel, mainly due to the war. In the beginning of 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Nitro 1000, a manufacturer, developer and provider of biological crop inputs in Brazil, for a consideration of $30 million. Nitro 1000’s products mainly target soybean, corn and sugar cane crops, and their application replaces or optimizes the use of fertilizers. These products help farmers increase profitability, as well as offer more sustainable options.

Financing expenses, net Net financing expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 amounted to $33 million, compared to $41 million in the corresponding quarter last year, a decrease of $8 million. This decrease is mainly due to a decrease of $10 million in account receivables factoring expenses, partially offset by an increase of $2 million in interest expenses. Tax expenses In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company’s reported tax expenses amounted to $33 million, compared to $158 million in the corresponding quarter of last year, reflecting an effective tax rate of 28% and 32%, respectively. The Company’s relatively low effective tax rate for this quarter was mainly due to the devaluation of the shekel against the US dollar. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and deposits amounted to $592 million compared to $508 million as of December 31, 2022. In addition, the Company maintained about $1.2 billion of unused credit facilities as of December 31, 2023. Outstanding net debt As of December 31, 2023, ICL’s net financial liabilities amounted to $2,095 million, a decrease of $221 million compared to December 31, 2022. Credit facilities Sustainability-linked Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) In April 2023, the Company entered into a Sustainability-Linked Revolving Credit Facility Agreement made between ICL Finance B.V. and a consortium of twelve international banks for a $1,550 million credit facility. The Sustainability-Linked RCF replaced a previous revolving credit facility that was entered into in 2015, as amended and extended in 2018, and which was due to expire in 2025. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had utilized $376 million of the credit facility. Securitization The total amount of the Company's committed securitization facility framework is $300 million with an additional $100 million uncommitted. As of December 31, 2023, ICL had utilized approximately $182 million of the facility’s framework. Ratings and financial covenants Fitch Ratings In June 2023, Fitch Ratings reaffirmed the Company’s long-term issuer default rating and senior unsecured rating at 'BBB-'. The outlook on the long-term issuer default rating is stable. S&P Ratings In July 2023, the S&P credit rating agency reaffirmed the Company’s international credit rating and senior unsecured rating of 'BBB-'. In addition, the S&P Maalot credit rating agency reaffirmed the Company’s credit rating of 'ilAA' with a stable rating outlook. Financial covenants As of December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all of its financial covenants stipulated in its financing agreements. Dividend Distribution In connection with ICL’s fourth quarter 2023 results, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of 4.76 cents per share, or approximately $61 million. The dividend will be paid on March 26, 2024. The record date is March 14, 2024.

We disclose in this quarterly report non-IFRS financial measures titled adjusted operating income, adjusted net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders, diluted adjusted earnings per share, and adjusted EBITDA. Our management uses adjusted operating income, adjusted net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders, diluted adjusted earnings per share, and adjusted EBITDA to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period. We calculate our adjusted operating income by adjusting our operating income to add certain items, as set forth in the reconciliation table under “Adjustments to reported operating, and net income (non-GAAP)” below. Certain of these items may recur. We calculate our adjusted net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders by adjusting our net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders to add certain items, as set forth in the reconciliation table under “Adjustments to reported operating, and net income (non-GAAP)” below, excluding the total tax impact of such adjustments. We calculate our diluted adjusted earnings per share by dividing adjusted net income by the weighted-average number of diluted ordinary shares outstanding. Our adjusted EBITDA is calculated as net income before financing expenses, net, taxes on income, share in earnings of equity-accounted investees, depreciation and amortization, and adjust items presented in the reconciliation table under “Consolidated adjusted EBITDA, and diluted adjusted Earnings Per Share for the periods of activity” below, which were adjusted for in calculating the adjusted operating income. Commencing with the year 2022, the Company’s “adjusted EBITDA” calculation is no longer adding back “minority and equity income, net“. While “minority and equity income, net” reflects the share of an equity investor in one of our owned operations, since adjusted EBITDA measures the Company’s overall performance, its operations and its ability to satisfy cash needs, before profit is allocated to the equity investor, management believes that adjusted EBITDA before deduction of such item is more reflective. You should not view adjusted operating income, adjusted net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders, diluted adjusted earnings per share or adjusted EBITDA as a substitute for operating income or net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders determined in accordance with IFRS, and you should note that our definitions of adjusted operating income, adjusted net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders, diluted adjusted earnings per share, and adjusted EBITDA may differ from those used by other companies. Additionally, other companies may use other measures to evaluate their performance, which may reduce the usefulness of our non-IFRS financial measures as tools for comparison. However, we believe adjusted operating income, adjusted net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders, diluted adjusted earnings per share, and adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to both management, and investors by excluding certain items that management believes are not indicative of our ongoing operations. Our management uses these non-IFRS measures to evaluate the Company's business strategies, and management performance. We believe that these non IFRS measures provide useful information to investors because they improve the comparability of our financial results between periods and provide for greater transparency of key measures used to evaluate our performance. 1The reference to our website is intended to be an inactive textual reference and the information on, or accessible through, our website is not intended to be part of this Form 6-K. (1a) The Company only provides guidance on a non-GAAP basis. The Company does not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) to GAAP net income (loss), due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting, and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation, in particular, because special items such as restructuring, litigation, and other matters, used to calculate projected net income (loss) vary dramatically based on actual events, the Company is not able to forecast on a GAAP basis with reasonable certainty all deductions needed in order to provide a GAAP calculation of projected net income (loss) at this time. The amount of these deductions may be material, and therefore could result in projected GAAP net income (loss) being materially less than projected adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP). The guidance speaks only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this news release or to reflect actual outcomes, unless required by law. For 2023, Specialties businesses are represented by the Industrial Products, and Growing Solutions segments, and the specialties part of the Phosphate Solutions segment, and we present EBITDA from the phosphate specialties part of the Phosphate Solutions segment as we believe this information is useful to investors in reflecting the specialty portion of our business. Beginning with 2024, we are providing specialties-driven Adjusted EBITDA which will include Industrial Products, Growing Solutions and Phosphate Solutions, as the Phosphate Solutions business is now predominantly specialties-focused and for our Potash business we will be providing sales volumes guidance. The company believes this change provides greater transparency, as these new metrics are less impacted by fertilizer commodity prices, given the extreme volatility in recent years. We present a discussion in the period-to-period comparisons of the primary drivers of change in the Company’s results of operations. This discussion is based in part on management’s best estimates of the impact of the main trends on our businesses. We have based the following discussion on our financial statements. You should read such discussion together with our financial statements.

Quantity – The positive impact on operating income was primarily due to higher sales volumes of potash, bromine-based flame retardant, elemental bromine, specialty agriculture and FertilizerpluS products, as well as phosphate fertilizers and white phosphoric acid (WPA). These were partially offset by lower sales volumes of phosphate-based food additives and magnesium. Price – The negative impact on operating income was primarily related to a decrease of $249 in the potash price (CIF) per tonne year-over-year, as well as lower selling prices of specialty agriculture and FertilizerpluS products, bromine-based flame retardants, bromine-based industrial solutions, white phosphoric acid (WPA) and phosphate fertilizers. Exchange rates – The favorable impact on operating income was mainly due to a positive impact on sales resulting from the appreciation of the average exchange rate of the euro and the Brazilian Real against the US dollar, which was partially offset by a negative impact on operational costs resulting from the above-mentioned appreciation, together with a positive impact due to the depreciation of the average exchange rate of the Israeli shekel against the US dollar. Raw materials – The positive impact on operating income was due to lower costs of sulphur, commodity fertilizers, potassium hydroxide (KOH), raw materials used in the production of industrial solutions products, and caustic soda. Energy – The positive impact on operating income was due to lower gas and electricity prices. Transportation – The positive impact on operating income resulted from decreased marine transportation costs. Operating and other expenses – The positive impact on operating income was primarily related to lower operational costs and sales commissions.

The decrease was partially offset by higher sales volumes of bromine-based flame retardants, bromine-based industrial solutions, specialty agriculture products and WPA. South America – The decrease in sales was primarily due to lower selling prices of potash and specialty agriculture products, partially offset by higher sales volumes of the above-mentioned products. North America – The decrease in sales was primarily due to lower selling prices and sales volumes of potash, magnesium and phosphate-based flame retardants, as well as lower sales volumes of phosphate-based food additives.

Adjusted EBITDA reaches $123.2 million. The company completes vessel transactions and secures $625 million in financing. Estimated TCE rates for Q1 and Q2 2024 are promising. Positive Significant increase in net income and earnings per share for Q4 2023 compared to Q3 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 2023 shows a substantial improvement. Successful completion of a vessel sale with a gain of $5.8 million and an agreement to sell another vessel. Securing $625 million in financing at favorable terms to fund capex obligations and debt refinancing until 2026. Announcement of a cash dividend of $0.30 per share for Q4 2023. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results of Golden Ocean Group Limited reveal a significant year-over-year decline in net income, from $461.8 million in 2022 to $112.3 million in 2023. This indicates a contraction in profitability that may concern investors. However, the company has shown a strong quarter-over-quarter recovery, doubling its net income from the third to the fourth quarter of 2023. This recovery is crucial to analyze as it may signal an improving trajectory after a potentially challenging year.Golden Ocean's ability to secure financings totaling $625 million at favorable terms is a strategic move that strengthens their financial position. It ensures the company's capital expenditure obligations are met and debt maturities are covered until 2026. This financial maneuvering provides stability and may positively influence investor sentiment by mitigating near-term liquidity risks.The declaration of a cash dividend of $0.30 per share, despite the lower annual net income, reflects a commitment to shareholder returns. It is essential to monitor the sustainability of such dividend payments in the context of the company's earnings and cash flow generation capabilities. Market Research Analyst The Time Charter Equivalent (TCE) rates reported for Capesize and Panamax vessels offer an insight into the market conditions faced by Golden Ocean. The TCE rates are a standard industry metric that reflect the average daily revenue performance of a vessel. The reported rates are indicative of the current demand and supply dynamics in the dry bulk shipping market.Golden Ocean's completion of a Supramax vessel transaction with a $5.8 million gain and the ongoing sale of a Panamax vessel suggest active fleet management. This strategy could be aimed at optimizing the fleet in response to market conditions or shifting towards more profitable or efficient vessel classes.Projected TCE rates for the first half of 2024 show a substantial portion of Capesize and Panamax available days already secured at rates that appear to be consistent with Q4 2023 performance. This forward-looking information is critical for stakeholders to gauge expected revenue streams and operational stability in the near term. Economist The dry bulk shipping industry, where Golden Ocean operates, is highly cyclical and influenced by global economic factors such as commodity demand, trade flows and fleet supply. The fluctuation in annual net income can be attributed to these market dynamics. An economist would assess the broader economic environment, including indicators such as global GDP growth, infrastructure spending and trade policies, which could impact the demand for dry bulk shipping.The company's ability to secure long-term financing at attractive terms suggests a favorable credit environment or confidence among lenders in the company's financial health and industry prospects. This financial agility could be a competitive advantage in an industry that requires significant capital for operations and fleet expansion.Furthermore, the strategic sale of vessels and the gain recorded from these transactions indicate an active approach to capitalizing on asset values and market timing. It's essential to consider how these activities align with broader economic trends and their implications for the company's asset turnover and return on investment. 02/28/2024 - 02:00 AM Golden Ocean Group Limited (NASDAQ/OSE: GOGL) (the “Company” or “Golden Ocean”), the world's largest listed owner of large size dry bulk vessels, today announced its unaudited results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023. Highlights Net income of $57.5 million and earnings per share of $0.29 (basic) for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with net income of $28.7 million and earnings per share of $0.14 (basic) for the third quarter of 2023.Net income of $112.3 million and earnings per share of $0.56 (basic) for full year 2023, compared with net income of $461.8 million and earnings per share of $2.30 (basic) for full year 2022.Adjusted EBITDA of $123.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with $78.9 million for the third quarter of 2023.Adjusted net income of $64.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $22.0 million for the third quarter of 2023.Reported TCE rates for Capesize and Panamax vessels of $25,176 per day and $16,738 per day, respectively, and $21,958 per day for the entire fleet in the fourth quarter of 2023.Completed a purchase and sale of a Supramax vessel, recording a gain of $5.8 million upon delivery of the vessel to its new owner. Entered into an agreement to sell one Panamax vessel for net consideration of $15.8 million.Arranged financings in an aggregate amount of $625 million at highly attractive terms. Upon completion, the Company will have fully funded its remaining capex obligations and refinanced all of its debt maturities until 2026.Estimated TCE rates, inclusive of charter coverage calculated on a load-to-discharge basis, are approximately: $25,000 per day for 74% of Capesize available days and $15,400 per day for 84% of Panamax available days for the first quarter of 2024.$25,000 per day for 25% of Capesize available days and $14,200 per day for 19% of Panamax available days for the second quarter of 2024. Announced a cash dividend of $0.30 per share for the fourth quarter of 2023, which is payable on or about March 25, 2024, to shareholders of record on March 13, 2024. Shareholders holding the Company’s shares through Euronext VPS may receive this cash dividend later on or about March 27, 2024. Lars-Christian Svensen, Chief Executive Officer, commented: “The Company’s large, modern fleet has been predominantly exposed to the spot market, resulting in strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2023 and thus far in 2024. The market for large size dry bulk vessels continues to outperform the broader freight market due to increasing tonne-mile demand for various key commodities, including iron ore, coal, and bauxite. We have entered 2024 with strong demand in Asia and a broad-based global economic recovery underway, creating an overall healthy demand picture. Fleet growth, particularly in the Capesize segment, remains at historically low levels, and the global fleet is trading at historically high efficiency levels. The Company maintains a positive outlook, and with no unfunded capex or near-term debt maturities, we are well positioned to continue to return value to our shareholders through dividends. Golden Ocean has now paid a dividend for 11 consecutive quarters, demonstrating the Company’s potential as well as the resilience of its performance in weaker market conditions.” The Board of DirectorsGolden Ocean Group LimitedHamilton, BermudaFebruary 28, 2024 Questions should be directed to: Lars-Christian Svensen: Chief Executive Officer, Golden Ocean Management AS+47 22 01 73 40 Peder Simonsen: Chief Financial Officer, Golden Ocean Management AS+47 22 01 73 40 The full report is available in the link below.

Positive None. Negative None. Medical Technology Analyst The introduction of Stryker's Blueprint Mixed Reality (MR) Guidance System represents a significant advancement in the field of orthopaedic surgery, particularly for shoulder arthroplasty. This system, which integrates Stryker's software with the Microsoft HoloLens 2 headset, could potentially lead to improved surgical outcomes through enhanced precision and personalization of the surgical process. By allowing surgeons to visualize 3D images and guidance widgets directly in their line of sight, the technology promises to streamline the surgical workflow and reduce the likelihood of errors.From an industry perspective, the adoption of such technology could set a new standard for pre-operative planning and intraoperative navigation. Given that the system has received a CE mark, indicating conformity with health, safety and environmental protection standards for products sold within the European Economic Area, it is poised for broader adoption in Europe. This could lead to increased market demand for Stryker's products, potentially impacting the company's financial performance positively if the technology is widely accepted and adopted. Healthcare Market Analyst Considering the broader market implications, the successful implementation of the Blueprint MR Guidance System in Europe could serve as a catalyst for Stryker's market share growth in the medical technology sector. The company's strategic collaboration with surgeons and integration with Microsoft's advanced technology indicates a commitment to innovation, which is crucial for maintaining competitive advantage in the fast-evolving medtech industry.Investors should monitor the outcomes of the pilot study being conducted in France, as positive results could lead to increased trust and credibility among surgeons, potentially driving further adoption. The long-term success of this technology will depend on its ability to demonstrate tangible benefits over traditional surgical methods, such as reduced operation times, lower complication rates and quicker patient recovery times, which would ultimately translate into cost savings for healthcare providers. Financial Analyst Financially, the launch of a new product like the Blueprint MR Guidance System could have a notable impact on Stryker's revenue streams. The medical device sector is known for high barriers to entry due to stringent regulatory requirements and significant R&D expenditures. However, once these barriers are overcome, the introduction of innovative products can lead to substantial returns on investment. The fact that the system has already been used in the U.S. and Canada and now in Europe, suggests that Stryker is effectively expanding its global footprint.It is essential to evaluate how the adoption of this technology will affect operating costs and whether it will require additional investment in training or support infrastructure. Investors should also consider the potential for this technology to create recurring revenue through software updates, disposable components, or service contracts, which could contribute to a more stable and predictable revenue stream for Stryker. 02/28/2024 - 02:10 AM Blueprint Mixed Reality Guidance System offers shoulder arthroplasty surgeons a new tool to execute their pre-operative plan AMSTERDAM--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Stryker (NYSE:SYK), a global leader in medical technologies, today announced that the first shoulder arthroplasty surgeries using Blueprint Mixed Reality (MR) Guidance in Europe have been successfully completed by Professor Julien Berhouet, MD, PhD, CHRU Tours Hospital, France, and Dr. Lionel Neyton, MD, orthopaedic shoulder surgeon at Centre Orthopédique Santy and Hôpital Privé Jean Mermoz in Lyon, France.

The Nomination Committee proposes that Advokat Eva Hägg be elected Chair of the AGM. Item 2 Preparation and approval of the voting list The voting list proposed for approval is the voting list drawn up by Euroclear Sweden AB on behalf of the Company, based on the AGM's register of shareholders, shareholders having given notice of participation and being present at the meeting venue and postal votes received. Item 8.4 Dividend and record dates The Board of Directors proposes a dividend to the shareholders of SEK 2.70 per share. The dividend is proposed to be paid in two equal installments, SEK 1.35 per share with the record date April 5, 2024, and SEK 1.35 per share with the record date October 2, 2024. Assuming these dates will be the record dates, Euroclear Sweden AB is expected to disburse SEK 1.35 per share on April 10, 2024, and SEK 1.35 per share on October 7, 2024. Item 9 Number of Board members and deputies to be elected by the AGM According to the articles of association, the Board of Directors shall consist of no less than five and no more than twelve Board members, with no more than six deputies. The Nomination Committee proposes that the number of Board members elected by the AGM shall be ten and that no deputies be elected. Item 10 Fees payable to members of the Board of Directors elected by the AGM and to members of the Committees of the Board of Directors elected by the AGM The Nomination Committee proposes that fees to non-employee Board members elected by the AGM and non-employee members of the Committees of the Board of Directors elected by the AGM be paid as follows: SEK 4,640,000 to the Chair of the Board of Directors (previously SEK 4,500,000);SEK 1,175,000 to each of the other Board members (previously SEK 1,140,000);SEK 540,000 to the Chair of the Audit and Compliance Committee (previously SEK 495,000);SEK 310,000 to each of the other members of the Audit and Compliance Committee (previously SEK 285,000);SEK 230,000 to the Chair of the Enterprise Business and Technology Committee (previously SEK 210,000);SEK 200,000 to each of the other members of the Enterprise Business and Technology Committee (previously SEK 185,000);SEK 220,000 to each Chair of the Finance and the Remuneration Committee (previously SEK 210,000); andSEK 195,000 to each of the other members of the Finance and the Remuneration Committee (previously SEK 185,000).The Nomination Committee considered the Board fees with the objective of ensuring that they allow for the recruitment and retention of high quality individuals while also being appropriate in comparison to other technology companies operating globally and with similar size and complexity. As such, the Nomination Committee has concluded that an increase of the fees to all members of the Board and Board Committees, including their Chairs, in accordance with the above is reasonable, well-justified and in the best interests of the Company. The proposal of the Nomination Committee provides for an increase of the fees of approximately 3.8% compared with the total fees to the corresponding number of Board and Committee members for Board and Committee work resolved by the Annual General Meeting 2023.Fees in the form of synthetic sharesBackgroundThe Nomination Committee believes that it is appropriate that Board members elected by the shareholders hold shares in Ericsson, in order to strengthen the Board members' and the shareholders' mutual interests in the Company. The Nomination Committee recommends that Board members elected by the shareholders, over a five year period, build a holding of shares or synthetic shares in Ericsson equal to at least the value of the annual Board fee (excluding fees for Committee work), and that such holding be kept during the time the Board member remains Board member in Ericsson. To enable Board members to create an economic interest in the Company and considering that it is in many cases difficult for Board members to trade in the Company's share due to applicable insider rules, the Nomination Committee proposes that the Board members should, as previously, be offered the option of receiving part of the Board fees in the form of synthetic shares. A synthetic share constitutes a right to receive payment of an amount which corresponds to the market value of a share of series B in the Company on Nasdaq Stockholm at the time of payment. ProposalThe Nomination Committee therefore proposes that the AGM 2024 resolve that part of the fees to the Board member, in respect of their Board assignment (however, not in respect of Committee work), may be paid in the form of synthetic shares, on the following terms and conditions. A nominated Board member shall be able to choose to receive the fee in respect of his or her Board assignment, according to the following four alternatives:25 percent in cash – 75 percent in synthetic shares50 percent in cash – 50 percent in synthetic shares75 percent in cash – 25 percent in synthetic shares100 percent in cashThe number of synthetic shares to be allocated shall be valued at the average of the market price of shares of series B in the Company on Nasdaq Stockholm during a period of five trading days immediately following the publication of Ericsson's interim report for the first quarter of 2024. The synthetic shares are vested during the term of office, with 25 percent per quarter of the year.The synthetic shares give a right to, following the publication of Ericsson's year-end financial statement in 2029, receive payment of a cash amount per synthetic share corresponding to the market price of shares of series B in the Company in close connection with the time of payment.An amount corresponding to dividend in respect of shares of series B in the Company, resolved by the AGM during the holding period, shall be disbursed at the same time as the cash amount.Should the Board member's assignment to the Board of Directors come to an end no later than during the third calendar year after the year in which the AGM resolved on allocation of the synthetic shares, payment may take place the year after the assignment came to an end.The number of synthetic shares may be subject to recalculation in the event of bonus issues, splits, rights issues and similar measures, under the terms and conditions for the synthetic shares.The complete terms and conditions for the synthetic shares are described in Exhibit 1 to the Nomination Committee's proposal. The financial difference for the Company, should all Board members receive part of their fees in the form of synthetic shares compared with the fees being paid in cash only, is assessed to be limited.Item 11 Election of Board members and deputies of the Board of DirectorsProposals The Nomination Committee proposes that the following persons be re-elected as members of the Board: 11.1 Jon Fredrik Baksaas; 11.2 Jan Carlson; 11.3 Carolina Dybeck Happe; 11.4 Börje Ekholm; 11.5 Eric A. Elzvik; 11.6 Kristin S. Rinne; 11.7 Jonas Synnergren; 11.8 Jacob Wallenberg; and 11.9 Christy Wyatt. 11.10 The Nomination Committee proposes that Karl Åberg be elected as new Board member of Ericsson. Considerations The Nomination Committee primarily searches for potential Board member candidates for the upcoming mandate period, but also considers future competence needs. It is a long journey to identify the right candidates and long-term planning is essential. In assessing the appropriate composition of the Board of Directors, the Nomination Committee considers, among other things, experience and competence needed on the Board and its Committees, and the value of diversity in age, gender and cultural/geographic background as well as the need for renewal. The Nomination Committee believes that diversity on the Board will support Ericsson's sustainable development and therefore continually focuses on identifying Board member candidates with different backgrounds. While acknowledging increased expectations on transparency relating to diversity on the Board, applicable privacy regulations prevent Ericsson and the Nomination Committee from processing certain sensitive personal data about its Board members, such as information relating to demographic background. The Nomination Committee has applied the Swedish Corporate Governance Code, Section 4.1, as its diversity policy. Focusing on improving the gender balance of the Board over time, the Nomination Committee particularly works to identify women candidates matching the current and future needs of the Board. The Nomination Committee also assesses the appropriateness of the number of Board members and whether the Board members can devote the necessary time required to fulfill their tasks as Board members in Ericsson. In its appraisal of qualifications and performance of the individual Board members, the Nomination Committee takes into account the competence and experience of each individual member along with the individual member's contribution to the Board work as a whole and to the Committee work. The Committee has familiarized itself with the results of the Board work evaluation that was led by the Chair of the Board of Directors. The Nomination Committee's objective is to propose and support the election of a Board that is comprised of individuals of the highest competency and integrity, while also holistically comprising a strong mix of needed skills and experience to effectively oversee and lead Ericsson. The Nomination Committee is of the opinion that the current Board of Directors and Board work is well functioning. Further, it is the Nomination Committee's view that the Board fulfills expectations in terms of composition and that the Board of Directors as well as the individual Board members fulfill expectations in terms of expertise. Competencies and experiences represented on the Board include broad international industry experience, experience from the telecom, IT and ICT sectors, technological and technical competencies and experiences (e.g. related to software and digitalization), financial expertise and experience from private equity, M&A and new business. The Nomination Committee further believes that competencies and experiences within the ESG areas (areas within environmental, social and governance) considered most relevant for Ericsson and the sector in which the Company operates are well represented on the Board, including, for example, related to the technologies the Company develops and delivers as well as relating to ethics and compliance. Helena Stjernholm has informed the Nomination Committee that she will not stand for re-election at the AGM 2024. The Nomination Committee proposes re-election of current Board members Jon Fredrik Baksaas, Jan Carlson, Carolina Dybeck Happe, Börje Ekholm, Eric A. Elzvik, Kristin S. Rinne, Jonas Synnergren, Jacob Wallenberg and Christy Wyatt, and new election of Karl Åberg as member of the Board. Karl Åberg has long-term experience in investments and asset management. He is currently the Deputy Chief Executive Officer, head of the investment organization and the finance function at AB Industrivärden, and a member of the Board in Alleima and SCA. Previously, Karl Åberg was partner at Zeres Capital, partner at CapMan, and he has held various roles at Handelsbanken Capital Markets. It is the Nomination Committee's assessment that Karl Åberg adds valuable expertise and experience to the Board, and that Karl Åberg's extensive governance and financial knowledge will be of additional value to Ericsson and will further strengthen the Board. The Nomination Committee believes that the proposed Board composition provides the Company with the right conditions for realizing its long-term potential. Out of the proposed Board members to be elected by the AGM (excluding the President and CEO) 33% are women. Gender balance continues to be a key priority for the Nomination Committee, and the Committee will continue to work to improve the gender balance on the Board of Directors over time. Information regarding proposed Board membersInformation regarding the proposed Board members is presented in Exhibit 2 to the Nomination Committee's proposal. Independence of Board members The Nomination Committee has made the following assessments in terms of applicable Swedish independence requirements and US NASDAQ independence requirements: 1. The Nomination Committee considers that the following Board members are independent of the Company and its senior management: a. Jon Fredrik Baksaas b. Jan Carlson c. Carolina Dybeck Happe d. Eric A. Elzvik e. Kristin S. Rinne f. Jonas Synnergren g. Jacob Wallenberg h. Christy Wyatt i. Karl Åberg 2. From among the Board members reported in (i) above, the Nomination Committee considers that the following are independent of the Company's major shareholders: a. Jon Fredrik Baksaas b. Jan Carlson c. Carolina Dybeck Happe d. Eric A. Elzvik e. Kristin S. Rinne f. Jonas Synnergren g. Christy Wyatt Moreover, the Nomination Committee considers that the following Board members are independent in respect of all applicable independence requirements: a. Jon Fredrik Baksaas b. Jan Carlson c. Carolina Dybeck Happe d. Eric A. Elzvik e. Kristin S. Rinne f. Jonas Synnergren g. Christy Wyatt The Nomination Committee concludes that the proposed composition of the Board of Directors meets the independence requirements applicable to Ericsson. Item 12 Election of the Chair of the Board of Directors The Nomination Committee proposes that Jan Carlson be re-elected Chair of the Board of Directors. Item 13 Number of auditors According to the articles of association, the Company shall have no less than one and no more than three registered public accounting firms as auditor. The Nomination Committee proposes that the Company should have one registered public accounting firm as auditor. Item 14 Fees payable to the auditor The Nomination Committee proposes, as in previous years, that the auditor fees be paid against approved account. Item 15 Election of auditor In accordance with the recommendation by the Audit and Compliance Committee, the Nomination Committee proposes that Deloitte AB be appointed auditor for the period from the end of the AGM 2024 until the end of the AGM 2025 (re-election). Item 16 Implementation of LTV 2024 including transfer of treasury stock, directed share issue and authorization for the Board of Directors to decide on an acquisition offer of shares of series C Background The Remuneration Committee and the Board of Directors evaluate the long-term variable compensation (""LTV"") programs to the Executive Team (""ET"") and for employees classified as executives (""Executives"") on an ongoing basis. The evaluation considers the LTV programs for effectiveness in serving their purpose to support achieving the Ericsson Group's strategic business objectives and sustainable long-term interests as well as their facility to increase the long-term focus of the members of the ET and the Executives and align their interests with the long-term expectations and the interests of the shareholders. Upon evaluation of the currently ongoing LTV programs for the ET (LTV 2021, LTV 2022 and LTV I 2023) and the ongoing LTV program for the Executives (LTV II 2023), the Remuneration Committee and the Board of Directors concluded that these ongoing LTV programs, which are all in essence the same in terms of plan structure, performance criteria and performance periods, enabled the Company to achieve its long-term objectives. The LTV I 2023 and LTV II 2023 were put forward to the AGM 2023 as two separate programs: LTV I 2023 for the ET and LTV II 2023 for the Executives. For administrative reasons, the Board of Directors has decided to put forward the Long-Term Variable Compensation Program 2024 (""LTV 2024"") as one program applicable to both the ET and the Executives. The ongoing LTV programs have further enabled the Company to attract, retain and motivate senior leaders and offer them globally competitive remuneration, and remain committed to create increased shareholder value. In order to further strengthen Ericsson's, as well as the ET's and Executives', commitment to long-term sustainability and responsible business, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation from the Remuneration Committee, has concluded to propose to the AGM 2024 an LTV 2024 for the ET and the Executives. LTV 2024 is an integral part of the Company's remuneration strategy and the Board of Directors in particular expects the members of the ET and the Executives to build significant equity holdings to align the interests and expectations of the LTV program participants with those of shareholders. Proposals 16.1 Implementation of the LTV 2024 The Board of Directors proposes that the AGM 2024 resolve on the LTV 2024 for the ET and the Executives comprising a maximum of 10.4 million shares of series B in the Company as set out below. Objectives of the LTV program The LTV program is designed to provide long-term incentives for the ET and the Executives (""Participants""), thereby creating long-term value for the shareholders. The aim is to attract, retain and motivate senior leaders in a competitive market through performance-based share related incentives, to encourage the build-up of significant equity holdings to align the interests of the Participants with those of shareholders and to further strengthen the ET's and the Executives' commitment to long-term sustainability and responsible business. The LTV Program in brief The LTV Program is proposed to include all members (current and future) of the ET and the Executives, currently comprising 215 employees, including the President and CEO. Awards under LTV 2024 (""Performance Share Awards"") will be granted free of charge entitling the Participant, provided that, among other things, certain performance criteria as set out below are met, to receive a number of shares at no consideration, following expiration of a three-year vesting period (""Vesting Period""). Allotment of shares pursuant to Performance Share Awards will be subject to the achievement of performance criteria, as set out below, and will generally require that the Participant retains his or her employment over the Vesting Period. All major decisions relating to LTV 2024 will be taken by the Remuneration Committee, with approval by the full Board of Directors as required. Granting of Performance Share Awards Granting of Performance Share Awards to the Participants will generally take place as soon as practicably possible following the AGM 2024. For 2024, the value of the underlying shares in respect of the Performance Share Awards made to the President and CEO will not exceed 150% of the Annual Base Salary at the time of grant, and for other Participants, the value will not exceed 100% of the Participants' respective Annual Base Salary at the time of grant, unless the Participant is employed in the USA where the value will not exceed 200% of Participants' Annual Base Salary. The share price used to calculate the number of shares to which the Performance Share Awards entitle will be the volume-weighted average of the market price of shares of series B in Ericsson on Nasdaq Stockholm during the five trading days immediately following the publication of the Company's interim report for the fourth quarter 2023. Performance criteria The vesting of the Performance Share Awards will be subject to the satisfaction of a performance criterion related to 2024 Group EBITA (earnings (loss) before interest, taxes, amortizations and write-downs of acquired intangible assets) (operating income), along with performance criteria related to three-year total shareholder return (""TSR""[1]) and Group Environmental Social Governance (""ESG""), which will determine what portion (if any) of the Performance Share Awards will vest at the end of the Vesting Period. The 2024 Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion relates to 45% of the Performance Share Awards and the maximum vesting level is 200%. The performance criteria based on TSR are absolute TSR development and relative TSR development for the Ericsson series B share over the period January 1, 2024 – December 31, 2026 (""Performance Period""[2]). The absolute and relative TSR performance criteria relate to 25% and 20%, respectively, of the Performance Share Awards and the maximum vesting level for both TSR performance criteria is 200%. The Group ESG performance criterion measured over the Performance Period will relate to 10% of the Performance Share Awards, and the maximum vesting level is 200%. The following conditions will apply to the performance criteria: 2024 Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion45% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfilment of a Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion for the 2024 financial year. The 2024 Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion established by the Board of Directors will stipulate a minimum level and a maximum level. The 2024 Group EBITA (operating income) target is not disclosed due to stock market and competition considerations. The vesting level of Performance Share Awards related to 2024 Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion will be determined by the Board of Directors when the audited result for the financial year 2024 is available. If the maximum performance level is reached or exceeded, the vesting will amount to (and will not exceed) the maximum level of 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to the 2024 Group EBITA (operating income) performance criterion. If performance is below the maximum level but exceeds the minimum level, a linear pro-rata vesting of shares will occur. No vesting will occur if performance amounts to or is below the minimum level. The allotment of the shares will not occur until the end of the Vesting Period in 2027. TSR performance criteriaAbsolute TSR performance criterion 25% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfillment of an absolute TSR performance criterion over the Performance Period. If the absolute TSR development reaches or exceeds 14% per annum compounded, the maximum vesting of 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to absolute TSR performance criterion will occur. If the absolute TSR development is below or reaches only 6% per annum compounded, no vesting will occur in respect of the Performance Share Awards related to the absolute TSR performance criterion. A linear pro-rata vesting from 0% to 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to absolute TSR performance criterion will apply if the Company's absolute TSR performance is between 6% and 14% per annum compounded.Relative TSR performance criterion20% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfilment of a relative TSR performance criterion over the Performance Period, compared to a peer group consisting of eleven peer companies (""Peer Group""[3]). The vesting of the relative TSR related Performance Share Awards varies depending on the Company's TSR performance ranking versus the other companies in the Peer Group. If the Company's relative TSR performance is below the TSR development of the company ranked 6th in the Peer Group, no vesting will occur in respect of the Performance Share Awards related to relative TSR performance criterion. Vesting of the Performance Share Awards related to relative TSR performance criterion will occur at the following percentage levels, based on which ranking position in the Peer Group the Company's TSR performance corresponds to: Position within the Peer Group Associated vesting percentage level 6 or lower 0% 5 50% 4 100% 3 150% 2 or higher 200% If the Company's TSR performance is between two of the ranked companies, a linear pro-rata vesting will apply between the vesting percentage levels for the relevant ranked positions. Group ESG performance criterion10% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfilment of a Group ESG performance criterion comprised of two equally weighted subcomponents covering environmental and social aspects of ESG measured over the Performance Period. Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions 5% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfillment of a subcomponent of reducing greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions[4] from service fleet vehicles, energy consumption at facilities and from business travel[5]. Subcomponent target- and corresponding achievement levels are defined in the schedule below and broken down for each of the three years[6] covered by the Performance Period. Vesting is determined at the end of each year, with each year corresponding to one third (1/3) of the total subcomponent Performance Share Awards. A linear pro-rata vesting of one third (1/3) of 0% to 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to reducing emissions in the subcomponent will apply if reported emissions in scope are between the minimum and maximum vesting levels for each of the years covered by the Performance Period. An illustrative example is included below. These target levels are aligned to the emissions reduction trajectory set for achieving Net Zero emissions from the Ericsson Group's own activities by 2030. Achievement GHG emissions target levels for emission in scope by fiscal year (ktonne CO2e) (%) 2024 2025 2026 0 138 133 126 100 122 117 110 200 114 110 102 Illustrative example: first, if reported emissions in scope for the year 2024 are 114 ktonne, the maximum vesting of one third of 200% (1/3 x 200% = 66.67%) of the Performance Share Awards related to this subcomponent and year will occur. Next, if reported emissions for the year 2025 are 117 ktonne, vesting of one third of 100% (1/3 x 100% = 33.33%) of the Performance Share Awards related to this subcomponent and fiscal year will occur. Last, if reported emissions in scope for the year 2026 are 126 ktonne, no vesting (1/3 x 0% = 0.00%) of the Performance Share Awards related to this subcomponent will occur. Consequently, in this example total vesting of the Performance Share Award related to this subcomponent over the Performance Period will be (66.67% + 33.33% + 0.00%) 100%. Increasing the representation of women leaders in Ericsson 5% of the Performance Share Awards granted to a Participant will be subject to fulfilment of a subcomponent of increasing the representation of women leaders (i.e., women holding roles with people management responsibility) in the Ericsson Group to 26% by the end of the Performance Period, which is in line with achieving the target trajectory for increasing the representation of women leaders in the Ericsson Group to 30% by 2030. If the representation of women leaders in the Ericsson Group amounts to 27% or above by the end of the Performance Period, the maximum vesting of 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to this subcomponent will occur. If the representation of women leaders in the Ericsson Group amounts to 25% or below by the end of the Performance Period, no vesting will occur in respect of the Performance Share Awards related to this subcomponent. A linear pro-rata vesting from 0% to 200% of the Performance Share Awards related to increasing the representation of women leaders in the Ericsson Group subcomponent will apply if the representation of women leaders in the Ericsson Group exceeds 25% but is below 27% by the end of the Performance Period. The vesting level of Performance Share Awards related to the Group ESG performance criterion will be determined by the Board of Directors when the audited results for both subcomponents at the end of the financial year 2026 are available. Information about the outcome of the performance criteria will be provided no later than in the annual report for the financial year 2026. Allotment of shares Provided that the performance criteria above have been met and that the Participant has retained his or her employment (unless special circumstances are at hand) during the Vesting Period, allotment of vested shares will take place as soon as practicably possible following the expiration of the Vesting Period. When determining the final vesting level of Performance Share Awards, the Board of Directors shall examine whether the vesting level is reasonable considering the Company's financial results and position, conditions on the stock market and other circumstances, such as environmental, social, ethics and compliance factors, and if not, as determined by the Board of Directors, reduce the vesting level to the lower level deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors. In the event delivery of shares to Participants cannot take place under applicable law or at a reasonable cost and employing reasonable administrative measures, the Board of Directors will be entitled to decide that Participants may, instead, be offered a cash settlement. The Company has the right to, before delivering vested shares to the Participants, retain and sell the number of shares required to cover the cost for withholding and paying tax and social security liabilities on behalf of the Participants in relation to the Performance Share Awards for remittance to revenue authorities. In such an event, net amount of vested shares will thus be delivered to the Participants after the vested Performance Share Awards are reduced by the number of shares retained by the Company for such purposes. Financing The Board of Directors has considered different financing methods for transfer of shares under the LTV 2024 such as transfer of treasury stock and an equity swap agreement with a third party. The Board of Directors considers that a directed issue of shares of series C in the Company, followed by buy-back and transfer of treasury stock is the most cost efficient and flexible method to transfer shares under LTV 2024. The Company's current holding of treasury stock is not sufficient for the implementation of the LTV 2024. Therefore, the Board of Directors proposes a directed share issue and buy back of shares as further set out below under item 16.2. Under the proposed transactions, shares are issued at the share's quota value and repurchased as soon as the shares have been subscribed for and registered. The purchase price paid by the Company to the subscriber equals the subscription price. As compensation to the subscriber for its assistance in the issuance and buy-back of shares under items 16 and 17, the Company will pay to the subscriber an amount totaling SEK 100,000. The procedure of issuance and buy-back of shares for the Company's LTV programs has previously been decided by the AGMs in 2001, 2003, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2016, 2017 and 2023. Since the costs for the Company in connection with an equity swap agreement will be significantly higher than the costs in connection with transfer of treasury stock, the main alternative is that the financial exposure is secured by transfer of treasury stock and that an equity swap agreement with a third party is an alternative in the event that the required majority for approval is not reached. Costs The total effect on the income statement of the LTV 2024, including financing costs and social security fees, is estimated to range between SEK 260 million and SEK 475 million distributed over the years 2024-2027. The costs will depend on the future development of the price of Ericsson series B share. The administration cost for hedging the financial exposure of the LTV 2024 by way of an equity swap agreement is currently estimated to approximately SEK 70 million, compared to the cost of approximately SEK 100,000 for using newly issued and acquired shares in treasury (SEK 100,000 is the total cost paid to the subscriber in relation to items 16 and 17, regardless of the number of share issuances). Dilution The Company has approximately 3.3 billion registered shares. As per February 27, 2024, the Company held approximately 12.5 million shares in treasury. The number of shares that may be required for ongoing LTV programs (2021, 2022, and II 2023) as per February 27, 2024, is estimated to approximately 10 million shares, corresponding to approximately 0.30 percent of the number of registered shares of the Company. In order to implement the LTV 2024, a total of up to 10.4 million shares are required, which corresponds to approximately 0.31 percent of the total number of registered shares of the Company, hence an issue of new shares of series C, followed by a buy-back, is proposed for the implementation of LTV 2024. The effect on important key figures is only marginal. 16.2 Transfer of treasury stock to employees and on an exchange, directed share issue and acquisition offer for the LTV 2024 a. Transfer of treasury stock under the LTV 2024 To secure the delivery of Performance Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of the LTV 2024, the Board of Directors proposes that the AGM resolve that the Company shall have the right to transfer no more than 8.6 million shares of series B in the Company less any shares retained by the Company as per item 16.2 c) on the following terms and conditions: The right to acquire shares shall be granted to such persons within the Ericsson Group covered by the terms and conditions pursuant to the LTV 2024. Furthermore, subsidiaries within the Ericsson Group shall have the right to acquire shares, free of consideration, and such subsidiaries shall be obligated to immediately transfer, free of consideration, shares to employees covered by the terms and conditions of the LTV 2024.The employee shall have the right to receive shares during the period when the employee is entitled to receive shares pursuant to the terms and conditions of the LTV 2024.Employees covered by the terms and conditions of the LTV 2024 shall receive shares of series B in the Company free of consideration.The number of shares of series B in the Company that may be transferred under the LTV 2024 may be subject to recalculation in the event of bonus issues, splits, rights issues and/or similar measures, under the terms and conditions of the LTV 2024.b. Transfer of treasury stock on an exchange to cover expenses for the LTV 2024 The Company may, prior to the AGM in 2025, transfer no more than 1.8 million shares of series B in the Company, in order to cover certain expenses, mainly social security payments. Transfer of the shares shall be effected on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the, at each time, prevailing price interval for the share as disseminated by Nasdaq Stockholm. c. Authorization to decide on transfer of treasury stock on an exchange to cover costs for tax and social security liabilities for the Participants in the LTV 2024 Authorization for the Board of Directors to decide to, in conjunction with the delivery of vested shares under LTV 2024, prior to the AGM in 2025, retain and sell no more than 70% of the vested shares of series B in the Company in order to cover the costs for withholding and paying tax and social security liabilities on behalf of the Participants in relation to the Performance Share Awards for remittance to revenue authorities. Transfer of the shares shall be effected on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the, at each time, prevailing price interval for the share as disseminated by Nasdaq Stockholm. These shares form a part of the final number of vested shares to the employees under LTV 2024 and do not incur additional costs to the LTV 2024 for the Company. d. Directed issue of shares of series C in the Company for the LTV 2024 Increase of the share capital in the Company by SEK 52,000,000.01 through an issue of 10.4 million shares of series C in the Company, each share with a quota value of approximately SEK 5. The terms and conditions of the share issue are the following: The new shares shall – with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights – be subscribed for only by Investor AB or its subsidiaries.The new shares shall be subscribed for during the period as from April 25, 2024, up to and including May 2, 2024. Over-subscription may not occur.The amount that shall be paid for each new share shall be the quota value (approximately SEK 5).Payment for the subscribed shares shall be made at the time of subscription.The Board of Directors shall be entitled to extend the period for subscription and payment.The new shares shall not entitle the holders to dividend payment.It is noted that the new shares are subject to restrictions pursuant to Chapter 4, Section 6 (conversion clause) and Chapter 20, Section 31 (redemption clause) of the Swedish Companies Act.The Board of Directors proposes that the President and CEO shall be authorized to make the minor adjustments to the above resolutions that may prove to be necessary in connection with the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. Reasons for deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and principles on which the subscription price is based The Board of Directors considers that a directed issue of shares of series C, followed by buy-back and transfer of treasury stock is the most cost efficient and flexible method to transfer shares under the LTV 2024. Shares are issued at the share's quota value and repurchased as soon as the shares have been subscribed for and registered. The purchase price paid by the Company to the subscriber equals the subscription price. e. Authorization for the Board of Directors to decide on a directed acquisition offer for the LTV 2024 Authorization for the Board of Directors to decide that 10.4 million shares of series C in the Company be acquired according to the following: Acquisition may occur by an offer to acquire shares directed to all holders of shares of series C in Ericsson.The authorization may be exercised until the AGM in 2025.The acquisition shall be made at a price corresponding to the quota value of the share (approximately SEK 5 per share).Payment for acquired shares shall be made in cash.16.3 Equity Swap Agreement with third party in relation to the LTV 2024 In the event that the required majority for approval is not reached under item 16.2 above, the financial exposure of the LTV 2024 shall be hedged by the Company entering into an equity swap agreement with a third party, under which the third party may, in its own name, acquire and transfer shares of series B in the Company to employees covered by the LTV 2024. Majority rules The resolution of the AGM on implementation of the LTV 2024 according to item 16.1 requires that more than half of the votes cast at the AGM approve the proposal. The resolution of the AGM on transfer of treasury stock to employees and on an exchange, directed share issue and acquisition offer for the LTV 2024 according to item 16.2 requires that shareholders representing at least nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the AGM approve the proposal. The resolution of the AGM on an Equity Swap Agreement with third party according to item 16.3 requires that more than half of the votes cast at the AGM approve the proposal. Description of other ongoing long-term variable compensation programs In addition to the LTV programs 2021, 2022 and I 2023, which are directed at the President and CEO and the members of the ET, and LTV II 2023, which is directed at the Executives, the Company has other ongoing long-term variable compensation programs directed at other employees within the Group. These programs are an integral part of the Company's remuneration strategy as well as a part of the Company's talent management strategy. The Company has decided to implement one other share-related compensation program for 2024: the Key Contribution Plan 2024 (""KC Plan 2024""). Ericsson has also implemented an all-employee share purchase plan in 2021 (ESPP). The KC Plan 2024 The KC Plan 2024 is designed to recognize the best talent, individual performance, potential and critical skills as well as encourage the retention of key employees. Approximately 10% to 14% of Ericsson employees will be eligible for the KC Plan 2024. The award levels are assigned to employees mainly within in a range of 10 – 50% of Annual Base Salary to bring greater alignment with the local market conditions. Participants are assigned a potential award, which is converted into a number of synthetic shares based on the same market price of the shares of series B in Ericsson used for the LTV 2024 at the time of grant. The plan has a three-year total service period (""Service Period"") during which the awards are paid on an annual rolling bases following the below payment schedule: 25% of the award at the end of the first year,25% of the award at the end of the second year, and50% of the award at the end of the full Service Period.The value of each synthetic share is driven by the absolute share price performance of shares of series B in Ericsson shares during the Service Period. At the date of vesting for each instalment of the above-described annual rolling payment schedule, the synthetic shares are converted into a cash amount, based on the market price of the Ericsson series B share on Nasdaq Stockholm at the respective vesting date, and this final amount is paid to the Participant in cash gross before tax. It is estimated that approximately 30 million synthetic shares will be awarded under the KC Plan 2024. The maximum total cost effect of the KC Plan 2024 on the income statement, including social security fees, is estimated to be approximately SEK 5 billion distributed over the years 2024-2027. The costs will depend on the future development of the market price of the Ericsson series B share. The Ericsson share purchase plan (""ESPP"") Ericsson is committed to helping employees thrive and to recognizing them for the impact they create by providing opportunities to enrich their working experience. In order to encourage employees to play an active role in achieving the Company's purpose, further create sense of belonging and ownership, the ESPP was launched in November 2021 (in 58 countries to approximately 58,900 eligible employees), with continued deployment in 2022 to 20 additional countries and 30,100 eligible employees. In total the ESPP is now live in 79 countries for 88,000 eligible employees of which 15,099 were actually participating at year-end 2023. The ESPP is an all-employee share purchase plan that enables employees to purchase shares of series B in Ericsson up to a maximum value of SEK 55,000 per year via monthly payroll deduction. In recognition of the employees' commitment, Ericsson supports the participants with a net cash payment up to 15% of their elected contribution amounts and covers the tax on the Company supported amount, which is payable via payroll. Under the ESPP participants will acquire shares of series B in Ericsson at market price on Nasdaq Stockholm and the ESPP does therefore not have any dilutive effect. The Company's ongoing variable compensation programs are described in further detail in the Annual Report 2023 in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements, Note G3: Share-based compensation and on the Company's website. Item 17 Resolution on transfer of treasury stock to employees and on an exchange, directed share issue and acquisition offer in relation to the earlier resolution on the LTV I 2023 The AGM in 2023 resolved to implement Long-Term Variable Compensation Program I 2023 (""LTV I 2023"") and to secure the Company's undertakings under LTV I 2023 through an equity swap agreement with a third party. The Board of Directors still considers that transfer of treasury stock, a proposal that was not approved by the AGM 2023, is the most cost efficient and flexible method to secure the undertakings under LTV I 2023. The Company has approximately 3.3 billion registered shares. For LTV I 2023, a total of up to 4.1 million shares are required, which corresponds to approximately 0.12 percent of the total number of registered shares, hence an issue of new shares of series C, followed by a buy-back, is proposed for LTV I 2023. The effect on important key figures is only marginal. a. Transfer of treasury stock under the LTV I 2023 To secure the delivery of Performance Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of the LTV I 2023, the Board of Directors proposes that the AGM resolve that the Company shall have the right to transfer no more than 3.4 million shares of series B in the Company less any shares retained by the Company as per item 17 c) on the following terms and conditions: The right to acquire shares shall be granted to such persons within the Ericsson Group covered by the terms and conditions pursuant to the LTV I 2023. Furthermore, subsidiaries within the Ericsson Group shall have the right to acquire shares, free of consideration, and such subsidiaries shall be obligated to immediately transfer, free of consideration, shares to employees covered by the terms and conditions of the LTV I 2023.The employee shall have the right to receive shares during the period when the employee is entitled to receive shares pursuant to the terms and conditions of the LTV I 2023.Employees covered by the terms and conditions of the LTV I 2023 shall receive shares of series B in the Company free of consideration.The number of shares of series B in the Company that may be transferred under the LTV I 2023 may be subject to recalculation in the event of bonus issues, splits, rights issues and/or similar measures, under the terms and conditions of the LTV I 2023.b. Transfer of treasury stock on an exchange to cover expenses for the LTV I 2023 The Company may, prior to the AGM in 2025, transfer no more than 700,000 shares of series B in the Company, in order to cover certain expenses, mainly social security payments. Transfer of the shares shall be effected on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the, at each time, prevailing price interval for the share as disseminated by Nasdaq Stockholm. c. Authorization to decide on transfer of treasury stock on an exchange to cover costs for tax and social security liabilities for the Participants in the LTV I 2023 Authorization for the Board of Directors to decide to, in conjunction with the delivery of vested shares under LTV I 2023, prior to the AGM in 2025, retain and sell no more than 60% of the vested shares of series B in the Company in order to cover the costs for withholding and paying tax and social security liabilities on behalf of the Participants in relation to the Performance Share Awards for remittance to revenue authorities. Transfer of the shares shall be effected on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the, at each time, prevailing price interval for the share as disseminated by Nasdaq Stockholm. These shares form a part of the final number of vested shares to the employees under LTV I 2023 and do not incur additional costs to the LTV I 2023 for the Company. d. Directed issue of shares of series C in the Company for the LTV I 2023 Increase of the share capital in the Company by SEK 20,500,000.01 through an issue of 4.1 million shares of series C in the Company, each share with a quota value of approximately SEK 5.

Reasons for deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and principles on which the subscription price is based The Board of Directors considers that a directed issue of shares of series C, followed by buy-back and transfer of treasury stock is the most cost efficient and flexible method to transfer shares under the LTV I 2023. Shares are issued at the share's quota value and repurchased as soon as the shares have been subscribed for and registered. The purchase price paid by the Company to the subscriber equals the subscription price. As compensation to the subscriber for its assistance in the issuance and buy-back of shares under items 16 and 17, the Company will pay to the subscriber an amount totaling SEK 100,000. e. Authorization for the Board of Directors to decide on a directed acquisition offer for the LTV I 2023 Authorization for the Board of Directors to decide that 4.1 million shares of series C in the Company be acquired according to the following: Acquisition may occur by an offer to acquire shares directed to all holders of shares of series C in Ericsson.The authorization may be exercised until the AGM in 2025.The acquisition shall be made at a price corresponding to the quota value of the share (approximately SEK 5 per share).Payment for acquired shares shall be made in cash.Majority rules The resolution of the AGM on transfer of treasury stock to employees and on an exchange, directed share issue and acquisition offer for the LTV I 2023 according to item 17 is proposed to be taken as one decision and requires that shareholders representing at least nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the AGM approve the proposal. Item 18 Resolutions on transfer of treasury stock in relation to the resolutions on the ongoing LTV 2021, LTV 2022 and LTV II 202318.1 Transfer of treasury stock on an exchange to cover expenses The AGM in 2023 resolved on a right for the Company to transfer in total no more than 2 million shares of series B in the Company on a stock exchange to cover certain payments, mainly social security payments, which may occur in relation to the Long-Term Variable Compensation Programs LTV 2021, LTV 2022 and LTV II 2023 (the ""Programs""). The resolution is valid up to the following AGM. Resolutions on transfer of treasury stock for the purpose of the above-mentioned programs must therefore be repeated at subsequent AGMs. None of these 2 million shares of series B in the Company have been transferred up to February 27, 2024. The Board of Directors proposes that the AGM resolve that the Company may, prior to the AGM in 2025, transfer no more than 2 million shares of series B in the Company, or the lower number of shares of series B, which as per April 3, 2024 remain of the original 2 million shares for the purposes of covering certain payments, primarily social security payments that may occur in relation to the Programs.

Transfer of the shares shall be effected on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the, at each time, prevailing price interval for the share as disseminated by Nasdaq Stockholm.

The move aligns with ICL's strategy to invest in agriculture, particularly in Brazil, and capitalize on the growing demand for biologicals solutions. The acquisition is expected to drive innovation, increase market share, and strengthen ICL's position in the specialty plant nutrition market. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of Nitro 1000 by ICL represents a strategic move to diversify and strengthen its position in the agricultural sector, particularly in the biologicals market. The transaction, valued at approximately $30 million, is not just a financial investment but a calculated step towards capturing a larger share of a rapidly growing market. The biologicals space is gaining traction due to the increasing need for sustainable agricultural practices and the global push towards reducing chemical fertilizer usage.ICL's expansion into biologicals is timely, given the projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.8% in the ag biologicals market. By incorporating Nitro 1000's product line, which focuses on major crops such as soybean, corn and sugar cane, ICL is positioning itself to meet the rising demand for eco-friendly crop solutions. This could potentially lead to increased revenue streams and market share, especially in Brazil where ICL already enjoys a significant presence. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the acquisition of Nitro 1000 by ICL is relatively modest in scale but strategically significant. The $30 million price tag suggests a targeted investment designed to enhance ICL's product portfolio without overextending its capital resources. Investors should note that ICL's Brazilian sector accounted for 20% of its sales in 2023, indicating that the company is deepening its foothold in a key market.ICL's previous successful acquisitions in Brazil, such as the South American Plant Nutrition business of Compass Minerals and Fertiláqua, both in 2021, demonstrate a pattern of strategic growth in the region. This latest acquisition is expected to yield synergies with these earlier investments, potentially leading to improved operational efficiencies and cost savings. The integration of Nitro 1000 could offer ICL a competitive edge in the specialty plant nutrition space, which may reflect positively on its financial performance and attractiveness to investors. Sustainability Expert ICL's acquisition of Nitro 1000 underscores the company's commitment to sustainability in agriculture. Biologicals are a cornerstone of sustainable farming practices, as they can enhance nutrient uptake and stress tolerance in crops, reducing the dependence on traditional fertilizers. This aligns with global sustainability goals and the increasing regulatory pressures to move away from chemical-based agricultural inputs.The integration of Nitro 1000's biological solutions into ICL's portfolio not only enhances the company's sustainability profile but also meets a growing consumer demand for environmentally responsible products. As the agricultural industry continues to evolve, ICL's focus on sustainable solutions may improve its brand image and customer loyalty, contributing to long-term business resilience. 02/28/2024 - 02:29 AM Company adding meaningful manufacturing capabilities and expanding product portfolio with acquisition of Nitro 1000 TEL AVIV, Israel--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ICL (NYSE: ICL) (TASE: ICL), a leading global specialty minerals company, today announced it has acquired Nitro 1000, a manufacturer, developer and provider of biologicals in Brazil for approximately $30 million. This acquisition marks another meaningful step into the biologicals market, while expanding ICL’s product offerings and positioning the company for further expansions into new and adjacent end-markets. Nitro 1000 will immediately join the ICL product portfolio, and the company will begin selling to its existing customer base in Brazil. Nitro 1000’s products are mainly aimed at soybean, corn and sugar cane crops, and their application replaces or optimizes the use of fertilizers. This not only helps farmers increase profitability, it also offers a more sustainable solution. “We’re excited to merge Nitro 1000’s core expertise in biologicals manufacturing with ICL’s extensive R&D capabilities and innovation engine and to further execute against our stated strategy of continuing to invest in agriculture – specifically in Brazil,” said Elad Aharonson, president of ICL Growing Solutions. “This acquisition allows us to leverage our global Growing Solutions business to develop new products and technology, while benefitting from our existing production capacity and go-to-market strategy.

Negative None. 02/28/2024 - 01:20 AM OSLO, Norway, Feb. 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Nel ASA (Nel) (OSE: NEL) has initiated a process to explore and prepare for a potential spin-off and separate listing of its Fueling division with the intention to create two independent pure-play companies aiming to become market leaders in their respective fields. ""We have seen limited synergies between the Fueling and Electrolyser divisions and believe each business will be better positioned to become market leaders in their respective fields by operating independently,"" says Nel's CEO, Håkon Volldal. One year ago, when Nel presented its fourth quarter 2022 report, the company stated it was considering strategic actions for its Fueling division. Nel is now exploring spinning off the Fueling division as a dividend-in-kind to all existing Nel ASA shareholders and applying for listing of the shares in the separate fueling company on an OSE regulated market during 2024. This will create two streamlined and focused companies that can pursue their individual strategic agendas. Nel will ensure that the independent fueling company will have a sufficient liquidity runway at the time of listing. ""The underlying market drivers for electrolysers and hydrogen fueling stations remain strong. We believe that two independent and focused companies represent the structure that maximizes the likelihood of success for each business and therefore long-term shareholder value,"" Volldal says. The decision to spin off and separately list the Fueling division has not yet been concluded and no assurances can currently be given that it will be completed. If completed, the shares of Nel (comprising its Electrolyser division) will remain listed on the OSE under the ticker ""NEL"". Carnegie AS has been engaged as financial advisor to assist Nel in this process, and Wikborg Rein Advokatfirma AS is acting as Nel's legal counsel.

The initial conversion rate for the notes offers a premium of approximately 30% to the last reported share price. Five9 entered into capped call transactions to reduce potential dilution to its common stock. Negative None. Financial Analyst An increase in the offering size of convertible notes, as seen with Five9 Inc., often reflects strong demand from institutional investors, which can be interpreted as a positive market sentiment towards the company's creditworthiness and future prospects. The decision to use a portion of the proceeds to repurchase existing debt due in 2025 suggests a strategic move to manage the company's debt profile by taking advantage of current market conditions to refinance at potentially lower interest rates or more favorable terms.Furthermore, the introduction of capped call transactions is a sophisticated financial strategy aimed at minimizing the dilutive impact of the convertible notes on existing shareholders. It indicates that the management is considerate of shareholder value while securing capital for the company. The premium of approximately 30% on the initial conversion price over the last reported sale price of the common stock indicates confidence in the company's potential for stock price appreciation. Market Research Analyst The convertible notes offering and the associated capped call transactions could have a stabilizing effect on the stock price of Five9 in the short term, as the option counterparties engage in hedging activities. However, market dynamics could be influenced by these transactions, potentially increasing volatility around the periods when the option counterparties adjust their hedge positions.Understanding the potential market impact requires close monitoring of trading volumes and stock price movements, especially during the observation periods related to the conversion of the notes. Investors should also consider the broader implications of these financial instruments on the company's cost of capital and the implications for future financial flexibility. Legal Expert The offering of convertible notes under Rule 144A indicates that the securities are being offered in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers, which is a common practice for companies looking to raise capital with fewer regulatory disclosure obligations than public offerings. However, this limits the pool of potential investors and restricts the liquidity of the notes, as they are not registered under the Securities Act and, therefore, cannot be readily sold in the public market.Additionally, the terms of the convertible notes, such as the no-call period and the conditions under which they can be redeemed or converted, are legally binding and reflect the company's contractual obligations to the noteholders. The legal framework governing these transactions ensures that both the company and the noteholders have a clear understanding of their rights and obligations. 02/28/2024 - 01:12 AM SAN RAMON, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Five9, Inc. (NASDAQ: FIVN), the Intelligent CX Platform provider, today announced the pricing of $650.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.00% convertible senior notes due 2029 (the “notes”) in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”). The offering size was increased from the previously announced offering size of $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of the notes. Five9 also granted the initial purchasers of the notes a 13-day option to purchase up to an additional $97.5 million aggregate principal amount of the notes. The sale of the notes to the initial purchasers is expected to settle on March 1, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions, and is expected to result in approximately $633.5 million (or, if the initial purchasers fully exercise their option to purchase additional notes, approximately $728.8 million) in net proceeds to Five9 after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and estimated offering expenses payable by Five9. The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of Five9, and interest will be payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2024. The notes will mature on March 15, 2029, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. Five9 may not redeem the notes prior to March 22, 2027; on or after March 22, 2027 and prior to December 15, 2028, Five9 may redeem the notes, at its option and subject to certain conditions, as detailed below. Five9 expects to use approximately $304.9 million of the net proceeds of the offering of the notes to repurchase $313.1 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 0.500% convertible senior notes due 2025 (the “2025 notes”) (such transactions, the “2025 note repurchases”). Five9 also expects to use approximately $81.3 million of the net proceeds of the offering of the notes to pay the cost of the capped call transactions described below. The remainder of the net proceeds from the offering will be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Five9 expects that holders of the 2025 notes that sell their 2025 notes to Five9 may enter into or unwind various derivatives with respect to Five9’s common stock and/or purchase or sell shares of Five9’s common stock in the market to hedge their exposure in connection with these transactions. These activities could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Five9’s common stock or the notes. The initial conversion rate for the notes is 12.5918 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $79.42 per share). Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding December 15, 2028, the notes will be convertible at the option of the noteholders only upon the satisfaction of specified conditions and during certain periods. Thereafter, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, the notes will be convertible at the option of the noteholders at any time regardless of these conditions. Conversions of the notes will be settled in cash, shares of Five9’s common stock or a combination thereof, at Five9’s election. The initial conversion price represents a premium of approximately 30% to the $61.09 per share last reported sale price of Five9’s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market on February 27, 2024. Five9 may redeem all or any portion of the notes (subject to certain limitations), at its option, on or after March 22, 2027 and prior to December 15, 2028, at a cash redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if the last reported sale price of Five9’s common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which Five9 provides written notice of redemption. Holders of notes may require Five9 to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of certain events that constitute a fundamental change under the indenture governing the notes at a cash repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. In connection with certain corporate events or if Five9 issues a notice of redemption, Five9 will, under certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for holders who elect to convert their notes in connection with such corporate event or holders of called notes that elect to convert such notes during the relevant redemption period, as applicable. In connection with the pricing of the notes, Five9 entered into capped call transactions with one of the initial purchasers and other financial institutions (the “option counterparties”). The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to Five9’s common stock upon any conversion of the notes and/or offset any potential cash payments Five9 is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap based on the cap price. The cap price of the capped call transactions will initially be $122.18 per share, which represents a premium of 100% over the last reported sale price of Five9’s common stock of $61.09 per share on February 27, 2024, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the capped call transactions. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, Five9 expects to enter into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties. Five9 expects that, in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates will purchase shares of Five9’s common stock and/or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Five9’s common stock concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the notes. These activities could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Five9’s common stock or the notes at that time. In addition, Five9 expects that the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to Five9’s common stock and/or by purchasing or selling shares of Five9’s common stock or other securities of Five9 in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so (x) during any observation period relating to a conversion of the notes and (y) following any repurchase of notes by Five9 if Five9 elects to unwind a corresponding portion of the capped call transactions in connection with such repurchase). These activities could cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of Five9’s common stock or the notes, which could affect the ability of noteholders to convert the notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the notes, could affect the number of shares and value of the consideration that noteholders will receive upon conversion of the notes. In connection with the issuance of the 2025 notes, Five9 entered into capped call transactions (the “existing capped call transactions”) with certain financial institutions (the “existing capped call counterparties”). In connection with the 2025 note repurchases, Five9 has entered into agreements with the existing capped call counterparties to terminate a portion of the existing capped call transactions in a notional amount corresponding to the amount of the 2025 note repurchases. In connection with the termination of these transactions, Five9 expects the existing capped call counterparties or their respective affiliates to sell shares of Five9’s common stock and/or unwind various derivatives during an unwind period following the pricing of the notes to unwind their hedge in connection with those transactions, which could decrease, or reduce the size of any increase in, the market price of Five9’s common stock during such unwind period. In connection with the termination of the existing capped call transactions, Five9 will receive payments from the existing capped call counterparties that depend in part on the market price of Five9’s common stock over the unwind period. The notes were and will be offered only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Act. Neither the notes nor the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes, if any, have been, nor will be, registered under the Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements. This announcement is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any of these securities and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation, or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale is unlawful.

Uncertainty surrounding the future of ObsEva's workforce and operations. Financial Analyst The announcement by ObsEva SA regarding the wind-down of its operations and potential delisting from the SIX Swiss Exchange represents a critical event with significant implications for shareholders and creditors. The inability to have financial statements audited under IFRS suggests severe liquidity constraints, which typically indicates a distressed financial position. This could lead to substantial losses for existing shareholders as the equity value may be eroded in the event of liquidation or restructuring. Creditors may also face challenges in recovering loans or outstanding payments due to the moratorium, which protects the company from claims. The market's reaction to such news is often negative, potentially leading to a sharp decline in stock price and increased volatility. It's essential for investors to closely monitor the company's next steps, particularly any developments regarding the monetization of Nolasiban, which could provide some financial relief if successful. Pharmaceutical Industry Analyst The focus on monetizing Nolasiban, a compound designed to improve live birth rates in IVF treatments, is a strategic move for ObsEva. However, the current financial situation overshadows the potential of this asset. The biopharmaceutical industry is capital-intensive, with long development cycles and high regulatory hurdles. ObsEva's financial distress illustrates the risks inherent in the sector, especially for companies that are unable to secure steady funding through milestones. For competitors and potential acquirers, the distress of ObsEva may present an opportunity to acquire valuable assets at a lower cost. However, the success of such an asset's monetization amidst a wind-down process can be complex and uncertain, potentially affecting the asset's value and attractiveness to potential buyers or licensees. Legal Expert The temporary moratorium granted to ObsEva by the Tribunal de première instance of Geneva is a legal measure that provides the company with breathing space to explore restructuring or liquidation options without the immediate pressure from creditors. The appointment of a commissioner to supervise the company's activities ensures that the interests of all parties, including creditors and employees, are considered during this process. From a legal standpoint, the moratorium is a double-edged sword; it offers protection to the company but also signals to the market and stakeholders that the company's financial health is compromised. This legal development will likely influence the strategies of creditors, who may need to reassess their approach to recovery in light of the moratorium and the company's limited cash position. 02/28/2024 - 01:00 AM Ad hoc announcement pursuant to Art. 53 LR of the SIX Swiss Exchange Geneva, Switzerland – 28 February 2024 – ObsEva SA (SIX: OBSN), a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for women's health, today announced that it will wind-down its operations with the termination of all of its employees, including Fabien de Ladonchamps, CEO, and notified SIX Swiss Exchange's listing authority that there was a substantial risk that it will lack the resources to have financial statements for 2023 prepared under IFRS audited, and that it is as a result likely not going to be able to satisfy the requirements for maintaining its listing on SIX. Fabien de Ladonchamps, CEO, will remain in function during the notice period for the duration of the moratorium process and beyond, as needed. On 29 January 2024, the Tribunal de première instance of Geneva granted a temporary moratorium (sursis provisoire) to ObsEva for a period of four months ending 29 May 2024 and appointed a commissioner (commissaire) to supervise the company's activities during the process. The moratorium limits the ability of ObsEva's creditors to enforce their claims against the company while it evaluates the possibility of a restructuring or orderly liquidation. Fabien de Ladonchamps, Chief Executive Officer, said: “While we are pursuing our efforts to monetize Nolasiban, our compound designed to increase live birth rate for women undergoing IVF, ObsEva's cash position remains low, which compromises our ability to keep operating the company with existing workforce and to have financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS audited. Therefore, we decided to inform SIX of the situation. This may lead to a delisting.” About ObsEva ObsEva is a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies to improve women’s reproductive health and pregnancy. ObsEva has established a development program focused on improving in vitro fertilization success rates. ObsEva is listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange where it is traded under the ticker symbol “OBSN”.

The collaboration strengthens Viatris' cardiovascular and immunology offerings.","Viatris and Idorsia Enter Into Significant Global Research and Development Collaboration Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Viatris expands its portfolio by adding two Phase 3 assets, Selatogrel and Cenerimod, through a collaboration with Idorsia. The deal includes potential for future innovative assets. Selatogrel targets acute myocardial infarction patients, while Cenerimod focuses on systemic lupus erythematosus. The collaboration strengthens Viatris' cardiovascular and immunology offerings. Positive None. Negative None. Pharmaceutical Industry Analyst The strategic collaboration between Viatris and Idorsia represents a significant move in the pharmaceutical industry, especially considering the potential of the two Phase 3 assets, selatogrel and cenerimod. Selatogrel, aimed at patients with a history of acute myocardial infarction, could be transformative in the cardiovascular market due to its self-administration aspect, which is relatively novel in this therapeutic area. Cenerimod, as a potential first-in-class oral therapy for systemic lupus erythematosus, taps into the growing demand for innovative treatments in immunology.From an industry perspective, the collaboration leverages Viatris' financial strength and global operational infrastructure, which could facilitate accelerated development and market penetration for these assets. The deal's structure, focusing on disciplined capital allocation, may reassure investors of Viatris' commitment to maintaining financial stability while pursuing growth opportunities.For stakeholders, the short-term implications include the anticipation of R&D advancements and potential market disruptions. Long-term benefits could manifest as strong revenue streams if the drugs achieve 'blockbuster' status, defined as exceeding $1 billion in annual sales. The success of these assets could also enhance Viatris' competitive position in the cardiovascular and immunology markets. Financial Analyst Examining the financial implications, the deal could be accretive to Viatris' earnings if the Phase 3 trials result in successful commercialization. The term 'blockbuster revenue potential' suggests significant confidence in the market viability of these drugs. Investors should monitor the progression of clinical trials and regulatory approvals closely, as these milestones will be critical in determining the financial impact of the collaboration.Furthermore, the optionality to expand the collaboration could provide Viatris with a pipeline of innovative assets, which is crucial for sustained growth in the pharmaceutical sector. This strategic diversification may also serve as a hedge against risks associated with the company's existing product portfolio.However, investors should consider the inherent risks of drug development, including the possibility of clinical trial failures or regulatory setbacks, which could adversely affect projected earnings and stock performance. It is also important to compare Viatris' R&D spending and potential return on investment against industry averages to assess the deal's relative attractiveness. Medical Research Analyst The medical significance of selatogrel and cenerimod cannot be overstated. Selatogrel's self-administered mechanism could lead to improved patient outcomes by providing rapid intervention during cardiac events. This aligns with current trends in patient-centered care and could set a new standard for acute cardiovascular treatments. Cenerimod's potential as a first-in-class oral therapy for SLE addresses a substantial unmet medical need, given the limited treatment options currently available for lupus patients.From a research and development standpoint, the success of these drugs in Phase 3 trials will be pivotal. The 'blockbuster' designation is often reserved for drugs that not only meet clinical efficacy and safety standards but also demonstrate a clear advantage over existing therapies. The ability to broaden the application of cenerimod across multiple autoimmune diseases could also be a game-changer, underscoring the importance of lifecycle management in drug development.It is crucial to evaluate the clinical trial data objectively once available, to understand the true therapeutic potential and safety profile of these drugs. The impact on patient care, healthcare costs and the overall healthcare system will be determined by these factors. 02/28/2024 - 01:00 AM Expands Viatris' Portfolio of Innovative Assets by Immediately Adding Two Phase 3 Assets, Selatogrel and Cenerimod, Both With Blockbuster Revenue PotentialIncludes Future Optionality to Expand Collaboration With Additional Innovative AssetsCombines Viatris' Financial Strength and Worldwide Operational Infrastructure With Idorsia's Proven, Highly Productive Drug Development Team and Innovation EngineDeal Structure Reinforces Viatris' Disciplined Approach to Capital AllocationViatris Announces R&D Event to be Held March 27, 2024PITTSBURGH, Feb. 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Viatris Inc. (NASDAQ: VTRS), a global healthcare company, and Idorsia Ltd (SIX: IDIA) today announced they have entered into agreements for a significant global research and development collaboration under which Viatris will receive exclusive global development and commercialization rights to two Phase 3 assets as well as the potential to add additional innovative assets in the future. The collaboration includes selatogrel, a potential life-saving self-administered medicine for patients with a history of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), or heart attack, and builds on Viatris' existing global cardiovascular franchise and specialty infrastructure, as well as its knowledge, leadership, and distribution capabilities for self-administered medication for acute life-threatening conditions. The collaboration also includes cenerimod, a novel immunology asset that has the potential to be a first-in-class oral therapy for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the most common form of lupus. Through lifecycle management, this asset also has the potential for broad application across multiple autoimmune diseases in a specialist-driven category with attractive market dynamics for oral therapies and could be a cornerstone asset in Viatris' immunology platform. Viatris CEO Scott A. Smith said: ""I am extremely pleased with our global research and development collaboration with Idorsia. We are connecting Idorsia's proven, highly productive drug development team and innovation engine with Viatris' strong global infrastructure and experience to focus on two late-stage potential blockbuster assets with long-dated patent protection. I believe that together we will be able to execute on the potential of these global assets, and any future assets, as we work to deliver on our goal of building a more durable, predictable portfolio on the foundation of our strong base business, and that selatogrel and cenerimod can become meaningful components of Viatris' business over the long term. Smith continued: ""As I have said previously, in addition to continuing to develop the three core therapeutic areas that we identified—ophthalmology, dermatology and GI—we are also going to be opportunistic in seeking out assets that we believe fit our company well and have the potential to contribute significantly to our future revenue growth. Entering into this type of global research and development partnership structure with Idorsia is a great example of our disciplined approach to capital allocation."" Viatris Chief R&D Officer Philippe Martin said: ""I am excited to have the opportunity to work with Idorsia's talented drug development team who are essential to the execution of these clinical programs. Both selatogrel and cenerimod have the potential to be important medicines by providing significant advances for patients suffering with life-altering disease. Selatogrel has the potential to become the first self-administered treatment for recurring AMI that fills the medical gap during the pre-hospital phase of a life-threatening condition. Cenerimod has the potential to fill the need for a more tolerable and effective treatment for SLE, in combination with standard therapy, earlier in disease progression."" Idorsia CEO Jean-Paul Clozel, MD, said: ""I'm delighted that with Viatris we have found a strong partner to secure and accelerate the development programs for both selatogrel and cenerimod by leveraging the strength of Viatris' global infrastructure. From the first meeting, it was clear that the team at Viatris shares the same excitement and engagement for our innovations. This global collaboration allows us to share the costs of the ongoing Phase 3 programs whilst retaining long-term shareholder value, by sharing the rewards for success through the milestones and royalties."" Terms of the TransactionUnder the terms of the agreements, the development programs and certain personnel for selatogrel and cenerimod will be transferred to Viatris in exchange for an upfront payment to Idorsia of $350 million, potential development and regulatory milestone payments, and certain contingent payments of additional sales milestone payments and tiered royalties in the mid-single to low-double digit percentages on annual net sales. Viatris and Idorsia will both contribute to the development costs for both programs. Viatris will have worldwide commercialization rights for both selatogrel and cenerimod (excluding, for cenerimod only, Japan, South Korea and certain countries in the Asia-Pacific region) and intends to utilize its Global Healthcare Gateway® infrastructure to bring access to patients worldwide. A joint development committee will oversee the development of the ongoing Phase 3 programs through regulatory approval. The agreements also provide Viatris a right of first refusal and a right of first negotiation for certain other assets in Idorsia's pipeline. The closing of the transaction is subject to certain limited closing conditions, but no additional regulatory or shareholder approvals are required. The transaction is expected to close at the end of March. Citi is acting as financial advisor to Viatris. R&D EventViatris will hold an R&D Event on March 27, 2024, from 10 a.m. to noon ET, in New York City. The event will include presentations from Viatris executives discussing the global research and development collaboration with Idorsia and other elements of the Company's pipeline, as well as presentations from two expert thought leaders. The presenters will be available to answer questions at the end of the presentations. Expert thought leaders presenting at the event are: Dr. Deepak L. Bhatt, MD, MPH, a top expert in cardiovascular medicine and interventional cardiology, Director of Mount Sinai Heart.

Dr. Askanase is an internationally renowned clinician, diagnostician and researcher with more than 15 years specializing in complex SLE. Dr. Askanase trained as a rheumatologist at New York University where she remained for more than 15 years on faculty, directing clinical trials, training fellows and residents, and treating challenging cases of SLE at NYU's prestigious hospitals.Interested parties will be able to access a live webcast of the event at investor.viatris.com. An archived version will be available following the live event and can be accessed at the same location for a limited time. About selatogrelSelatogrel is a potent, fast-acting, reversible, and highly selective P2Y12 inhibitor, being developed for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), in patients with a history of AMI. It is intended to be self-administered subcutaneously via a drug delivery system (autoinjector). This novel, self-administered emergency agent has the potential to protect heart muscle in the very early phase of an AMI – in the crucial time between symptom onset and first medical attention – so as to treat the ongoing AMI and prevent early death. Idorsia is enrolling patients into a large international, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study – Selatogrel Outcome Study in suspected Acute Myocardial Infarction (SOS-AMI) – to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of selatogrel 16 mg when self-administered (on top of standard of care) upon the occurrence of symptoms suggestive of AMI. The primary efficacy endpoint is the occurrence of death from any cause, or non-fatal AMI, after self-administration of the study treatment. A Special Protocol Assessment has been agreed with the FDA, indicating its concurrence with the adequacy and acceptability of critical elements of overall protocol design for a study intended to support a future marketing application. In addition, the FDA designated the investigation of selatogrel for the treatment of suspected AMI as a ""fast-track"" development program. This designation is intended to promote communication and collaboration between the FDA and pharmaceutical companies for drugs that treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. About cenerimodCenerimod, the result of 20 years of research in Idorsia's labs, is a highly selective S1P1 receptor modulator, given as an oral once-daily tablet. Cenerimod potentially offers a novel approach for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a disease with a significant impact on patients and limited treatment options. In December 2022, Idorsia initiated the OPUS program (Oral S1P1 Receptor ModUlation in SLE), which consists of two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group Phase 3 studies to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of cenerimod in adult patients with moderate to severe SLE on top of background therapy. The main objectives of the program are to evaluate the effectiveness of cenerimod 4 mg in reducing disease activity, as well as controlling the disease, compared to placebo. The primary endpoint is response on SRI-4 at month 12 compared to baseline. Secondary endpoints include response on BICLA at month 12 compared to baseline and – for the first time in a lupus registration study – measures of sustained disease control: time to first confirmed 4-month sustained mSLEDAI-2K response and time to first confirmed 4-month sustained response in mucocutaneous manifestations (i.e. rash, alopecia, mucosal ulcers). The investigation of cenerimod for the treatment of SLE has been designated as a ""fast-track"" development program by the FDA. This designation is intended to promote communication and collaboration between the FDA and pharmaceutical companies for drugs that treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need.

CoolCo has a backlog of $1.4 billion in contracted revenue, indicating a positive outlook for near-term earnings growth. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial performance of Cool Company Ltd. (""CoolCo"") in Q4 2023 shows an increase in operating revenues to $97.1 million from $92.9 million in Q3 2023, indicating a positive trend in revenue generation. However, there is a notable decrease in net income, from $39.21 million in Q3 to $22.41 million in Q4, which the company attributes to unrealized mark-to-market losses on interest rate swaps. This volatility in net income highlights the impact of financial instruments and market conditions on the company's profitability. Investors should consider the potential for similar fluctuations in the future, as interest rate swap valuations can significantly affect reported earnings.The company's Time Charter Equivalent (TCE) Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA both increased in Q4, suggesting improved operational efficiency and earnings quality. TCE, a standard shipping industry performance measure that equates net voyage revenue to the number of operating days, reached the company's highest quarterly level, which may signal strong operational management and favorable market conditions. The Adjusted EBITDA, which removes non-cash and non-operating items, provides a clearer view of the company's underlying profitability and cash generation capabilities. These figures are critical for investors as they assess the company's ability to service debt, fund operations and pay dividends. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the LNG carrier sector faced a normalization in rates post the heightened demand following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Despite this, CoolCo's strategic positioning with medium and long-term charters at higher rates has allowed it to maintain a competitive edge. The company's anticipation of a market upswing in the second half of 2024, based on expected longer voyage distances and increased LNG volumes heading east, suggests a strategic approach to fleet deployment and chartering activities. The mention of environmental regulations and the competitive disadvantage of older vessels implies a market shift favoring newer, more efficient ships. This could impact the supply-demand dynamics and pricing power within the industry.Additionally, the company's backlog of $1.4 billion in contracted revenue provides visibility into future earnings, which is a positive signal for investors. However, the orderbook-to-fleet ratio and the potential impact of new liquefaction projects on the demand for LNG carriers should be monitored closely. The timing of vessel deliveries and project startups may create temporary imbalances in the market, influencing charter rates and vessel utilization. Legal and Regulatory Expert Regulatory changes, particularly the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) carbon intensity indicator (CII) rules and carbon pricing for voyages into Europe, are likely to have a significant impact on the LNG carrier industry. CoolCo's focus on state-of-the-art vessels positions it favorably in an environment where emissions regulations are becoming increasingly stringent. The company's ability to secure long-term charters for its modern fleet could provide a competitive advantage and pricing power in the face of these regulations.For investors, understanding the implications of such regulations is crucial, as they can affect both the operational costs and the demand for different types of vessels. Companies with newer fleets that meet or exceed environmental standards are likely to experience increased demand, while those with older, less efficient vessels may face challenges. The strategic importance of CoolCo's investment in fleet modernization and environmental performance enhancements should be considered when evaluating its long-term prospects in a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape. 02/28/2024 - 01:00 AM HAMILTON, Bermuda--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- This release includes business and financial updates for the three (""Q4"", ""Q4 2023"" or the ""Quarter"") and twelve months (""FY 2023"") ended December 31, 2023 of Cool Company Ltd. (""CoolCo"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE:CLCO / CLCO.OL). Q4 Highlights and Subsequent Events Generated total operating revenues of $97.1 million in Q4, compared to $92.9 million for the third quarter of 2023 (""Q3"" or ""Q3 2023""); Net income of $22.41 million in Q4, compared to $39.21 million for Q3, with the decrease primarily related to unrealized mark-to-market losses on our interest rate swaps; Achieved average Time Charter Equivalent Earnings (""TCE"")2 of $87,300 per day for Q4, compared to $82,400 per day for Q3; Generated Adjusted EBITDA2 of $69.4 million for Q4, compared to $62.8 million for Q3; During the Quarter, the Company announced that it had entered into sale and leaseback financing arrangements (the “Sale and Leasebacks”) with Huaxia Financial Leasing Co. Ltd for the two state-of-the-art MEGA LNG carriers under order at Hyundai-Samho (the ""Newbuilds""); Subsequent to the Quarter, the Company received commitments from certain banks to upsize (on a delayed draw-down basis) the existing $520 million term loan facility maturing in May 2029 in anticipation of the maturity of the two sale & leaseback facilities during the first quarter of 2025; Announced a twelve-month charter, which is scheduled to commence during the first quarter of 2024. Declared a dividend for Q4 of $0.41 per share, to be paid to shareholders of record on March 11, 2024. Richard Tyrrell, CEO, commented: “In the fourth quarter, we benefited from strong operational performance, a seasonal uplift on our variable rate contract, and the continuing impact of our fleet’s fixed-rate charter coverage. Additionally, we took measured exposure to the charter market in the form of one vessel that we chose to deploy directly in the spot market while waiting for the right term opportunity. The net result was a sequentially higher TCE level at $87,300 per day, CoolCo's highest ever quarterly TCE. This winter saw rates return to more normalized levels after an extraordinary period following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Despite the normalization of the overall market, CoolCo benefited from having a number of medium and long-term charters at previously contracted higher levels and continued to show its ability to secure high value business with the announcement of a 12-month charter for its spot market vessel, to commence during the first quarter of 2024. Our next available vessels are well spaced and do not come open before the second half of 2024, when the market is anticipated to be in a seasonal upswing powered by expected longer voyage distances as greater volumes of LNG head east this year. Due to the relatively warm northern hemisphere winter, gas prices have fallen and reduced the option value to charterers of maintaining excess LNG carrier capacity to facilitate opportunistic trades. This, combined with some delays to certain liquefaction projects, has resulted in sublets weighing on time charter rates. Nonetheless, CoolCo’s Newbuilds continue to attract interest and remain the only such vessels in the market available from independent owners in 2024, and thus the only such vessels likely to be available for term contracts. With the imposition of increasingly tight emissions regulations in the coming years, the relative advantage of these state-of-the-art vessels only increases over time. Conversely, older steam turbine vessels, which presently make up 31% of the global fleet (by number of vessels) face growing pressure from those same regulations and their utilization is falling to the point that, heavy scrapping in the coming years is anticipated. CoolCo has a backlog of $1.4 billion of contracted revenue at the end of the Quarter and continues to expect near-term earnings growth from its fully financed Newbuilds, when delivered, to offset current market weakness should it persist."" Financial Highlights The table below sets forth certain key financial information for Q4 2023, Q3 2023, Q4 2022, FY 2023 and December 31, 2022 (""FY 2022""), split between Successor and Predecessor periods, as defined below. Twelve Months ended December 31, Q4 2023 Q3 2023 Q4 2022 2023 2022 (in thousands of $, except TCE) Successor Successor Successor Successor Successor Predecessor Total Time and voyage charter revenues 89,319 84,523 79,032 347,081 183,567 37,289 220,856 Total operating revenues 97,144 92,901 90,255 379,010 212,978 43,456 256,434 Operating income 55,051 48,336 48,881 200,893 110,936 27,728 138,664 Net income 1 22,415 39,170 33,069 176,363 87,500 23,244 110,744 Adjusted EBITDA2 69,432 62,754 58,621 259,894 134,585 33,473 168,058 Average daily TCE2 (to the closest $100) 87,300 82,400 83,600 83,600 73,000 57,100 69,800 Note: As disclosed previously, the commencement of operations and funding of CoolCo and the acquisition of its initial tri-fuel diesel electric (""TFDE"") LNG carriers, The Cool Pool Limited and the shipping and FSRU management organization from Golar LNG Limited (""Golar"") were completed in a phased process. It commenced with the funding of CoolCo on January 27, 2022 and concluded with the acquisition of the LNG carrier and FSRU management organization on June 30, 2022, with vessel acquisitions taking place on different dates over that period. Results for the twelve months that commenced January 1, 2022 and ended December 31, 2022 have therefore been split between the period prior to the funding of CoolCo and various phased acquisitions of vessel and management entities (the ""Predecessor"" period) and the period subsequent to the various phased acquisitions (the ""Successor"" period). The combined results are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and consist of the aggregate of selected financial data of the Successor and Predecessor periods. No other adjustments have been made to the combined presentation. We cannot adequately benchmark the operating results for the year ended December 31, 2023 against the previous year reported in our comparative unaudited financial information without combining the applicable Successor and Predecessor periods and do not believe that reviewing the results of the periods in isolation would be useful in identifying trends in or reaching conclusions regarding our overall operating performance. LNG Market Review The average Japan/Korea Marker gas price (""JKM"") for the Quarter was $13.35/MMBtu compared to $11.81/MMBtu for Q3 2023; with average JKM for Q1 2024 at $13.84/MMBtu as of February 23, 2024. The Quarter commenced with Dutch Title Transfer Facility gas price (""TTF"") at $12.54/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $188,750 per day. The Quarter concluded with TTF at $10.31/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $78,750 per day. The TFDE headline spot rate has subsequently fallen to as low as $40,000 per day, but with a very low volume of transactions taking place at those levels. Because trading opportunities that rely on LNG carriers for floating storage were limited and periods of West-East arbitrage did not materialize, the pre-winter seasonal spike that began in late September quickly normalized, as has been seen in prior years when similar trading conditions prevailed. LNG was generally traded within its basin of origin, which reduced the number of long-distance inter-basin voyages. While those inter-basin voyages that did take place during the Quarter were extended by limitations on Panama Canal traffic and the more recent threat of attacks in the Red Sea causing vessels to route around the Cape of Good Hope, the limited number of such voyages during the winter 2023/24 has meant that their effect on prevailing rates has not been material. The high level of LNG prices in the first half of the year and expectation that these would persist resulted in coal being stockpiled for the current winter. Today’s lower actual prices and the environmental benefits of transitioning from coal-to-gas are likely to make LNG an increasingly attractive alternative going forward, particularly in markets such as China, India, and South-East Asia which have typically been more price-sensitive and involve relatively greater shipping distances. Operational Review CoolCo's fleet continued to perform well with a Q4 fleet utilization of 97% (Q3: 97%) with the remaining 3% covered by a ballast bonus, compared to 100% for the first half of 2023. While there were no drydocks in 2023, four drydocks are expected during 2024, starting with one in the second quarter and the remaining three during the third quarter. The budgeted cost of these dry-docks is approximately $6.5 million each plus up to 30 days off-hire. One of the drydocks in the third quarter will involve the upgrade of a vessel to LNGe specification through the addition of a subcooler with high liquefaction capacity and other performance enhancements at a budgeted cost of an additional $15.0 million and an additional 20 days off-hire. Subsequent to the Quarter, a ship management services customer has decided to transfer an additional two vessels for which CoolCo currently provides technical management to managers that solely provide ship management services. This is not expected to materially impact CoolCo's earnings and we expect to incur some immaterial restructuring costs to adjust our operations in light of this change. Business Development Subsequent to the end of the Quarter, the Company announced that it has entered into a new time charter agreement for one of its TFDE vessels. The 12-month time charter is with Santos Singapore Shipping Pte. Ltd. and is scheduled to commence in the first quarter of 2024. The vessel is scheduled to be upgraded to LNGe specification in the third quarter of 2024 and the charter includes an innovative commercial mechanism to reward both the charterer and CoolCo for realizing performance and environmental gains as a result of the upgrades. CoolCo continues to be in discussions with multiple potential charterers seeking employment for the two Newbuilds it has on order for delivery towards the end of second half of 2024. While headline LNG carrier rates and recent negative sentiment in the sector have served as a headwind to securing long-term employment at attractive rates, several charterers are known to have specific and as-yet-unmet transportation requirements and are expected to come to market in advance of the 2024 winter season and delivery of the Newbuilds. Financing and Liquidity In October 2023, the Company announced that it had entered into Sale and Leasebacks for the Newbuilds with Huaxia Financial Leasing Co. Ltd. The Sale and Leasebacks are on a fixed rate per day basis for 10 years, with extension options, an implied fixed interest rate just under 6% and a minimum loan-to-value of 80%, with potential for additional capacity contingent upon the terms of the charter employment that the Company anticipates securing in advance of the Newbuilds' deliveries. The Sale and Leaseback financing also offers pre-delivery financing of the Newbuilds. Subsequent to the Quarter, the Company received commitments from certain banks to upsize the existing $520 million term loan facility maturing in May 2029 in anticipation of the need to refinance the maturity of the two existing sale & leaseback facilities during the first quarter of 2025. The upsize will be on a delayed drawdown basis (at our option) to benefit from the current low interest rate in these existing facilities. As of December 31, 2023, CoolCo had cash and cash equivalents of $133.5 million and total short and long-term debt, net of deferred finance charges, amounted to $1,061.1 million. Total Contractual Debt2 stood at $1,163.9 million, which comprised of $485.3 million in respect of the $570 million bank facility maturing in March 2027, $461.9 million in respect of the $520 million term loan facility, maturing in May 2029, and $216.7 million of sale and leaseback facilities which comprised of $176.7 million in respect of the two maturing in the first quarter of 2025 (Kool Ice and Kool Kelvin) and $40 million in respect of the Newbuilds financing (Kool Tiger & Kool Panther). Overall, the Company’s interest rate on its debt is fixed or hedged for approximately 85% of the notional amount of debt, adjusting for existing cash on hand. Corporate and Other Matters As of December 31, 2023, CoolCo had 53,702,846 shares issued and outstanding. Of these, 31,254,390 shares (58.2%) were owned by EPS Ventures Ltd (""EPS"") and 22,448,456 (41.8%) were publicly owned. In line with the Company’s variable dividend policy, the Board has declared a Q4 dividend of $0.41 per common share. The record date is March 11, 2024 and the dividend will be distributed to DTC-registered shareholders on or around March 18, 2024, while due to the implementation of the Central Securities Depositories Regulation in Norway, the dividend will be distributed to Euronext VPS-registered shareholders on or around March 21, 2024. Outlook In the coming years, the global supply of LNG is set to increase by more than 50% based on projects that have already reached Final Investment Decision (""FID""). At least 40 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of capacity have reached FID stage in 2023 alone, equivalent to approximately 10% of total LNG production in 2022. To understand the current 51% orderbook-to-fleet ratio (by volume), it is critical to recognize that the orderbook has overwhelmingly been built based on long-term contracts to service new liquefaction facilities. The timing and quantity of these vessels deliveries are intended to match the commencement of new production. Furthermore, to the extent that project development delays result in vessels delivering to their charterers before their intended startup time, we would expect to see a dynamic similar to that which has recently prevailed. In such a scenario, the market is sharply divided between charterers seeking to fill interim periods in the spot market and owners such as CoolCo, who are in a position to offer multi-year time charters. Numerous liquefaction projects are still under development in North America, the Middle East, and various other geographies. This supply is expected to meet gas demand arising from the continued strong and widespread desire to decarbonize both through complementing renewables with gas, and gas substituting for the vast amounts of coal still being consumed. Among LNG carriers currently on the water, the older, less efficient vessels in the charter market are expected to face growing competitive pressure over time, particularly among the steam turbine vessels that continue to make up over 30% of the global fleet by volume. The imposition of the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) carbon intensity indicator (CII) rules from the beginning of last year, as well as this year's implementation of carbon pricing on voyages into Europe, are projected to increase the relative advantage of modern, efficient TFDE and 2-stroke tonnage, such as those in the CoolCo fleet. The limited supply of modern vessels available for time charter employment through the medium-term is concentrated among a small number of owners, including CoolCo. Given the improved bargaining position afforded by a combination of scarcity and concentration, such owners have remained focused primarily on longer-term charters that would bridge the period from now until the next wave of LNG supply is expected to arrive in 2026-2027. A newbuild vessel ordered today would have a lead time of approximately four years, a purchase price exceeding $260 million and relatively expensive financing, limiting the likelihood of unforeseen newbuild tonnage during that period while providing support for the rate benchmark against which the overall fleet is priced. 1 Net income includes mark-to market loss on interest rate swaps amounting to $13.1 million for Q4 2023, compared to gains of $9.7 million for Q3 2023 and $7.3 million for year ended December 31, 2023. 2 Refer to 'Appendix A' - Non-GAAP financial measures and definitions, for definitions of these measures and a reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure.

On January 26, 2022, CoolCo entered into various agreements (the ""Vessel SPA"") with Golar, as amended on February 25, 2022, pursuant to which CoolCo acquired all of the outstanding shares of nine of Golar’s wholly-owned subsidiaries on various dates in March and April 2022. Eight of these entities were each the registered or disponent owner or lessee of the following modern LNG carriers: Crystal, Ice, Bear, Frost, Glacier, Snow, Kelvin and Seal (disposed subsequently). The Cool Pool Limited was the entity responsible for the marketing of these LNG carriers. For CoolCo, for the three and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2022, the successor period reflects the period beginning from January 27, 2022 with the closing of CoolCo’s Norwegian equity raise and the date CoolCo operations substantially commenced and were considered meaningful. Vessel SPA acquisition dates were staggered reflecting results, as the successor, from the date CoolCo obtained control of the respective vessel entities. (2) Predecessor period includes results derived from the carve-out of historical operations from Golar entities acquired by CoolCo as part of the Vessel SPA and ManCo SPA until the day before the staggered acquisition date per legal entity during the period beginning from January 1, 2022 to June 30, 2022.

APPENDIX A - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND DEFINITIONS Non-GAAP Financial Metrics Arising from How Management Monitors the Business In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP), this earnings release and the associated investor presentation and discussion contain references to the non-GAAP financial measures which are included in the table below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP. Non-GAAP measures are not uniformly defined by all companies, and may not be comparable with similar titles, measures and disclosures used by other companies. The reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated. Non-GAAP measure Closest equivalent US GAAP measure Adjustments to reconcile to primary financial statements prepared under US GAAP Rationale for adjustments Performance Measures Adjusted EBITDA Net income '+/- Other non-operating income +/- Net financial expense, representing: Interest income, Interest expense, Gains/(Losses) on derivative instruments and Other financial items, net +/- Income taxes, net + Depreciation and amortization - Amortization of intangible assets and liabilities – charter agreements, net Increases the comparability of total business performance from period to period and against the performance of other companies by removing the impact of other non-operating income, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and liabilities -charter agreements, net, financing and tax items. Average daily TCE Time and voyage charter revenues - Voyage, charter hire and commission expenses, net The above total is then divided by calendar days less scheduled off-hire days. - Measure of the average daily net revenue performance of a vessel. - Standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period-to-period changes in the vessel’s net revenue performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (i.e. spot charters, time charters and bareboat charters) under which the vessel may be employed between the periods. - Assists management in making decisions regarding the deployment and utilization of its fleet and in evaluating financial performance. Liquidity measures Total Contractual Debt Total debt (current and non-current), net of deferred finance charges + VIE Consolidation and fair value adjustments upon acquisition + Deferred Finance Charges We consolidate two lessor VIEs for our sale and leaseback facilities (for the vessels Ice and Kelvin). This means that on consolidation, our contractual debt is eliminated and replaced with the Lessor VIEs’ debt. Contractual debt represents our actual debt obligations under our various financing arrangements before consolidating the Lessor VIEs. The measure enables investors and users of our financial statements to assess our liquidity and the split of our debt (current and non-current) based on our underlying contractual obligations. Total Company Cash CoolCo cash based on GAAP measures: + Cash and cash equivalents + Restricted cash and short-term deposits (current and non-current) - VIE restricted cash and short-term deposits (current and non-current) We consolidate lessor VIEs for our sale and leaseback facilities. This means that on consolidation, we include restricted cash held by the lessor VIEs. Total Company Cash represents our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and short-term deposits (current and non-current) before consolidating the lessor VIEs. Management believes that this measure enables investors and users of our financial statements to assess our liquidity and aids comparability with our competitors.

The net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes and investments in energy projects. Negative None. Financial Analyst NextEra Energy Capital Holdings' announcement of a $1.0 billion junior subordinated debenture offering is a significant move in the capital markets. The structure of these debentures, with a two-phase interest rate, reflects a strategic approach to managing the company's long-term financing costs. Initially, the interest rate is fixed at 6.70%, which is relatively attractive in the current interest rate environment, potentially indicating strong investor demand or a conservative approach by the company to lock in rates before any further market volatility.The provision for a rate reset tied to the Five-Year Treasury Rate plus a spread after five years introduces a variable component, which could impact the company's interest expenses based on future economic conditions. Investors should closely monitor treasury rate projections and the company's credit rating, as these will directly affect the cost of capital for NextEra Energy. The 50% equity credit expected from credit rating agencies is particularly noteworthy, as it could positively influence the company's leverage metrics and possibly its credit rating.From a liquidity perspective, the use of proceeds to repay commercial paper obligations suggests prudent financial management, as it may reduce short-term liabilities and interest expenses. However, investors should consider the subordination of these debentures to senior debt, which implies a higher risk in the event of financial distress. Energy Market Analyst The decision by NextEra Energy to fund investments in energy and power projects aligns with the company's position as a leader in the renewable energy sector. The capital raised could be instrumental in financing new projects or expanding existing ones, particularly in wind, solar and battery storage, where NextEra Energy Resources is already a global leader.

Positive Progress Software Corporation announces a private offering of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2030 to qualified institutional buyers. The offering includes an option for the initial purchasers to buy up to an additional $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes. The offering size was increased from $350.0 million to $400.0 million (or $402.5 million if the initial purchasers exercise their option in full). The Notes will mature on March 1, 2030, and bear interest at a rate of 3.50% per year, payable semi-annually. Noteholders will have the right to convert their Notes before November 1, 2029, under certain conditions. Progress estimates net proceeds of approximately $389.3 million from the offering. The company intends to use the proceeds for various purposes, including debt repayment, share repurchases, and general corporate needs. Progress entered into capped call transactions to reduce potential dilution to its common stock upon conversion of the Notes. Negative None. Financial Analyst Progress Software Corporation's issuance of $400 million in Convertible Senior Notes reflects a strategic capital raising effort. The interest rate of 3.50% is moderately attractive, given the current interest rate environment, suggesting a solid demand for the company's debt. The option for additional purchases of $50 million to cover overallotments indicates a potential over-subscription, which is a positive sign of investor confidence.From an investment perspective, the conversion premium of 27.50% is notable. It aligns with typical premiums for similar convertible debt offerings, balancing investor upside in equity conversion with protection against equity value dilution. The capped call transactions are a defensive maneuver to manage dilution and stabilize the stock price, which could reassure shareholders concerned about equity value erosion upon conversion.The use of proceeds to repay existing debt and buy back shares suggests a proactive capital management strategy. It should be noted that the share repurchase could be accretive to earnings per share, potentially boosting investor sentiment. However, investors should also consider the impact of hedging activities by the option counterparties, which could affect the stock's market price and the conversion value of the notes. Market Research Analyst Progress Software's decision to increase the principal amount from the previously announced $350 million to $400 million indicates robust market demand for its debt instruments. The timing of this offering and the decision to repay the term loan credit facility suggest a strategic shift towards more flexible financing, which could improve the company's debt profile and interest expense outlook.The repurchase of common stock in conjunction with the offering is a strategic move that could signal to the market a self-assessment of undervaluation. However, the timing and execution of these repurchases, as well as the subsequent hedging activities by the option counterparties, could introduce volatility to the stock price, which stakeholders should monitor closely.Investors and analysts should also scrutinize the capped call transactions. While they are designed to minimize dilution, the cap price set at a 75% premium to the current stock price is aggressive and may reflect management's confidence in the company's growth prospects. The effectiveness of these capped call transactions in offsetting dilution and maintaining stock price stability will be an important factor for long-term investors to consider. Legal Expert The offering's compliance with Rule 144A is a critical legal aspect as it allows Progress Software to raise capital from qualified institutional buyers without the need for a public registration, streamlining the process. However, it limits the liquidity of the notes, as they cannot be readily sold to the general public.The conversion features and potential adjustments to the conversion rate and price require careful legal structuring to ensure they meet regulatory standards and protect both the issuer and the note holders. The terms around 'fundamental change' repurchase rights and the specific conditions under which the notes can be redeemed or converted are significant. These terms must be clearly defined to avoid legal disputes and ensure that investors understand the circumstances that could affect their investment.Finally, the legal ramifications of the capped call transactions and the potential unwinding of hedge positions by the option counterparties should be closely examined. These actions have direct implications for the market perception of the offering and the company's financial stability and they must be conducted in compliance with securities regulations to avoid legal repercussions. 02/27/2024 - 10:28 PM BURLINGTON, Mass., Feb. 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Progress Software Corporation (NASDAQ: PRGS) (“Progress”) today announced the pricing of its private offering of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2030 (the “Notes”) to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Progress also granted the initial purchasers of the Notes an option to purchase up to an additional $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes, for settlement within a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the first date on which the Notes are issued, solely to cover overallotments. The aggregate principal amount of the offering was increased from the previously announced offering size of $350.0 million (or $402.5 million if the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes in full). The offering of the Notes is expected to close on March 1, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. The Notes will be Progress’ senior unsecured obligations and will mature on March 1, 2030, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. The Notes will bear interest at a rate of 3.50% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1, of each year, beginning on September 1, 2024. Before November 1, 2029, Noteholders will have the right to convert their Notes only upon the occurrence of certain events. From and after November 1, 2029, Noteholders may convert their Notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. Progress will satisfy its conversion obligations by paying cash up to the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at its election, in respect of the remainder. The initial conversion rate is 14.7622 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $67.74 per share of common stock. The initial conversion price represents a premium of approximately 27.50% over the last reported sale price of $53.13 per share of Progress’ common stock on February 27, 2024. The conversion rate and conversion price will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, upon certain corporate events or upon a notice of redemption (as described below), Progress will, under certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for Noteholders who convert Notes in connection with such a corporate event or notice of redemption. The Notes will not be redeemable before March 5, 2027. The Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, for cash at Progress’ option at any time, and from time to time, on or after March 5, 2027 and on or before the 60th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of Progress’ common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for a specified period of time. The redemption price will be equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. If a “fundamental change” (as will be defined in the indenture for the Notes) occurs, then, subject to a limited exception, Noteholders may require Progress to repurchase their Notes for cash. The repurchase price will be equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the applicable repurchase date. Progress estimates that the net proceeds from the offering will be approximately $389.3 million (or $438.1 million if the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes in full) after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by it. Progress intends to use the net proceeds from the offering (i) to repay amounts outstanding under its term loan credit facility, (ii) to fund the approximate $37.5 million cost of entering into the capped call transactions described below, (iii) to repurchase approximately 470,544 shares of its common stock, using approximately $25.0 million of the net proceeds from the offering, pursuant to its existing share repurchase program concurrently with the pricing of the offering in privately negotiated transactions effected through one or more of the initial purchasers or their affiliates, at a price per share equal to $53.13, the last reported sale price per share of Progress’ common stock on February 27, 2024 and (iv) for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of other indebtedness. In connection with the pricing of the Notes, Progress entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates and/or other financial institutions (the “option counterparties”). The capped call transactions will cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the Notes, the number of shares of common stock initially underlying the Notes. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional Notes, then Progress expects to enter into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to Progress’ common stock upon any conversion of the Notes and/or offset any potential cash payments Progress is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. The cap price of the capped call transactions will initially be approximately $92.98, which represents a premium of approximately 75.00% over the last reported sale price of Progress’ common stock of $53.13 per share on February 27, 2024, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the capped call transactions. In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates expect to purchase shares of Progress’ common stock and/or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Progress’ common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Progress’ common stock or the Notes at that time. In addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to Progress’ common stock and/or purchasing or selling Progress’ common stock or other securities issued by Progress in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the Notes and prior to the maturity of the Notes (and (x) are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of the Notes, following any redemption of the Notes by Progress or following any repurchase of the Notes by Progress in connection with any fundamental change and (y) are likely to do so following any repurchase of the Notes by Progress other than in connection with any such redemption or any such fundamental change if Progress elects to unwind a corresponding portion of the capped call transactions in connection with such repurchase). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of Progress’ common stock or the Notes, which could affect a Noteholder’s ability to convert the Notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the Notes, it could affect the number of shares of Progress’ common stock and value of the consideration that a Noteholder will receive upon conversion of the Notes. In addition, if any such capped call transaction fails to become effective, whether or not the offering of the Notes is completed, the option counterparty party thereto may unwind its hedge positions with respect to Progress’ common stock, which could adversely affect the value of Progress’ common stock and, if the Notes have been issued, the value of the Notes. The concurrent repurchases of shares of Progress’ common stock described above may have resulted in the common stock trading at prices that are higher than would be the case in the absence of these repurchases, which may have resulted in a higher initial conversion price for the Notes Progress is offering. The Notes will be offered and sold only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The Notes and any shares of Progress’ common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act, or any state securities law, and the Notes and any such shares may not be offered or sold in the United States or to any U.S. persons absent registration under, or pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the Notes or any shares of Progress’ common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, nor shall there be any offer, solicitation or sale of any Notes or any such shares of Progress’ common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

The notable average dayrate improvement due to new contract awards indicates an uptick in the company's pricing power and could signal a recovery in the offshore drilling sector, which has been under pressure due to fluctuating oil prices and competition from onshore production methods.However, the reported net loss raises concerns about the company's ability to translate top-line growth into bottom-line profitability. This discrepancy could be attributed to increased expenses, such as higher charter rental costs and annual bonus expenses. Investors should scrutinize the sustainability of the company's cost structure and the potential for margin improvement as the new contracts commence. Market Research Analyst The offshore drilling industry is highly sensitive to changes in oil prices, which influence clients' spending on exploration and production. Diamond Offshore's contract awards and backlog addition reflect a potentially stabilizing market environment. The company's focus on securing contracts with improved dayrates may indicate a strategic response to industry demands for more cost-effective drilling solutions.The rig performance bonus earned in Senegal and the successful completion of Special Periodical Surveys underscore the company's operational excellence and commitment to safety. These factors can enhance the company's reputation and competitive positioning, potentially attracting more business in a sector where operational reliability is paramount. Tax Expert The reported non-cash tax expense and the reversal of a tax benefit are indicative of the complex tax environment in which Diamond Offshore operates. The normalization of the company's tax expense could reflect adjustments to deferred taxes or changes in valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. Stakeholders should consider the impact of such tax expenses on the company's cash flows and ongoing fiscal obligations, as well as the potential volatility in reported earnings due to such non-cash items. 02/27/2024 - 10:12 PM $362 Million in Contract Awards Year to Date 2024$245 Million in Total Backlog Added in Q4Rig Performance Bonus Earned in SenegalOcean BlackHawk and Ocean Courage Commenced New Contracts in Q4HOUSTON, Feb. 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (NYSE: DO) today reported the following results for the fourth quarter of 2023: Three Months Ended Thousands of dollars, except per share data December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 Total revenues $ 297,637 $ 244,958 Operating income 44,915 863 Adjusted EBITDA 72,340 27,693 Net loss (145,702) (145,016) Adjusted net loss (145,702) (138,792) Loss per diluted share $ (1.42) $ (1.42) Adjusted loss per diluted share $ (1.42) $ (1.36) Bernie Wolford, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, ""2023 was a transformational year for Diamond Offshore. We marked our one-year anniversary of re-listing on the New York Stock Exchange, made measurable improvements in our capital structure, secured $485 million dollars in new contract awards throughout the year, safely completed Special Periodical Surveys on five rigs, and completed eight contract start-ups, including four contract commencements in the fourth quarter, one in each of the regions in which we operate. In the first quarter of 2024, as previously announced, we secured a two-year contract extension for the Ocean BlackLion in the Gulf of Mexico at a leading edge dayrate and secured additional P&A work for the Ocean Patriot to fill a portion of the gap prior to commencement of a long-term P&A campaign in 2025. The recent $362 million in contract awards are in addition to our reported backlog of $1.4 billion as of January 1, which will result in notable average dayrate improvement as we transition to new contracts."" Revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $298 million compared to $245 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in revenue quarter-over-quarter was primarily driven by the Ocean BlackHawk's contract commencement in the Gulf of Mexico in the fourth quarter after completion of an MPD installation, Special Periodical Survey and contract preparation work and new contract commencements for the Ocean Patriot and Ocean Apex, partially offset by lower revenue for the Ocean Courage due to contract preparation activities related to its new multi-year contract in Brazil. Contract drilling expense for the fourth quarter was $189 million, or a $7 million increase from the prior quarter, largely due to higher charter rental costs associated with the managed rigs and the annual bonus expense related to the drillships' BOP service agreement. The increase in expense was partially offset by the deferral of certain costs associated with contract preparation activities for the Ocean Courage, as the Company continued to prepare the rig for a new contract that commenced during the quarter, and the absence of costs associated with the Ocean Apex shipyard project in the third quarter. General and administrative expenses were $19 million in the fourth quarter, or a $3 million increase compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to an adjustment in accrued expenses associated with the Company's incentive compensation plan. Tax expense for the fourth quarter was $174 million as compared to a $125 million expense in the prior quarter. The non-cash tax expense in the fourth quarter reflected the expected continued normalization of the Company's tax expense and the reversal of the tax benefit recorded earlier in 2023. Operational Highlights Operationally, the Company's rigs continued to perform well, achieving revenue efficiency of approximately 95% across the fleet for the second successive quarter. This is a notable achievement given the unusually high amount of shipyard activity for the Company's fleet and the start-up of contracts during the quarter. Of note, both the Ocean BlackHawk and Ocean Courage completed contract preparation activities in the fourth quarter and are now operating under new contracts in the Gulf of Mexico and offshore Brazil, respectively. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, the Company earned an additional bonus for efficient, injury-free operations in Senegal.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures (Unaudited) To supplement the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented on a basis in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), this press release provides investors with adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and loss on extinguishment of debt (or Adjusted EBITDA), which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that this measure provides meaningful information about the Company's performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the Company's ongoing operating results. This allows investors and others to better compare the Company's financial results across previous and subsequent accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the long-term performance of the Company. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, contract drilling revenue, contract drilling expense, operating income or loss, cash flows from operations or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

The net proceeds will be used for various purposes, including the conversion of Partnership Class A-3 Common Units, share purchases, and general corporate needs. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The upsizing of Perella Weinberg Partners' public offering to 5 million shares at $12.00 each, with an additional option for 750,000 shares, highlights a significant capital raise for the firm. This move suggests a strategic initiative to bolster the firm's capital structure, potentially diluting existing shareholders but providing funds for important corporate activities. The allocation of net proceeds for the conversion of certain ACUs into cash to cover tax liabilities indicates a proactive approach to managing partner incentives and tax obligations.Moreover, the use of proceeds to facilitate the purchase of outstanding PWP OpCo Class A partnership units and Class B common stock in connection with the quarterly exchange implies an intent to streamline ownership structure, which could result in a more straightforward capital framework. This could be beneficial for the company's financial flexibility and simplify the equity story for investors. However, the impact on the stock price will need to be closely monitored, as the market's reception to the offering and the subsequent dilution will play a key role in the short-term performance of PWP's stock. Market Research Analyst Perella Weinberg Partners' decision to raise capital through a public offering is a strategic move that reflects broader market trends. Companies in the advisory sector often require substantial capital for operations and growth initiatives, such as mergers and acquisitions. The timing and pricing of the offering may indicate the company's confidence in its valuation and market conditions. It's important to consider the competitive landscape and how this capital infusion could position PWP relative to its peers.Investors will be keen to understand how the capital raised will be deployed to drive value creation, especially in light of the proposed uses indicating a mix of liability management and potential growth funding. The offering's success and the subsequent deployment of capital will likely influence investor sentiment and could set a precedent for similar companies considering public capital markets to fund their strategic initiatives. Legal Expert The offering's compliance with SEC regulations, as evidenced by the use of a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, demonstrates PWP's adherence to legal frameworks governing securities offerings. The mention of the offering not constituting an offer to sell or a solicitation in states where it would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification underlines the intricate nature of securities law and the need for companies to navigate these regulations carefully.It is crucial for potential investors to understand that the legal structure of the offering, including the conversion of ACUs and the potential merger of PWP AdCo Professionals LP with PWP OpCo, could have legal implications that affect shareholder rights and the company's governance structure. These factors should be carefully evaluated for their potential impact on both current and future shareholders. 02/27/2024 - 08:08 PM NEW YORK, Feb. 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Perella Weinberg Partners (the “Company” or “PWP”) (Nasdaq: PWP), a leading global independent advisory firm, today announced the pricing of its upsized public offering of 5,000,000 shares of Class A common stock at a public offering price of $12.00 per share (the “Offering”). In addition, the Company has granted the underwriter a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 750,000 shares of its Class A common stock at the public offering price, less underwriting discounts and commissions. The Offering is expected to close on March 1, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. The Company intends to contribute the net proceeds from the Offering to PWP Holdings LP (“PWP OpCo”) in exchange for 5,000,000 PWP OpCo Class A partnership units (5,750,000 PWP OpCo Class A partnership units if the underwriter exercises its option in full). PWP OpCo intends to use the net proceeds received from the Company, together, to the extent necessary, with any cash on hand, for (i) the conversion of certain Partnership Class A-3 Common Units (“ACUs”) at PWP OpCo held by limited partners into cash in an amount expected to cover the estimated tax liabilities (as determined in the Company’s discretion and subject to available cash for this purpose) associated with the vesting of such limited partners’ ACUs instead of such ACUs vesting into PWP OpCo Class A partnership units, subject to the required board of directors, audit committee and other approvals, (ii) the purchase from certain holders of (A) outstanding PWP OpCo Class A partnership units and (B) outstanding shares of the Company’s Class B common stock in connection with the quarterly exchange for the second quarter of 2024, and (iii) general corporate purposes (provided that (i) and (ii) are subject to completion of the contemplated merger of PWP AdCo Professionals LP with and into PWP OpCo).

The proceeds will fund internal asset programs, AI technology, and general corporate purposes.","Absci Announces Pricing of Public Offering of Common Stock Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Absci Corporation (ABSI) announced a public offering of 16.7 million shares of common stock at $4.50 per share, expecting to raise approximately $75.2 million. The proceeds will fund internal asset programs, AI technology, and general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The public offering from Absci Corporation represents a significant capital infusion for the company, earmarked for the development of its internal asset programs and its Integrated Drug Creation™ platform. The pricing of shares at $4.50 suggests a strategic valuation decision likely based on current market conditions and investor appetite. The gross proceeds of approximately $75.2 million, before expenses, provide a substantial cash runway for the company to advance its AI-driven drug discovery initiatives.Investors will be keenly observing the utilization of these funds, looking for tangible progress in the company's pipeline and technological advancements. The underwriters' option for additional shares introduces potential dilution but also indicates confidence in the offering's success. The involvement of reputable financial institutions such as Morgan Stanley and TD Cowen as joint book-running managers could be seen as a positive indicator of the offering's credibility and the company's growth prospects. Biotechnology Market Analyst The biotechnology sector is highly competitive and capital-intensive, with a strong emphasis on innovation and rapid development cycles. Absci's focus on generative AI for drug creation places it at the intersection of biotech and tech, sectors that are of high interest to investors due to their potential for disruption and high growth. The investment in its proprietary Integrated Drug Creation™ platform suggests a commitment to maintaining a competitive edge in the AI drug discovery space, which is becoming increasingly crowded.Given the long timelines typically associated with drug development, the market will be monitoring Absci's short-term and long-term milestones closely. Success in the platform's enhancement and the progression of asset programs could lead to strategic partnerships, licensing deals, or even acquisition interest from larger pharmaceutical companies. However, setbacks in these areas could significantly impact the company's valuation and stock performance. Medical Research Analyst From a medical research perspective, the funding towards Absci's internal asset programs is crucial. The development of new drugs through AI technologies holds the promise of faster discovery times and potentially more effective treatments. The ability to rapidly iterate on drug candidates using AI can significantly reduce the time and cost associated with traditional drug development.However, the path from drug discovery to market is fraught with regulatory hurdles and clinical trial challenges. The capital raised will need to support not only technology development but also the necessary clinical trials to bring these potential treatments to market. The effectiveness of Absci's AI platform in navigating these steps will be a critical factor in their long-term success and impact on patient care. 02/27/2024 - 10:20 PM VANCOUVER, Wash., Feb. 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Absci Corporation (Nasdaq: ABSI) (“Absci”), a data-first generative AI drug creation company, today announced the pricing of an underwritten public offering of 16,700,000 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $4.50 per share, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions.

According to Dr. Rob Stenstrom, Asep's Medical Director, ""Abdominal pain is one of the most common complaints we see for children in the emergency room, and so it's important that we identify the difference between simple appendicitis and perforated appendicitis quickly and accurately."" The link between appendicitis severity and sepsis was discovered as a result of a single-centre prospective exploratory diagnostic clinical study published online in the JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association) Pediatrics on February 19, 2024, in an article titled Gene Expression Profiling in Pediatric Appendicitis, Dhillon et al., with Asep CEO Dr. Robert Hancock as senior author.1 Thus, the gene expression signature that is foundational to the Company's AI-based sepsis diagnostic technology, called SepsetER TM, was able to distinguish between simple appendicitis (SA) and perforated appendicitis (PA), which was found to be a much more severe sepsis condition. According to a related editorial article by Maurizio Pacilli et al.2, in the same issue, ""SA has a mortality rate of about 0.1% while PA has a mortality risk of 5%, highlighting the need for timely and accurate diagnosis and treatment ... Dhillon et al. aimed to identify blood-based biomarkers for use as clinical molecular diagnostics to differentiate between SA and PA in children."" Perforated appendicitis has an incidence, according to one study3, of at least 19% in children undergoing appendectomy. The clinical study asked, ""What blood-based mechanistic changes distinguish pediatric patients with perforated appendicitis (PA) from those with simple appendicitis on presentation to the emergency department?"" The study found that the ""diagnostic study of 71 patients with pediatric appendicitis using systems immunology methods revealed a mechanistic understanding of severe disease, indicating immune dysregulation similar to that observed in sepsis. A blood-based gene expression signature of PA was also derived, providing a potential diagnostic for pediatric PA. Further work4 indicated that the SepsetER gene signature was similarly diagnostic and, in fact, overlapped with the 4-gene signature."" The study concluded that early diagnostics and management strategies for pediatric PA should be informed by underlying immune dysregulation and similarities to sepsis. Given that Asep is in advanced pre-clinical development of their sepsis gene expression in vitro diagnostic test, SepsetER, it is likely that this test may assist with diagnoses of the most severe forms of childhood sepsis in the future. Dr. Robert E. W. Hancock, Asep Medical's Founder, Chairman and CEO, commented, ""This study took place in 2017 in Calgary, and we performed the final data analysis in August 2023. Using the gene expression signatures we developed at UBC, and now under patent and licenced to Asep Medical's subsidiary Sepset Biosciences, we were able to leverage this data to show the value of the SepsetER technology in identifying perforated appendicitis. Based on the new potential benefits of this ER technology, we look forward to improving outcomes for children presenting with abdominal pain in the ER."" ABOUT ASEP MEDICAL HOLDINGS INC. Asep Medical Holdings Inc. (www.asepmedical.com) is dedicated to addressing the global issue of antibiotic failure by developing novel solutions for significant unmet medical needs in human medicine. The Company is a consolidation of three existing private companies, all with technology in advanced development — Sepset Biosciences Inc. (proprietary diagnostic tools to enable the early and timely identification of sepsis), ABT Innovations Inc. (broad-spectrum therapeutic agents to address multi-drug resistant biofilm infections), and SafeCoat Medical Inc. (an antibacterial peptide medical device coating technology). Sepset Biosciences Inc. (www.sepset.ca) is in the final stages of preparation for clinical studies and commercialization of an in vitro diagnostic test that involves a patient gene expression signature that helps assess the development of severe sepsis, one of the significant diseases leading to antibiotic failure since antibiotics are the primary initial treatment for sepsis. Sepsis was responsible for nearly 20% of all deaths on the planet in 2017 and essentially all deaths due to COVID-19 and other pandemics. The SepsetER test is a blood-based gene expression assay that is straightforward to implement, and results are obtained about an hour after taking a blood sample in the emergency room or intensive care unit. This proprietary diagnostic technology differs from current diagnostic tests, enabling the risk assessment for progression to severe sepsis within ~60 minutes of initiating the test. Bacterial culture, the gold standard, provides results after ~15 hours but can be as long as three days. Asep Inc. believes its test will enable physicians to make critical early decisions regarding appropriate therapies and thus reduce overall morbidity and mortality due to sepsis. ABT Innovations Inc.'s (www.abtinnovations.ca) peptide technology covers a broad range of therapeutic applications, including bacterial biofilm infections (dental, wound, sinusitis, skin, medical device infections, chronic infections, lung, bladder, ear-nose and throat, orthopaedic, etc.), anti-inflammatories, anti-infective immune-modulators and vaccine adjuvants. The company is in the pre-clinical development phase with promising data for the first three indications. SafeCoat Medical Inc.'s (www.safecoatmedical.com) technology encompasses anti-fouling self-assembling polymers combined with conjugated antimicrobial peptides, which can be applied to various surfaces as antimicrobial and anti-fouling coatings. In particular, the invention relates to coatings that may be applied to multiple medical devices and implants, and feasibility has been demonstrated in animal models. The company's expertise also encompasses the methods for manufacturing and applying these anti-bacterial coatings.

Financial Analyst The issuance of $900 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.00% exchangeable senior notes by NextEra Energy Capital Holdings, a subsidiary of NextEra Energy, Inc., is a significant move in the corporate finance space. This type of instrument allows institutional investors to potentially convert their holdings into equity, specifically NextEra Energy common stock, under certain conditions. The initial exchange rate offers a 22.5% premium over the current stock price, which could be attractive to investors betting on the company's future growth.From a financial perspective, the decision to settle any remaining obligation in cash could be indicative of the company's confidence in its liquidity position. Additionally, the net proceeds of approximately $889.5 million, or $988.5 million if the additional notes are purchased, after deducting costs, are earmarked for general corporate purposes including investment in energy and power projects. This aligns with NextEra's strategic focus on expanding its clean energy portfolio, which may bolster investor confidence in the company's growth trajectory.The capped call transactions with a cap price of $83.34 per share, a 50% premium over the last reported sale price, are a strategic hedge. They limit the potential dilution of existing shareholders' equity and earnings per share if the stock price appreciates significantly. For investors, this move signals a balanced approach to financing that seeks to manage risk while providing upside potential. Market Research Analyst NextEra Energy's positioning as a leading clean energy company is critical in the context of the growing global demand for renewable energy sources. The company's investment in wind, solar and battery storage reflects a broader industry trend towards sustainable energy solutions. By allocating a portion of the proceeds to further these initiatives, NextEra is likely to maintain or enhance its competitive edge in this sector.Moreover, the company's status as America's largest electric utility and its sizeable customer base provide a stable revenue stream that supports its investment activities. This stability is an important consideration for institutional investors looking at long-term debt instruments like the exchangeable senior notes. The company's commitment to sustainability and corporate responsibility also adds to its appeal for investors with an ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) focus, potentially increasing demand for the notes. Legal Expert The offering of exchangeable senior notes is subject to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, which facilitates the sale of privately placed securities to qualified institutional buyers. This exemption from public registration allows for a more expedited and less costly process, but it limits the pool of potential investors to those who meet the criteria of being 'qualified institutional buyers.'It is also important to note that the notes and any shares of NextEra Energy common stock deliverable upon exchange are not transferable without registration or an exemption from registration requirements. This lack of liquidity could be a consideration for potential investors. The legal structure of the notes offering, including the guarantee by NextEra Energy, provides investors with a degree of security, as it is an unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed senior unsecured obligation of the parent company. 02/27/2024 - 11:30 PM JUNO BEACH, Fla., Feb. 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- NextEra Energy Capital Holdings, Inc., a subsidiary of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NEE), today announced the pricing of $900 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.00% exchangeable senior notes due 2027 (the ""notes"") in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""). In connection with the offering of the notes, NextEra Energy Capital Holdings granted the initial purchasers the option to purchase up to an additional $100 million aggregate principal amount of the notes within a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the date on which the notes are first issued. The offering is expected to close on March 1, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. The notes will accrue interest at a rate of 3.00% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and Sept. 1 of each year, beginning on Sept. 1, 2024. Holders may exchange all or a portion of their notes at any time prior to their maturity date in principal amounts equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof. Upon exchange, NextEra Energy Capital Holdings will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be exchanged and has the right, at its sole discretion, to pay or deliver cash, shares of NextEra Energy common stock or a combination of both to settle any remaining obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being exchanged. At this time, NextEra Energy Capital Holdings expects to settle any remaining obligation in cash. The initial exchange rate is 14.6927 per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which represents an approximately 22.5% premium to the $55.56 per share closing price of NextEra Energy common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on Feb. 27, 2024. The exchange rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The notes will mature on March 1, 2027, unless earlier purchased by NextEra Energy Capital Holdings or exchanged, and will be unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by NextEra Energy. NextEra Energy Capital Holdings estimates the net proceeds from the notes offering will be approximately $889.5 million (or approximately $988.5 million if the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes in full), after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by NextEra Energy Capital Holdings. NextEra Energy intends to use a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to pay the approximately $47 million cost of the capped call transactions (or approximately $52 million if the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes in full) described below. NextEra Energy Capital Holdings will add the remainder of the net proceeds from the offering to its general funds and expects to use its general funds to fund investments in energy and power projects and for other general corporate purposes, including the repayment of a portion of its outstanding commercial paper obligations. In connection with the offering of the notes, NextEra Energy has entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers of the notes or their respective affiliates and/or certain other financial institutions (the ""hedge counterparties""). The cap price of the capped call transactions will initially be $83.34 per share, which represents a premium of 50% over the last reported sale price of NextEra Energy common stock of $55.56 per share on the New York Stock Exchange on Feb. 27, 2024, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the capped call transactions. The capped call transactions may be settled with cash or, at NextEra Energy's election, with shares of NextEra Energy common stock. At this time, NextEra Energy expects to settle the capped call transactions in cash. Any capped call settlement value is expected to offset the value to be delivered upon exchange of the notes (as applicable) as a result of share price improvement up to the cap price, which will be subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the capped call transactions. The offer and sale of the notes, the guarantee and the shares of NextEra Energy common stock, if any, deliverable upon exchange of the notes, if any, have not been registered under the Securities Act, or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. Accordingly, the notes are being offered and sold only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The notes, the guarantee and NextEra Energy common stock deliverable upon exchange of the notes are not transferable absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. This news release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the securities described herein, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities law of any such jurisdiction.

This integration could set a new standard for liquid cooling solutions, potentially influencing future designs of data center infrastructure. As data centers continue to scale and the demand for processing power increases, especially with the proliferation of AI and machine learning workloads, effective cooling solutions like PLC become increasingly vital.The demonstration of PLC's effectiveness in SKT's AI Data Center Testbed will serve as a crucial case study for the industry. If successful, it could accelerate the adoption of liquid cooling technologies across the sector, impacting suppliers, manufacturers and operators of data centers. The implications for the stock market could include increased investor interest in companies providing these innovative cooling solutions, as well as in data center operators who adopt them to cut costs and improve efficiency. Environmental Sustainability Analyst The environmental implications of the MOU signed by SK Telecom, Iceotope Technologies and SK Enmove are substantial. As businesses and governments around the world intensify their focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the adoption of energy-efficient technologies becomes critical. The data center industry, in particular, has been under scrutiny for its high energy consumption and consequent environmental impact. By developing solutions that significantly reduce the power consumption of cooling systems, the partnership is addressing a core challenge in the path toward a more sustainable data center industry.The move toward energy-efficient cooling solutions like PLC not only supports corporate social responsibility goals but can also be a factor in regulatory compliance. As more regions implement stringent energy use regulations, data centers employing such advanced cooling technologies could benefit from incentives or avoid penalties associated with energy consumption. This proactive approach to sustainability can enhance the public image of the companies involved, potentially leading to a more favorable market perception and an advantage in attracting eco-conscious investors. 02/27/2024 - 07:17 PM BARCELONA, Spain, Feb. 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- SK Telecom (NYSE: SKM, ""SKT""), Iceotope Technologies, the global leader in Precision Liquid Cooling, and SK Enmove, Korea's leading base oil and lubricants provider developing thermal fluids for data center, signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to collaborate on the development of liquid cooling technique/solution that optimizes energy-efficiency of AI data centers.

(PK) reported strong financial results for Q4 and full year 2023, with increases in key metrics like Net income, Operating income, and Comparable RevPAR. The company exceeded its operational goals, strengthened its balance sheet, and returned over $630 million to shareholders. Park invested nearly $400 million in renovation projects, leading to positive outlooks for 2024. Despite challenges like disruptions from renovations, Park's strategic initiatives have driven growth and increased shareholder value. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The revision of Park Hotels & Resorts Inc.'s full-year 2024 outlook, particularly the adjustments to operating income margin and total revenues, is an indicator of the company's financial health and operational efficiency. The updated operating income margin projections of 15.1% to 16.3% suggest a robust control over costs relative to revenue. This is further corroborated by the reported net income growth of 437.1% for the quarter and 16.1% for the full year. The increase in Adjusted Funds From Operations (FFO) per share by 32.5% is a critical metric for real estate investment trusts (REITs), signifying the company's ability to generate cash flow from its hotel operations. Investors should note that FFO is a more accurate representation of a REIT's operational performance than net income, as it excludes depreciation and amortization, which are non-cash expenses.Additionally, the repurchase of 14.6 million shares and the payment of over $450 million in dividends reflect a shareholder-friendly capital allocation strategy. The increase in recurring quarterly dividend by 67% demonstrates confidence in the company's future cash flows. However, investors should be aware that share repurchases and high dividend payouts, while beneficial in the short-term, could potentially limit the company's ability to reinvest in growth opportunities. Market Research Analyst The reported increases in Comparable Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR), which rose by 8.7% year-over-year and the surge in Comparable Occupancy by 4.9 percentage points, indicate a strong recovery in the hospitality sector, particularly in urban and resort markets. Park's strategic capital investments, such as the renovation projects at key properties, are poised to enhance the guest experience and drive future revenue growth. The Comparable RevPAR growth in urban markets is particularly noteworthy, as it signifies a rebound in business and group travel, which had been heavily impacted by the pandemic.Moreover, the credit rating upgrade by S&P Global to BB- reflects improved financial stability and may reduce borrowing costs, facilitating future growth. The divestiture of the Hilton Miami Airport hotel and the exit from the Hilton San Francisco Hotels also suggest a strategic shift in asset allocation, focusing on high-potential properties and markets. However, the impact of renovations on the Casa Marina Key West resort, which disrupted operations and contributed to a decline in RevPAR for the location, underscores the short-term trade-offs associated with long-term capital improvements. Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) Analyst Park's operational update and financial results are indicative of a strategic positioning within the REIT sector. The company's focus on enhancing its portfolio through targeted renovations and the development of new guestrooms align with industry trends of prioritizing asset quality and guest experience. The sale of non-core assets and the repayment of mortgage loans are in line with a strategy to streamline the portfolio and strengthen the balance sheet.Investors should consider the implications of the receivership of the Hilton San Francisco Hotels, as it removes economic interest from Park but also eliminates associated debt from its balance sheet. This move, coupled with the repayment of the W Chicago – City Center mortgage loan, demonstrates active debt management. The planned capital expenditures for 2024, amounting to $230 million to $250 million, reflect a commitment to asset enhancement but should be evaluated against the potential ROI these projects may yield. The company's liquidity position, with over $1.3 billion available, provides financial flexibility to support these initiatives. 02/27/2024 - 09:29 PM TYSONS, Va., Feb. 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The following items in this press release have been corrected: (i) under the caption “Full-Year 2024 Outlook” and the accompanying reconciliations, the “low case” and “high case” outlook of operating income margin were changed to 15.1% and 16.3%, respectively; (ii) under the accompanying reconciliations to the full-year 2024 outlook, the “low case” and “high case” of Total Revenues were changed to $2,633 million and $2,682 million, respectively, and the “low case” and “high case” of “other revenue” were both changed to $92 million.

Thomas J. Baltimore, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, ""2023 was a year of outstanding accomplishments for Park as we executed on our strategic objectives, exceeded our operational goals, and meaningfully strengthened our balance sheet, while delivering sector-leading total returns for shareholders. As we previously reported, our portfolio's performance was strong during the fourth quarter, with Comparable RevPAR increasing over 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, or over 6% if excluding disruption from renovations, primarily at the Casa Marina Key West resort, where operations were largely suspended during the quarter, and the Bonnet Creek Orlando complex. For the full year, both Comparable RevPAR and Adjusted EBITDA increased by nearly 9% from the prior year and exceeded the midpoint of our full-year guidance. In addition to our operating achievements, we remained laser-focused on creating long-term shareholder value and executed important strategic capital allocation initiatives over the past year, returning over $630 million in capital to shareholders, including the repurchase of 14.6 million shares of common stock for $180 million and paying over $450 million of dividends. In addition, we reinvested nearly $300 million back into our current portfolio and will continue to reinvest in our portfolio, including nearly $90 million on upcoming key renovation projects. Turning to 2024, we are excited for the expected benefits from the nearly $400 million invested over the past two years on transformative renovation projects at Casa Marina Key West, the Tapa Tower at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and the Bonnet Creek Orlando complex, which began 2024 with the highest full-year Group Revenue Pace in the complex's history. Additionally, strong convention calendars and expected increases in group demand at our New Orleans, Chicago, San Diego and Miami hotels, coupled with ongoing strength in leisure and group demand at our Hawaii hotels from both domestic and international travel create a favorable backdrop for Park. The year is off to a strong start, with January Comparable RevPAR up 13.4% compared to last year and February Comparable RevPAR currently expected to exceed last year by over 8%, reinforcing our positive outlook for our portfolio this year that has allowed us to increase our recurring quarterly dividend by 67% to $0.25 from $0.15 per share.” Additional Highlights In February 2024, S&P Global raised Park's credit rating by two notches to BB- from B as a result of improved leverage following Park's effective exit from the Hilton San Francisco Hotels;Completed the multi-phased renovation project of the 1,021-room Tapa Tower at the Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort in December 2023, and, in early 2024, completed the nearly $230 million transformative expansion and full-scale renovation of the Waldorf Astoria Orlando and Signia by Hilton Orlando Bonnet Creek hotels and the approximately $80 million full-scale renovation at the Casa Marina Key West, Curio Collection;Declared a total of $2.15 per share in dividends to stockholders during 2023, which includes dividends of $1.70 per share declared during the fourth quarter of 2023.

As of December 31, 2023, Park's Comparable Net Debt was approximately $3.4 billion, which excludes the SF Mortgage Loan and considers the $162 million special dividend resulting from Park's effective exit from the Hilton San Francisco Hotels paid in January 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the weighted average maturity of Park's consolidated debt, excluding the SF Mortgage Loan, is 3.4 years.

(3) Park has approximately $950 million of available capacity under the Revolver.(4) Excludes $164 million of Park’s share of debt of its unconsolidated joint ventures.(5) Excludes the SF Mortgage Loan, which is included in debt associated with hotels in receivership in Park's consolidated balance sheets. In June 2023, Park ceased making debt service payments toward the non-recourse SF Mortgage Loan, and Park received a notice of default. The stated rate on the loan is 4.11%, however, beginning June 1, 2023, the default interest rate on the loan is 7.11%. Additionally, beginning June 1, 2023, the loan accrues a monthly late payment administrative fee of 3% of the monthly amount due. In October 2023, the Hilton San Francisco Hotels were placed into court-ordered receivership, and thus, Park has no further economic interest in the operations of the hotels. Capital Investments In January 2024, Park completed the over $220 million capital improvement project at its Bonnet Creek Orlando complex, which included meeting space expansion and renovation of guestrooms, existing meeting space, lobbies, food and beverage outlets, golf course and other recreational amenities. Including the renovations at the Bonnet Creek Orlando complex, Park spent nearly $300 million on capital improvements at its hotels during 2023, with $90 million spent during the fourth quarter of 2023, which also includes the completion of the approximately $85 million guestroom renovation at the Tapa Tower of the Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort, the $80 million renovation of all guestrooms, public spaces, food and beverage outlets, and certain hotel infrastructure at the Casa Marina Key West, Curio Collection, the $11 million phase 2 guestroom renovation in the Riverside Building at the Hilton New Orleans Riverside, and the $5 million ballroom renovation at the New York Hilton Midtown. Park has approved an additional $190 million to $200 million in capital expenditures for 2024. Combined with previously approved projects, Park expects to spend between $230 million to $250 million in 2024.

PARK HOTELS & RESORTS INC.DEFINITIONS Comparable The Company presents certain data for its consolidated hotels on a Comparable basis as supplemental information for investors: Comparable Hotel Revenues, Comparable RevPAR, Comparable Occupancy, Comparable ADR, Comparable Hotel Adjusted EBITDA and Comparable Hotel Adjusted EBITDA Margin. The Company presents Comparable hotel results to help the Company and its investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of its hotels. The Company’s Comparable metrics include results from hotels that were active and operating in Park's portfolio since January 1st of the previous year and property acquisitions as though such acquisitions occurred on the earliest period presented. Additionally, Comparable metrics exclude results from property dispositions that have occurred through February 27, 2024 and the Hilton San Francisco Hotels, which were placed into receivership at the end of October 2023. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Hotel Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA margin Earnings before interest expense, taxes and depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), presented herein, reflects net income (loss) excluding depreciation and amortization, interest income, interest expense, income taxes and interest expense, income tax and depreciation and amortization included in equity in earnings from investments in affiliates. Adjusted EBITDA, presented herein, is calculated as EBITDA, as previously defined, further adjusted to exclude the following items that are not reflective of Park's ongoing operating performance or incurred in the normal course of business, and thus, excluded from management's analysis in making day-to-day operating decisions and evaluations of Park's operating performance against other companies within its industry: Gains or losses on sales of assets for both consolidated and unconsolidated investments;Costs associated with hotel acquisitions or dispositions expensed during the period;Severance expense;Share-based compensation expense;Impairment losses and casualty gains or losses; andOther items that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current or future operating performance. Hotel Adjusted EBITDA measures hotel-level results before debt service, depreciation and corporate expenses of the Company’s consolidated hotels, which excludes hotels owned by unconsolidated affiliates, and is a key measure of the Company’s profitability. The Company presents Hotel Adjusted EBITDA to help the Company and its investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of the Company’s consolidated hotels. Hotel Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated as Hotel Adjusted EBITDA divided by total hotel revenue. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Hotel Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA margin are not recognized terms under United States (“U.S.”) GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or other measures of financial performance or liquidity derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, the Company’s definitions of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Hotel Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The Company believes that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Hotel Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful information to investors about the Company and its financial condition and results of operations for the following reasons: (i) EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Hotel Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA margin are among the measures used by the Company’s management team to make day-to-day operating decisions and evaluate its operating performance between periods and between REITs by removing the effect of its capital structure (primarily interest expense) and asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization) from its operating results; and (ii) EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Hotel Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA margin are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a common performance measure to compare results or estimate valuations across companies in the industry. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Hotel Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered either in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) or other methods of analyzing the Company’s operating performance and results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Because of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as discretionary cash available to the Company to reinvest in the growth of its business or as measures of cash that will be available to the Company to meet its obligations. Nareit FFO attributable to stockholders, Adjusted FFO attributable to stockholders, Nareit FFO per share – diluted and Adjusted FFO per share – diluted Nareit FFO attributable to stockholders and Nareit FFO per diluted share (defined as set forth below) are presented herein as non-GAAP measures of the Company’s performance. The Company calculates funds from (used in) operations (“FFO”) attributable to stockholders for a given operating period in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”), as net income (loss) attributable to stockholders (calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP), excluding depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on sales of assets, impairment, and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, plus adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures are calculated to reflect the Company’s pro rata share of the FFO of those entities on the same basis. As noted by Nareit in its December 2018 “Nareit Funds from Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement,” since real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. For these reasons, Nareit adopted the FFO metric in order to promote an industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance. The Company believes Nareit FFO provides useful information to investors regarding its operating performance and can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between REITs. The Company’s presentation may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the terms in accordance with the current Nareit definition, or that interpret the current Nareit definition differently. The Company calculates Nareit FFO per diluted share as Nareit FFO divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during a given operating period. The Company also presents Adjusted FFO attributable to stockholders and Adjusted FFO per diluted share when evaluating its performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding the Company’s ongoing operating performance. Management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating its performance and in its annual budget process. Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted FFO provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s complete understanding of operating performance. The Company adjusts Nareit FFO attributable to stockholders for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refers to this measure as Adjusted FFO attributable to stockholders: Costs associated with hotel acquisitions or dispositions expensed during the period;Severance expense;Share-based compensation expense;Casualty gains or losses; andOther items that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current or future operating performance. Net debt Net debt, presented herein, is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company uses to evaluate its financial leverage. Net debt is calculated as (i) debt excluding unamortized deferred financing costs; and (ii) the Company’s share of investments in affiliate debt, excluding unamortized deferred financing costs; reduced by (a) cash and cash equivalents; and (b) restricted cash and cash equivalents. The Company believes Net debt provides useful information about its indebtedness to investors as it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to compare the indebtedness of companies. Net debt should not be considered as a substitute to debt presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Net debt may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of other companies. Occupancy Occupancy represents the total number of room nights sold divided by the total number of room nights available at a hotel or group of hotels. Occupancy measures the utilization of the Company’s hotels’ available capacity. Management uses Occupancy to gauge demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period. Occupancy levels also help management determine achievable Average Daily Rate (“ADR”) levels as demand for rooms increases or decreases. Average Daily Rate ADR (or rate) represents rooms revenue divided by total number of room nights sold in a given period. ADR measures average room price attained by a hotel and ADR trends provide useful information concerning the pricing environment and the nature of the customer base of a hotel or group of hotels. ADR is a commonly used performance measure in the hotel industry, and management uses ADR to assess pricing levels that the Company is able to generate by type of customer, as changes in rates have a more pronounced effect on overall revenues and incremental profitability than changes in Occupancy, as described above. Revenue per Available Room Revenue per Available Room (“RevPAR”) represents rooms revenue divided by the total number of room nights available to guests for a given period. Management considers RevPAR to be a meaningful indicator of the Company’s performance as it provides a metric correlated to two primary and key factors of operations at a hotel or group of hotels: Occupancy and ADR. RevPAR is also a useful indicator in measuring performance over comparable periods. Total RevPAR Total RevPAR represents rooms, food and beverage and other hotel revenues divided by the total number of room nights available to guests for a given period. Management considers Total RevPAR to be a meaningful indicator of the Company’s performance as approximately one-third of revenues are earned from food and beverage and other hotel revenues. Total RevPAR is also a useful indicator in measuring performance over comparable periods. Group Revenue Pace Group Revenue Pace represents bookings for future business and is calculated as group room nights multiplied by the contracted room rate expressed as a percentage of a prior period relative to a prior point in time. What were Park Hotels & Resorts Inc.'s (PK) key financial metrics for Q4 and full year 2023? Park reported increases in Net income, Operating income, and Comparable RevPAR for Q4 and full year 2023. How much did Park invest in renovation projects in 2023? Park invested nearly $400 million in renovation projects in 2023. What was Park's dividend declaration for Q1 2024? Park declared a first quarter 2024 cash dividend of $0.25 per share to be paid on April 15, 2024. What challenges did Park face in 2023? Park faced disruptions from renovations at Casa Marina Key West and Bonnet Creek Orlando complex in 2023. How did Park strengthen its balance sheet in 2023? Park strengthened its balance sheet by returning over $630 million to shareholders and executing strategic capital allocation initiatives."

This milestone aims to create two leading companies in their markets, as stated by Robert A. Ortenzio, Executive Chairman. Positive None. Negative None. Tax Advisor The favorable private letter ruling from the IRS is a critical step for Select Medical in its strategic decision to separate its occupational health services business, Concentra. From a tax perspective, this ruling ensures that the separation can be conducted on a tax-free basis, which is significant for the company's financial structuring. It implies potential savings of millions in tax liabilities, depending on the value of the assets involved. The tax-free status can also be appealing to investors, as it suggests a more efficient allocation of capital and could lead to a reevaluation of the company's stock.By establishing two distinct entities, each focused on their core competencies, there is a possibility for improved operational efficiencies and a sharper strategic focus. However, this also means that each entity will have to bear its own operational costs and may face new market challenges independently. It's essential for stakeholders to consider the implications of these changes on the company's financial health and operational synergy. Market Analyst The announcement by Select Medical to pursue the separation of Concentra can be seen as a strategic move to unlock shareholder value. By creating two market-leading companies, Select Medical may be aiming to enhance the market perception and valuation of both businesses. This move can be particularly effective if the markets believe that the sum of the parts is greater than the whole.Investors should monitor the reaction of the stock market to this news, as it can serve as an indicator of the market's confidence in the success of the separation. It's also important to analyze the competitive landscape of the healthcare services industry to understand how this separation might alter the dynamics and competitive advantages of both Select Medical and the newly independent Concentra.Long-term benefits may include more focused business strategies and potentially higher growth rates as each company tailors its approach to its specific market. However, there could be short-term costs associated with the separation, such as administrative expenses, which could impact financial performance. Healthcare Industry Analyst The potential separation of Select Medical's business units points to a broader industry trend where healthcare companies are streamlining operations to focus on core services. For Concentra, operating independently could mean a more focused investment in occupational health services and potential market expansion. This separation can lead to more agile decision-making and specialized services, which is crucial in the competitive healthcare market.For stakeholders, it's essential to assess how the separation will affect the service quality, client relationships and brand value of both entities. Any changes in these areas can have significant implications for the companies' market shares and revenue streams. Furthermore, the impact on employees and company culture should not be overlooked, as these are vital components of a company's success in the healthcare industry. 02/27/2024 - 06:16 PM MECHANICSBURG, Pa., Feb. 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Select Medical Holdings Corporation (""Select Medical,"" ""we,"" ""us,"" or ""our"") (NYSE: SEM) announced today that it has received a favorable private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the ""IRS"") with respect to the tax-free status of its previously announced plan to pursue a separation of its wholly-owned occupational health services business, Concentra Group Holdings Parent, LLC (""Concentra"" and such business, the ""Concentra business"").

Electra Provides Corporate Update,2024-02-27T23:26:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Electra Battery Materials Corporation (ELBM) announces agreement with Noteholders to postpone interest payments, plans Share Issuance and seeks Nasdaq compliance extension. Company settles employee incentive payments with Common Shares.","Electra Provides Corporate Update Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Electra Battery Materials Corporation (ELBM) announces agreement with Noteholders to postpone interest payments, plans Share Issuance and seeks Nasdaq compliance extension. Company settles employee incentive payments with Common Shares. Positive Electra Battery Materials Corporation (ELBM) has reached an agreement with Noteholders to postpone interest payments on senior secured convertible notes. The Noteholders have agreed to a waiver allowing the Company to delay interest payments until August 15, 2024, subject to certain conditions. The Company will pay accrued interest through a Share Issuance to certain Noteholders, pending TSX Venture Exchange approval. Electra Battery Materials Corporation (ELBM) is focused on finalizing financing for a cobalt refinery construction while ensuring stability in its balance sheet. The Company is seeking an extension from Nasdaq to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement by March 19, 2024. Electra Battery Materials Corporation (ELBM) has settled performance-based incentive cash payments to non-officer employees by issuing Common Shares at a deemed price of C$0.81 per share. Negative None. Financial Analyst The agreement between Electra Battery Materials Corporation and its Noteholders to postpone interest payments and satisfy a portion through equity issuance is a strategic financial maneuver. This action indicates a focus on liquidity management and balance sheet stabilization, which is crucial for the company's near-term financial health. By deferring cash outflows for interest payments, Electra is able to conserve cash for operational needs, such as the construction of its cobalt refinery. However, this also adds to the principal amount, potentially increasing the long-term debt burden.The Share Issuance at a discount to market price could dilute existing shareholders' equity but also provides immediate relief from cash interest obligations. The market's reaction to such dilution will depend on investor confidence in the company's future profitability and growth prospects. Additionally, the waiver regarding the resale registration statement may signify the Noteholders' willingness to hold their positions longer, which could be interpreted as a vote of confidence in the company's prospects. Legal Expert The terms outlined in the Waiver and the Indenture have legal implications for the company's financial agreements. The condition that Electra must pay the interest immediately in the event of default underscores the importance of maintaining compliance with the Indenture. This legal structure provides a safeguard for Noteholders while offering Electra some flexibility in managing its debt. The need for approval from the TSX Venture Exchange for the Share Issuance also highlights the regulatory oversight involved in such transactions, ensuring that they are conducted in accordance with market rules and protecting the interests of all stakeholders. Market Research Analyst Electra's strategy to manage its debt obligations through equity issuance and interest payment deferrals is reflective of broader trends in the battery materials sector, where companies are often capital-intensive and may seek creative financing solutions to manage cash flow. The company's focus on completing the cobalt refinery financing package is indicative of the strategic importance of vertical integration in the battery materials industry to secure supply chains and meet growing demand for electric vehicles. The NASDAQ's Minimum Bid Requirement non-compliance and the subsequent steps to resolve it will be important for Electra to maintain its listing status and access to capital markets, which is vital for its growth trajectory. 02/27/2024 - 06:26 PM TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Electra Battery Materials Corporation (NASDAQ: ELBM; TSX-V: ELBM) (“Electra” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that the Company and the holders (the “Noteholders”) of US$51 million principal amount of 8.99% senior secured convertible notes (the “Notes”) have entered into an agreement (the “Waiver”) whereby the Noteholders have agreed, subject to certain conditions, to a postponement in the unpaid payment of interest on the Notes payable on the August 15, 2023 and February 15, 2024 interest payment dates (the “Interest”) under the convertible note indenture dated as of February 13, 2023 (the “Indenture”) that governs the Notes. Pursuant to the Waiver, the Company is required to make payment of accrued Interest on August 15, 2024, other than the Interest to be paid through the Share Issuance (as defined below). In the event of a default by the Company under the Indenture, the Company is required to pay the Interest immediately. Pending repayment, the Interest will be treated as additional principal amounts of Notes entitled to the same rights as the Notes under the Indenture, including the accrual of additional interest under the Indenture and the right to convert into common shares in the capital of the Company (“Common Shares”). The Company has agreed to satisfy US$400,732 of the Interest through the issuance of Common Shares to certain Noteholders (the “Share Issuance”). The Share Issuance will occur at a deemed value equivalent to 95% of the volume weighted average trading price of the Common Shares for the five trading days immediately prior to the issuance. The Share Issuance remains subject to the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange (the “TSXV”), and the Company will issue a further news release once the Share Issuance has been completed confirming the final number of Common Shares issued. “While our primary focus is completion of the financing package for construction of the cobalt refinery, steps such as today’s support stability within our balance sheet and meeting our near-term obligations to our lenders,” said David Allen, Electra’s CFO. In addition, subject to certain conditions, the Noteholders have agreed to waive the requirement set out in the Indenture for the Company to file a registration statement to provide for the resale of the Common Shares underlying the Notes and the common share purchase warrants issued on February 13, 2023. NASDAQ Notice Update Further to the Company’s news release dated September 22, 2023 regarding its receipt of notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) on September 21, 2023 stating that the Company is not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement (""Minimum Bid Requirement""), the Company intends to submit an application pursuant to the Nasdaq Listing Rules for an additional 180-day extension to the notice period under Nasdaq Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(ii), at which point the Company may be required to take steps to resolve the non-compliance. If at any time before March 19, 2024, the bid price of the Common Shares closes at or above US$1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, the Company will regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement. Employee Share Settlement Further to the Company’s news release dated February 12, 2024, the Company has settled a total of C$133,857 of earned performance-based incentive cash payments to certain non-officer employees by issuing a total of 165,257 Common Shares at a deemed price of C$0.81 per share to these individuals (the “Share Settlement”). The aggregate Share Settlement is lower than the previously disclosed total of C$157,357, by issuing a total of 194,268 Common Shares, that the Company had anticipated settling. Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.

(OGEN) announces the pricing of a public offering of 1,400,000 shares of common stock at $1.50 per share, raising $2.1 million for the development of a neurosteroid drug compound to treat mild traumatic brain injuries. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent public offering by Oragenics, Inc. indicates a strategic move to secure funding for the continued development of their neurosteroid drug compound, ONP-002. From a financial perspective, the pricing of shares at $1.50 to raise $2.1 million, before expenses, suggests a targeted approach to finance specific corporate objectives. The decision to provide underwriters with an over-allotment option is a common practice known as a 'greenshoe' option, which can help stabilize the stock price post-offering. The potential dilution effect on current shareholders is an important consideration, as it could impact the stock's price performance in the short term.Investors and analysts will be monitoring the deployment of the raised capital towards ONP-002's development, as its success or failure will likely have significant implications for the company's financial health and stock valuation. The use of a shelf registration statement expedites the process of capital raising, demonstrating the company's preparedness to leverage market opportunities promptly. Medical Research Analyst ONP-002's role in treating mild traumatic brain injuries, commonly known as concussions, places Oragenics in a niche yet crucial segment of the pharmaceutical market. The development of treatments for neurological disorders, particularly concussions, is an area of high unmet medical need and significant commercial potential. Given the prevalence of concussions in sports and other activities, a successful treatment could lead to substantial market demand.Furthermore, the intranasal delivery system of their pharmaceuticals could offer a competitive advantage in terms of ease of administration and rapid absorption, which is critical in acute neurological conditions. The progress of ONP-002 through clinical trials and eventual market approval will be key milestones that could greatly affect the company's future prospects and investor sentiment. Market Research Analyst Analyzing the broader market context, Oragenics' public offering should be viewed against the backdrop of the biotech industry's funding landscape. Biotech firms often rely on public offerings to fund research and development due to the capital-intensive nature of the industry. The timing and success of such offerings can be influenced by market conditions, investor appetite for risk and the perceived potential of the company's drug pipeline.The market's reception of the offering and the subsequent performance of Oragenics' stock will provide insights into investor confidence in the company's strategic direction. It will also reflect the market's assessment of the risk-reward profile associated with investing in a single-asset biotech company, which is inherently higher risk due to the binary outcomes associated with clinical trial results. 02/27/2024 - 09:25 PM SARASOTA, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Oragenics, Inc. (NYSE American: OGEN) (“Oragenics” or the “Company”), a company focused on developing unique, intranasal nanoparticle pharmaceuticals for the treatment of neurological disorders, today announced the pricing of an underwritten public offering of 1,400,000 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $1.50 per share, for gross proceeds of $2.1 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses payable by the Company. In addition, the Company has granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 210,000 shares of its common stock at the public offering price, less discounts, to cover over-allotments, if any. The offering is expected to close on March 1, 2024, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to fund the continued development of ONP-002, which is a unique neurosteroid drug compound intended to treat mild traumatic brain injuries also known as concussions, and for general corporate purposes and working capital. ThinkEquity and Laidlaw & Company (UK) Ltd. are acting as joint book-running managers for the offering. The securities are being offered and sold pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-269225), including a base prospectus, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on January 13, 2023 and declared effective on January 25, 2023.

Clorox Declares Regular Quarterly Dividend of $1.20 Per Share,2024-02-28T02:06:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Clorox Company (CLX) declares a quarterly dividend of $1.20 per share, continuing its tradition of shareholder value.","Clorox Declares Regular Quarterly Dividend of $1.20 Per Share Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary Clorox Company (CLX) declares a quarterly dividend of $1.20 per share, continuing its tradition of shareholder value. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Clorox's quarterly dividend of $1.20 per share represents a key aspect of shareholder value, especially for income-focused investors. Dividends are a direct way in which a company returns profits to its shareholders and can be indicative of the company's current financial health and future prospects. In this case, the dividend payout needs to be assessed in relation to Clorox's earnings to determine the payout ratio, which will indicate the sustainability of these dividends. Additionally, the consistency and potential growth of dividend payments are often seen as a sign of a company's confidence in its ongoing profitability and financial stability.It's also important to consider the yield, calculated by annualizing the quarterly dividend and dividing by the stock's price. This figure is compared against industry averages and competing investment opportunities. A higher-than-average yield might attract investors, but could also signal that the market is requiring a higher yield due to perceived risk associated with the company. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the declaration of a dividend can have several implications. For one, it might influence the stock's attractiveness to certain investor segments, such as those seeking stable income streams. This can lead to increased demand for the stock, potentially driving up its price. However, it's also critical to analyze the dividend in the context of overall market conditions and investor sentiment. During periods of market volatility or economic downturn, a stable dividend can be particularly appealing.Furthermore, Clorox's history of regular dividend payments and annual increases could be a strong signal to the market, suggesting a reliable and shareholder-friendly management approach. This historical pattern may also be factored into the company's stock valuation by analysts and investors alike, as it could imply a predictable return on investment, barring any significant changes in company performance or macroeconomic factors. 02/27/2024 - 09:06 PM OAKLAND, Calif., Feb. 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The Clorox Company (NYSE: CLX) announced today that its board of directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $1.20 per share on the company's common stock.

Veracyte’s Decipher Prostate Test Receives Highest Evidence-Level Rating Among Molecular Tests in Updated Prostate Cancer NCCN Guidelines,2024-02-27T22:55:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Veracyte, Inc. announced that its Decipher Prostate Genomic Classifier has received a 'Level 1B' evidence rating in the 2024 NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology, making it the only gene expression test to achieve this status. The test was recognized for its prognostic value in risk stratifying patients with localized prostate cancer, with recommendations based on extensive clinical evidence.","Veracyte’s Decipher Prostate Test Receives Highest Evidence-Level Rating Among Molecular Tests in Updated Prostate Cancer NCCN Guidelines Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Veracyte, Inc. announced that its Decipher Prostate Genomic Classifier has received a 'Level 1B' evidence rating in the 2024 NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology, making it the only gene expression test to achieve this status. The test was recognized for its prognostic value in risk stratifying patients with localized prostate cancer, with recommendations based on extensive clinical evidence. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The recent classification of the Decipher Prostate Genomic Classifier as a 'Level 1B' evidence tool in the NCCN Guidelines represents a significant endorsement of its clinical utility. From an oncological perspective, this test provides a nuanced risk stratification for patients with localized prostate cancer, which is crucial for tailoring treatment plans. The 'Level 1B' rating signifies that the test is supported by high-quality evidence from randomized, phase 3 clinical trials, which are the gold standard in clinical research. This means that the test has been proven to be predictive of clinical outcomes and can influence treatment decisions post-biopsy or post-prostatectomy. Having a tool that can integrate with the NCCN's risk classification system allows for a more individualized approach to patient care. Incorporating genomic data with clinical parameters could lead to more precise prognostication and potentially better patient outcomes. The Decipher test's ability to guide treatment decisions based on tumor biology is a step forward in the practice of personalized medicine in oncology. Medical Research Analyst As a medical research analyst, the inclusion of the Decipher Prostate test in the NCCN Guidelines with a 'Level 1B' rating is indicative of its robust validation through extensive clinical evidence. The synthesis of data from thousands of patients across multiple phase 3 studies underscores the test's reliability and the reproducibility of its results. Furthermore, the unique provision of a separate table in the guidelines for treatment implications based on the Decipher score illustrates the test's integration into clinical decision-making processes. For stakeholders, this development could potentially lead to broader adoption of the test, increased insurance coverage and a more favorable reimbursement environment. The rigorous evidence supporting the test's efficacy likely will bolster Veracyte's market position in cancer diagnostics, possibly impacting its financial performance positively in the long term. Healthcare Economist The endorsement of the Decipher Prostate test by the NCCN Guidelines could have significant economic implications for the healthcare system. By stratifying patients more accurately based on their genomic profile, the test can help avoid overtreatment and the associated costs. In the short term, there may be an increase in the use of gene expression tests, which could raise immediate healthcare expenditures. However, in the long term, the potential for more personalized treatment plans may lead to cost savings by reducing unnecessary interventions and focusing resources on patients who are most likely to benefit from specific treatments. From an economic standpoint, the adoption of such precision medicine tools could lead to an overall more efficient allocation of healthcare resources. It is also likely to influence the competitive landscape of the diagnostics industry, as other companies may seek to develop or improve their tests to meet or exceed the 'Level 1B' evidence standard. 02/27/2024 - 05:55 PM SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Veracyte, Inc. (Nasdaq: VCYT), a leading cancer diagnostics company, today announced that its Decipher Prostate Genomic Classifier is the only gene expression test to receive a “Level 1B” evidence rating in the 2024 NCCN* Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) as a prognostic tool for the risk stratification of patients with localized prostate cancer. Level 1B was assigned to Decipher Prostate based on the evidence in both the post-biopsy and post-prostatectomy settings. Additionally, because of this classification, the Decipher Prostate test is the only gene expression test for which the guidelines synthesize the available published data in a separate table that summarizes treatment implications for patients based on both their NCCN risk classification and Decipher score. “We commend the NCCN panel for their evidence synthesis and expert consensus that has again designated the Decipher Prostate test as the gene expression tool for risk stratification supported by the most clinical evidence across the spectrum of the disease and has uniquely provided clinical guidance that integrates a patient’s Decipher score,” said Elai Davicioni, Ph.D., medical director of Urology for Veracyte. “These recommendations reflect the extensive clinical evidence generated in collaboration with clinical trial groups from around the world from analysis of many thousands of their patients, including those from practice-changing phase 3 studies. Ultimately, we believe that these guidelines will help our customers better use the Decipher Prostate test and tumor biology to provide optimal care for more of their patients with prostate cancer.” The new NCCN Guidelines classify the Decipher Prostate test as Level 1B according to the “Simon Criteria,” which are published criteria for assigning a level of evidence for clinical biomarkers based on the quality and quantity of evidence available. They summarize the treatment implications for patients based on their Decipher score and the published evidence from analyses of multiple randomized, phase 3 clinical trials. About the Decipher Prostate Genomic Classifier The Decipher Prostate Genomic Classifier is a 22-gene test, developed using RNA whole-transcriptome analysis and machine learning, that helps inform treatment decisions for patients with prostate cancer. The test is performed on biopsy or surgically resected samples and provides an accurate risk of developing metastasis with standard treatment. Armed with this information, the physician can better personalize their patients’ care and may recommend less-intensive options for those at lower risk or earlier, more-intensive treatment for those at higher risk of metastasis. The Decipher Prostate test has been validated in more than 75 studies involving more than 100,000 patients. About Veracyte Veracyte (Nasdaq: VCYT) is a global diagnostics company whose vision is to transform cancer care for patients all over the world. We empower clinicians with the high-value insights they need to guide and assure patients at pivotal moments in the race to diagnose and treat cancer.

(BROS) announces pricing of 8,000,000 shares of Class A common stock at $29.05 per share in a public offering by selling stockholders. The offering is expected to close soon. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Dutch Bros Inc. regarding the pricing of a significant public offering of shares by selling stockholders is a noteworthy event for current and potential investors. The offering of 8,000,000 shares at $29.05 each could indicate a liquidation event for TSG Consumer Partners, which may lead to a dilution of existing shareholders' equity. It is crucial to assess the volume of shares being sold in relation to the total shares outstanding to understand the impact on the stock's liquidity and potential pressure on the share price.Furthermore, the use of proceeds from such offerings is a key factor in evaluating the potential impact on the company's financial health. In this case, since the selling stockholders are conducting the offering, the capital raised will not directly benefit Dutch Bros' balance sheet. Instead, the transaction may reflect the exit strategy of an early investor, which could be interpreted in various ways depending on the context and timing relative to Dutch Bros’ growth trajectory and market conditions. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the public offering price set by Dutch Bros aligns with market demand and investor appetite, which is indicative of the company's perceived valuation in the current market environment. The public offering price is a critical data point, as it provides a benchmark for the company's valuation and can influence investor sentiment and future pricing of the stock. It is important to analyze how this price compares to recent trading history and sector averages to gauge market reaction.It is also essential to consider the timing of the offering and its alignment with broader market trends. For instance, if the offering occurs during a bullish market for the company’s sector, it may be received favorably. Conversely, in a bearish or volatile market, the additional shares could exacerbate downward pressure on the stock. The secondary market's reception of these shares will be a telling indicator of the company's standing among investors. 02/27/2024 - 08:00 PM GRANTS PASS, Ore.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Dutch Bros Inc.

Comparable store sales, adjusted for an additional week in 2022, rose by 2.3%. Net income for 2023 was $103.83 million, a 17.1% decrease from 2022. The company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.34 per share. Positive None. Negative Net income for fiscal year 2023 decreased by 17.1% compared to 2022. Fourth quarter net sales decreased by 7.1% compared to the previous year. Fourth quarter net income decreased by 28.9% compared to 2022. Market Research Analyst The disclosed fiscal results of Weis Markets, Inc. reflect a nuanced picture of the company's performance. While the net sales remained virtually flat year-over-year, the slight increase in comparable store sales by 2.3 percent, when adjusted for the extra week in 2022, suggests a modest organic growth in the customer base or spending. This is further reinforced by the two-year stacked comparable sales growth of 9.8 percent, indicating sustained positive momentum over a longer period.However, the decline in net income by 17.1 percent for the fiscal year and 28.9 percent for the fourth quarter, alongside a decrease in earnings per share (EPS), raises concerns about the company's profitability. This contraction could be attributed to various factors including increased operational costs, price investments to stay competitive, or a decrease in government benefits as hinted by the CEO. In the context of the retail sector, which operates on thin margins, such a dip in profitability warrants a closer examination of cost structures and efficiency measures. Financial Analyst From an investor's standpoint, the stagnation in net sales coupled with a decrease in net income suggests a potential pressure on the company's margins. It's critical to scrutinize the financial statements to identify the drivers of the reduced profitability. The earnings per share (EPS) figures, being lower in both the fiscal year and fourth quarter, could be indicative of underlying issues that may not be immediately apparent from top-line figures alone. Investors should also consider the declared quarterly cash dividend of $0.34 per share, which represents a return to shareholders but also reflects the company's confidence in its cash flow and financial stability.Furthermore, it's important to compare these financial metrics with industry benchmarks and competitors to gauge Weis Markets' performance in the broader context. The company's strategy to invest in price and technology to improve efficiencies could be a long-term play to solidify its market position, but it's essential to balance such investments with the need to maintain healthy profit margins. Retail Industry Expert In the retail industry, particularly in the grocery sector, comparable store sales are a critical metric as they indicate the health of the business excluding the impact of new store openings or closures. Weis Markets' ability to maintain positive comparable sales growth, despite the inflationary pressures and the end of enhanced government benefits, demonstrates resilience and effective operational management. The focus on price investments to remain competitive is a common strategy in the industry, especially in times of economic uncertainty where consumer spending is more sensitive to price changes.The company's investment in technology to improve efficiencies is reflective of a larger industry trend where retailers are leveraging digital transformation to streamline operations and enhance the customer experience. These investments are often essential for long-term growth but can impact short-term profitability. As such, the balance between current earnings and future potential is a key consideration for stakeholders. 02/27/2024 - 05:13 PM Company's fiscal year 2023 comparable store sales, adjusted for an additional week in 2022 and excluding fuel, increased 2.3 percent SUNBURY, Pa., Feb. 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Weis Markets, Inc.

Revenue passenger miles and available seat miles also decreased by 2.3% and 0.6% respectively. However, the load factor dropped by 2.5 percentage points. Total system passengers saw a 2.0% decline. The average stage length increased slightly. Allegiant also provided the estimated average fuel cost per gallon for January 2024 at $2.88. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported decline in passengers and revenue passenger miles (RPMs) by Allegiant Travel Company indicates a potential contraction in demand or operational efficiency. A 2.3% decrease in passengers and RPMs year over year, despite a 0.6% increase in available seat miles (ASMs), suggests that while Allegiant expanded capacity, it did not translate into proportional demand. This could be due to various factors such as economic conditions, competitive dynamics, or seasonal variations.The 2.5 percentage point decrease in load factor, a critical measure of airline efficiency that indicates how well an airline fills seats and generates fare revenue, points to underutilization of capacity. This metric is particularly important for investors as it directly impacts revenue and profitability. A consistent decline might prompt strategic reassessments or operational adjustments.It's also notable that the average stage length, the average non-stop distance flown per departure, increased slightly. This could imply a strategic shift in route dynamics or an operational optimization. However, without further context on route profitability or cost implications, it's challenging to assess the full impact of this change. Financial Analyst The preliminary financial results indicating an estimated average fuel cost per gallon of $2.88 are a vital input for cost management analysis. Fuel expenses are one of the largest variable costs for airlines and can significantly impact margins. Investors should monitor how these costs trend in relation to oil market dynamics and hedge positions the company may hold. Comparing this cost to industry averages and competitors can provide insights into Allegiant's cost efficiency and pricing power.Given the reported traffic results and fuel costs, the company's short-term profitability could be under pressure. Investors would benefit from a deeper dive into Allegiant's revenue management strategies, such as how it adjusts pricing and capacity to optimize load factors and revenue in response to demand fluctuations. Additionally, understanding the company's cost structure beyond fuel, such as labor and maintenance, is crucial for a comprehensive financial health assessment. Aviation Industry Analyst Allegiant's performance metrics, particularly the load factor and passenger traffic decline, must be evaluated in the context of the broader aviation industry. Factors such as seasonal travel patterns, regional economic conditions and competitive pressures from other airlines could all influence these results. For instance, a decrease in load factor may be less concerning if it mirrors a seasonal industry-wide trend.Moreover, the company's focus on serving small-to-medium cities with all-nonstop flights is a niche strategy that can be both a strength and a vulnerability. The impact of these results on the company's stock will depend on how these trends compare to industry benchmarks and how investors perceive Allegiant's ability to navigate market challenges relative to its peers.Lastly, the increase in average stage length could indicate a strategic adjustment to serve longer routes, which may affect cost per available seat mile (CASM) and ultimately, profitability. It's essential to track how these operational changes align with broader industry shifts and consumer travel preferences. 02/27/2024 - 07:00 PM LAS VEGAS, Feb. 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Allegiant Travel Company (NASDAQ: ALGT) today reported preliminary passenger traffic results for January 2024.

The filings provide insights into the company's financial position, operations, and projects. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The disclosure of annual financial statements, along with management's discussion and analysis (MD&A), is a critical event for stakeholders, particularly investors. A comprehensive review of these documents reveals the company's fiscal health, operational efficiency and strategic direction. The MD&A section, in particular, offers insights into the company's performance, providing context and explanations for the financial results, which can be pivotal in assessing the company's future profitability and growth potential.When evaluating GoldMining Inc.'s financial position, attention should be paid to key metrics such as revenue growth, profit margins and cash flow. These indicators can signal the company's ability to fund its operations and projects, service debt and provide returns to shareholders. The mining sector often requires significant capital investment and the ability to generate positive cash flow is essential for sustaining operations and funding exploration and development activities.Furthermore, the reported financials should be compared against industry benchmarks and previous fiscal years to gauge performance trends. Any substantial deviations could indicate underlying issues or exceptional performance that may influence investor confidence and the company's stock price. Market Research Analyst GoldMining Inc.'s operational updates within the annual filings are of particular interest to stakeholders, as they provide a forward-looking view of the company's project pipeline and exploration endeavors. In the mining industry, the value of a company is heavily influenced by its reserves and resources. Thus, updates on exploration results, reserve estimates and project development stages are crucial for evaluating the company's long-term prospects.Additionally, the geopolitical and economic context in which GoldMining Inc. operates can significantly impact its operations. Factors such as regulatory changes, commodity prices and currency fluctuations are vital to consider when analyzing the company's potential performance. The market's perception of these factors could lead to volatility in the company's stock price.It is also important to consider the company's strategic initiatives and how they align with market demands and the sustainability trends that are increasingly prevalent in the mining sector. Initiatives related to environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors can affect investor sentiment and may play a role in the company's access to capital. Economist From an economic perspective, the performance of GoldMining Inc. must be contextualized within the broader commodity market dynamics. Gold, as a commodity, is often seen as a safe-haven asset during times of economic uncertainty. Therefore, the company's financial position and project development prospects could be influenced by macroeconomic indicators and investor sentiment towards gold as an asset class.The demand for gold, both for industrial use and as an investment, can be affected by global economic growth, inflation rates and currency values. These factors can lead to fluctuations in gold prices, which directly impact the revenue potential for GoldMining Inc. It is essential to analyze the company's cost structure and operational efficiency in relation to gold price trends to understand its resilience to price volatility.Moreover, the company's ability to adapt to economic cycles and its hedging strategies against price fluctuations are important considerations for its long-term sustainability and attractiveness to investors seeking both growth and stability in their portfolios. 02/27/2024 - 06:12 PM VANCOUVER, BC, Feb. 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - GoldMining Inc.

The company has 60 days to submit a plan to regain compliance, with a potential extension until August 19, 2024. The delay was caused by higher estimated research and development expenses, leading to a longer cash runway. Positive None. Negative The delay in filing the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q could impact investor confidence and raise concerns about the company's financial management. The potential need to appeal the decision to a Nasdaq Hearings Panel could further prolong the compliance process, adding uncertainty for shareholders. Financial Analyst The notification of delinquency received by Veru Inc. from Nasdaq for failing to file its quarterly report in a timely manner is a significant concern for shareholders and potential investors. This non-compliance can affect investor confidence as it puts the company's transparency and governance practices into question. The delay in filing, as attributed to discrepancies in estimated research and development expenses, suggests potential internal control weaknesses that could have broader implications on financial reporting quality.From a financial perspective, the reassurance that cash on hand may last longer than previously expected could mitigate some immediate liquidity concerns. However, the underlying issue of financial reporting accuracy remains a critical factor in assessing the company's operational efficiency and financial health. Investors would benefit from a thorough investigation into the cause of the discrepancy and measures taken to prevent future occurrences.It is also important to consider the potential consequences of non-compliance with Nasdaq's listing rules. If Veru Inc. is unable to present a satisfactory plan to regain compliance, or if such a plan is not accepted by Nasdaq, the risk of delisting could have a material impact on the company's stock price and liquidity. Delisting typically results in reduced market visibility and investor interest, which could adversely affect the stock's performance. Legal Expert The legal implications of Veru Inc.'s failure to file the required Form 10-Q are non-trivial. Nasdaq's Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) is designed to ensure that all market participants have access to timely and accurate financial information, which is essential for maintaining fair and efficient markets. The Notice serves as a formal warning and initiates a compliance process that the company must navigate carefully.Veru Inc. has a 60-day window to submit a compliance plan and if accepted, a maximum of 180 days to correct the filing delinquency. This period allows the company to rectify the issue without immediate drastic consequences, but it is a time-sensitive situation that requires prompt and decisive action. The potential for an appeal to a Nasdaq Hearings Panel introduces additional layers of complexity and uncertainty, which could extend the timeframe and resource allocation for resolution.In terms of governance, this event highlights the importance of robust internal controls and compliance mechanisms. The company's ability to address the identified weaknesses and enhance its reporting processes will be critical in regaining stakeholder trust and ensuring regulatory adherence. The legal team's role in guiding the company through this process, while minimizing risk and exposure, is paramount. Market Research Analyst The market's reaction to Veru Inc.'s announcement will likely be influenced by several factors, including the company's market position, the perceived severity of the filing delay and the response strategy outlined by management. In the biopharmaceutical sector, where investor sentiment is particularly sensitive to regulatory compliance and financial stability, such news can have an amplified effect on stock performance.While the company's statement that cash on hand will last longer than initially projected may provide some reassurance, investors will be closely monitoring the situation for further developments. The market will also assess the company's ability to adhere to its stated plan to regain compliance and the efficacy of any remedial measures implemented. A swift and transparent resolution could help stabilize the stock, whereas prolonged uncertainty or additional negative disclosures could exacerbate market concerns.Additionally, the impact on Veru Inc.'s research and development pipeline, particularly for its innovative medicines in oncology and ARDS, should be considered. Delays in financial reporting can distract from core business activities and potentially delay critical R&D milestones, which in turn could influence the company's competitive edge and future revenue streams. 02/27/2024 - 07:15 PM MIAMI, FL, Feb. 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Veru Inc. (NASDAQ: VERU), a late clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative medicines for preserving muscle for higher quality weight loss, oncology, and viral induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), today announced that it received a delinquency notification letter (“Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications staff of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) on February 21, 2024 due to the Company’s non-compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) as a result of the Company’s failure to timely file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023 (the “Form 10-Q”). Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The Notice states that the Company has 60 calendar days to submit to Nasdaq a plan to regain compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules. If Nasdaq accepts the Company’s plan, then Nasdaq may grant the Company up to 180 calendar days from the prescribed due date for filing the Form 10-Q or until August 19, 2024, to regain compliance. If Nasdaq does not accept the Company’s plan, then the Company will have the opportunity to appeal that decision to a Nasdaq Hearings Panel. As previously disclosed, the Company’s estimated research and development expenses recorded were higher than the actual expenses that were incurred, leading to the Company’s failure to file the Form 10-Q on a timely basis. The net result of these research and development estimated expenses being recorded at too high of an amount is that the Company’s cash on hand is expected to last longer than initially stated. The Company continues to work diligently to complete the Form 10-Q and plans to file the Form 10-Q as promptly as possible to regain compliance with the Listing Rule. This announcement is made in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(b). About Veru Inc.Veru is a late clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel medicines for the treatment of metabolic diseases, oncology, and ARDS. The Company’s drug development program includes two late-stage novel small molecules, enobosarm and sabizabulin. Enobosarm, a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM), is being developed for two indications: (i) Phase 2b clinical study of enobosarm as a treatment to augment fat loss and to prevent muscle loss in sarcopenic obese or overweight elderly patients receiving a GLP-1 RA who are at-risk for developing muscle atrophy and muscle weakness and (ii) subject to the availability of sufficient funding, Phase 3 ENABLAR-2 clinical trial of enobosarm for the treatment of androgen receptor positive (AR+), estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-) metastatic breast cancer in the 2nd line setting. Sabizabulin, a microtubule disruptor, is being developed as a Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of hospitalized patients with viral-induced ARDS. The Company does not intend to undertake further development of sabizabulin for the treatment of viral-induced ARDS until we obtain funding from government grants, pharmaceutical company partnerships, or other similar third-party external sources.

Dole plc Announces Sale of Progressive Produce to Arable Capital,2024-02-27T23:09:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,Dole plc (NYSE: DOLE) has agreed to sell its 65% equity stake in Progressive Produce LLC to PTF Holdings for $120.25 million. Progressive Produce is a leading produce company with annual sales over $400 million. The sale is expected to close in March 2024.,"Dole plc Announces Sale of Progressive Produce to Arable Capital Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Dole plc (NYSE: DOLE) has agreed to sell its 65% equity stake in Progressive Produce LLC to PTF Holdings for $120.25 million. Progressive Produce is a leading produce company with annual sales over $400 million. The sale is expected to close in March 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The divestiture of a 65% equity stake in Progressive Produce by Dole to PTF Holdings for $120.25 million represents a strategic realignment of Dole's business portfolio. This transaction is particularly significant as it involves a substantial cash inflow, which Dole plans to allocate primarily towards debt reduction. The financial implications for Dole include an immediate liquidity boost and an improved debt-to-equity ratio, enhancing the company's financial health and potentially its credit rating. Furthermore, the sale indicates a sharpening of Dole's focus on its core operations, which may lead to improved operational efficiencies and profitability in the long run.From an industry perspective, the transaction underscores the ongoing consolidation trend within the agricultural sector, where companies are seeking to optimize their asset base in response to competitive pressures. For stakeholders, the immediate benefit lies in Dole's strengthened balance sheet, while the long-term impact could manifest in more streamlined operations and strategic growth initiatives. However, divestitures also carry risks, such as the loss of revenue streams and market share, which must be managed by ensuring that remaining business segments can compensate for this divestment. Market Research Analyst Examining the sale of Progressive Produce to Pacific Trellis Fruit's parent company from a market dynamics standpoint, the deal reflects Dole's intention to refine its market strategy and concentrate on areas with the highest growth potential. Progressive Produce, with its substantial annual sales, has been a significant player in the produce sector. Its integration with Pacific Trellis Fruit could create a more formidable entity in the market, with potential economies of scale and an expanded distribution network.For the broader produce industry, this deal may signal an increased appetite for mergers and acquisitions, as companies strive to achieve scale and diversify product offerings. The retention of Progressive Produce's management team and their ownership stake is a strategic move to maintain operational continuity and leverage existing expertise. Stakeholders should monitor how this consolidation affects market competition and whether it leads to enhanced product offerings and services. Economist From an economic standpoint, the divestiture of Progressive Produce reflects a reallocation of capital within Dole's operations, which can be seen as a move towards optimizing the company's capital structure. By reducing debt, Dole is likely aiming to decrease its cost of capital, which can enhance shareholder value over time. This decision may be influenced by the current economic climate, where interest rates and financial market volatility play crucial roles in corporate finance strategies.The sale's timing, expected to close in March 2024, suggests a deliberate approach to executing the transaction, potentially aiming to capitalize on favorable market conditions or tax considerations. The impact on the labor market and regional economy, particularly in Los Angeles where Progressive Produce is based, will depend on the new ownership's operational decisions. If the transition leads to increased efficiency and growth, it could have a positive economic effect locally and within the agricultural sector. 02/27/2024 - 06:09 PM DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Dole plc (NYSE: DOLE) (“Dole” or the “Group”) has today announced that it has reached an agreement to sell its 65% equity stake in Progressive Produce LLC (“Progressive Produce” or the “Company”) to PTF Holdings, LLC (“PTF Holdings”), the parent company of Pacific Trellis Fruit, LLC (“Pacific Trellis Fruit”).

Progressive Produce is a subsidiary of Dole plc and is part of the Diversified Fresh Produce – Americas and Rest of World reporting segment. Post the completion of this transaction, the existing management team of Progressive Produce will remain with the enlarged business of Progressive Produce and Pacific Trellis Fruit and retain an ownership stake.

Net proceeds from the sale received by Dole are currently expected to be used primarily for debt reduction.

Negative The Company will not receive any proceeds from the Offering, which might indicate a lack of direct financial benefit for the company from this transaction. Financial Analyst The launch of a secondary offering of 25,000,000 shares by existing stockholders of Sotera Health Company signifies a liquidity event for the selling shareholders, which includes major affiliates and members of the company's management and board. This move will not dilute current shareholders since the company isn't issuing new shares, but it could impact the stock's price due to the increased availability of shares in the market.An important aspect is the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares, which can serve as an indicator of the offering's reception and potential over-allotment. The involvement of top-tier financial institutions as joint lead book-running managers may provide a level of confidence to potential investors regarding the handling of the offering.Investors should monitor the post-offering share price for potential volatility. The fact that the company is not receiving proceeds may raise questions about its capital requirements and future growth financing strategies. Market Research Analyst Secondary offerings are often a reflection of a company's maturity and the desire of early investors to realize gains. The profile of the selling stockholders, including prominent private equity firms, suggests a strategic exit or portfolio rebalancing, which could influence investor sentiment.Market dynamics surrounding such offerings can provide insights into investor appetite for the company's stock and the broader sector's health. The immediate effect on the company's market capitalization will be minimal, but the long-term impact on stock performance depends on market perception and the company's operational performance following the offering.Investors should consider the secondary offering's timing and context within the industry, as it could signal broader trends or shifts in the healthcare and technology services sector.

The dividend will be paid on March 19, 2024, to shareholders of record as of March 8, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Stanley Black & Decker's quarterly cash dividend payment is a testament to the company's financial stability and commitment to returning value to shareholders. The dividend of $0.81 per common share, while seemingly modest, is a crucial indicator of the company's consistent cash flow and its ability to maintain a steady stream of income for investors. This consistency is particularly noteworthy as it contributes to the company's reputation on the New York Stock Exchange as a reliable dividend payer.Dividends are often seen as a reflection of a company's confidence in its current financial health and future prospects. The continuation of such payments can reassure investors, especially during volatile market conditions. However, it is important for investors to consider the dividend yield in relation to the stock price, as well as the payout ratio, which indicates the proportion of earnings being returned to shareholders as dividends. A payout ratio that is too high could signal that the company is not reinvesting enough into its own growth. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Stanley Black & Decker's record as the longest consecutive dividend payer among industrial companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange underscores its market position and could influence investor sentiment. Dividend consistency and longevity can be a draw for income-focused investors, particularly in sectors where such reliability is prized.However, it is also critical to assess the dividend in the context of the overall industry and the company's financial performance relative to its peers. Factors such as market share, innovation and operational efficiency play a significant role in sustaining dividend payments over the long term. Investors should also be aware of the company's growth initiatives and capital allocation strategies, which can affect future dividend sustainability and growth. 02/27/2024 - 05:16 PM NEW BRITAIN, Conn., Feb. 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE: SWK), a worldwide leader in Tools and Outdoor, announced today that its Board of Directors approved a regular first quarter cash dividend of $0.81 per common share.

Carbon TerraVault Provides 2023 Update,2024-02-27T22:14:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"California Resources Corporation (CRC) through its subsidiary Carbon TerraVault provided an update on its 2023 operations, highlighting advancements in carbon management projects, EPA permits, DOE funding, and a pending merger with Aera Energy. Key achievements include securing new Carbon Dioxide Management Agreements, receiving DOE grants, submitting EPA permits for CO2 storage, and expanding its workforce. The company aims to accelerate decarbonization efforts in California through strategic partnerships and project developments.","Carbon TerraVault Provides 2023 Update Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary California Resources Corporation (CRC) through its subsidiary Carbon TerraVault provided an update on its 2023 operations, highlighting advancements in carbon management projects, EPA permits, DOE funding, and a pending merger with Aera Energy. Key achievements include securing new Carbon Dioxide Management Agreements, receiving DOE grants, submitting EPA permits for CO2 storage, and expanding its workforce. The company aims to accelerate decarbonization efforts in California through strategic partnerships and project developments. Positive None. Negative None. Environmental Policy Analyst Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is an essential component in the strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The update from Carbon TerraVault (CTV) signifies a substantial progression in CCS infrastructure within California. The issuance of the first draft Class VI permits by the EPA for underground CO2 injection is a pivotal regulatory step, indicating a move towards operational readiness. This development is likely to have a positive impact on the local environment by potentially reducing CO2 emissions in the area.Furthermore, the Department of Energy's (DOE) funding of approximately $12 million for the California Direct Air Capture (DAC) Hub demonstrates federal support for innovative carbon management solutions. This funding, along with the two DOE research and development grants totaling $18 million, suggests a strong government commitment to supporting CCS technologies, which could lead to increased investor confidence in the sector.The pending merger with Aera Energy, which will expand CRC's carbon management capabilities, is another significant event. This strategic move could potentially double CRC's CO2 injection rate capacity, creating a 'decarbonization hub' and positioning the company as a leader in the field of carbon management in California. The merger's success hinges on regulatory approvals and CRC shareholder agreement, which introduces a level of uncertainty that stakeholders should monitor closely. Energy Market Analyst The operational updates from CTV indicate a growing market for CCS projects, which are becoming increasingly important in the energy sector's transition towards a low-carbon future. The announcement of new Carbon Dioxide Management Agreements (CDMAs) and the acquisition of additional pore space for CO2 storage highlight CTV's proactive approach in securing its position in the carbon management market. The expected sequestration of 100 thousand metric tons per year of CO2 by the end of 2025 at CRC's Elk Hills plant is a clear indicator of the company's commitment to measurable environmental targets.The strategic merger with Aera Energy is poised to enhance CTV's market position by expanding its storage capacity and operational scale. This move could be seen as a competitive advantage, potentially attracting more greenfield project capital and partnerships. The financial implications for CRC and its shareholders could be significant, as the success of these projects may lead to long-term revenue streams from carbon management services.However, the energy market should also consider the risks associated with the development of CCS technologies, such as high capital costs, technological challenges and the regulatory environment that can affect the pace of project development and profitability. Financial Analyst The financial implications of CTV's operational updates are multifaceted. The pursuit of carbon capture and sequestration projects can be capital-intensive, but the federal funding received suggests a reduction in financial risk for CRC. The DOE's financial support could offset a significant portion of the project costs, improving the return on investment for these initiatives.Moreover, the announcement of storage-only CDMAs, which have already secured a capacity of 760 KMTPA, indicates a growing revenue stream for CTV. This is further bolstered by the total CO2 injection rate capacity under CDMAs or agreements reaching 1.1 MMTPA. These agreements are likely to provide a steady income and could improve CRC's financial stability and attractiveness to investors.From a shareholder perspective, the pending merger with Aera Energy and the potential to nearly double injection rate capacity could be a game-changer for CRC, potentially increasing the company's market valuation. However, the closure of the merger is contingent on regulatory and shareholder approvals, which adds a layer of uncertainty to the financial forecast.Stakeholders should also consider the long-term benefits of investing in CCS, as it aligns with global decarbonization goals and may lead to preferential regulatory treatment or subsidies in the future. Nevertheless, the capital-intensive nature of these projects and the evolving regulatory landscape necessitate a careful assessment of the associated financial risks and rewards. 02/27/2024 - 05:14 PM LONG BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Carbon TerraVault (CTV) today provided an update on its 2023 operations. California Resources Corporation (NYSE: CRC) conducts its carbon management business through Carbon TerraVault which pursues carbon capture and sequestration projects that are directly sited or within close proximity to significant sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in California. “During 2023, our team meaningfully advanced the expansion of our carbon management business by announcing new Carbon Dioxide Management Agreements (CDMAs)1, submitting new permits to the EPA and attracting new greenfield project capital to California,” said Francisco Leon, CRC’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “The most recent release of California’s first draft Class VI permits for the 26R reservoir and the Department of Energy (DOE) development grant awarded to the California Direct Air Capture (DAC) Hub reflects our continued commitment to carbon management solutions for hard-to-abate industries and decarbonization technologies in the Golden State. Finally, the recently announced agreement to combine with Aera Energy will enhance our carbon management business, providing greater scale with which to accelerate CRC’s efforts to decarbonize California.” 2023 Highlights The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released California’s first draft Class VI well permits for underground CO2 injection at the 26R storage vault, located at the proposed Clean Energy Park at Elk Hills Field in Kern County California DAC Hub, led by CTV's subsidiary CTV Direct, LLC, was selected to receive approximately $12 million in DOE funding for a regional initiative focused on the development of California’s first full-scale DAC plus storage (DAC+S) network Submitted 51 million metric tons (MMT) of Class VI permits to EPA for CTV IV and CTV V storage reservoirs in Northern California. In total, CTV has submitted permits for 191 MMT of CO2 storage with an estimated injection rate of 5.3 MMT per year Announced CTV's first capture-to-storage project at CRC's Elk Hills cryogenic gas plant, located in Kern County. This project is expected to sequester 100 thousand metric tons per year (KMTPA) of CO2 in the 26R reservoir by year-end 2025 Signed 760 KMTPA of storage-only CDMAs1 with several greenfield project developers, helping to decarbonize California’s energy value chain CTV's total CO2 injection rate capacity under CDMAs1 or agreements is 1.1 million metric tons per year (MMTPA) Awarded two DOE research and development grants under the CarbonSAFE initiative for a total of approximately $18 million Built the carbon management business to approximately 50 full-time equivalent employees, including many technical experts with decades of subsurface experience in California who transferred from CRC Acquired additional pore space in strategic locations that build upon CRC’s leading mineral, surface, and seismic data position in California EPA Class VI Permitting and Kern County Draft Environmental Impact Review (EIR) Update In December 2023, EPA released draft Class VI permits for CTV's “CTV I – 26R” carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) project located at CRC's Elk Hills field in Kern County. These are the first draft permits released by EPA in California. In December 2023, Kern County also released the draft EIR prepared in connection with the conditional use permit application for CTV I – 26R. The draft Class VI permits and draft EIR are subject to public review and comment. CTV anticipates that EPA and Kern County will deliver their final decisions on the permits in the second half of 2024. DOE Carbon Storage Validation and Testing Funding for Carbon TerraVault Projects CRC’s carbon management business continues to attract federal funding for research and development and deployment of carbon capture technologies to help mitigate the impacts of climate change and benefit communities across California by improving air quality and creating new energy transition employment opportunities. In November 2023, two projects were awarded DOE funding under the CarbonSAFE initiative for a total of approximately $18 million (80% of the total project cost). These awards are expected to de-risk carbon storage via a newly drilled data well. CTV's share of the total project cost is approximately 20%. These research projects will be performed over the next 24 months. For further information, please see: https://www.energy.gov/fecm/project-selections-foa-2711-carbon-storage-validation-and-testing-round-2 CalCapture Update CalCapture is a post-combustion CCS project that is designed to capture CO2 from the Elk Hills Power Plant, a 550-megawatt (MW) natural gas, combined-cycle power plant, located in Kern County, California, and inject that CO2 underground for permanent sequestration in a co-located underground storage reservoir. To date, two front-end engineering and design (FEED) studies have been completed. CRC continues to evaluate the technical and economic aspects of this project such as engineering designs, energy optimizations, capital requirements, existing regulatory framework and availability of government assistance for this and other low CO2 stream concentration projects. CRC expects to provide additional commentary on the progress of this project in 2025. Pending Aera Merger On February 7, 2024, CRC entered into a definitive merger agreement (Merger Agreement) to combine with Aera Energy, LLC (Aera) in an all-stock transaction with an effective date of January 1, 2024. The merger will expand CRC’s leading carbon management business through the addition of surface acreage and subsurface rights, and significant new CO2 pore space to enable future CCS development. As a result of this combination, CRC will obtain a pending EPA Class VI permit application for 27 MMT of storage capacity in the Belridge Field. CRC also expects to submit an additional Class VI permit for approximately 27 MMT of storage at the Coles Levee Field. The Company will have the potential to nearly double its injection rate capacity in the San Joaquin Basin, creating a premier “decarbonization hub” for CO2 storage.

Flushing Financial Corporation Declares Quarterly Dividend of $0.22 per Share,2024-02-27T22:00:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Flushing Financial Corporation (Nasdaq: FFIC) declares a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per common share, marking the 111th consecutive quarterly dividend. The company focuses on increasing NIM, maintaining credit discipline, preserving liquidity and capital, and reducing expenses in 2024. Flushing Bank, the FDIC insured commercial bank, offers a range of banking services in New York since 1929.","Flushing Financial Corporation Declares Quarterly Dividend of $0.22 per Share Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary Flushing Financial Corporation (Nasdaq: FFIC) declares a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per common share, marking the 111th consecutive quarterly dividend. The company focuses on increasing NIM, maintaining credit discipline, preserving liquidity and capital, and reducing expenses in 2024. Flushing Bank, the FDIC insured commercial bank, offers a range of banking services in New York since 1929. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of a quarterly dividend by Flushing Financial Corporation represents a tangible return on investment for shareholders and signals the company's financial health and stability. The declared dividend of $0.22 per common share is a critical metric for investors, as it reflects the company's ability to generate cash flow and its commitment to returning value to shareholders. The historical consistency of paying dividends since 1996, including the 111th consecutive quarterly dividend, reinforces investor confidence and can have a stabilizing effect on the stock price.Furthermore, the strategic focus areas outlined for 2024, such as increasing the Net Interest Margin (NIM) and maintaining credit discipline, are crucial for enhancing profitability and managing risk. By prioritizing strong liquidity and capital preservation, the company positions itself to withstand economic fluctuations and invest in growth opportunities. The emphasis on bending the expense curve indicates a proactive approach to cost management, which can lead to improved margins and shareholder value over time. Market Research Analyst Flushing Financial Corporation's emphasis on serving multicultural markets and providing a range of banking services positions it favorably in the competitive financial services landscape. The company's ability to communicate in various languages and its presence in the New York City metropolitan area cater to a diverse customer base, which can drive deposit growth and loan originations. Additionally, the bank's involvement in real estate lending, a sector that often reflects broader economic trends, suggests a significant influence on its financial performance.The online banking divisions, iGObanking® and BankPurely®, indicate an adaptation to digital banking trends and an expansion of the bank's reach beyond its physical branches. This strategic move can attract tech-savvy consumers and provide a scalable platform for growth. As the banking industry continues to evolve with technology, Flushing Bank's digital initiatives will likely be a critical factor in its ability to compete and capture market share. Economist Flushing Financial Corporation's dividend announcement and strategic focus for 2024 should be evaluated within the context of the broader economic environment. The company's goal to increase the NIM is particularly relevant in an interest rate-sensitive industry, where the NIM is a key determinant of a bank's profitability. Flushing's ability to manage this metric amidst potential interest rate changes by the Federal Reserve will be a significant factor in its financial performance.Maintaining credit discipline is indicative of a cautious approach to lending, which is prudent in periods of economic uncertainty. This strategy could mitigate the risk of loan defaults and protect the bank's balance sheet. The commitment to preserving liquidity and capital aligns with regulatory expectations and provides a buffer against potential market shocks. These strategic initiatives reflect a forward-looking approach that balances growth with risk management, which is essential for long-term financial stability and resilience. 02/27/2024 - 05:00 PM UNIONDALE, NY / ACCESSWIRE / February 27, 2024 / Flushing Financial Corporation (the ""Company"") (Nasdaq:FFIC), the parent holding company for Flushing Bank (the ""Bank""), today announced that the Board of Directors (the ""Board"") declared a quarterly dividend on its common stock of $0.22 per common share, payable on March 22, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 11, 2024.John R.

The company exceeded production guidance, returned $733 million to shareholders, acquired Permian assets, and closed the sale of Bakken assets. In Q4 2023, they generated net earnings of $856 million and reduced total debt by $426 million. The 2024 outlook includes a capital program of $2.2 to $2.4 billion. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported net earnings of $2.1 billion and cash from operating activities of $4.2 billion by Ovintiv Inc. indicate a strong performance for the fiscal year 2023. The company's ability to exceed production guidance while maintaining capital expenditures at $2.7 billion reflects a robust operational strategy. The Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow of $1.2 billion is particularly significant as it underscores the company's efficiency in managing its finances post-investment activities.Investors should note the shareholder returns of $733 million through dividends and buybacks, which could be seen as a commitment to returning value. The strategic acquisition in the Permian Basin could enable future growth and operational synergies, while the sale of Bakken assets suggests a portfolio optimization strategy. The inclusion in the S&P 400 index may increase the stock's visibility and could lead to a broader investor base.For 2024, the projected capital program and expected production volumes indicate a continued focus on capital efficiency. However, investors should monitor commodity prices, as they can significantly impact projected revenues and profitability in the energy sector. Market Research Analyst Ovintiv's performance, particularly in the context of the energy sector, appears to be strong. The company's operational execution has led to exceeding production targets, which is critical in an industry where production volumes directly correlate with revenue potential. The company's strategic moves, such as the acquisition of Permian assets and the exit from the Bakken play, are likely to reposition it favorably within the competitive landscape.The announcement for 2024 suggests a focus on capital discipline and efficiency, aiming to produce more with less. This could resonate well with investors who are increasingly looking for companies that can operate effectively in volatile market conditions. The company's ability to reduce total debt by $426 million further strengthens its financial stability and may positively influence its stock valuation. Energy Sector Analyst From an industry perspective, Ovintiv's operational results are impressive, particularly the average total volumes of 566 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/d). This level of production, combined with the company's cost management, places it in a strong competitive position within the oil and gas sector. The integration of the Permian assets is a strategic move that capitalizes on the region's prolific production rates and may offer long-term growth opportunities.The forward-looking statements for 2024 with the capital program set at $2.2 to $2.4 billion to deliver 545 to 575 MBOE/d suggest a slight decrease in production volumes but increased efficiency. Stakeholders should consider the potential impact of geopolitical events and environmental policies on the sector, as these can influence operational costs and market demand. 02/27/2024 - 05:01 PM Strong 2023 Operational Execution; Enhanced Capital Efficiency Expected in 2024 Highlights: Full Year 2023 Generated net earnings of $2.1 billion, cash from operating activities of $4.2 billion, Non-GAAP Cash Flow of $3.9 billion and Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow of $1.2 billion after capital expenditures of $2.7 billionExceeded high end of full year production guidance on every product with average total volumes of 566 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (""MBOE/d""), including 202 thousand barrels per day (""Mbbls/d"") of oil and condensate, 90 Mbbls/d of other NGLs (C2 to C4) and 1,642 million cubic feet per day (""MMcf/d"") of natural gasReturned $733 million to shareholders through the combination of base dividend payments and share buybacksAcquired and seamlessly integrated high-quality Permian assets comprising approximately 65,000 net acres of largely undeveloped land directly adjacent to the Company's existing Permian operationsClosed the sale of the Company's Bakken assets, representing Ovintiv's exit from the playAnnounced the Company's inclusion on the S&P 400 index effective June 20, 2023Fourth Quarter 2023 Generated fourth quarter net earnings of $856 million, cash from operating activities of $1.4 billion, Non-GAAP Cash Flow of $1.2 billion and Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow of $577 million after capital expenditures of $660 millionDelivered average quarterly production volumes of 605 MBOE/d, including 240 Mbbls/d of oil and condensate, 91 Mbbls/d of other NGLs and 1,645 MMcf/d of natural gas; all exceeding the high end of Company guidanceReduced total debt by $426 million2024 Outlook Announced 2024 capital program of approximately $2.2 to $2.4 billion, which is expected to deliver total production volumes of 545 to 575 MBOE/d, including oil and condensate volumes of 202 to 208 Mbbls/dDENVER, Feb. 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Ovintiv Inc.

NI 51-101 Exemption The Canadian securities regulatory authorities have issued a decision document (the ""Decision"") granting Ovintiv exemptive relief from the requirements contained in Canada's National Instrument 51-101 Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities (""NI 51-101""). As a result of the Decision, and provided that certain conditions set out in the Decision are met on an on-going basis, Ovintiv will not be required to comply with the Canadian requirements of NI 51-101 and the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook. The Decision permits Ovintiv to provide disclosure in respect of its oil and gas activities in the form permitted by, and in accordance with, the legal requirements imposed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""), the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules of the NYSE.

NOTE 1: Non-GAAP Measures Certain measures in this news release do not have any standardized meaning as prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, are considered non-GAAP measures. These measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies and should not be viewed as a substitute for measures reported under U.S. GAAP. These measures are commonly used in the oil and gas industry and/or by Ovintiv to provide shareholders and potential investors with additional information regarding the Company's liquidity and its ability to generate funds to finance its operations. For additional information regarding non-GAAP measures, see the Company's website. This news release contains references to non-GAAP measures as follows: Non-GAAP Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure defined as cash from (used in) operating activities excluding net change in other assets and liabilities, and net change in non-cash working capital.Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure defined as Non-GAAP Cash Flow in excess of capital expenditures, excluding net acquisitions and divestitures. Forecasted Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow represents forecasted Non-GAAP Cash Flow based on $75 WTI and $2.50 NYMEX and utilizing the midpoint of production guidance. Due to its forward-looking nature, management cannot reliably predict certain of the necessary components of the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures, such as changes in operating assets and liabilities. Accordingly, Ovintiv is unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of such forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure. Amounts excluded from this non-GAAP measure in future periods could be significant.Non-GAAP Adjusted Earnings is a non-GAAP measure defined as net earnings (loss) excluding non-cash items that the Company's management believes reduces the comparability of the Company's financial performance between periods. These items may include, but are not limited to, unrealized gains/losses on risk management, impairments, non-operating foreign exchange gains/losses, and gains/losses on divestitures. Income taxes includes adjustments to normalize the effect of income taxes calculated using the estimated annual effective income tax rate. In addition, any valuation allowances are excluded in the calculation of income taxes.Adjusted EBITDA, Debt to EBITDA and Debt to Adjusted EBITDA (Leverage Target/Ratio) are non-GAAP measures. EBITDA is defined as trailing 12-month net earnings (loss) before income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, and interest. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA adjusted for impairments, accretion of asset retirement obligation, unrealized gains/losses on risk management, foreign exchange gains/losses, gains/losses on divestitures and other gains/losses. Debt to EBITDA is calculated as long-term debt, including the current portion, divided by EBITDA. Debt to Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as long-term debt, including the current portion, divided by Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA, Debt to EBITDA and Debt to Adjusted EBITDA are a non-GAAP measures monitored by management as indicators of the Company's overall financial strength.ADVISORY REGARDING OIL AND GAS INFORMATION – The conversion of natural gas volumes to barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) is on the basis of six thousand cubic feet to one barrel. BOE is based on a generic energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent economic value equivalency at the wellhead. Readers are cautioned that BOE may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation.

The total consideration amounts to €21,871,948 ($C32,066,462). IAMGOLD now owns 100% of EURO Ressources S.A. shares after the transaction, leading to the delisting of EURO Shares from the Euronext Paris stock exchange. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The acquisition of EURO Ressources S.A. by IAMGOLD Corporation represents a strategic consolidation within the mining sector. The financial outlay of approximately €21.87 million underscores IAMGOLD's commitment to expanding its asset portfolio. This transaction may potentially lead to operational synergies, as IAMGOLD can streamline processes and reduce costs by integrating EURO's assets. From an investor's perspective, the key points of interest will be the impact of the acquisition on IAMGOLD's earnings per share, the return on investment and how the consolidation affects the company's market position relative to its competitors.Furthermore, the delisting of EURO Shares from the Euronext Paris and the subsequent cessation of EURO as a reporting issuer could imply a reduction in administrative overhead and a more focused strategic direction. However, it is crucial to monitor IAMGOLD's post-acquisition integration process as it could pose risks if not managed efficiently, potentially affecting the company's stock performance in the short to medium term. Market Research Analyst The mining industry is often characterized by the need for large capital investments and economies of scale. IAMGOLD's acquisition of the remaining 10% of EURO Ressources S.A. shares it did not already own allows for complete control over EURO's resources, which could lead to increased market power and potentially higher barriers to entry for competitors. This acquisition might also signal a bullish outlook on the commodities EURO is involved with, suggesting IAMGOLD's anticipation of rising demand or prices.Market consolidation, such as this, typically invites scrutiny regarding its impact on competition. It is important to analyze future moves by IAMGOLD in terms of exploration and development strategies, as well as how the market reacts to this consolidation, particularly in terms of the stock price movement of IAMGOLD and its competitors in the days following the announcement. Legal Expert The transaction followed a buy-out offer and a squeeze-out in compliance with French law, highlighting the legal complexities associated with cross-border acquisitions. The involvement of financial and legal advisors, Natixis and Norton Rose Fulbright LLP respectively, suggests that IAMGOLD navigated through a structured regulatory framework to ensure a smooth transaction. This adherence to protocol is crucial in mitigating legal risks and ensuring shareholder confidence.With the acquisition receiving approval from the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), IAMGOLD has demonstrated its ability to fulfill regulatory obligations, a critical factor for investors who are often concerned about the regulatory risks associated with such transactions. The cessation of EURO as a reporting issuer in Canada may also simplify regulatory compliance and reduce reporting burdens going forward. 02/27/2024 - 05:01 PM Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - February 27, 2024) - IAMGOLD Corporation (TSX: IMG) (NYSE: IAG) (""IAMGOLD"" or the ""Company"") announced today that it has completed, through its wholly-owned subsidiary IAMGOLD France S.A.S.

(NYSE American: WWR) announces a 25% increase in Phase I production to 12,500 mt per year of battery-grade natural graphite anode material at the Kellyton Graphite Processing Plant. The company remains within the Phase I cost estimate of $271 million and expects this expansion to enhance profitability and meet market demand for 'Made in the USA' battery anode material. Positive Westwater Resources increases Phase I production to 12,500 mt per year of battery-grade natural graphite anode material. The capacity increase from 7,500 mt to 10,000 mt per year was previously announced in November 2023. The company now expects to produce 12,500 MT of CSPG annually, a 25% increase, while staying within the Phase I cost estimate of $271 million. Westwater signs its first multi-year offtake agreement and responds to market demand signals for 'Made in the USA' battery anode material. Recent Chinese export restrictions on graphite highlight supply-chain risks, prompting the U.S. to focus on IRA-compliant graphite for EV tax credit eligibility. The Kellyton Plant aims to provide high-quality natural graphite anode material to U.S. battery manufacturers, ensuring 100% IRA compliance. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The increase in production capacity announced by Westwater Resources represents a strategic move in anticipation of the growing demand for battery-grade natural graphite, especially given the recent regulations that incentivize the use of domestically sourced materials for electric vehicle (EV) batteries. From a market perspective, this expansion could potentially enhance Westwater's competitive positioning in the EV supply chain, as manufacturers seek to align with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) compliance requirements. The company's ability to meet these demands can lead to an increased market share and potentially higher revenue streams, given the projected uptick in EV production and the consequent rise in demand for battery components.Furthermore, the new Chinese export restrictions on graphite create a supply gap that Westwater is poised to fill, potentially allowing for pricing power and favorable contract terms with battery manufacturers. The ability to remain within the original Phase I cost estimate while increasing output by 25% is a notable achievement that could reflect operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness, which are critical factors in maintaining profitability in the commodities sector. Financial Analyst Westwater's announcement of increased production capacity has immediate financial implications. The expansion aligns with the company's growth strategy and could lead to an improved financial outlook, as evidenced by the expected increase in profitability mentioned by the company's executive chairman. Investors will likely assess the potential for higher future cash flows against the capital expenditures required for the expansion. The company's focus on securing debt financing to complete Phase I suggests confidence in its ability to service the debt through future earnings.The market interest in Westwater's product, driven by regulatory changes, can be seen as a positive indicator for the company's stock performance. The ability to secure multi-year offtake agreements provides visibility into the company's revenue pipeline, which is a key factor in evaluating its financial health and investment potential. The emphasis on 'Made in the USA' products could also resonate with a growing sentiment for domestic production, possibly influencing investor sentiment positively. Legal Expert The regulatory landscape is a critical factor in Westwater's business model, particularly with the Treasury Department's guidance on IRA-compliant graphite and the identification of China as a Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC). Westwater's positioning as a provider of IRA-compliant graphite could lead to a competitive advantage as EV manufacturers adjust to meet federal tax credit requirements. The legal implications of these regulations create a barrier to entry for non-compliant competitors and establish a protected market for compliant domestic producers like Westwater.Understanding the legal nuances of these regulations and their impact on the supply chain is essential for stakeholders. The exclusion of FEOC from the EV battery supply chain underscores the importance of Westwater's efforts to produce 100% IRA-compliant graphite, as it directly correlates to the eligibility for federal tax incentives. This compliance not only aligns with federal policy objectives but also provides a clear value proposition to potential customers within the EV industry. 02/27/2024 - 05:00 PM CENTENNIAL, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Westwater Resources, Inc. (NYSE American: WWR), an energy technology and battery-grade natural graphite development company (“Westwater” or the “Company”), is announcing an additional increase in Phase I production to 12,500 mt per year of battery-grade natural graphite anode material. In November 2023, Westwater previously announced a capacity increase from 7,500 mt to 10,000 mt per year. During the fourth quarter of 2023 and early 2024, Westwater worked with its third-party engineering firm and equipment manufacturers to increase design capacity of coated spherical purified graphite (“CSPG”) production for Phase I of the Kellyton Graphite Processing Plant (“Kellyton Plant”). As a result, Westwater now expects to produce 12,500 MT of CSPG annually – an increase of 25 percent – while remaining within the Phase I cost estimate of $271 million. “Westwater is making great progress commercially with the signing of our first multi-year offtake agreement, and now technically by adding additional Phase I production,” said Frank Bakker, Westwater’s President and CEO. “We believe the market interest in our CSPG is due in part to the recent Foreign Entity of Concern guidance requiring EV tax credit vehicles use of IRA-compliant graphite by 2025, and by new Chinese export restrictions on graphite that have reduced security of supply.” “Customer engagement and market demand for domestic CSPG remains strong following our February 5th announcement of our first multi-year offtake agreement with volumes ramping up to 10,000 mt per year,” said Terence J. Cryan, Westwater’s Executive Chairman. “By increasing the production of Phase I at the Kellyton Plant to 12,500 mt per year, Westwater is responding to the customer demand signals for ‘Made in the USA’ battery anode material. This 25% increase in Phase 1 plant capacity simultaneously improves the projected Kellyton Plant economics, and importantly, the inherent estimated profitability of our company. It will also aid us in securing the debt financing planned for the completion of Phase 1.” Recent Government Regulation of Graphite Products Chinese exporters are now required to apply for permits to ship two types of graphite material, including high-purity, high-hardness and high-intensity synthetic graphite material and natural flake graphite and its products. Nearly 100% of the battery-grade natural graphite materials produced in 2023 involve some amount of processing in China. Westwater believes these export restrictions continue to highlight the supply-chain risk for the U.S. and other countries related to natural graphite products. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury Department”) has published guidance on key requirements for federal clean vehicle tax credits established by the IRA. In addition, the Treasury Department has proposed new regulations to clarify the application of Foreign Entity of Concern (“FEOC”) credit eligibility exclusions, which specifically identifies the People’s Republic of China as an FEOC. Under these regulations, any vehicle whose batteries contain critical minerals – including graphite – that were extracted or processed in anyway, and to any degree, by an FEOC – including China – will be ruled ineligible for the Clean Vehicle Tax credit of $7,500. As a result, an FEOC must be excluded from a vehicle battery’s supply chain in order for the vehicle to be eligible for the tax credit. Westwater is currently constructing its Kellyton Plant with the intent to provide high-quality natural graphite anode material to battery manufacturers in the United States and believes its product will be 100% IRA compliant. About Westwater Resources, Inc. Westwater Resources, Inc. (NYSE American: WWR), an energy technology company, is focused on developing battery-grade natural graphite. The Company’s primary project is the Kellyton Plant that is under construction in east-central Alabama. In addition, the Company’s Coosa Graphite Deposit is the most advanced natural flake graphite deposit in the contiguous United States and located across 41,965 acres (~17,000 hectares) in Coosa County, Alabama.

Ltd. announces the renewal of its normal course issuer bid to repurchase up to 3,971,380 common shares, representing 5% of outstanding shares. The bid aims to return capital to shareholders, believing the shares are undervalued. Purchases can be made on TSX, NYSE, and alternative trading systems. The bid will terminate on Feb 28, 2025, or earlier if the maximum shares are repurchased. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Share repurchase programs, such as the NCIB announced by West Fraser, are often interpreted as a signal of management's confidence in the company's value. The decision to buy back shares can indicate that the leadership believes the stock is undervalued and that investing in their own shares will yield a better return than other potential uses of capital, such as acquisitions or research and development.From a market research perspective, this move could potentially increase the earnings per share (EPS) by reducing the number of outstanding shares, which may make the stock more attractive to investors. However, the impact on the stock price is not guaranteed, as market conditions and investor perceptions vary. Furthermore, the company's choice to cancel the repurchased shares will permanently reduce the share count, which could be seen as a commitment to enhancing shareholder value over the long term.It's also noteworthy that West Fraser has set up an automatic purchase plan to continue buying back shares during self-imposed blackout periods. This demonstrates a structured approach to capital management and may provide some price support during times when insiders are not allowed to trade the stock. Financial Analyst When analyzing the financial implications of West Fraser's NCIB, it's essential to consider the allocation of capital. The company is authorized to repurchase approximately 5% of its outstanding shares, which is a significant buyback. The repurchase of shares could be financed from free cash flow or by utilizing existing cash reserves, which may affect the company's liquidity and leverage ratios.Investors should review the company's balance sheet to understand how this buyback might affect its financial health. If the company has a strong balance sheet with low debt levels and ample cash reserves, the NCIB could be viewed positively. However, if the company is already highly leveraged, further use of cash for share repurchases might raise concerns about financial prudence.Another point of interest is the historical performance of West Fraser's previous NCIB. The company repurchased a significant number of shares below the maximum authorized amount, which may suggest a disciplined approach to buybacks, only executing them when the price is deemed favorable. Legal Expert In accordance with the legal framework, West Fraser's NCIB must comply with the regulatory requirements of both the TSX and the NYSE. The company's adherence to Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act ensures that the repurchases are made in a manner that does not manipulate the market price of the shares. The limitations imposed by this rule, such as the volume of shares that can be repurchased daily, are designed to protect investors and maintain fair market conditions.The legal aspect of the automatic purchase plan is also significant. It shows that West Fraser is taking steps to comply with insider trading regulations by automating share repurchases during periods when insiders are privy to non-public information and are prohibited from trading.Lastly, the option for West Fraser to make purchases through private agreements or via an issuer bid exemption order indicates a flexibility in the execution of the NCIB, which could allow the company to repurchase shares at a discount to the market price, subject to regulatory approval. 02/27/2024 - 05:01 PM VANCOUVER, BC, Feb. 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - West Fraser Timber Co. Ltd. (""West Fraser"" or the ""Company"") (TSX and NYSE: WFG) announced today that the Toronto Stock Exchange (""TSX"") has accepted West Fraser's notice to renew its normal course issuer bid (""NCIB""). Under the renewed NCIB, West Fraser will be entitled to purchase up to 3,971,380 Common shares (""Shares"") of the Company, representing approximately 5% of the Shares issued and outstanding as at February 16, 2024. The NCIB will commence on March 1, 2024. The purpose of the NCIB is to enable the Company to return capital to shareholders by way of repurchases of Shares, including when the Company believes its Shares are undervalued or represent an attractive investment opportunity. The Company believes that such repurchases are an appropriate use of the Company's available funds and in its best interests. Purchases under the NCIB may be made through the facilities of the TSX, the New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE"") and alternative trading systems in Canada and/or the United States, if eligible. Purchases of Shares under the NCIB may be made on the TSX, at the market price at the time of purchase in accordance with the rules and policies of the TSX, or on the NYSE in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act""). In addition, purchases may also be made by private agreement or under a specific share repurchase program pursuant to an issuer bid exemption order issued by a securities regulatory authority, in which event purchases will be at a discount to the prevailing market price. The rules and policies of the TSX contain restrictions on the number of Shares that can be purchased under the NCIB, based on the average daily trading volumes on the TSX. Similarly, the safe harbor conditions of Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act impose certain limitations on the number of Shares that can be purchased on the NYSE each day. As a result of the restrictions, subject to certain exceptions for block purchases, the maximum number of Shares that can be purchased per day during the NCIB on the TSX is 48,339 based on 25% of the average daily trading volume on the TSX for the prior six months (being 193,358 Shares on the TSX). Subject to certain exceptions for block purchases, the maximum number of Shares that can be purchased per day on the NYSE is 25% of the average daily trading volume on NYSE for the four calendar weeks preceding the date of purchase. Subject to regulatory requirements, the actual number of Shares purchased and the timing of such purchases, if any, will be determined by West Fraser having regard to future price movements and other factors. All Shares purchased by West Fraser under the NCIB will be cancelled. The NCIB will terminate on February 28, 2025 or earlier if the maximum number of Shares authorized for repurchase under the NCIB have been purchased. West Fraser reserves the right to terminate the NCIB earlier if it feels it is appropriate to do so. West Fraser plans to enter into an automatic purchase plan with a broker, which will enable West Fraser to provide standard instructions and purchase Shares on the open market during self-imposed blackout periods. Outside of these blackout periods, Shares may be purchased in accordance with management's discretion. West Fraser's prior normal course issuer bid for the purchase of up to 4,063,696 Shares expired on February 26, 2024. In aggregate, West Fraser purchased a total of 1,907,510 Shares at a volume weighted-average price of US$70.55 per Share, excluding brokerage fees, all of which purchases were made on the open market.

The company's net loss increased significantly, driven by impairment charges. Despite challenges, 3D Systems aims to improve margins, reduce costs, and focus on key growth investments in Healthcare and Industrial Solutions. Positive Revenue for Q4 2023 decreased by 13.5% to $114,848 compared to Q4 2022, with gross profit margin at 40.4%. Net loss was $300,412, primarily due to impairment charges. Adjusted EBITDA decreased to a loss of $12,260. Full-year 2023 revenue of $488,069 decreased by 9.3% compared to 2022. Gross profit margin improved to 40.7%. Net loss increased to $370,432, driven by impairment charges. Adjusted EBITDA decreased to a loss of $24,525. The company repurchased $135,130 of Convertible Senior Notes in December 2023, reducing outstanding debt by nearly 30%. Cash and cash equivalents of $331,525 position the company well for restructuring and growth investments. 3D Systems aims to balance short-term profitability with essential R&D investments in 2024. The company expects relatively flat revenue growth due to economic uncertainties but remains optimistic about growth opportunities in the future. The company's 2024 financial guidance includes revenue of $475-$505 million, Non-GAAP Gross Profit Margin of 42%-44%, Non-GAAP Operating Expense of $223-$238 million, and aims for break-even or better Adjusted EBITDA. 3D Systems will delay filing its Form 10-K for 2023 due to additional time required for financial reporting close procedures. Negative Revenue declines in both Q4 and full year 2023 due to softness in dental orthodontics and depressed printer sales. Significant increase in net loss in 2023, primarily driven by impairment charges. Adjusted EBITDA decreased in both Q4 and full year 2023, indicating financial challenges. Delay in filing Form 10-K for 2023 may raise concerns among investors about transparency and financial reporting accuracy. Financial Analyst An examination of 3D Systems Corporation's financials reveals a decline in revenue by 13.5% for Q4 and 9.3% for the full year, which can be attributed to a contraction in the dental orthodontics market and a slowdown in printer sales. The net loss has widened significantly, primarily due to non-cash impairments. However, it's worth noting the company's proactive debt management, as evidenced by the repurchase of Convertible Senior Notes at a discount, which reduced debt by nearly 30%. This indicates a strategic approach to capital structure optimization and could be seen as a positive by investors concerned with balance sheet strength.The increase in both GAAP and non-GAAP gross profit margins, despite lower volumes, suggests that the company's cost control and efficiency measures are bearing fruit. However, investors should be cautious as the Adjusted EBITDA has turned negative, reflecting operational challenges. The company's guidance for 2024 with an expected revenue of $475 - $505 million and a break-even Adjusted EBITDA implies a cautious outlook, potentially due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. This guidance will be critical for investors to monitor as it suggests a stabilization of the company's financial performance. Market Research Analyst The 3D printing industry is highly sensitive to economic cycles, as seen in the macroeconomic headwinds impacting 3D Systems' performance. The company's restructuring initiatives, aimed at cost reduction and efficiency improvement, are a response to these challenges and may position the company for better profitability in the long term. However, the short-term impact on revenues, particularly in the dental orthodontics segment, indicates a vulnerability to market demand fluctuations.3D Systems' diversified technology platforms across metals, polymers and biologics and its investments in Regenerative Medicine, suggest a long-term strategy focused on innovation and market differentiation. The company's emphasis on growth investments despite economic uncertainty reflects a commitment to maintaining a competitive edge, which could pay off as the market for additive manufacturing matures and expands. Economist The financial results of 3D Systems underscore the broader economic narrative of reduced capital expenditure in uncertain times. The company's significant net loss, driven by impairment charges, indicates a recalibration of asset values in response to market conditions. This could be seen as an alignment with the conservative investment behavior observed across industries during periods of economic volatility.Moreover, the company's strategic decision to repurchase debt at a discount reflects a broader trend of corporations taking advantage of market conditions to optimize their debt portfolio. The cash and cash equivalents position of over $300 million provides the company with a buffer to navigate short-term economic turbulence while continuing to fund strategic initiatives. The company's outlook for 2024, with flat revenue expectations, mirrors the cautious sentiment prevalent in many sectors facing geopolitical and economic uncertainties. 02/27/2024 - 06:15 PM ROCK HILL, S.C., Feb. 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 3D Systems Corporation (NYSE:DDD) announced today its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Fourth Quarter Financial Results (Unaudited)(All numbers are unaudited and are presented in thousands, except per share amounts or otherwise noted) Q4 2023 revenue of $114,848 decreased 13.5% compared to Q4 2022 due to significant softness in dental orthodontics and depressed printer sales from delayed customer capex investmentsQ4 2023 gross profit margin of 40.4% and Non-GAAP gross profit margin(1) of 41.9%.

Summary Comments on ResultsCommenting on 2023 results and the outlook for 2024, Dr. Jeffrey Graves, president and CEO of 3D Systems said, “Our fourth quarter revenue results reflect the significant headwinds created by ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility. As we exited the third quarter, we had expected some of these broader pressures to moderate through year-end, as historical seasonality of increased consumption and year-end customer capex spending would typically translate to an acceleration of revenues in the fourth quarter. While customer-driven pre-sales activities did accelerate as expected in the quarter, the same cannot be said for revenue. Fortunately, based upon customer feedback, we view this as a market timing issue rather than any permanent trend in customer adoption rates for additive manufacturing, or a loss of market share for 3D Systems.” “Reflecting on 2023 in its entirety, the most influential driver to our revenue performance was our dental orthodontic product line, with revenues declining 39% from 2022 levels and essentially cut in half from their peak in 2021. However, adding to the pressure from this market was a sluggishness broadly in capex spending on new production capacity by both our Healthcare and Industrial customers. These combined effects resulted in a significant revenue headwind for 2023. In response to this softness, we’ve undertaken a comprehensive restructuring initiative to reduce costs, improve margins through greater efficiencies, and keep the company solidly on a path for sustained profitability and positive operating cash flow. The rise in gross margins, even in the face of declining volumes in 2023, is an early indicator of these efficiency improvements, which we expect to continue throughout 2024.” “It is important to note that we are different from others in the additive manufacturing industry in that we have the broadest range of technology platforms, which we bring to market through two focused business units, Healthcare and Industrial Solutions. These platforms span metals, polymers and biologics, and, by necessity, require deep expertise in hardware, software and materials development. This technology foundation, in which we have been heavily investing for the last two years, along with industry-leading operational scale and an outstanding global reach, give us an ability to continue taking cost out of our business while preserving the critical investments needed to support the exciting growth opportunities we see ahead. Our goal is to balance short-term profitability and cash performance in 2024, with the need to ensure continuity in essential R&D investments for growth. This balance is critical for two reasons. First, risks remain in the world economic outlook, which could continue to impact sales in the short term. However, offsetting this pressure are a number of very targeted key-customer applications we expect to bring to market over the next 12-18 months. Fortunately, to execute these restructuring and investment plans, we have a strong balance sheet with over $300 million in cash, and 0% interest debt that is not due until late 2026. This gives us an ability to thoughtfully restructure the business to drive profitability and cash performance, while supporting key customer-driven development programs that we believe will add meaningfully to our top line revenues in the years ahead.” Dr. Graves concluded, “Given the continuing risks we see to the world economy, we expect moderating but continued sales pressures, which we are translating into relatively flat top line revenue expectations for the year. Given this, we will prioritize completion of our previously announced restructuring program, which includes headcount reductions, significant site consolidations and a reduction in external spending. We believe these efforts, which will largely be completed by mid-year, will favorably impact both COGS and OPEX, further improve gross margins, and deliver positive adjusted-EBITDA performance and operating cash flow for the full year. In parallel, we will continue our most important development programs that are now, after over two years of increased R&D investment, beginning to yield exciting results. We expect these new additive solutions to materially change the way products are designed and manufactured and healthcare is delivered. We believe the path forward is very clear. In the short term, we will manage our costs to deliver improving margins and cash performance in the face of economic uncertainty. As these clouds then lift, the opportunities for growth in our industry remain incredibly bright. We believe that this focus on our strategic initiatives will harmonize the ability to deliver sustainable profitability this year, while preserving the exceptional opportunities we have to deliver long-term shareholder value in the years ahead.” Summary of Fourth Quarter Results (Unaudited) Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased 13.5% to $114,848 compared to the same period last year, and revenue on a constant currency basis decreased 14.7%. The decline of revenue primarily reflects lower sales to certain dental orthodontic market customers and lower printer sales more broadly throughout the remaining portfolio due to macroeconomic factors that are negatively impacting demand. Healthcare Solutions revenue decreased 15.7% to $51,188 compared to the prior year period, and revenue on a constant currency basis decreased 16.4% year over year. Industrial Solutions revenue decreased 11.6% to $63,660 compared to the prior year period, and revenue on a constant currency basis decreased 13.3% year over year. Gross profit margin for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 40.4% compared to 41.2% in the same period last year. Non-GAAP gross profit margin was 41.9% compared to 40.9% in the same period last year and increased primarily due to favorable mix. Net loss attributable to 3D Systems Corporation increased by $274,859 to a loss of $300,412 in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in net loss attributable to 3D Systems Corporation primarily reflects $297,689 related to the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $7,452 to a loss of $12,260 in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same period last year primarily driven by lower revenue and an increase in operating expenses associated with investments in Regenerative Medicine and an increase in short-term consulting and outside services expenses. Summary of Full-Year 2023 Results (Unaudited) Revenue for 2023 of $488,069 decreased 9.3% compared to the prior year. Revenue on a constant currency basis decreased 9.6%. The decline in revenue primarily reflects lower sales to certain dental orthodontic market customers due to macroeconomic factors that are negatively impacting demand. Healthcare Solutions revenue decreased 18.3% to $213,216, compared to the prior year, and revenue on a constant currency basis decreased 18.6% year over year. Industrial Solutions revenue decreased 0.8% to $274,853 compared to the prior year, and revenue on a constant currency basis decreased 1.1% year over year. Gross profit margin for the full year 2023 was 40.7% compared to 39.8% in the prior year. Non-GAAP gross profit margin was 41.1% for the full year 2023 compared to 39.8% in the prior year. Gross profit margin increased primarily driven by improved operational efficiencies and favorable mix. Net loss attributable to 3D Systems Corporation for the full year 2023 increased by $247,721 to a loss of $370,432 compared to the prior year. The increase in net loss attributable to 3D Systems Corporation primarily reflects an impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, lower revenue and an increase in operating expenses associated with investments in our Regenerative Medicine business and an increase in consulting and outside services expenses. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $18,744 to a loss of $24,525 in 2023 compared to last year primarily driven by the unfavorable impact of lower volumes from dental orthodontics markets and an increase in operating expenses associated with investments in Regenerative Medicine and an increase in consulting and outside services expenses. 2024 Outlook The company is providing full-year 2024 financial guidance as follows: Revenue:$475 - $505 millionNon-GAAP Gross Profit Margin:42% - 44%Non-GAAP Operating Expense:$223 - $238 millionAdjusted EBITDA:Break even or better Financial Liquidity (Unaudited) At December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $331,525 and decreased $237,212 since December 31, 2022. This decrease resulted primarily from the repurchase of our Convertible Notes of $100,614, cash used in operations of $80,671, acquisitions and other investments, net of cash acquired, of $29,152, capital expenditures of $27,183, and taxes paid related to net-share settlement of equity awards of $5,211, offset by a $3,492 effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. At December 31, 2023, the company had total debt, net of deferred financing costs of $319,356.

Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements made in this release that are not statements of historical or current facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the company to be materially different from historical results or from any future results or projections expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. In many cases, forward looking statements can be identified by terms such as “believes,” “belief,” “expects,” “may,” “will,” “estimates,” “intends,” “anticipates” or “plans” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Forward-looking statements are based upon management’s beliefs, assumptions and current expectations and may include comments as to the company’s beliefs and expectations as to future events and trends affecting its business and are necessarily subject to uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company. The factors described under the headings “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in the company’s periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as other factors, could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected or predicted in forward-looking statements. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, forward-looking statements are not, and should not be relied upon as a guarantee of future performance or results, nor will they necessarily prove to be accurate indications of the times at which such performance or results will be achieved. The forward-looking statements included are made only as the date of the statement. 3D Systems undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements made by management or on its behalf, whether as a result of future developments, subsequent events or circumstances or otherwise, except as required by law. Presentation of Information in this Press Release 3D Systems reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP. Management also reviews and reports certain non-GAAP measures, including: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP diluted income (loss) per share, and Adjusted EBITDA. These non-GAAP measures exclude certain items that management does not view as part of 3D Systems’ core results as they may be highly variable, may be unusual or infrequent, are difficult to predict and can distort underlying business trends and results. Management believes that the non-GAAP measures provide useful additional insight into underlying business trends and results and provide meaningful information regarding the comparison of period-over-period results. Additionally, management uses the non-GAAP measures for planning, forecasting and evaluating business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets. 3D Systems’ non-GAAP measures are not calculated in accordance with or as required by GAAP and may not be calculated in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. These non-GAAP measures should thus be considered as supplemental in nature and not considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. To calculate the non-GAAP measures, 3D Systems excludes the impact of the following items: amortization of intangible assets, a non-cash expense, as 3D Systems’ intangible assets were primarily acquired in connection with business combinations;costs incurred in connection with acquisitions and divestitures, such as legal, consulting and advisory fees;stock-based compensation expenses, a non-cash expense;charges related to restructuring and cost optimization plans, impairment charges, including goodwill, and divestiture gains or losses;certain compensation expense related to the 2021 Volumetric acquisition; andcosts, including legal fees, related to significant or unusual litigation matters. Amortization of intangibles and acquisition and divestiture-related costs are excluded from non-GAAP measures as the timing and magnitude of business combination transactions are not predictable, can vary significantly from period to period and the purchase price allocated to amortizable intangible assets and the related amortization period are unique to each acquisition. Amortization of intangible assets will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. While intangible assets contribute to the company’s revenue generation, the amortization of intangible assets does not directly relate to the sale of the company’s products or services. Additionally, intangible assets amortization expense typically fluctuates based on the size and timing of the company’s acquisition activity. Accordingly, the company believes excluding the amortization of intangible assets enhances the company’s and investors’ ability to compare the company’s past financial performance with its current performance and to analyze underlying business performance and trends. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to certain of our employees, the expense is non-cash in nature, and we continue to evaluate our business performance excluding stock-based compensation; therefore, it is excluded from non-GAAP measures. Stock-based compensation expenses will recur in future periods. Charges related to restructuring and cost optimization plans, impairment charges, including goodwill, divestiture gains or losses, and the costs, including legal fees, related to significant or unusual litigation matters are excluded from non-GAAP measures as the frequency and magnitude of these activities may vary widely from period to period. Additionally, impairment charges, including goodwill, are non-cash. Furthermore, the company believes the costs, including legal fees, related to significant or unusual litigation matters are not indicative of our core business' operations. Finally, 3D Systems excludes contingent consideration recorded as compensation expense related to the 2021 Volumetric acquisition from non-GAAP measures as management evaluates financial performance excluding this expense, which is viewed by management as similar to acquisition consideration. The matters discussed above are tax effected, as applicable, in calculating non-GAAP diluted income (loss) per share. Adjusted EBITDA, defined as net income, plus income tax (provision) benefit, interest and other income (expense), net, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation expense, and other non-GAAP adjustments, all as described above, is used by management to evaluate performance and helps measure financial performance period-over-period. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is provided in the accompanying schedules. 3D Systems does not provide forward-looking guidance for certain measures on a GAAP basis. The company is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP gross profit margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and non-GAAP operating expense to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures without unreasonable effort because certain items, including litigation costs, acquisition expenses, stock-based compensation expense, intangible assets amortization expense, restructuring expenses, and goodwill impairment charges are difficult to predict and estimate. These items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond the company’s control, and as such, any associated estimate and its impact on GAAP performance could vary materially.

Closes Acquisition of J&J Worldwide Services Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary CBRE Group, Inc. completes the acquisition of J&J Worldwide Services, a leading provider of engineering services for the U.S. federal government. The acquisition enhances CBRE's technical services capabilities, expands its government client base, and aims for revenue growth. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of J&J Worldwide Services by CBRE Group represents a strategic expansion into government contracting, particularly in the realm of engineering services and facilities maintenance. This move is indicative of CBRE's intent to diversify its service offerings and enhance its revenue streams. The focus on fixed-price contracts with the Department of Defense is particularly noteworthy as it suggests a stable and potentially predictable source of income, which is appealing to investors seeking resilience in a company's financial performance.Moreover, the acquisition is significant in terms of scale, given that J&J employs over 3,300 people and serves a wide range of military and healthcare facilities. This could lead to substantial operational synergies and cross-selling opportunities within CBRE's existing Global Workplace Solutions segment. The long-term nature of J&J's customer relationships, coupled with its technical service delivery track record, may also enhance CBRE's competitive positioning in the government sector. Financial Analyst The financial terms of the acquisition, with an upfront payment of $800 million in cash and an additional earn-out of up to $250 million, suggest a significant investment by CBRE into a sector with long-term growth potential. The earn-out component is contingent on J&J meeting certain performance thresholds, which aligns the interests of both parties towards the success of the integration and future performance. From a financial perspective, investors will be closely monitoring the impact of this acquisition on CBRE's cash flow, debt levels and earnings per share.It is important to note that such acquisitions can involve integration risks and the ability of CBRE to effectively assimilate J&J's operations will be critical to realizing the expected benefits. Investors will be particularly interested in how this acquisition affects CBRE's margins and whether the company can leverage J&J's expertise to secure additional government contracts, thereby enhancing its earnings potential. Legal Expert Given that J&J Worldwide Services primarily serves the U.S. Department of Defense, it is essential to consider the regulatory and compliance aspects of the acquisition. Government contracts are subject to stringent regulations and oversight and CBRE must ensure adherence to federal procurement standards and security requirements. The due diligence process likely involved a thorough review of J&J's compliance with these regulations and ongoing compliance will be critical to the success of the business post-acquisition.Additionally, the legal implications of integrating a government contractor into a global corporation like CBRE involve navigating complex rules regarding data security, employee clearances and operational protocols. CBRE's experience in managing these legal intricacies will be pivotal in maintaining J&J's existing contracts and securing future opportunities within the government sector. 02/27/2024 - 05:03 PM DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CBRE Group, Inc.

Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, Nutrien's initiation of a normal course issuer bid (NCIB) to repurchase up to five percent of its outstanding common shares is a significant move that can have various implications for shareholders and the company's capital structure. The repurchase of shares is often seen as a signal that a company believes its stock is undervalued and that it has sufficient cash reserves to allocate to buying back shares rather than investing in new projects or paying down debt. This can be interpreted as a positive sign by the market, potentially leading to an uptick in the stock price.However, there are also risks associated with share buybacks. They can reduce the company's cash reserves, which might limit future growth opportunities or the ability to weather economic downturns. Additionally, if the buyback is financed through debt, it could increase the company's leverage, making it more vulnerable to financial stress. It's important for investors to consider the company's rationale for the buyback and its overall financial health when evaluating the potential impact on the stock's value. Market Research Analyst Share buyback programs like the NCIB announced by Nutrien are often a response to market conditions and can reflect broader trends in the sector. In the agricultural sector, where Nutrien operates, such moves can be influenced by commodity prices, global demand for fertilizers and industry-specific challenges. Investors should consider how these factors may affect Nutrien's performance and the potential for the NCIB to support the stock price.Furthermore, the timing and execution of the buyback strategy are critical. The cancellation of repurchased shares can lead to a reduced share count, which in turn can improve earnings per share (EPS) metrics, even if net income remains constant. This financial engineering can make the company appear more profitable on a per-share basis and can be a tool to meet or exceed market expectations in the short term. Legal Expert Legal considerations are paramount in the execution of an NCIB. Nutrien's compliance with the TSX normal course issuer bid rules and the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, particularly Rule 10b-18, is essential to ensure the legitimacy of the buyback process. These regulations are designed to prevent market manipulation and protect investors by imposing restrictions on the volume of shares that can be repurchased daily.Additionally, the use of an automatic purchase plan during self-imposed blackout periods is a strategy to avoid insider trading allegations, as it standardizes the buyback process and removes discretion during sensitive times when insiders might have access to non-public, material information. 02/27/2024 - 04:45 PM SASKATOON, Saskatchewan--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Nutrien Ltd. (TSX and NYSE: NTR) announced today that the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) has accepted Nutrien's notice to commence a normal course issuer bid (NCIB) to purchase outstanding common shares representing up to five percent of its issued and outstanding common shares. Under the NCIB, purchases of common shares may be made through the facilities of the TSX, the New York Stock Exchange and/or alternative trading systems in Canada and the U.S., or as otherwise permitted under applicable securities laws. The actual number of common shares that may be purchased under the NCIB and the timing of any such purchases will be determined by Nutrien. Nutrien believes that purchasing its own common shares represents an attractive investment opportunity, is in the best interests of the company and is consistent with Nutrien's objective of returning capital to shareholders over time. As of February 16, 2024, Nutrien had 494,563,180 common shares outstanding and, therefore, is permitted to repurchase up to 24,728,159 of its outstanding common shares pursuant to the NCIB. Common shares purchased under the NCIB will be cancelled. The NCIB will be effected in accordance with the TSX normal course issuer bid rules and/or Rule 10b-18 under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which contain restrictions on the number of common shares that may be purchased on a single day, subject to certain exceptions for block purchases, based on the average daily trading volumes of Nutrien's common shares on the applicable exchange. Subject to exceptions for block purchases, Nutrien will limit daily purchases of common shares on the TSX in connection with the NCIB to no more than twenty-five percent (290,908 common shares) of the average daily trading volume of the common shares on the TSX (1,163,632 common shares) during any trading day. Purchases under the NCIB will be made through open market purchases at market price, as well as by other means as may be permitted under applicable securities laws, including private agreements. Any purchases made by private agreement under an issuer bid exemption order issued by a securities regulatory authority will be at a discount to the prevailing market price as provided in such exemption order. Purchases of common shares may commence on March 1, 2024 and will expire on the earlier of February 28, 2025, the date on which the company has acquired the maximum number of common shares allowable under the NCIB or otherwise decides not to make any further repurchases under the NCIB. Nutrien has entered into an automatic purchase plan with a broker which will enable Nutrien to provide standard instructions and purchase common shares on the open market during self-imposed blackout periods. Outside of these black-out periods, common shares may be purchased in accordance with management's discretion. Nutrien's prior NCIB for the purchase of up to 24,962,194 common shares will expire on February 29, 2024. As of February 16, 2024, Nutrien repurchased an aggregate of 5,375,397 common shares at a weighted-average price of US$69.76 per share, for an aggregate of US$374,998,896 under the prior NCIB. Purchases were made on the open market. About Nutrien Nutrien is a leading provider of crop inputs and services, helping to safely and sustainably feed a growing world.

The partnership with a reputable OEM like Volvo could enhance Stoneridge's market position and brand recognition. However, the full financial impact will depend on the market's reception of the new models and the pace at which fleets adopt this technology.

Despite challenges like lower unit volumes, the Company remains optimistic about future growth.","HYSTER-YALE MATERIALS HANDLING ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2023 RESULTS Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Hyster-Yale Materials Handling, Inc. reported impressive Q4 and full-year 2023 results with consolidated operating profit up 146% in Q4, revenue growth of $42 million, and net income of $25.2 million. The Lift Truck business saw significant improvements in operating profit and margins. Despite challenges like lower unit volumes, the Company remains optimistic about future growth. Positive Consolidated operating profit surged by 146% in Q4 2023, reaching $48.7 million, compared to $19.8 million in Q4 2022. Q4 consolidated revenue increased by $42 million, or 4%, compared to the same period in 2022. Q4 Lift Truck operating profit of $54.2 million and a margin of 5.5% showed significant growth over Q4 2022. Full-year net income saw a remarkable improvement, reaching $125.9 million compared to a loss of $74.1 million in 2022. The Company expects full-year 2024 consolidated net income to be on par with 2023 results. Despite lower unit volumes, the Lift Truck business experienced revenue growth led by price increases, favorable currency effects, and a positive sales mix shift to higher-priced products. Consolidated unit shipments decreased by 13% year-over-year, mainly due to challenges in EMEA and Americas. The Company reduced its net debt by $17 million in Q4 2023, generating cash flow of $46 million for the quarter and $151 million for full-year 2023. Market commentary highlighted the global economic uncertainty due to geopolitical tensions, impacting market activities in 2023. The Company's Lift Truck business aims to transform competitiveness through product innovations, electrification projects, and technology advancements. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results for Hyster-Yale Materials Handling, Inc. (HY) indicate a robust year-over-year improvement in both quarterly and full-year operating profits and net income. The substantial increase in operating profit, from $19.8 million in Q4 2022 to $48.7 million in Q4 2023, reflects a 146% growth, which is significantly higher than the industry average. This growth is attributed to improved product margins and an appreciation of the company's stock price, which affected equity incentive compensation expenses. The average sales price per backlog unit increase suggests the company has successfully passed on cost increases to customers, a positive indicator for maintaining profitability amid inflationary pressures.From an investor's perspective, the substantial growth in net income from a loss of $74.1 million in 2022 to a profit of $125.9 million in 2023 is a strong signal of a turnaround in the company's financial health. This turnaround is further supported by the decrease in net debt by $17.2 million and an improved debt to total capital ratio, which fell by 600 basis points, indicating a strengthened balance sheet.However, the expected full-year 2024 consolidated net income to be comparable to 2023 results suggests that the company does not anticipate significant growth in the coming year, which could temper investor expectations for continued upward momentum in the stock price. Market Research Analyst The reported results highlight a mixed performance across geographic segments, with significant growth in the Americas and EMEA, contrasted by declines in JAPIC. This indicates a regional variability in market conditions, which is crucial for investors to consider when evaluating the company's future performance. The decline in unit shipments, particularly the 30% decrease in EMEA, points to potential supply chain and market demand issues that could be a cause for concern.The lift truck market commentary provided suggests that the global economy in 2023 performed better than expected, with the core lift truck market remaining robust. However, the anticipated flat global lift truck market for 2024 implies that Hyster-Yale may not experience significant market-driven growth in the near term. The company's strategic focus on booking orders with strong margins and anticipated market share gains, especially in warehouse products, suggests a strategic shift towards more profitable segments.Investors should note the company's initiatives in emerging technology solutions for warehouse-related markets, which had strong growth rates in 2023. The company's focus on these technology solutions is expected to continue driving growth in 2024, which could be a key differentiator in a flat market. Supply Chain Analyst The report indicates ongoing skilled labor challenges and component supply issues, mainly in EMEA, which have impacted production rates and shipments. This reflects broader industry challenges that companies are facing in the wake of global supply chain disruptions. Hyster-Yale's efforts to improve working capital efficiency, as evidenced by the reduction in net debt, are positive steps toward mitigating these challenges.The company's extended backlog, representing almost ten months of revenue, provides a cushion against potential booking declines. However, this also suggests that the company may be facing extended lead times, which could impact customer satisfaction and future sales. The focus on reducing lead times and backlog levels to pre-pandemic levels will be critical for operational efficiency and customer retention.It is important to note the trend towards higher average unit backlog prices and margins, demonstrating the company's ability to maintain profitability in a challenging environment. Investors should be aware of the potential impacts of tariff exemptions expiring in late May 2024 and the effect on unit margins in the second half of the year. 02/27/2024 - 04:51 PM Q4 and Full-Year 2023 Highlights: Q4 consolidated operating profit of $48.7 million up 146% from Q4 2022, despite $9.6 million of equity incentive compensation expense specifically due to appreciation in the Company's stock price during Q4 2023Q4 consolidated revenue growth of $42 million, or 4%, compared with Q4 2022 Q4 Lift Truck operating profit of $54.2 million and margin of 5.5% increased significantly over Q4 2022 due to improved product margins Average sales price per backlog unit up 16% over Q4 2022 and 2% over Q3 2023Q4 consolidated net income of $25.2 increased from $7.6 million in Q4 2022Full-year net income of $125.9 million increased by $200 million from 2022 loss of $74.1 million Full-year 2024 consolidated net income expected to be comparable to 2023 resultsCLEVELAND, Feb. 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Hyster-Yale Materials Handling, Inc. (NYSE: HY) reported the following consolidated results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023. All comparisons are to the three months ended December 31, 2022, unless otherwise noted.

(Rounded to nearest hundred) Q4 2023 Q4 2022 Change Fav (Unfav) Q3 2023 Change Fav (Unfav) Unit Shipments 23,600 27,100 (3,500) 25,700 (2,100) Americas 15,600 16,000 (400) 17,100 (1,500) EMEA 5,400 7,800 (2,400) 5,900 (500) JAPIC 2,600 3,300 (700) 2,700 (100) Fourth-quarter 2023 Lift Truck revenues increased approximately 5% compared with 2022. Revenue growth was led by the favorable effect of previously implemented price increases in all regions and favorable currency effects of $18 million, primarily in EMEA. A positive sales mix shift, mainly to higher-priced, higher-capacity Class 4 and Class 5 trucks, including Big Trucks, and increased parts sales also contributed to the revenue growth. These benefits were partially offset by lower unit volumes. Consolidated unit shipments decreased 13% year-over-year and 8% sequentially from third-quarter 2023. The year-over-year decline was largely due to a 30% decrease in EMEA shipments, while fewer Americas' shipments drove the decrease from third-quarter 2023. These declines were primarily due to the negative effect of certain product launch and component supply issues mainly in EMEA compounded with lower market demand in certain areas. Ongoing skilled labor challenges also impeded progress on planned production rate increases and shipments during the quarter. The Company shipped approximately 102,200 units in full-year 2023. This compares with approximately 100,800 units in 2022. Gross profit and operating profit (loss) by geographic segment were as follows: ($ in millions) Q4 2023 Q4 2022 Change Fav (Unfav) Gross Profit $192.8 $129.2 $63.6 Americas $151.1 $110.1 $41.0 EMEA $37.6 $11.0 $26.6 JAPIC $4.1 $8.1 $(4.0) Operating Profit (Loss) $54.2 $27.2 $27.0 Americas $55.0 $38.4 $16.6 EMEA $6.0 $(11.2) $17.2 JAPIC $(6.8) $— $(6.8) Fourth-quarter 2023 Lift Truck operating profit increased substantially over the prior year, resulting in a 5.5% operating profit margin. This year-over-year increase generated a 62% incremental margin in the quarter, demonstrating strong growth and disciplined execution. Product margins increased significantly in the Americas and EMEA due to favorable price-to-cost ratios and an improved sales mix. Favorable currency movements also contributed to the profit growth. Higher operating costs partly offset the profit improvement. The operating cost increase was primarily due to higher employee-related expenses, including increased incentive compensation attributable to strong fourth-quarter 2023 results and $9.6 million ($8.2 million net of taxes of $1.4 million) for the equity component specifically due to appreciation of the Company's stock price in fourth-quarter 2023. Elevated marketing costs, in part resulting from promotions of new product launches, also contributed to the increase. Geographically, the Americas' fourth-quarter 2023 operating profit improved 43%, with 4% revenue growth, compared with fourth-quarter 2022. Continued product margin improvements and a favorable sales mix more than offset lower unit volumes and increased employee-related, product development and marketing expenses. EMEA fourth-quarter 2023 revenues increased $30.8 million, or 16%, while operating profit improved by $17.2 million when compared with a substantial 2022 loss. Benefits from price increases, favorable currency movements and lower material and freight costs more than offset the effect of lower unit and parts volumes and elevated operating expenses. New product launch issues and certain component parts shortages continued to constrain production and shipment levels during fourth quarter 2023. JAPIC reported a fourth-quarter 2023 operating loss of $6.8 million compared with break-even results in 2022. The lower results were primarily due to lower unit and parts volumes, unfavorable manufacturing variances, higher labor and freight costs and increased operating expenses. JAPIC shipments decreased year-over-year largely due to strong prior-year shipments. This was caused by previously unfavorable lead times on products sourced from affiliate regions that led to dealer overstocking in fourth-quarter 2022. Bolzoni Results ($ in millions) Q4 2023 Q4 2022 ChangeFav (Unfav) Revenues $87.3 $92.0 $(4.7) Gross Profit $19.4 $19.3 $0.1 Operating Profit $2.6 $2.0 $0.6 Bolzoni's fourth-quarter 2023 revenues decreased $4.7 million while operating profit improved by $0.6 million compared with 2022. Fourth-quarter 2022 results included a $2.4 million loss on sale of a business. Excluding the effect of the sale, operating profit decreased substantially year-over-year primarily due to higher operating expenses. Bolzoni's product and gross margins improved over the prior year despite comparable gross profit dollars. Favorable currency movements and price increases implemented in prior years were offset by a mix shift to lower margin products, reduced sales volumes and material cost increases. Nuvera Results ($ in millions) Q4 2023 Q4 2022 Change Fav (Unfav) Revenues $0.2 $1.3 $(1.1) Gross Profit (Loss) $(2.4) $(1.7) $(0.7) Operating Loss $(8.0) $(9.3) $1.3 Nuvera's fourth-quarter 2023 operating loss decreased to $8.0 million from $9.3 million in 2022. This was primarily due to lower product development costs resulting from U.S. government funding received to support certain fuel cell research and development expenses. The lower expenses more than offset a decline in fourth-quarter 2023 revenues due to fewer engine shipments compared with 2022. Balance Sheet and Liquidity ($ in millions) December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 Change Fav (Unfav) Debt $494.0 $510.6 $16.6 Cash 78.8 78.2 0.6 Net Debt $415.2 $432.4 $17.2 During fourth-quarter 2023, the Company reduced its net debt by $17 million, or 4%, compared with September 30, 2023. The net debt reduction was primarily due to increased cash resulting from the Company's ongoing efforts to improve working capital efficiency. Overall, the Company generated cash flow from operations of almost of $46 million in the fourth quarter and $151 million for full-year 2023. These results mark a significant improvement over the prior-year periods, with $6 million and $41 million of cash generated in fourth-quarter 2022 and full-year 2022, respectively. The Company's debt to total capital ratio of 55% at December 31, 2023 improved sequentially by 600 basis points from September 30, 2023, due to significant profitability and a lower debt balance. The Company had unused borrowing capacity of approximately $270 million under its revolving credit facilities as of December 31, 2023, compared with $254 million on September 30, 2023. Fourth-quarter 2023 days inventory outstanding decreased by one day compared with third-quarter 2023 levels despite comparable inventory balances between periods. The Company remains focused on improving inventory efficiency as production rates increase. Market CommentaryGenerally, the 2023 global economy performed better than anticipated. The Company's core lift truck market remains strong and above pre-pandemic levels in most regions. Nonetheless, some external market factors, including ongoing geopolitical instability, most recently evidenced by the tensions in the Red Sea, continue to create a significant amount of uncertainty within the global economic outlook. Due to this and abnormally high industry volumes from 2020 to 2022, global market activity declined across 2023, particularly in EMEA. The latest publicly available lift truck market data indicates that new unit, third-quarter 2023 booking activity decreased globally and in all major geographies except China and India compared with strong 2022 levels. Internal company estimates suggest that fourth-quarter 2023 global lift truck market bookings decreased compared with the prior year. Its estimated that the rate of decline slowed in EMEA and accelerated somewhat in the Americas. In 2024, global market bookings are expected to be generally comparable to 2023 levels. An anticipated first-half decline is expected to be offset by a second-half increase. For both full-years 2023 and 2024, market unit volumes are projected to remain strong. Consolidated Strategic PerspectiveThe Company's significantly improved 2023 results are due to the global team's ongoing execution of strategic initiatives and actions to offset external headwinds and improve the business' resiliency over time. These actions include key projects and process improvements to help the Company achieve long-term growth rates above the material handling market's expected growth rates. The Company's mature Lift Truck and Bolzoni businesses are the foundation for growth, while the Company believes the Nuvera Fuel Cell business' substantial growth prospects should be additive in future years. Hyster-Yale is focused on transforming the way the world moves materials from Port to Home. The Company plans to do this through two customer promises. First, by providing optimized product solutions and second, by providing exceptional customer care. The Company believes these actions will contribute to an increased and sustainable competitive advantage over time. Operational Perspectives - Lift Truck BusinessLift Truck unit bookings and backlog were as follows: (Bookings & Backlog $ Value in millions) Q4 2023 Q4 2022 ChangeFav (Unfav) Q3 2023 Change Fav (Unfav) Unit Bookings 16,700 21,000 (4,300) 18,200 (1,500) Unit Bookings $ Value $480 $690 $(210) $580 $(100) Average Sales Price/Unit booked $28,743 $32,857 $(4,114) $31,868 $(3,125) Unit Backlog 78,400 102,100 (23,700) 85,300 (6,900) Unit Backlog $ Value $3,330 $3,730 $(400) $3,540 $(210) Average Sales Price/Unit of backlog $42,474 $36,533 $5,941 $41,501 $973 Given the Company's extended backlog position, it continues to prioritize booking orders with strong margins. This focus combined with declining market demand, particularly in the Americas, resulted in an 8% decrease in fourth-quarter 2023 lift truck bookings compared with third-quarter 2023 and a 20% decline from strong prior-year levels. Looking forward, the Company expects to be price competitive with the market, but will work to maintain targeted bookings margins even as backlog levels are reduced. Overall, the Company expects 2024 bookings to increase compared to 2023. This improvement is primarily due to anticipated market share gains, especially in warehouse products, within an overall flat global lift truck market. These expected increases are primarily the result of the Company's strategic initiatives, particularly those focused on emerging technology solutions for warehouse-related markets. These technology solutions had strong 2023 growth rates, and the Company expects to build on that momentum in 2024. Planned production rate increases combined with anticipated market decreases in the first half of 2024 should help the Company reduce its extended lead times and backlog closer to pre-pandemic levels over 2024. However, given current expectations, the Company believes lead times and backlog levels will likely remain above optimal levels on certain product lines for an extended period. Specific lines, such as warehouse products, are expected to return to more normal lead time and backlog levels in 2024. The Company's extended backlog, valued at $3.3 billion, represents almost ten months of revenue and should serve as a cushion for the business if bookings decline more than anticipated in 2024. Overall, customer cancellations, which can impact backlog levels, trended up modestly in 2023 from prior year rates. Hyster-Yale's cancellation rate remains substantially below the industry average. Full-year 2024 production and shipment rates are expected to increase compared with 2023 as production launch issues and lingering component and labor constraints dissipate. The Company's focus remains on maintaining a full production pipeline across its facilities within this moderated market demand environment. The trend of higher average unit backlog prices and margins continued in the fourth quarter. This trend was largely due to the Company's ongoing focus on booking orders at strong margins and benefits from prior-year price increases to offset inflation. Fourth-quarter 2023 average booking prices decreased compared with both the third-quarter 2023 and the prior year largely due to the shift toward lower-priced warehouse products with shorter average lead times. While material costs decreased modestly in 2023, forward economic indicators suggest stabilizing material costs and moderately higher labor costs in 2024. Elevated freight costs tied to geopolitical events are expected throughout 2024, particularly in the first half of the year. In this context, the Company expects to maintain its strong price-to-cost ratio in the first half of 2024 as higher-priced backlog units are shipped. This, combined with an anticipated increase in unit volumes, is expected to lead to higher gross margins and an improved operating profit in the first half of the year compared with 2023. The expiration of tariff exemptions in late May 2024, shipment of trucks ordered in 2024's more competitive pricing environment and the mix effect of increased warehouse product shipments are likely to temper unit margins in the second half of the year. For the full-year, gross profit margins should be comparable to 2023 levels. The Company is working to reduce the earnings impact from externally driven factors through increased manufacturing productivity and expense control. The Company will continue to monitor labor and material costs closely, as well as the impacts from tariffs and competition, and will adjust forward pricing accordingly. Overall, higher production and shipment rates along with stable gross profit margins are expected to generate increased Lift Truck revenues and operating profit in 2024 compared to the prior year. Strategic Perspectives - Lift TruckFrom a broad perspective, the Lift Truck business has three core strategies that are expected to transform the Company's competitiveness, market position and economic performance over time. The first core strategy is to provide products that improve customer productivity at the lowest cost of ownership. The Lift Truck business' capabilities in this area are expected to be enhanced by bringing to market a wide variety of vehicle innovations, including new modular and scalable product families, truck electrification projects and technology advancements in operator assist systems (OAS), power options and vehicle automation. The Company continues to make progress on its high priority projects. The Company's heart-of-the-line modular, scalable 2- to 3.5-ton internal combustion engine lift trucks have been launched in the EMEA and Americas markets. The production ramp-up continues to occur gradually given the current extended backlog. However, bookings and shipments accelerated in 2023. A first-quarter 2024 launch of the full 2-to 3-ton internal combustion product line, which includes value, standard and premium truck configurations, is expected for the JAPIC market. Similar enhancements to the 2- to 3.5-ton electric truck platforms are also expected over 2024 and 2025. The modular, scalable product platform is expected to enhance multiple areas of the business, including reducing supply chain costs, improving working capital levels and helping optimize the Company's manufacturing footprint, while providing customers with a more customizable product that better meets their needs. Other key projects include electrifying trucks used for applications now dominated by internal combustion engine trucks that capitalize on advancements in electric powertrain options. The Company currently has its first electrified fuel cell Container Handler operating at the Port of Los Angeles, and its first electrified fuel cell Reach Stacker operating at the Port of Valencia, Spain. Hyster-Yale anticipates delivering a new electrified fuel cell Terminal Tractor and an electrified fuel cell Empty Container Handler to a customer in Hamburg, Germany in 2024. The Company is exploring options for additional electrification projects within the European Union and the United States. Hyster-Yale also has key projects focused on applying its technology advancements to additional OAS and automated product options. Notably, during third-quarter 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with a technology-service provider to co-develop further robotics software technology for automated lift truck solutions. The Lift Truck business also has a key project focused on expanding global sourcing options of container handlers. The Company expects its Hyster® RS45 ReachStackers, as well as Empty Container Handlers, to be sourced from production locations in both Nijmegen, the Netherlands, and Fuyang, China during 2024. This dual-source supply chain will help the Company better meet the needs of the global market, enabling customers to benefit from time efficient delivery for economically viable trucks. The second core strategy is be the leader in the delivery of industry- and customer-focused solutions by transforming the Company's sales approach to ensure it meets a wide variety of customer needs across a broad set of end markets. To meet diversified customer product needs, the Company is transforming its sales processes by using an industry-focused approach. The Company believes that understanding the customers' applications is best done by segmenting the market into two broad umbrella categories: industrial and warehousing applications. The Company's Hyster® brand will increasingly focus on industrial applications, while the Yale® brand will increasingly focus on warehouse applications. This focus separation will reinforce a natural differentiation between the two brands that already exists in the marketplace. The third core strategy is to be the leader in independent distribution by focusing on effectively coordinating dealer and major account coverage, enhancing dealer excellence and ensuring outstanding dealer ownership globally. The Company is committed to helping its excellent dealer group be the leaders in their territories. Operational and Strategic Perspectives - BolzoniBolzoni anticipates a modest increase in 2024 revenues compared with 2023 as legacy products begin to be phased out and attachment volumes increase. Operating profit is expected to increase year-over-year as higher product margins and anticipated manufacturing efficiency improvements are projected to more than offset higher material and operating costs. Bolzoni's core strategy is to be the leader in the attachments business. In this context, Bolzoni continues to concentrate on driving its ""One Company - 3 Brands"" approach globally, increasing its Americas business and focusing on strengthening its ability to serve key attachment industries and customers in global markets. As part of this approach, Bolzoni also intends to increase its sales, marketing and product capabilities especially in North America to support its industry-specific sales strategy. Operational and Strategic Perspectives - NuveraNuvera's core strategy is to be a leader in the heavy-duty fuel cell market. Nuvera continues to focus on placing 45kW and 60kW fuel cell production engines for demonstration in a limited number of niche, heavy-duty vehicle applications with expected significant fuel cell adoption potential where batteries alone cannot meet the market's need. As a result, these applications are expected to have nearer-term fuel cell adoption potential. Nuvera has announced several projects with various third parties to test Nuvera® engines in targeted applications, including the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Valencia, and most recently with Helinor Energy for zero-emission energy solutions for maritime applications. Nuvera expects to have additional products being tested in bus applications in China and India and in a German port by mid-2024. Nuvera is also developing a new, larger 125kW fuel cell engine for heavier-duty applications, which is projected to be available in 2025, and is working with customers to launch modular fuel cells for stationary and mobile generator applications. Nuvera is focused on increasing customer product demonstrations and customer bookings in 2024. Nuvera is also expanding its presence in Europe and China. Orders from current customers have been booked and are expected to result in higher sales in 2024 compared with 2023. Nuvera expects these higher sales to be offset by increased development costs, leading to comparable year-over-year operating results. The increased engine demonstration volumes should significantly enhance the foundation for future fuel cell engine technology adoption and improved financial returns in future years. Consolidated OutlookAt the consolidated level, the Company expects 2024 operating profit to increase while net income is expected to be comparable to 2023. The latter is due to higher projected 2024 income tax expense driven by an elevated income tax rate. This results from full utilization of U.S. net operating losses in 2023 combined with ongoing capitalization of research and development costs for tax purposes in 2024. The Company anticipates continued strong product margins from shipments of fixed-price backlog units to drive year-over-year profit growth in the first half of the year. However, the expiration of tariff exemptions and shipments of orders placed in 2024's more competitive pricing environment will likely temper second half results. As an offset to any competitive pricing adjustments, the Company will continue to focus on effectively managing its ongoing component and labor costs and production levels. The Company made solid progress toward its 7% operating profit margin and greater than 20% return on total capital employed goals at both the Lift Truck and Bolzoni businesses in 2023 and will work to make continued progress in 2024 toward achieving these goals. Hyster-Yale is committed to continuing to reduce its leverage and enhance its cash flows through ongoing working capital reductions and continued discipline over operating expenses. Capital expenditures were $35.4 million in 2023 and are expected to be $87 million in 2024. This full-year increase over restrained 2023 levels includes a return to investing for business growth and network efficiency. While the Company expects to make these substantial additional investments in the business, maintaining liquidity also continues to be a priority. Working capital control continues to be an area of intense focus for the Company. Inventory levels remain elevated and above pre-pandemic levels but are slowly declining from their peak in mid-2023. Efforts to maximize the use of on-hand inventory are expected to help significantly reduce excess inventory levels in 2024 despite intermittent supply chain and some periodic labor constraints. As a result of these actions, the Company expects a significant increase in cash flow from operations in 2024 compared with 2023. ***** Conference CallThe management of Hyster-Yale Materials Handling, Inc. will conduct a conference call with investors and analysts on Wednesday, February 28, 2024, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the financial results.

The company reported total revenue of US$64.4 million, up 42.2% YoY, with positive trends in IoT PaaS and SaaS revenue. Operating margin improved by 35.8 percentage points YoY, while net margin saw a 33.4 percentage point improvement. The company's cash position remained strong at US$984.3 million. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results by Tuya Inc. indicate a robust year-over-year revenue growth of 42.2%, with substantial increases in both IoT PaaS and SaaS revenues. The improvement in gross margins, particularly a 3.3 percentage point increase in IoT PaaS gross margin, suggests enhanced profitability and operational efficiency. The shift from a net cash used in operating activities to generating $31.8 million is a positive signal for liquidity and operational cash flow health. However, a negative operating margin, despite significant improvement, still reflects ongoing operational challenges.Investors should note the company's strategic focus on key accounts and premium IoT PaaS customers, which contributed a significant portion of revenue. This focus on high-value customers is a common strategy for B2B companies to stabilize revenue streams. The substantial increase in dollar-based net expansion rate (DBNER) for IoT PaaS, from 51% to 103%, is indicative of successful upselling and cross-selling efforts, leading to increased customer spend over time.Despite the positive revenue and margin trends, the company's operating expenses increased slightly, which could be a concern if the trend continues. The net loss has narrowed significantly, which is encouraging, but the company still needs to reach a consistent net profitability. The significant cash and cash equivalents position provides a buffer for strategic investments and weathering economic cycles. Market Research Analyst Tuya's report highlights a strategic emphasis on cost management and operational efficiency, which are critical in the current economic environment characterized by inflation and cautious consumer spending. The company's ability to grow its premium IoT PaaS customer base and maintain a high DBNER suggests a strong product-market fit and customer loyalty, which are important indicators of long-term business health in the IoT and cloud services industry.The IoT market is increasingly competitive and Tuya's focus on enhancing product capabilities and value proposition is essential for maintaining its market position. The increase in gross profit and the stabilization of SaaS and others gross margin reflect the company's ability to deliver high-value solutions and manage costs effectively. However, the slight decrease in total customer numbers could be a point of concern and warrants monitoring to see if it is a temporary fluctuation or indicative of a larger trend.From a market perspective, Tuya's financial performance and operational highlights suggest resilience and the potential for sustained growth. Investors and market observers should consider the company's strategic adjustments and their potential to drive long-term value in the evolving IoT and cloud services landscape. Technology Industry Analyst The Internet of Things (IoT) industry is rapidly evolving and Tuya's performance must be contextualized within this dynamic sector. The increase in registered IoT device and software developers by 40.3% year over year reflects a growing ecosystem and the potential for increased innovation and customer engagement. Tuya's focus on IoT PaaS and SaaS offerings aligns with the industry's shift towards service-based models that provide recurring revenue and scalability.IoT PaaS and SaaS solutions are critical for enabling smart device connectivity and cloud-based data management, which are cornerstones of modern IoT applications. Tuya's increase in revenue from these segments indicates solid demand for its platform, which is crucial in an industry that relies on long-term customer relationships and network effects.The company's emphasis on premium IoT PaaS customers and the high percentage of revenue derived from this group underscore the strategic importance of targeting high-value clients in the tech industry. The ability to maintain high gross margins in this competitive landscape is an indication of Tuya's effective cost control and value-added services.Overall, Tuya's financial results and operational highlights demonstrate the company's strategic positioning and adaptation to industry trends, which are essential for maintaining competitiveness in the IoT sector. 02/27/2024 - 04:45 PM SANTA CLARA, Calif., Feb. 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Tuya Inc.

Fourth Quarter 2023 Operating Highlights IoT PaaS customers1 for the fourth quarter of 2023 were approximately 2,200 (4Q2022: approximately 2,400). Total customers for the fourth quarter of 2023 were approximately 3,200 (4Q2022: approximately 3,400). The Company's implementation of key-account strategy has enabled it to be more focused on serving strategic customers.Premium IoT PaaS customers2 for the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2023 were 265 (4Q2022: 263). In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company's premium IoT PaaS customers contributed approximately 82.7% of its IoT PaaS revenue (4Q2022: approximately 77.0%).Dollar-based net expansion rate (""DBNER"")3 of IoT PaaS for the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2023 was 103% (4Q2022: 51%).Registered IoT device and software developers were approximately 993,000 as of December 31, 2023, up 40.3% from approximately 708,000 developers as of December 31, 2022.1. The Company defines an IoT PaaS customer for a given period as a customer who has directly placed orders for IoT PaaS with the Company during that period. 2. The Company defines a premium IoT PaaS customer as a customer as of a given date that contributed more than US$100,000 of IoT PaaS revenue during the immediately preceding 12-month period. 3. The Company calculates DBNER of IoT PaaS for a trailing 12-month period by first identifying all customers in the prior 12-month period (i.e., those have placed at least one order for IoT PaaS during that period), and then calculating the quotient from dividing the IoT PaaS revenue generated from such customers in the current trailing 12-month period by the IoT PaaS revenue generated from the same Company of customers in the prior 12-month period. The Company's DBNER may change from period to period, due to a combination of various factors, including changes in the customers' purchase cycles and amounts and the Company's customer mix, among other things. DBNER indicates the Company's ability to expand customer use of the Tuya platform over time and generate revenue growth from existing customers. Mr. Xueji (Jerry) Wang, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Tuya, commented, ""In the fourth quarter of 2023, we continued to execute our proven development strategies of focusing on key account customers and enhancing our product capabilities to boost our value proposition, while also essentially completing our organization adjustment. These combined efforts enabled us to conclude the year with strong sequential growth momentum. Notably, we achieved a 42.2% year-over-year revenue increase, reaching approximately $64.4 million in the quarter, alongside a record-high blended gross margin of 47.3%. These results reflect the substantial value of our platform, products, and services offer to our customers, affirming our confidence in Tuya's resilience and its capability to navigate industry cycles with improved operational leverage and financial performance."" Ms. Yao (Jessie) Liu, Director and Chief Financial Officer of Tuya, added, ""The fourth quarter marked our transition from recovery to growth, efficiency enhancements, and margin expansion. During the quarter, all three business sectors recorded robust revenue growth, and their margins either improved or remained steady, a testament to the effectiveness of our product focus and enrichment strategy. Our strategic commitment to cost management and operational efficiency, coupled with the steady growth of gross profits, resulted in continued record-high non-GAAP net profits and positive net operating cashflow. As we advance into 2024, we are confident that Tuya's solid financial position and momentum will sustain our business expansion and product profitability."" Fourth Quarter 2023 Unaudited Financial Results REVENUE Total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 increased by 42.2% to US$64.4 million from US$45.3 million in the same period of 2022, mainly due to the increase in IoT PaaS revenue, SaaS and others revenue and smart device distribution revenue. IoT PaaS revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 increased by 44.6% to US$47.2 million from US$32.6 million in the same period of 2022, primarily due to the relief of downstream inventory backlog and a global economic improvement compared with the same period of 2022, along with the effective customer-focus and product-enhancement strategies the Company adopted to navigate through the macroeconomic headwinds. Correspondingly, the Company's DBNER of IoT PaaS for the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2023 increased to 103% from 51% for the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2022.SaaS and others revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 increased by 19.3% to US$9.5 million from US$7.9 million in the same period of 2022, primarily due to an increase in revenue from cloud software products. The Company remained committed to offering value-added services and a diverse range of software products with compelling value propositions to its customers.Smart device distribution revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 increased by 64.6% to US$7.8 million from US$4.7 million in the same period of 2022, primarily due to an increase in revenue from smart device solutions and the variations in the timing and volume of customer demands and purchases.COST OF REVENUE Cost of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 increased by 35.3% to US$33.9 million from US$25.1 million in the same period of 2022, generally in line with the increase in the Company's total revenue.

The Company had a non-GAAP net profit of US$12.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to a non-GAAP net loss of US$5.2 million in the same period of 2022, demonstrating the Company's ability to sustain profitability on a non-GAAP basis.

For further information on non-GAAP financial measures presented above, see the section headed ""Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures."" Business Outlook In the fourth quarter of 2023, we continued to observe a moderately declining yet persisting overall inflation, which is expected to continually influence the discretionary consumer electronics spending. On the supply chain front, we expect downstream inventory levels to be normalizing ongoingly, providing downstream smart device manufacturers, brands, and retail channels with greater flexibility and resilience to adapt their operational and procurement plans as necessary. This, in turn, will revitalize their investment in smart business. Overall, discretionary consumer electronic spending alongside enterprise procurement are expected to prioritize cost-effectiveness, reflecting a balanced approach widely adopted in the current economic climate. In response to this evolving market environment, the Company will remain committed to continuously iterating and improving its products and services, further enhancing software and hardware capabilities, expanding key customer base, investing in innovations and new opportunities, diversifying revenue streams, and further optimizing operating efficiency. At the same time, the Company understands that future trajectories may encounter challenges, including shifting consumer spending patterns, regional economic disparities, inventory management, foreign exchange rate volatility, and broader geopolitical uncertainties.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In evaluating the business, the Company considers and uses non-GAAP measures, such as non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP loss from operations (including non-GAAP operating margin), non-GAAP net (loss)/profit (including non-GAAP net margin), and non-GAAP basic and diluted net (loss)/profit per ADS, as supplemental measures to review and assess its operating performance. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (""U.S. GAAP""). The Company defines non-GAAP measures by excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses and credit-related impairment of long-term investments from the respective GAAP measures. The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by the management to evaluate its operating performance and formulate business plans. The Company also believes that the use of the non-GAAP measures facilitates investors' assessment of its operating performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using the aforementioned non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not reflect all items of expenses that affect the Company's operations. Share-based compensation expenses and credit-related impairment of long-term investments have been and may continue to be incurred in the business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures. Further, the non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. The Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. The Company encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. Reconciliations of Tuya's non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures are included at the end of this press release.

The company also disclosed an arrangement agreement with Blackstone for a full acquisition. Positive Strong same home NOI growth of 6.2% in Q4 2023. Core FFO per share was $0.15 in Q4 2023, a decrease of 51.6% year-over-year. Tricon acquired 264 homes and disposed of 135 non-core homes during the quarter. Entered into an arrangement agreement with Blackstone for a full acquisition. Company expects common shares to be delisted from NYSE and TSX post-acquisition. Financial highlights show a decrease in Core FFO and AFFO for Q4 2023 compared to the prior year. Revenue from single-family rental properties increased by 14.3% in Q4 2023. Interest expense increased to $80.3 million in Q4 2023 due to elevated benchmark interest rates. Tricon's liquidity stood at $501 million as of December 31, 2023. Achieved Core FFO per share and same home results near the midpoint of guidance for 2023. Quarterly dividend to be suspended during the pendency of the Arrangement Agreement. Negative Core FFO per share decreased by 51.6% year-over-year in Q4 2023. Net loss from continuing operations was $35.5 million in Q4 2023. Decrease in Core FFO and AFFO for Q4 2023 compared to the prior year. Company expects common shares to be delisted from NYSE and TSX post-acquisition. Financial Analyst The reported net loss from continuing operations of $35.5 million in Q4 2023 for Tricon Residential Inc. represents a significant shift from the net income of $55.9 million in the same quarter of the previous year. This change is primarily attributed to a reduction in the fair value gain on rental properties and a fair value loss on derivative financial instruments. The decrease in Core FFO by 52.9% year-over-year to $45.7 million is noteworthy, as it reflects the underlying operational performance without the distortion of non-recurring items like the prior year's performance fees. The decline in Core FFO per share from $0.31 to $0.15 suggests that investors may see a potential impact on dividend payments and share valuation.Tricon's acquisition of 264 homes and disposal of 135 non-core homes indicate active portfolio management, which is crucial for optimizing asset performance in the dynamic U.S. Sun Belt real estate market. However, the increase in interest expense due to higher benchmark interest rates could pressure profit margins if such trends persist. The pending acquisition by Blackstone at $11.25 per common share represents a substantial corporate event that could offer shareholders an exit opportunity at a premium, but it also signals the end of Tricon as a publicly traded entity, which will affect liquidity and market presence. Market Research Analyst The single-family rental (SFR) market has been a growing segment in the U.S. housing industry and Tricon's 6.2% year-over-year same home NOI growth indicates a robust demand and effective rent management. The consistent occupancy rate of 97.4% and blended rent growth of 6.0% are positive indicators of the market's resilience, even in the face of economic uncertainty and rising interest rates. The SFR sector's performance is particularly relevant given the broader context of housing affordability issues and shifting consumer preferences towards rental housing. Tricon's operational focus on this segment may offer stability despite broader market volatility.From an investment perspective, the Blackstone acquisition deal suggests a bullish outlook on the SFR and multi-family rental markets, especially in the Sun Belt region. Blackstone's move could be indicative of a trend where institutional investors are increasingly interested in residential real estate as a long-term investment. This could potentially drive up asset values and encourage further consolidation in the industry. Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) Analyst Tricon's performance metrics, such as NOI growth and Core FFO, are critical for evaluating its status as a real estate investment entity. The reported growth in rental revenue from single-family properties by 14.3% is a positive sign of the company's ability to leverage market conditions to increase revenue. However, the increase in direct operating expenses raises concerns about cost management and its impact on profitability. The balance sheet strength, with $501 million in total liquidity, provides a cushion for future investments or to weather potential market downturns.The anticipated completion of the acquisition by Blackstone in the second quarter of 2024 is a pivotal event that will likely lead to a reevaluation of Tricon's assets and investment strategy. Post-acquisition, the focus may shift to integration and optimizing the performance of the newly acquired assets. This acquisition is a significant development in the REIT sector and could influence market dynamics, including the pricing and availability of investment-grade rental properties. 02/27/2024 - 05:01 PM TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Tricon Residential Inc.

The Company's operational and financial highlights of the quarter include: Net loss from continuing operations was $35.5 million in Q4 2023; basic and diluted loss per share from continuing operations were both $0.14; Core funds from operations (""Core FFO"") was $45.7 million and Core FFO per share was $0.15 in Q4 2023, compared to $96.8 million and $0.31 in the prior year, a decrease of 52.9% and 51.6% year-over-year, respectively. The prior-year result included $50.3 million of net performance fees earned on the sale of the U.S. multi-family rental portfolio;1 Same home NOI growth for the single-family rental portfolio in Q4 2023 was 6.2% year-over-year and same home NOI margin was 69.3%. Same home operating metrics remained consistently strong, including occupancy of 97.4%, annualized turnover of 14.8% and blended rent growth of 6.0%;1 The Company acquired 264 homes during the quarter for a total acquisition cost of $75.6 million, and disposed of 135 non-core homes for total proceeds of $49.2 million; and On January 19, 2024, the Company announced that it had entered into an arrangement agreement (the ""Arrangement Agreement""), under which Blackstone Real Estate Partners X L.P. (“BREP X”) together with Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. (collectively with BREP X and their respective affiliates, “Blackstone”) will acquire all outstanding common shares of the Company and each holder of common shares (other than Blackstone and dissenting shareholders) will be entitled to receive $11.25 per common share in cash. The transactions contemplated by the Arrangement Agreement (collectively, the ""Transaction"") are expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2024 and are subject to customary closing conditions, including court approval, the approval of Tricon shareholders and regulatory approval under the Canadian Competition Act (which was obtained on February 19, 2024) and Investment Canada Act. Subject to and upon completion of the Transaction, the Company expects that the common shares will no longer be listed on the NYSE or TSX and that the Company will apply to cease to be a reporting issuer under applicable Canadian securities laws. “Tricon ended 2023 on a high note, with strong same home NOI growth of 6.2% and Core FFO per share of $0.56 for the year, solidly within the range of our financial guidance. We achieved these results in the face of economic uncertainty and rising interest rates, while delivering an exceptional resident experience”, said Gary Berman, President & CEO of Tricon. “I would like to commend the entire Tricon team for their commitment to resident satisfaction and operational excellence that are instrumental to our success.” Financial Highlights For the periods ended December 31 Three months Twelve months (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts which are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise indicated) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Financial highlights on a consolidated basis Net (loss) income from continuing operations, including: $ (35,470 ) $ 55,883 $ 121,824 $ 779,374 Fair value gain on rental properties 2,029 56,414 210,936 858,987 Basic (loss) earnings per share attributable to shareholders of Tricon from continuing operations (0.14 ) 0.19 0.42 2.82 Diluted (loss) earnings per share attributable to shareholders of Tricon from continuing operations (0.14 ) 0.11 0.41 1.98 Net income from discontinued operations — 1,829 — 35,106 Basic earnings per share attributable to shareholders of Tricon from discontinued operations — 0.01 — 0.13 Diluted earnings per share attributable to shareholders of Tricon from discontinued operations — 0.01 — 0.11 Dividends per share $ 0.058 $ 0.058 $ 0.232 $ 0.232 Weighted average shares outstanding - basic 273,847,034 274,684,779 273,657,451 274,483,264 Weighted average shares outstanding - diluted 275,664,083 311,222,080 275,543,799 311,100,493 Non-IFRS(1) measures on a proportionate basis Core funds from operations (""Core FFO"") $ 45,651 $ 96,841 $ 172,597 $ 237,288 Adjusted funds from operations (""AFFO"") 38,159 88,694 139,110 198,264 Core FFO per share(2) 0.15 0.31 0.56 0.76 AFFO per share(2) 0.12 0.28 0.45 0.64 (1) Non-IFRS measures are presented to illustrate alternative relevant measures to assess the Company's performance. For the basis of presentation of the Company’s non-IFRS measures and reconciliations, refer to the “Non-IFRS Measures” section and Appendix A. For definitions of the Company’s non-IFRS measures, refer to Section 6 of Tricon's MD&A. (2) Core FFO per share and AFFO per share are calculated using the total number of weighted average potential dilutive shares outstanding, including the assumed exchange of preferred units issued by Tricon PIPE LLC, which were 310,408,201 and 310,287,917 for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, and 311,222,080 and 311,100,493 for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022, respectively. Net loss from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $35.5 million compared to net income of $55.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, and included: Fair value gain on rental properties of $2.0 million compared to $56.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, attributable to a moderation in home price appreciation within the single-family rental portfolio. Fair value loss of $23.2 million on derivative financial instruments compared to a gain of $25.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, and foreign exchange loss of $13.9 million compared to $0.2 million in the prior year period. The fair value loss on derivative financial instruments was primarily driven by an unrealized loss on the exchange and redemption options associated with the preferred units issued by Tricon PIPE LLC, correlated with an increase in Tricon's share price. Revenue from single-family rental properties increased by 14.3% to $206.8 million from $180.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, driven primarily by growth of 3.6% in the single-family rental portfolio to 37,183 homes, a 3.2% increase in total portfolio occupancy to 95.0%, and a 5.2% year-over-year increase in average effective monthly rent. Direct operating expenses increased by 15.7% to $67.5 million from $58.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily reflecting an expansion in the rental portfolio and higher property tax expenses associated with increasing property value assessments, as well as general cost and labor market inflationary pressures. Revenue from strategic capital services (previously reported as Revenue from private funds and advisory services) of $19.6 million compared to $14.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily attributable to a $6.2 million increase in performance fees earned from the U.S. residential development portfolio, partially offset by a decrease in property management fees of $1.5 million following the Company's sale of the U.S. multi-family rental portfolio in October 2022. Interest expense of $80.3 million compared to $71.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, attributable to a 0.12% increase in the weighted average interest rate, driven by elevated benchmark interest rates, in addition to an increase in the outstanding debt balance ($5.8 billion as at December 31, 2023 compared to $5.7 billion as at December 31, 2022). Net income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $121.8 million compared to $779.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, and included: Fair value gain on rental properties of $210.9 million compared to $859.0 million in the prior year for the same reasons discussed above. Revenue from single-family rental properties of $795.3 million and direct operating expenses of $261.9 million compared to $645.6 million and $209.1 million in the prior year, respectively, which translated to a net operating income (""NOI"") increase of $96.9 million, attributable to the continued expansion of the single-family rental portfolio and strong rent growth. Revenue from strategic capital services of $54.5 million compared to $160.1 million in the prior year, primarily attributable to $99.9 million of performance fees earned from the sale of Tricon’s remaining 20% equity interest in the U.S. multi-family rental portfolio in October 2022. Interest expense of $316.5 million compared to $213.9 million in the prior year, primarily attributable to a 0.74% increase in the weighted average interest rate, as discussed above, in addition to a 14.4% increase in the average outstanding debt balance throughout the year. Core FFO for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $45.7 million, a decrease of $51.2 million or 53% compared to $96.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. A year-over-year variance of $50.3 million in Core FFO is attributable to net performance fees recognized in the fourth quarter of 2022 with respect to the sale of Tricon's remaining 20% equity interest in the U.S. multi-family rental portfolio. This reduction was partly offset by NOI growth in the SFR business and strong performance from U.S. residential developments. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, Core FFO decreased by $64.7 million or 27% to $172.6 million compared to $237.3 million in the prior year, for the reasons noted above. AFFO for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023 was $38.2 million and $139.1 million, respectively, a decrease of $50.5 million (57%) and $59.2 million (30%) from the same periods in the prior year. This change in AFFO was driven by the decrease in Core FFO discussed above, partially offset by lower recurring capital expenditures as a result of disciplined cost containment and scoping refinement when turning homes, and the absence of recurring capital expenditures from the U.S. multi-family rental portfolio following its sale. Single-Family Rental Operating Highlights The measures presented in the table below and throughout this press release are on a proportionate basis, reflecting only the portion attributable to Tricon's shareholders based on the Company's ownership percentage of the underlying entities and exclude the percentage associated with non-controlling and limited partners' interests, unless otherwise stated. A list of these measures, together with a description of the information each measure reflects and the reasons why management believes the measure to be useful or relevant in evaluating the underlying performance of the Company’s businesses, is set out in Section 6 of Tricon's MD&A. For the periods ended December 31 Three months Twelve months (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except percentages and homes) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Total rental homes managed 37,716 36,259 Total proportionate net operating income (NOI)(1) $ 80,300 $ 73,744 $ 309,538 $ 275,543 Total proportionate net operating income (NOI) growth(1) 8.9 % 24.2 % 12.3 % 24.3 % Same home net operating income (NOI) margin(1) 69.3 % 69.8 % 69.0 % 69.0 % Same home net operating income (NOI) growth(1) 6.2 % N/A 6.2 % N/A Same home occupancy 97.4 % 97.6 % 97.4 % 97.8 % Same home annualized turnover 14.8 % 13.2 % 16.8 % 17.2 % Same home average quarterly rent growth - renewal 6.6 % 6.8 % 6.6 % 6.5 % Same home average quarterly rent growth - new move-in 3.7 % 9.8 % 7.7 % 15.5 % Same home average quarterly rent growth - blended 6.0 % 7.3 % 6.9 % 8.2 % (1) Non-IFRS measures are presented to illustrate alternative relevant measures to assess the Company's performance. For the basis of presentation of the Company’s non-IFRS measures and reconciliations, refer to the “Non-IFRS Measures” section and Appendix A. For definitions of the Company’s non-IFRS measures, refer to Section 6 of Tricon's MD&A. Single-family rental NOI was $80.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of $6.6 million or 8.9% compared to the same period in 2022. The growth in NOI was primarily attributable to a $9.9 million or 9.6% increase in rental revenues as a result of a 5.5% increase in the average monthly rent ($1,837 in Q4 2023 compared to $1,741 in Q4 2022), 2.5% portfolio growth (Tricon's proportionate share of rental homes was 21,994 in Q4 2023 compared to 21,464 in Q4 2022), and a 0.4% increase in occupancy (94.6% in Q4 2023 compared to 94.2% in Q4 2022). This favorable growth in rental revenue was partially offset by a $4.4 million or 12.9% increase in direct operating expenses reflecting incremental costs associated with a larger portfolio of homes, higher property taxes from increased assessed property values, elevated property management costs reflecting a tighter labor market and higher other direct costs associated with smart-home technology and higher utility rates. Single-family rental same home NOI growth was 6.2% in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same period last year. This favorable change was driven by a 6.9% increase in revenue from rental properties as a result of a 5.9% higher average monthly rent ($1,782 in Q4 2023 compared to $1,682 in Q4 2022), and an improvement in bad debt (0.6% in Q4 2023 compared to 1.3% in Q4 2022), partially offset by slightly lower occupancy (97.4% in Q4 2023 compared to 97.6% in Q4 2022). Same home operating expense increased by 8.5%, attributable primarily to a 14.5% increase in property taxes, partially offset by proactive cost containment in repair and maintenance expenses. Single-Family Rental Investment Activity The Company expanded its single-family rental portfolio during the quarter by acquiring 264 homes (254 wholly-owned homes for $71.2 million and ten homes owned through joint ventures for $4.4 million), bringing its total managed portfolio to 37,716 homes. The homes were purchased at an average cost per home of $286,000, including up-front renovations, for a total acquisition cost of $75.6 million, of which Tricon's share was approximately $72.6 million. During the quarter, Tricon also disposed of 135 homes for a total of $49.2 million (132 wholly-owned homes for $48.5 million and three homes owned through joint ventures for $0.7 million) at an average price of $365,000 per home. Adjacent Residential Businesses Highlights Quarterly highlights of the Company's adjacent residential businesses include: In the Canadian multi-family business, the proportionate total portfolio's occupancy remained strong at 96.9%, and included The Taylor as a stabilized property for the first time this quarter. At The Selby, annualized turnover was 17.6% compared to 24.0% during the same period in the prior year. Blended rent growth was 6.6% during the quarter, driven by healthy new-lease and renewal rent growth. In Tricon's Canadian residential development portfolio, The Ivy welcomed its first residents to the 231-unit mixed-use rental community during the quarter, and 15% of the building was leased as of December 31, 2023. Leasing velocity at Maple House continued to gain momentum, with 34% of its units leased as of December 31, 2023, reflecting the positive market response to Maple House’s location, design and architecture. Tricon's investments in U.S. residential developments generated $20.4 million of distributions to the Company in Q4 2023, including $6.2 million in performance fees. The U.S. residential developments also generated investment income of $6.9 million, an increase of $3.0 million from the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by strong demand for new housing, bolstered by builders offering customer incentives to maintain a healthy sales velocity despite escalating mortgage rates. Balance Sheet and Liquidity Tricon's liquidity consists of a $500 million corporate credit facility with approximately $330 million of undrawn capacity as at December 31, 2023. The Company also had approximately $171 million of unrestricted cash on hand, resulting in total liquidity of $501 million. As at December 31, 2023, Tricon’s pro-rata net debt (excluding exchangeable instruments) was $3.0 billion, reflecting a pro-rata net debt to assets ratio of 37.4%. For the three months ended December 31, 2023, Tricon's pro-rata net debt to Adjusted EBITDAre ratio was 8.4x.2 2023 Guidance Update The following table shows the most recent guidance and actual results for the Company's Core FFO per share, same home metrics and acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2023.

All such forward-looking information and statements involve risks and uncertainties and are based on management’s current expectations, intentions and assumptions in light of its understanding of relevant current market conditions, its business plans, and its prospects. If unknown risks arise, or if any of the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements prove incorrect, actual results may differ materially from management expectations as projected in such forward-looking statements. Examples of such risks include, but are not limited to, the failure to obtain necessary approvals or satisfy (or obtain a waiver of) the conditions to closing the Transaction, the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the Transaction, the Company or Blackstone’s failure to consummate the Transaction when required or on the terms as originally negotiated, risks related to the disruption of management time from ongoing business operations due to the Transaction and possible difficulties in maintaining customer, supplier, key personnel and other strategic relationships, potential litigation relating to the Transaction, including the effects of any outcomes related thereto, the Company's inability to execute its growth strategies; the impact of changing economic and market conditions, increasing competition and the effect of fluctuations and cycles in the Canadian and U.S. real estate markets; changes in the attitudes, financial condition and demand of the Company's demographic markets; rising interest rates and volatility in financial markets; the potential impact of reduced supply of labor and materials on expected costs and timelines; rates of inflation and economic uncertainty; developments and changes in applicable laws and regulations; and the aftermath of COVID-19.

Non-IFRS Measures The Company has included herein certain non-IFRS financial measures and non-IFRS ratios, including, but not limited to: ""proportionate"" metrics, net operating income (""NOI""), NOI margin, funds from operations (""FFO""), core funds from operations (""Core FFO""), adjusted funds from operations (""AFFO""), Core FFO per share, AFFO per share, Adjusted EBITDAre as well as certain key indicators of the performance of our businesses which are supplementary financial measures. These measures are commonly used by entities in the real estate industry as useful metrics for measuring performance. We utilize these measures in managing our business, including performance measurement and capital allocation. In addition, certain of these measures are used in measuring compliance with our debt covenants. We believe that providing these performance measures on a supplemental basis is helpful to investors and shareholders in assessing the overall performance of the Company’s business. However, these measures are not recognized under and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS as issued by the IASB, and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other publicly traded entities. These measures should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for related financial information prepared in accordance with IFRS. Because non-IFRS financial measures, non-IFRS ratios and supplementary financial measures do not have standardized meanings prescribed under IFRS, securities regulations require that such measures be clearly defined, identified, and reconciled to their nearest IFRS measure. The calculation and reconciliation of the non-IFRS financial measures and the requisite disclosure for non-IFRS ratios used herein are provided in Appendix A below. The definitions of the Company’s non-IFRS measures are provided in the ""Glossary and Defined Terms"" section as well as Section 6 of Tricon's MD&A. The non-IFRS financial measures, non-IFRS ratios and supplementary financial measures presented herein should not be construed as alternatives to net income (loss) or cash flow from the Company’s activities, determined in accordance with IFRS, as indicators of Tricon’s financial performance. Tricon’s method of calculating these measures may differ from other issuers’ methods and, accordingly, these measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other publicly-traded entities.

Performance fees are paid and deducted in arriving at Core FFO only when the associated fee revenue has been realized. (2) Recurring capital expenditures represent ongoing costs associated with maintaining and preserving the quality of a property after it has been renovated.

(3) Adjusted EBITDAre is a non-IFRS measure. Refer to the ""Glossary and Defined Terms"" section for definition and the Reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDAre table above. Glossary and Defined Terms The non-IFRS financial measures, non-IFRS ratios and KPI supplementary financial measures discussed throughout this press release for each of the Company’s business segments are calculated based on Tricon's proportionate share of each portfolio or business and are defined and discussed below and in Section 6 of the MD&A, which definitions and discussion are incorporated herein by reference. These measures are commonly used by entities in the real estate industry as useful metrics for measuring performance; however, they do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other publicly-traded entities. These measures should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with IFRS. See Appendix A for a reconciliation to IFRS financial measures where applicable. Adjusted EBITDAre is a metric that management believes to be helpful in evaluating the Company’s operating performance across and within the real estate industry. Further, management considers it to be a more accurate reflection of the Company’s leverage ratio, especially as it adjusts for and negates non-recurring and non-cash items. The Company’s definition of EBITDAre reflects all adjustments that are specified by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). In addition to the adjustments prescribed by NAREIT, Tricon excludes fair value gains that arise as a result of reporting under IFRS. EBITDAre represents net income from continuing operations, excluding the impact of interest expense, income tax expense, amortization and depreciation expense, fair value changes on rental properties, fair value changes on derivative financial instruments and adjustments to reflect the entity’s share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated entities. Adjusted EBITDAre is a normalized figure and is defined as EBITDAre before stock-based compensation, unrealized and realized foreign exchange gains and losses, transaction costs and other non-recurring items, and reflects only Tricon’s share of results from consolidated entities (by removing non-controlling interests’ and limited partners’ share of reconciling items). The Company also discloses its Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDAre ratio to assist investors in accounting for the Company’s unconsolidated joint ventures and equity-accounted investments, in both debt and Adjusted EBITDAre, by calculating pro-rata leverage on a look-through basis (excluding debt directly related to the Canadian development portfolio as well as warehouse and subscription facilities related to acquisitions of vacant single-family homes, which do not fully contribute to Adjusted EBITDAre). Cost to maintain is defined as the annualized repairs and maintenance expense, turnover expense net of applicable resident recoveries and recurring capital expenditures per home in service. The metric provides insight into the costs needed to maintain a property's current condition and is indicative of a portfolio's operational efficiency. Pro-rata net assets represents the Company's proportionate share of total consolidated assets as well as assets of non-consolidated entities on a look-through basis (which are shown as equity-accounted investments on its proportionate balance sheet), less its cash and restricted cash. Pro-rata net debt represents the Company's total current and long-term debt per its consolidated financial statements, less its cash and restricted cash (excluding debt directly related to the Canadian development portfolio as well as warehouse and subscription facilities related to acquisitions of vacant single-family homes, which do not fully contribute to Adjusted EBITDAre). ____________________ 1 Non-IFRS measures are presented to illustrate alternative relevant measures to assess the Company's performance.

ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER AND TOTAL YEAR 2023 RESULTS Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary TETRA Technologies, Inc. (TTI) reported fourth quarter revenue of $153.1 million, a 4% increase year-over-year, with adjusted net income improving by 51%.

Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $24.1 million, up 19% year-over-year, and total year Adjusted EBITDA increased by 37%. The company achieved various strategic milestones, including approval for a lithium production project in Arkansas. TETRA's financial performance in 2023 showcased strong growth and progress in generating cash flow, with a focus on long-term shareholder value. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported quarterly and annual financial results of TETRA Technologies showcase a mixed performance with a modest year-over-year revenue growth of 4% in Q4 and a significant increase in annual income from continuing operations by 235%. The adjusted net income improvement and a substantial boost in Adjusted EBITDA by 37% year-over-year are particularly noteworthy, indicating enhanced operational efficiency and cost management.From a financial perspective, the notable increase in Adjusted EBITDA margins and the conversion rate of nearly 40% of Adjusted EBITDA to adjusted free cash flow suggest a robust underlying business capable of generating cash, which is critical for funding ongoing investments and reducing leverage. The reported net leverage ratio of 1.13X, down from the previous year, alongside a strong liquidity position, presents a healthy balance sheet that could be attractive to investors seeking companies with financial stability and growth potential. Market Research Analyst Analyzing the strategic milestones mentioned, such as the approval of the Evergreen Brine Unit for future bromine and lithium production, indicates TETRA's pivot towards capitalizing on the growing demand for lithium, essential for batteries in electric vehicles and energy storage solutions. The reported highest lithium concentration in the U.S. for a SK-1300, NI-43-101, or JORC-compliant technical report summary could position TETRA as a significant player in the lithium market, potentially impacting its long-term valuation and stock performance.The expansion of the partnership with Eos Energy Enterprises and the designation as a preferred supplier for electrolyte products for Eos' Z3™ energy storage cube also aligns with the broader industry trend towards renewable energy solutions. This expansion could open additional revenue streams and diversify the company's portfolio, which is vital in the face of volatile energy markets. Energy Sector Analyst The reported slowdown in the Water & Flowback Services business due to seasonal factors and customer destocking activities in the industrial chemicals segment could be a short-term challenge but is not uncommon in the industry. The anticipated recovery in the first half of 2024, as well as the growth in offshore completion fluids business, suggests a temporary dip rather than a long-term concern. Moreover, the technology and automation initiatives that allowed for strong Adjusted EBITDA margins, despite a significant reduction in active frac fleets, demonstrate TETRA's resilience and adaptability in a highly cyclical industry.The focus on produced water desalination for beneficial re-use projects reflects an innovative approach to addressing environmental concerns associated with hydraulic fracturing, potentially enhancing the company's reputation and aligning with increasing investor interest in environmentally responsible operations. 02/27/2024 - 05:00 PM Fourth quarter revenue of $153.1 million increased 4% year-over-year.Fourth quarter net loss before discontinued operations was $4.2 million and net loss per share was $0.03.

Adjusted free cash flow for 2023 was $41 million, an improvement of $62 million year-over-year.THE WOODLANDS, Texas, Feb. 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- TETRA Technologies, Inc. (""TETRA"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE:TTI) today announced fourth quarter and total year 2023 results. Brady Murphy, TETRA's President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, ""2023 was a historical year for TETRA with numerous financial records and strategic milestones achieved that will have a significant impact for the Company for years to come. Financial highlights for the year include 2.4 times growth in income from continuing operations, 37% growth in Adjusted EBITDA, 710 basis points improvement in return on net capital employed to 20.5%1, 2.7 times improvement in cash flow from operations and a conversion rate of nearly 40% of Adjusted EBITDA to adjusted free cash flow. Excluding the impact of working capital, our total year 2023 adjusted free cash flow was the highest since 2015 demonstrating progress on generating cash. As of December 2023, our net leverage ratio was 1.13X and liquidity was $126 million. Recent strategic milestones achieved include: the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission (""AOGC"") unanimously approving the 6,138-acre Evergreen Brine Unit, a combination of TETRA and Saltwerx (a wholly owned subsidiary of ExxonMobil) brine leases for the purpose of future bromine and lithium production, and completing a lithium and bromine resource report for the Evergreen Brine Unit. Due to the richness of the lithium concentration and the favorable Smackover reservoir properties, the resource report estimated 22 tons per acre of total lithium resources for the Evergreen Brine Unit, which is believed to be the highest to date of any lithium brine resource in the U.S. for which a SK-1300, NI-43-101 or JORC-compliant technical report summary has been published. We also completed the engineering design for our first commercial produced water beneficial re-use project with a planned deployment later this year. And in January 2024, we further strengthened our balance sheet by refinancing, extending, and expanding our term loan, at a more attractive interest rate than our prior term loan. We enter 2024 with a strong and growing base business, a solid balance sheet, over $200 million of liquidity (following the term loan refinancing and inclusive of a $75 million delayed draw feature to fund our bromine project), with a constructive outlook for our products and services. We anticipate further growth in 2024 and expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow from our base business to fund investments in our Arkansas projects. The combination of these plus advances with our produced water beneficial re-use solution, our Arkansas resource position and strategic partnerships provides us the opportunity to continue to drive long-term shareholder value."" Fourth Quarter Results Fourth quarter 2023 revenue of $153 million increased 1% from the third quarter of 2023 reflecting the early production facility (""EPF"") sale in Argentina, partially offset by lower than usual onshore year-end activity in the United States and some customer year-end inventory de-stocking for our industrial chemicals business. Net loss before discontinued operations was $4.2 million, inclusive of $8.0 million of non-recurring charges and expenses and compares to net income from continuing operations of $5.5 million in the third quarter of 2023, inclusive of $3.7 million of non-recurring charges and expenses. Net loss per share from continuing operations in the fourth quarter was $0.03 and compares to net income per share of $0.04 in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted net income per share from continuing operations was $0.03 in the fourth quarter, which compares to $0.07 in the third quarter 2023. Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA of $24.1 million increased 19% year-on-year from $20.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 but decreased 7% from $26.1 million in the third quarter of 2023 reflecting a good cash generating EPF sale in Argentina but lower year-end onshore and industrial chemicals activity. Fourth quarter results included unrealized mark-to-market gains on investments of $0.7 million. Excluding these unrealized gains on investments, Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $23.4 million (15.3% of revenue) and was up 13% year-on-year. Fourth quarter cash flow from operating activities was $18.9 million and compares to a use of cash of $7.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and to cash flow from operating activities of $14.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted free cash flow was $20.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and compares to a use of cash of $14.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and to cash flow of $7.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. Working capital at the end of year was $104 million and compares to $110 million at the end the third quarter of 2023 and to working capital of $101 million at end of 2022. Working capital is defined as current assets, excluding cash and restricted cash, less current liabilities. Brady Murphy, further stated, ""Our Water & Flowback Services business experienced the first slowdown in many quarters, as several customers paused activity over the holidays; we believe in large part because many achieved production targets well ahead of year-end. This combined with some year-end customer destocking activity in our industrial chemicals business resulted in lower activity and lower Adjusted EBITDA compared to the third quarter. However, as we look to the first half of 2024, including our traditional northern Europe seasonal industrial chemicals ramp up in the second quarter, we are seeing a strong recovery in our chemicals business, continued strong activity in our offshore completion fluids business and modest growth in our Water & Flowback Services segment. Water & Flowback Services revenue for the fourth quarter was $81 million up $2.3 million (3.0%), quarter-over-quarter but declined $1 million (1%) year-on-year. Excluding the EPF sale in Argentina, fourth quarter revenue would have been $75 million. Income before taxes was $2.9 million while Adjusted EBITDA of $11.3 million declined $0.8 million (7%) year-on-year. Excluding the EPF sale, Adjusted EBITDA margins would have been 15% for the fourth quarter, down 400 basis points sequentially due to the lower year-end activity. For the total year, our Water & Flowback Services revenue grew by $33 million (12%) while income before taxes increased by $10 million (64%) and Adjusted EBITDA increased $10 million (23%), yielding an Adjusted EBITDA fall-through of nearly 30% for the year. Total year Water & Flowback Services revenue of $313 million exceeded our total year 2018 revenue with strong Adjusted EBITDA margins, despite 50% lower active frac fleets reflecting our technology and automation initiatives. ""As reported last quarter, we sold one of the three EPFs in Argentina to the operator for an amount of more than $5 million, with all the cash proceeds received in October. We completed an EPF expansion project in January for the same customer and will continue to operate and maintain the EPF for a fixed monthly fee. ""We recently completed the engineering design for our first produced water desalination plant for beneficial re-use applications and are in advanced commercial discussions with one of the largest North America shale producers for their beneficial re-use project which we expect to have awarded shortly. We are also in negotiations with the same customer for a second project, in the Permian Basin, for a commercial demonstration pilot project. ""Completion Fluids & Products also experienced a year-end slowdown driven by industrial chemicals, as several customers went through destocking activities. This also appears to be a seasonal event as activity has rebounded sharply to start the year and we expect the first half of 2024 to be above the second half of 2023. Completion Fluids & Products fourth-quarter 2023 revenue of $73 million decreased $0.7 million (1%), from the third quarter of 2023 but increased $6.3 million (10%) from the fourth quarter of 2022. Income before taxes was $11.0 million in the fourth quarter (15.1% of revenue) compared to $16.9 million (23% of revenue) in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA of $18 million decreased $2.6 million sequentially. Completion Fluids & Products Adjusted EBITDA margins were 25.3% in the fourth quarter compared to 28.6% in the third quarter of 2023 as margins were impacted by lower utilization and lower production volumes. The fourth quarter included $0.6 million in unrealized mark-to-market losses from investments. Excluding unrealized mark-to-market losses from investments, Adjusted EBITDA margins were 26%. For the total year, Completion Fluids & Products revenue grew by $40 million (15%) while income before taxes increased by $21 million (37%) and Adjusted EBITDA increased $22 million (32%), yielding an Adjusted EBITDA fall-through of nearly 55%. Total year Completion Fluids & Products revenue of $313 million is the highest since 2015 when we completed two large TETRA CS Neptune® projects in the Gulf of Mexico. Total revenue attributed to offshore projects increased 11% year-over-year. We anticipate further growth in 2024 as our pipeline of offshore projects continues to build. ""In January 2024, Eos Energy Enterprises, Inc. (""Eos"") announced that it expanded its partnership with TETRA and designated TETRA as its preferred strategic supplier for the full electrolyte products for Eos' Z3™ long duration energy storage cube. This new agreement expands TETRA's participation to provide a minimum of 75% of Eos' total electrolyte demand going forward. Having recently visited Eos' automated battery assembly line being designed and tested in Milwaukee, we are pleased to see the progress and expect to see a material ramp up in electrolyte deliveries during the second half of 2024. ""During January we updated the previously reported resources report for bromine and lithium in Arkansas. The updated resources report, which now includes measured resources, in addition to indicated and inferred resources, resulted in 3 times more volume of lithium versus what was in the previous report, and slightly higher bromine resources. With TETRA's current liquidity, including the $75 million delayed draw feature and anticipated 2024 and 2025 free cash flow, TETRA believes it has secured the required capital to advance its bromine processing facility, subject to a final investment decision. TETRA continues to work on completing a Front-End Engineering and Design study (""FEED"") for the lithium processing facility project and a detailed engineering study for the bromine processing facility, which are expected to be completed late in the first quarter of 2024 or early in the second quarter of 2024."" This press release includes the following financial measures that are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""GAAP""): Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of revenue) on consolidated and segment basis, adjusted income/(loss) from continuing operations, adjusted free cash flow from continuing operations, and net debt. Please see Schedules D through J for definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 1 Return on net capital employed is earnings before interest and taxes divided by average net capital employed. See Schedule J. A summary of key financial metrics for the fourth quarter are as follows: Fourth Quarter 2023 Results Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 (in thousands, except per share amounts) Revenue $ 153,126 $ 151,464 $ 147,448 Income (loss) before discontinued operations (4,239) 5,468 (1,829) Adjusted EBITDA before discontinued operations 24,142 26,059 20,341 GAAP income (loss) earnings per share from continuing operations (0.03) 0.04 (0.01) Adjusted net income per share from continuing operations 0.03 0.07 0.02 GAAP net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 18,875 13,974 (6,991) Adjusted free cash flow from continuing operations $ 20,073 $ 7,073 $ (14,228) Free Cash Flow and Balance Sheet At the end of the fourth quarter, unrestricted cash was $52 million and availability under our credit agreements was $74 million. Liquidity at the end of the year was $126.3 million. As of February 26, 2024, liquidity was approximately $212 million, inclusive of the $75.0 million delayed draw feature that is available to TETRA for the bromine project. Liquidity is defined as unrestricted cash plus availability under our revolving credit facilities and includes the delayed draw feature. Long-term debt was $158 million, while net debt was $105 million. TETRA's net leverage ratio was 1.13X at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. As previously announced, in January 2024, the Company entered into a definitive agreement for a $265 million credit facility with a maturity of January 2030, consisting of a $190 million funded term loan and a $75 million delayed draw term loan (collectively the ""New Term Credit Agreement"") that refinanced the Company's $163 million Term Credit Agreement outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and provides capital to advance the Company's Arkansas bromine processing project. Pricing on the New Term Credit Agreement is the secured overnight financing rate plus 575 basis points, which is 50 basis points lower than the prior term loan. The Company used the proceeds to repay in full the balance of the previous Term Credit Agreement, pay transaction expenses and add cash to TETRA's balance sheet. Fourth Quarter Non-Recurring Charges and Expenses Fourth quarter 2023 non-recurring charges and expenses are reflected on Schedule E and include $2.7 million of engineering and other consulting expenses incurred toward advancing the Company's efforts to quantify the costs and economics on the potential development of its Arkansas bromine and lithium resources, inclusive of a FEED study and net of reimbursements from Saltwerx.

Schedule D: Statement Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to financial results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, this press release may include the following non-GAAP financial measures for the Company: adjusted net income per share; consolidated and segment Adjusted EBITDA; segment Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of revenue (""Adjusted EBITDA margin""); adjusted net income, adjusted free cash flow; net debt, net leverage ratio, and return on capital employed. The following schedules provide reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as more fully discussed in the Company's financial statements and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management believes that the exclusion of the special charges and credits from the historical results of operations enables management to evaluate more effectively the Company's operations over the prior periods and to identify operating trends that could be obscured by the excluded items. Adjusted net income is defined as the Company's income before noncontrolling interests and discontinued operations, excluding certain special or other charges (or credits), and including noncontrolling interest attributable to continued operations. Adjusted net income is used by management as a supplemental financial measure to assess financial performance, without regard to charges or credits that are considered by management to be outside of its normal operations. Adjusted net income per share is defined as the Company's diluted net income per share attributable to TETRA stockholders excluding certain special or other charges (or credits). Adjusted net income per share is used by management as a supplemental financial measure to assess financial performance, without regard to charges or credits that are considered by management to be outside of its normal operations. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before taxes and discontinued operations, excluding impairments, exploration and pre-development costs, income from collaborative arrangement, certain special, non-recurring or other charges (or credits), interest, depreciation and amortization and certain non-cash items such as equity-based compensation expense. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is net income (loss) before taxes and discontinued operations. Exploration and pre-development costs represent expenditures incurred to evaluate potential future development of TETRA's lithium and bromine properties in Arkansas. Such costs include exploratory drilling and associated engineering studies. Income from collaborative arrangement represents the portion of exploration and pre-development costs that are reimbursable by our strategic partner. Exploration and pre-development costs and the associated income from collaborative arrangement are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA because they do not relate to the Company's current business operations. Adjustments to long-term incentives represent cumulative adjustments to valuation of long-term cash incentive compensation awards that are related to prior years. These costs are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA because they do not relate to the current year and are considered to be outside of normal operations. Long-term incentives are earned over a three-year period and the costs are recorded over the three-year period they are earned. The amounts accrued or incurred are based on a cumulative of the three-year period. Equity-based compensation expense represents compensation that has been or will be paid in equity and is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA because it is a non-cash item. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management as a supplemental financial measure to assess financial performance, without regard to charges or credits that are considered by management to be outside of its normal operations and without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis, and to assess the Company's ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures net of sales proceeds and cost of equipment sold, less payments on financing lease obligations and including cash distributions to TETRA from CSI Compressco and cash from other investments. Management uses this supplemental financial measure to: assess the Company's ability to retire debt;evaluate the capacity of the Company to further invest and grow; andto measure the performance of the Company as compared to its peer group.Adjusted free cash flow does not necessarily imply residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, as they exclude cash requirements for debt service or other non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted. Net debt is defined as the sum of the carrying value of long-term and short-term debt on its consolidated balance sheet, less cash, excluding restricted cash on the balance sheet. Management views net debt as a measure of TETRA's ability to reduce debt, add to cash balances, pay dividends, repurchase stock, and fund investing and financing activities. Net leverage ratio is defined as debt excluding financing fees and discount on term loan and including letters of credit and guarantees, less cash divided by trailing twelve months adjusted EBITDA for credit facilities. Adjusted EBITDA for credit facilities consists of adjusted EBITDA described above, less non-cash (gain) loss on sale of investments, (gain) loss on sales of assets and excluding certain special or other charges (or credits). Management primarily uses this metric to assess TETRA's ability to borrow, reduce debt, add to cash balances, pay distributions, and fund investing and financing activities. Return on capital employed is defined as Adjusted EBIT divided by average net capital employed. Adjusted EBIT is defined as net income (loss) before taxes and discontinued operations, interest, and certain non-cash charges, and non-recurring adjustments. Net capital employed is defined as assets, excluding assets associated with discontinued operations, plus impaired assets, less cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, and less current liabilities, excluding current liabilities associated with discontinued operations. Average net capital employed is calculated as the average of the beginning and ending net capital employed for the respective periods. Return on capital employed is used by management as a supplemental financial measure to assess the financial performance of the Company relative to assets, without regard to financing methods or capital structure.

Negative The company reported a decrease in net production and adjusted net income compared to the previous year. CRC experienced a net loss from commodity derivatives in the fourth quarter of 2023. The merger with Aera Energy involves assuming a significant amount of long-term indebtedness, which may impact CRC's financial position. The transaction with Aera is subject to regulatory approvals and shareholder consent, posing potential delays or obstacles to the closing timeline. Financial Analyst The reported financial results by California Resources Corporation (CRC) indicate a robust financial performance with a record generation of net cash from operating activities and free cash flow per share. The company's strategic capital allocation and cost-saving initiatives have resulted in a significant reduction in leverage ratio, from 0.3 times to 0.1 times. This demonstrates a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. The substantial return of $280 million to stakeholders, representing over half of the free cash flow, underscores CRC's commitment to shareholder returns. This could potentially attract investors looking for companies with a high free cash flow yield and a strong commitment to returning capital to shareholders.However, investors should be mindful of the volatility of commodity prices, which can affect CRC's financials, as evidenced by the net loss from commodity derivatives. The merger with Aera Energy is another critical factor to consider as it could enhance CRC's operating scale and improve cash flows. However, mergers carry execution risks and the potential for integration challenges. The impact on the stock will depend on how well CRC manages these risks and capitalizes on the synergies from the merger. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, CRC's performance and strategic initiatives, such as the anticipated merger with Aera Energy, are poised to reshape the company's market position. The merger is expected to provide CRC with greater scale, which could lead to enhanced competitive advantages in the oil and gas industry. Additionally, the focus on carbon management and the receipt of draft Class VI well permits for CO2 injection and storage positions CRC favorably in the context of environmental sustainability and could appeal to environmentally conscious investors.Furthermore, the company's production efficiency, as indicated by a lower-than-expected total capital delivering a modest gross production decline, suggests operational excellence. This operational efficiency may reflect positively on CRC's market reputation and could influence investor sentiment. The company's future outlook, bolstered by sustainable cost savings, may be seen as an indicator of long-term value creation, potentially impacting the stock's attractiveness to long-term investors. Energy Sector Analyst Looking at the energy sector specifics, CRC's average realized oil prices being 99% of Brent is indicative of their strong pricing power and favorable market conditions. The strategic focus on carbon management and the receipt of draft Class VI well permits are significant steps towards the decarbonization of California. These initiatives not only align with regulatory trends towards sustainability but also open up potential new revenue streams in carbon capture and storage, a growing sub-sector in the energy industry.The capital efficiency and production metrics reflect positively on CRC's operational capabilities. In an industry where cost management is as critical as revenue generation, CRC's demonstrated ability to achieve sustainable cost savings while maintaining production levels is commendable. Such operational efficiency is crucial for maintaining competitiveness, especially in a volatile price environment characteristic of the oil and gas industry. 02/27/2024 - 05:15 PM CRC Delivers Record Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow per Share Annual Results LONG BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- California Resources Corporation (NYSE: CRC) today reported financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2023.

See Carbon TerraVault's 2023 Update for additional information ""Our 2023 results were exceptional, and our teams executed on our plan to build a stronger CRC while creating long-term value for all stakeholders,"" said Francisco Leon, CRC’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “We profitably grew our business and generated significant free cash flow that maintained our premier balance sheet and allowed us to prioritize cash returns to our shareholders. Our focus now is on securing the requisite approvals to close the recently announced merger with Aera Energy, while preparing for integration of their experienced team members and high value assets into CRC after closing. The Aera merger will provide CRC greater operating scale for the entire business, thereby improving our operating cash flows and liquidity profile. The Aera assets will also enhance CRC’s carbon management business from which CRC will accelerate the decarbonization of California.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial and Operating Summary The Company reported fourth quarter net cash from operating activities of $131 million and free cash flow1 of $65 million.

PV-10 AND STANDARDIZED MEASURE The following table presents a reconciliation of the GAAP financial measure of Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows (Standardized Measure) to the non-GAAP financial measure of PV-10: ($ millions) December 31, 2023 Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows $ 4,069 Present value of future income taxes discounted at 10% 1,464 PV-10 of cash flows (*) $ 5,533 (*) PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents the year-end present value of estimated future cash inflows from proved oil and natural gas reserves, less future development and operating costs, discounted at 10% per annum to reflect the timing of future cash flows and using SEC prescribed pricing assumptions for the period. PV-10 differs from Standardized Measure because Standardized Measure includes the effects of future income taxes on future net cash flows. Neither PV-10 nor Standardized Measure should be construed as the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves. Standardized Measure is prescribed by the SEC as an industry standard asset value measure to compare reserves with consistent pricing costs and discount assumptions. PV-10 facilitates the comparisons to other companies as it is not dependent on the tax-paying status of the entity. Pending Aera Merger On February 7, 2024, CRC entered into a definitive merger agreement (Merger Agreement) to combine with Aera Energy, LLC (Aera) in an all-stock transaction with an effective date of January 1, 2024. Aera is a leading operator of mature fields in California, primarily in the San Joaquin and Ventura basins, with high oil-weighted production. At closing, Aera's owners will receive 21.2 million shares of CRC's common stock plus an additional number of shares determined by reference to the dividends declared by CRC having a record date between the effective date and closing. CRC also agreed to assume Aera’s outstanding long-term indebtedness of $950 million. CRC expects to repay a significant portion of this indebtedness with cash on hand and borrowings under its revolving credit facility. CRC expects to refinance the balance through one or more debt capital markets transactions and, only to the extent necessary, borrowings under a bridge loan facility. The Merger Agreement has been unanimously approved by CRC’s Board of Directors and the shareholders of Aera. The transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including among others, regulatory approvals and approval of the stock issuance by CRC's shareholders. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2024. For more information about this transaction please visit: https://www.crc.com/news/news-details/2024/California-Resources-Corporation-to-Combine-with-Aera-Energy/default.aspx 2024 Preliminary Outlook and First Quarter 2024 Guidance and Capital Program2 CRC’s 2024 guidance estimates exclude the pending merger with Aera. The Company intends to update guidance after the transaction closes. CRC expects its total 2024 capital program to range between $300 million and $340 million assuming normal operating conditions. Of this amount, $250 million to $260 million is related to oil and natural gas development, $30 million to $40 million is related to maintenance of one of its gas processing facilities and a power plant, both of which are located in CRC's Elk Hills field, $15 million to $25 million is for carbon management projects and $5 million to $15 million is for corporate and other activities. Through 2024, CRC expects to run a one rig program executing projects using existing permits. Subject to the availability of well permits, the Company expects to increase to a four rig program in the second half of 2024. The actual amount of spending related to oil and gas development under CRC's 2024 capital program will depend on a variety of factors. In particular, the rate and amount of this spending depends on its ability to obtain new well permits in the second half of the year. If CRC is not able to obtain these permits, CRC could reduce its capital program by up to $100 million. 2024 PRELIMINARY OUTLOOK2 TOTAL 2024E Net Total Production (MBoe/d) 78 - 82 Oil Production (%) ~60% Capital ($ millions) $300 - $340 Drilling & completions, workovers ($ millions) $250 -$260 Facilities ($ millions) $30 - $40 Carbon management business ($ millions) $15 - $25 Corporate & other ($ millions) $5 - $15 Note: If CRC is not able to receive drilling permits or permits are delayed, the Company plans to run a one rig program with a $200 million to $240 million 2024E total capital program and would expect a 5% to 7% entry to exit decline rate. CRC expects its first quarter capital program to range between $65 million to $75 million. The program includes capital of $36 million to $42 million for oil and natural gas, and facilities development3, $4 million to $6 million for carbon management projects and $25 million to $27 million for corporate and other activities, including maintenance at CRC's Elk Hills power plant. CRC expects to produce 76 to 80 MBoe/d (~60% oil) in the first quarter of 2024. The table below provides highlights of the Company's first quarter 2024 guidance. See Attachment 2 for complete information on CRC's first quarter 2024 guidance.

On February 6th, 2024, CRC’s Board of Directors approved a $250 million increase of the Share Repurchase Program, bringing the aggregate program to $1.35 billion, and extended the program through December 31, 2025. Adjusting for this increase, CRC has approximately $747 million of capacity remaining under the repurchase program as of February 6, 2024. In 2023, CRC repurchased 3.4 million shares for approximately $143 million at an average price of $41.69 per share. Since the inception of the Share Repurchase Program in May 2021 through December 31, 2023, 14.9 million shares have been repurchased for $604 million at an average price of $40.53 per share, including commissions and excise taxes. These total repurchases represent ~18% of CRC’s shares outstanding since December 31, 2020. In 2023, CRC repurchased $55 million in principal of its Senior Notes at par. After these repurchases, the remaining principal amount of CRC’s Senior Notes is $545 million due February 1, 2026. On February 27, 2024, CRC's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.31 per share of common stock. The dividend is payable to shareholders of record on March 6, 2024 and will be paid on March 18, 2024. Through December 31, 2023, CRC has returned $813 million of cash to its stakeholders, including $604 million in share repurchases, $154 million of dividends and $55 million in principal of its Senior Notes repurchases. Balance Sheet and Liquidity Update On October 30, 2023, the borrowing base for the Revolving Credit Facility was reaffirmed at $1.2 billion as part of CRC's semi-annual redetermination. CRC's aggregate commitment from lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility was $630 million as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, CRC had liquidity of $973 million, which consisted of $496 million in cash and cash equivalents plus $477 million of available borrowing capacity under its Revolving Credit Facility (which is net of $153 million of issued letters of credit). In connection with the Merger Agreement, on February 9, 2024, CRC entered into a second amendment to its Revolving Credit Facility to permit CRC to incur indebtedness under a bridge loan facility that may be used in connection with closing the Aera Merger. Acquisitions and Divestitures On December 29, 2023, CRC sold its non-operating working interest in the Round Mountain Unit in the San Joaquin basin for $35 million, before transaction costs and purchase price adjustments, recognizing a gain of $25 million. CRC retained an option to capture, transport and store carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the production at Round Mountain Unit for future carbon management projects. On February 22, 2024, CRC entered into an agreement to sell its 0.9 acre Fort Apache real estate property in Huntington Beach to a local real estate developer for approximately $10 million. Sustainability “2023 was another important year in CRC’s sustainability journey,” said Francisco Leon, CRC’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “We are dedicated to becoming an even more sustainable energy company while continuously prioritizing health, safety, and the environment in all we do. We achieved our second-best safety rate in the Company’s history, our best since the period during COVID.

The non-GAAP measures include adjusted net income (loss), adjusted EBITDAX, E&P, Corporate & Other adjusted EBITDAX, CMB adjusted EBITDAX, net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities, net, free cash flow, E&P, Corporate & Other free cash flow, CMB free cash flow, adjusted general and administrative expenses, operating costs per BOE, and adjusted total capital among others. These measures are also widely used by the industry, the investment community and CRC's lenders. Although these are non-GAAP measures, the amounts included in the calculations were computed in accordance with GAAP. Certain items excluded from these non-GAAP measures are significant components in understanding and assessing CRC's financial performance, such as CRC's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the effect of acquisition and development costs of CRC's assets. Management believes that the non-GAAP measures presented, when viewed in combination with CRC's financial and operating results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company's performance. The non-GAAP measures presented herein may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Below are additional disclosures regarding each of the non-GAAP measures reported in this earnings release, including reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP measure where applicable. ADJUSTED NET INCOME (LOSS) Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per share are non-GAAP measures. CRC defines adjusted net income as net income excluding the effects of significant transactions and events that affect earnings but vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount. These events may recur, even across successive reporting periods. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to the industry and the investment community interested in comparing CRC's financial performance between periods. Reported earnings are considered representative of management's performance over the long term. Adjusted net income (loss) is not considered to be an alternative to net income (loss) reported in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the GAAP financial measure of net income and net income attributable to common stock per share to the non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share. 4th Quarter 3rd Quarter 4th Quarter Total Year Total Year ($ millions, except per share amounts) 2023 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net (loss) income $ 188 $ (22 ) $ 83 $ 564 $ 524 Unusual, infrequent and other items: Non-cash derivative loss (gain) (160 ) 109 (2 ) (252 ) (187 ) Asset impairment — — — 3 2 Severance and termination costs — 7 — 10 — Net loss on early extinguishment of debt 1 — — 1 — Net gain on asset divestitures (25 ) — 1 (32 ) (59 ) Other, net 16 17 15 46 22 Total unusual, infrequent and other items (168 ) 133 14 (224 ) (222 ) Income tax (benefit) provision of adjustments at effective tax rate 47 (37 ) (4 ) 63 63 Income tax (benefit) provision - out of period — — — (31 ) 19 Adjusted net income attributable to common stock $ 67 $ 74 $ 93 $ 372 $ 384 Net income (loss) per share - basic $ 2.74 $ (0.32 ) $ 1.14 $ 8.10 $ 6.94 Net income (loss) per share - diluted $ 2.60 $ (0.32 ) $ 1.11 $ 7.78 $ 6.75 Adjusted net income per share - basic $ 0.98 $ 1.08 $ 1.28 $ 5.34 $ 5.09 Adjusted net income per share - diluted $ 0.93 $ 1.02 $ 1.24 $ 5.13 $ 4.95 ADJUSTED EBITDAX CRC defines Adjusted EBITDAX as earnings before interest expense; income taxes; depreciation, depletion and amortization; exploration expense; other unusual, infrequent and out-of-period items; and other non-cash items. CRC believes this measure provides useful information in assessing its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and is widely used by the industry, the investment community and its lenders. Although this is a non-GAAP measure, the amounts included in the calculation were computed in accordance with GAAP. Certain items excluded from this non-GAAP measure are significant components in understanding and assessing CRC’s financial performance, such as its cost of capital and tax structure, as well as depreciation, depletion and amortization of CRC's assets. This measure should be read in conjunction with the information contained in CRC’s financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. A version of Adjusted EBITDAX is a material component of certain of its financial covenants under CRC's Revolving Credit Facility and is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, income and liquidity measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The following table represents a reconciliation of the GAAP financial measures of net income and net cash provided by operating activities to the non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted EBITDAX. CRC has supplemented its non-GAAP measures of consolidated adjusted EBITDAX with adjusted EBITDAX for its exploration and production and corporate items (Adjusted EBITDAX for E&P, Corporate & Other) which management believes is a useful measure for investors to understand the results of the core oil and gas business. CRC defines adjusted EBITDAX for E&P, Corporate & Other as consolidated adjusted EBITDAX less results attributable to its carbon management business (CMB). 4th Quarter 3rd Quarter 4th Quarter Total Year Total Year ($ millions, except per BOE amounts) 2023 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net income (loss) $ 188 $ (22 ) $ 83 $ 564 $ 524 Interest and debt expense 13 15 14 56 53 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 55 56 49 225 198 Income tax provision (benefit) 79 (8 ) 34 184 237 Exploration expense 1 — 1 3 4 Interest income (7 ) (5 ) (3 ) (21 ) (4 ) Unusual, infrequent and other items (1) (168 ) 133 14 (224 ) (222 ) Non-cash items Accretion expense 11 12 11 46 43 Stock-based compensation 6 6 4 27 17 Post-retirement medical and pension 1 — 1 2 2 Adjusted EBITDAX $ 179 $ 187 $ 208 $ 862 $ 852 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 131 $ 104 $ 114 $ 653 $ 690 Cash interest payments 1 23 2 49 50 Cash interest received (7 ) (5 ) (3 ) (21 ) (4 ) Cash income taxes 41 29 — 121 20 Exploration expenditures 1 — 1 3 4 Adjustments to changes in operating assets and liabilities 12 36 94 57 92 Adjusted EBITDAX $ 179 $ 187 $ 208 $ 862 $ 852 E&P, Corporate & Other Adjusted EBITDAX $ 199 $ 199 $ 223 $ 916 $ 879 CMB Adjusted EBITDAX $ (20 ) $ (12 ) $ (15 ) $ (54 ) $ (27 ) Adjusted EBITDAX per Boe $ 23.57 $ 23.81 $ 24.94 $ 27.51 $ 25.77 (1) See Adjusted Net Income (Loss) reconciliation. FREE CASH FLOW AND SUPPLEMENTAL FREE CASH FLOW MEASURES Management uses free cash flow, which is defined by CRC as net cash provided by operating activities less capital investments, as a measure of liquidity. The following table presents a reconciliation of CRC's net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow. CRC supplemented its non-GAAP measure of free cash flow with (i) net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities, net, (ii) adjusted free cash flow, and (iii) free cash flow of exploration and production, and corporate and other items (Free Cash Flow for E&P, Corporate & Other), which it believes is a useful measure for investors to understand the results of CRC's core oil and gas business. CRC defines Free Cash Flow for E&P, Corporate & Other as consolidated free cash flow less results attributable to its carbon management business (CMB). CRC defines adjusted free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less adjusted capital investments. 4th Quarter 3rd Quarter 4th Quarter Total Year Total Year ($ millions) 2023 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities, net $ 104 $ 129 $ 192 $ 647 $ 747 Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net 27 (25 ) (78 ) 6 (57 ) Net cash provided by operating activities 131 104 114 653 690 Capital investments (66 ) (33 ) (75 ) (185 ) (379 ) Free cash flow $ 65 $ 71 $ 39 $ 468 $ 311 E&P, Corporate and Other $ 84 $ 79 $ 61 $ 511 $ 362 CMB $ (19 ) $ (8 ) $ (22 ) $ (43 ) $ (51 ) Adjustments to capital investments: Replacement water facilities(1) $ 1 $ 1 $ 3 $ 4 $ 12 Adjusted capital investments: E&P, Corporate and Other $ 61 $ 32 $ 85 $ 176 $ 363 CMB $ 5 $ 1 $ (10 ) $ 9 $ 16 Adjusted free cash flow: E&P, Corporate and Other $ 85 $ 80 $ 64 $ 515 $ 374 CMB $ (20 ) $ (9 ) $ (25 ) $ (47 ) $ (63 ) (1) Facilities capital includes $1 million, $1 million and $4 million in the third and second quarter of 2023 and third quarter of 2022, respectively, to build replacement water injection facilities which will allow CRC to divert produced water away from a depleted oil and natural gas reservoir held by the Carbon TerraVault JV. Construction of these facilities supports the advancement of CRC’s carbon management business and CRC reported these amounts as part of adjusted CMB capital in this press release. Where adjusted CMB capital is presented, CRC removed the amounts from facilities capital and presented adjusted E&P, Corporate and Other capital. ADJUSTED GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Management uses a measure called adjusted general and administrative (G&A) expenses to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing CRC's costs between periods and performance to our peers. CRC supplemented its non-GAAP measure of adjusted general and administrative expenses with adjusted general and administrative expenses of its exploration and production and corporate items (adjusted general & administrative expenses for E&P, Corporate & Other) which it believes is a useful measure for investors to understand the results or CRC's core oil and gas business. CRC defines adjusted general & administrative Expenses for E&P, Corporate & Other as consolidated adjusted general and administrative expenses less results attributable to its carbon management business (CMB). 4th Quarter 3rd Quarter 4th Quarter Total Year Total Year ($ millions) 2023 2023 2022 2023 2022 General and administrative expenses $ 66 $ 65 $ 59 $ 267 $ 222 Stock-based compensation (6 ) (6 ) (4 ) (27 ) (17 ) Information technology infrastructure (4 ) (6 ) (2 ) (17 ) (4 ) Other (1 ) (2 ) — (5 ) — Adjusted G&A expenses $ 55 $ 51 $ 53 $ 218 $ 201 E&P, Corporate and Other adjusted G&A expenses $ 53 $ 47 $ 51 $ 206 $ 189 CMB adjusted G&A expenses $ 2 $ 4 $ 2 $ 12 $ 12 OPERATING COSTS PER BOE The reporting of PSC-type contracts creates a difference between reported operating costs, which are for the full field, and reported volumes, which are only CRC's net share, inflating the per barrel operating costs.

(OGEN) announces a public offering of common stock to fund the development of ONP-002, a neurosteroid drug for treating mild traumatic brain injuries. The offering is led by ThinkEquity and Laidlaw & Company (UK) Ltd.","Oragenics Announces Proposed Public Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Oragenics, Inc. (OGEN) announces a public offering of common stock to fund the development of ONP-002, a neurosteroid drug for treating mild traumatic brain injuries. The offering is led by ThinkEquity and Laidlaw & Company (UK) Ltd. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Oragenics, Inc. regarding its intention to conduct an underwritten public offering is a strategic move aimed at capital acquisition to support ongoing projects, particularly the development of ONP-002. This neurosteroid drug compound is being targeted for the treatment of mild traumatic brain injuries, indicating the company's focus on a niche yet significant medical need. The choice to potentially offer pre-funded warrants alongside common stock suggests flexibility in financing options, which could be appealing to a broader range of investors.From a financial perspective, the offering's success hinges on market conditions, investor appetite for biotech sector risk and the perceived potential of ONP-002. The 45-day option for underwriters to purchase additional shares to cover over-allotments is a common practice that could stabilize the stock price post-offering. However, the dilutive effect of the new shares on existing shareholders could be a concern, potentially impacting the stock's short-term price.Long-term, the capital raised could significantly advance Oragenics' product pipeline, which would be critical for the company's growth. However, investors should consider the inherent risks of drug development, including regulatory hurdles and clinical trial outcomes, which could affect the company's financial health and stock performance. Medical Research Analyst The development of ONP-002 by Oragenics represents an intriguing prospect within the biopharmaceutical industry, particularly for the treatment of concussions, a common yet underserved medical issue. Concussions and mild traumatic brain injuries can have long-term health implications and current treatment options are limited, underscoring the potential market for an effective therapeutic solution.The success of ONP-002's development will rely on clinical trial results, safety profiles and efficacy data. Positive outcomes could position Oragenics as a leader in this therapeutic area, potentially leading to partnerships or acquisition interest from larger pharmaceutical companies. Conversely, any setbacks in the drug's development could have a detrimental effect on the company's valuation and investor confidence.It is crucial for stakeholders to monitor the progress of clinical trials and regulatory interactions. The ability to navigate the complex FDA approval process is essential for Oragenics to bring ONP-002 to market and realize a return on the investment from this public offering. 02/27/2024 - 04:33 PM SARASOTA, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Oragenics, Inc.

The par value per share changed from $0.01 to $0.1, aiming to increase the market price and maintain Nasdaq listing.","ReTo Eco-Solutions, Inc. Announces Share Combination Rhea-AI Impact (High) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary ReTo Eco-Solutions, Inc. (Nasdaq: RETO) announced a ten-to-one Share Combination, reducing common shares from 37,451,882 to approximately 3,745,189. The par value per share changed from $0.01 to $0.1, aiming to increase the market price and maintain Nasdaq listing. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The execution of a share combination, commonly known as a reverse stock split, is a strategic maneuver often employed by companies seeking to elevate their stock price to comply with exchange listing requirements. In the case of ReTo Eco-Solutions, this ten-to-one consolidation aims to reduce the total number of shares outstanding, thereby increasing the nominal value of each share. This move is particularly significant as it directly influences the liquidity and market perception of the stock.From a financial standpoint, while the intrinsic value of the company remains unchanged, the psychological impact on investors can be notable. A higher per-share price could potentially attract a different caliber of investors and improve the stock's reputation, as low-priced shares are often associated with higher risk and volatility. However, this tactic does not address underlying business challenges and may be viewed as a cosmetic change unless accompanied by fundamental improvements in the company's operations and financial health. Market Research Analyst Market dynamics suggest that a reverse stock split can serve as a short-term remedy to meet NASDAQ's minimum bid price requirement, but it does not inherently enhance shareholder value. Investors and potential shareholders often scrutinize such actions, seeking assurance that the company is also making substantive strides toward growth and profitability. It's crucial to monitor the market's reception to the share combination over the upcoming quarters, as it may reflect broader confidence or concern in the company's strategic direction.Historical data indicates mixed outcomes for companies undertaking reverse splits. While some manage to stabilize and grow post-adjustment, others continue to struggle, indicating that the success of such measures is not guaranteed and must be evaluated in the context of the company's specific circumstances and industry trends. Legal Expert Legally, the decision to implement a share combination without shareholder vote is permissible under the laws of the British Virgin Islands, where ReTo Eco-Solutions is incorporated. This highlights the importance of understanding the regulatory framework and corporate governance standards of different jurisdictions. Shareholders should be aware that their rights and the company's obligations may differ significantly from those in their home countries.Additionally, the process of exchanging physical stock certificates, as managed by the transfer agent, is a procedural matter that requires careful attention to ensure accuracy and compliance. Shareholders holding physical certificates must actively engage with the transfer agent to adjust their holdings, which underscores the administrative aspect of such corporate actions. 02/27/2024 - 04:30 PM BEIJING, Feb. 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- ReTo Eco-Solutions, Inc.

As a result of the Share Combination, each ten (10) pre-combination common shares of the Company will be automatically combined into one (1) common share without any action on the part of the holders, with par value of the common shares of the Company being changed from $0.01 per share to $0.1 per share, and the Company's issued and outstanding common shares will be reduced from 37,451,882 to approximately 3,745,189. The Company's common shares will continue to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market (""Nasdaq"") under the symbol ""RETO"" under a new CUSIP number – G75271125.

""The Company is in a very strong financial position as we await our permits to mine both deeper in the Pearl Pit and to begin mine development of our County Line project, our next targeted mine build.""Mr. Reid continued, ""We continue to mine and stack the lower grade Civit Cat portion of the Isabella Pearl deposit on the heap while we await approval to mine the remaining higher-grade oxide and oxide transitional gold ore deep in the Pearl zone. Adding this ore to the estimated 51,000 recoverable gold ounces on the pad at year end, we expect to be residual leaching gold from the pad over the next several years from Isabella Pearl. As we look to execute our original plan to overlap mine operations and layer production while transitioning to our second mine, we remain ready to begin development of County Line upon regulatory approvals. Our plan is to mine County Line as an aggregate operation, hauling crushed ore to our nearby processing facility at Isabella Pearl. With minimal infrastructure to be built at County Line, we are optimizing the mining sequence to access the highest-grade ore possible in the phased mining approach and look forward to being able to add additional new ore from County Line to our Isabella Pearl heap leach pad for operational longevity.""""In the last two weeks, we have received positive feedback from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) regarding both our permit applications to mine deeper in the Pearl zone and positive movement on our Plan of Operations submitted for County Line,"" stated Mr. Reid. ""The BLM is actively reviewing and advancing these permits. The Pearl deep permit approval sounds like it could be issued any day now and their County Line comments keep us optimistic all regulatory approvals, subsequent to the NEPA process, could be granted in the first half of 2024. The sooner County Line ore can be mined and placed on the heap leach pad in 2024, along with ore from Pearl deep as was originally contemplated, the better apt we will be at forecasting production; however, until we have additional clarity on permit timing, not only hear that the permits are progressing but have the permits in hand including County Line construction ability, we are not providing a 2024 production outlook. We expect continued gold production and cash flow from the existing ore on the heap leach pad along with additional ore added from the Isabella Pearl's Civit Cat area. Forecasting primarily residual leach with a pad's variable decline curve and the unpredictable nature of permit timing from which to estimate substantial new ore being placed on the pad from County Line is challenging.""Mr. Reid continued, ""Looking forward into 2024 as we await key permits, we expect to continue our investments in exploration and development activities across our exciting portfolio of 100% owned Nevada properties. Our exploration focus includes County Line, Golden Mile, the Isabella Pearl trend's Scarlet area, East Camp, as well as our recently acquired properties, Dauntless and Intrepid. With a strong treasury, and substantial capital already deployed acquiring equipment for County Line and Golden Mile, we target to develop both mines with cash while avoiding shareholder dilution. We also remain committed to the shareholder cash dividend. Having planned for and accumulated a near record cash treasury, having no debt, and continued cash flow coming in from operations, we are in a very strong position from which to span the unknown permit timing bridge as we await approval to build our second mine. Fortitude Gold remains a unique investment in the precious metal space offering investors exposure to gold production, a very attractive dividend yield, and district scale exploration potential of our eight Nevada properties all with surface and or near surface gold.""2023 OverviewFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company sold 37,836 gold ounces at a total cash cost after by-product credit of $536 per gold ounce, and a realized 2023 average sales price for gold of $1,939 per ounce. The Company recorded revenues of $73.1 million, and net income of $17.0 million, or $0.71 per share.The following Sales Statistics table summarizes certain information about our operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022: Year ended December 31, 2023 2022 Metal sold Gold (ozs.) 37,836 41,464 Silver (ozs.) 78,744 56,282 Average metal prices realized (1) Gold ($per oz.) 1,939 1,802 Silver ($per oz.) 23.41 22.18 Precious metal gold equivalent ounces sold Gold Ounces 37,836 41,464 Gold Equivalent Ounces from Silver 951 693 38,787 42,157 Total cash cost before by-product credits per gold ounce sold $585 $651 Total cash cost after by-product credits per gold ounce sold $536 $621 Total all-in sustaining cost per gold ounce sold $656 $725 (1) Average metal prices realized vary from the market metal prices due to final settlement adjustments from our provisional invoices when they are settled. Our average metal prices realized will therefore differ from the market average metal prices in most cases.The following Production Statistics table summarize certain information about our operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022: Year ended December 31, 2023 2022 Ore mined Ore (tonnes) 455,576 634,076 Gold grade (g/t) 2.52 3.71 Low-grade stockpile Ore (tonnes) 2,118 61,854 Gold grade (g/t) 0.46 0.47 Waste (tonnes) 1,430,824 1,814,864 Metal production (before payable metal deductions)(1) Gold (ozs.) 37,996 41,231 Silver (ozs.) 79,825 56,876 (1) The difference between what we report as ""metal production"" and ""metal sold"" is attributable to the difference between the quantities of metals contained in the doré we produce versus the portion of those metals actually paid for according to the terms of our sales contracts. Differences can also arise from inventory changes incidental to shipping schedules, or variances in ore grades and recoveries which impact the amount of metals contained in doré produced and sold.Isabella Pearl Project UpdateMine operations at Isabella Pearl are projected to conclude in 2024 depending on the final mine sequencing of the next four benches planned in the Pearl zone after the Company receives regulatory approval to mine deeper. There is also mineral both inside and outside the resource of the Civit Cat portion of the deposit. Though it is unknown at this time when Civit Cat will be depleted, it is expected to be mid- 2024 or later. Final mine operation timing could be impacted by BLM permit timing as well as any additional mineralization that may be encountered outside of the current mine plan. The Company did not update its 2023 Isabella Pearl SEC S-K 1300 TRS report, as Isabella Pearl deposit mining is projected to conclude by mid to late 2024.Projects UpdateThe Company is currently awaiting multiple new permits and permit modifications from the BLM. A near-term decision from the BLM is expected, as has been the case in 2023, for the Pearl deep portion of the Isabella Pearl mine, which would allow for final mine sequencing in the higher-grade Pearl portion of the deposit's oxide and transitional oxide gold ore areas.The Company filed a Plan of Operations with the BLM for its County Line project in May of 2023. County Line has the potential to supply gold ore to the Isabella Pearl heap leach pad and ADR facility, which is located 19 miles to the southeast of County Line along Nevada Route 361, for gold processing and final gold doré production. The Company believes County Line construction and capital development costs could be considerably reduced since the project is designed without processing facilities, nor a heap leach pad, and is to be mined similarly to an aggregate or gravel operation whereby ore is mined, crushed, and hauled to the nearby Isabella Pearl process facility.A Plan of Operations was filed with the BLM for the Golden Mile project in September of 2023. The Company is advancing a phase one open pit shell design and potential mine development at its Golden Mile property. A phase one open pit would target production from surface and near surface gold mineralization with further delineation efforts expected to add additional open pit phases. The development plan is to then add pit laybacks (similar in concept and execution of the pit phases at the Company's Isabella Pearl Mine) as further delineation of the mineralization allows.The Company also expects to file a permit modification with the BLM in the coming weeks after receipt of approval to mine deeper in the Pearl zone to expand the current Isabella Pearl mine plan boundary. A boundary modification and expansion to the northwest would include the Scarlet and Scarlet North targets, as well as additional prospective exploration ground in that area. The Company has discovered surface and near surface high-grade gold at Scarlet North with a proximity of 700 meters from its Isabella Pearl processing facility.Exploration ProgramsThe Company invested $17.2 million in exploration spending in 2023. Exploration drill programs focused on multiple property targets including the Isabella Pearl mineralized trend with Scarlet North, County Line, Golden Mile, and East Camp Douglas' northern veins and southern lithocap targets. 2024 exploration programs will continue to focus on increasing resources and reserves and discovering new mineralization.

This is the fourth program since its mutual-to-stock conversion in July 2021. The company has repurchased 5,409,022 shares since its first program. The new program will start after completing the third one. The repurchase can be done through various methods based on market conditions and the company's financial performance. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Blue Foundry Bancorp's new share repurchase program represents a significant financial move that could have multiple implications for the company's capital structure and shareholder value. Share repurchases are often interpreted as a signal that a company's leadership believes the stock is undervalued. By reducing the number of outstanding shares, the earnings per share (EPS) metric can be positively impacted, potentially leading to a higher stock price. However, this maneuver also means that the company is choosing to allocate capital to buy back shares rather than investing in new projects or business expansion, which could be seen as a lack of growth opportunities.From a financial perspective, this action may also indicate that Blue Foundry Bancorp is generating sufficient cash flow, enabling it to return capital to shareholders. However, it's essential to monitor the company's balance sheet to ensure that these repurchases are not being financed through excessive debt, which could undermine financial stability. The timing and volume of repurchases will be critical to watch, as they can affect the market's perception and the actual stock price. Market Research Analyst Blue Foundry Bancorp's decision to implement a fourth stock repurchase program could reflect broader market trends where companies use buybacks as a tool to manage their stock price and provide returns to investors. In the context of the banking sector, where growth can often be slow and steady, repurchase programs can be particularly attractive to investors looking for regular returns on their investments. It's also indicative of the company's confidence in its financial health and future prospects.Investors and analysts will be interested in how these buybacks correlate with the company's stock performance history since its mutual-to-stock conversion. The repurchase of 5% of outstanding common stock is a non-trivial amount that could tighten the supply of shares in the market, potentially leading to a short-term price increase. However, the long-term effects will largely depend on the company's ongoing financial performance and market conditions. Legal Expert The share repurchase program will be conducted in compliance with SEC Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18, which provide a regulatory framework for such transactions. Rule 10b5-1 allows insiders of publicly traded corporations to set up a trading plan for selling stocks they own, while Rule 10b-18 provides a 'safe harbor' for companies to repurchase their shares without being deemed to manipulate the market. These regulations are designed to ensure that the repurchases are executed in a manner that does not artificially inflate the stock price or mislead investors.It's important that Blue Foundry Bancorp follows these guidelines meticulously to maintain transparency and investor confidence. Any deviation or perceived manipulation could result in significant legal consequences and damage to the company's reputation. As such, the legal framework surrounding this repurchase plan is as critical as the financial implications and the company's adherence to these rules will be closely scrutinized by regulators and investors alike. 02/27/2024 - 04:30 PM RUTHERFORD, N.J., Feb. 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Blue Foundry Bancorp (NASDAQ: BLFY), the holding company for Blue Foundry Bank, announced that it has adopted a program to repurchase up to 1,203,545 shares of its common stock, which is approximately 5% of its outstanding common stock. This is the Company’s fourth stock repurchase program since completing its mutual-to-stock conversion and related stock offering in July 2021. Since announcing its first stock repurchase program on July 20, 2022, the Company has repurchased 5,409,022 shares. As of February 26, 2024, there were 46,736 shares remaining to be repurchased under the third plan. The fourth plan will commence immediately upon the completion of the third plan. The repurchase program permits shares to be repurchased in open market or private transactions, through block trades or pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The timing and amount of any repurchases will depend on a number of factors, including the availability of stock, general market conditions, the trading price of the stock, alternative uses for capital, and the Company’s financial performance. Open market purchases will be made in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities and Exchange Commission and other applicable legal requirements. The Company is not obligated to repurchase any particular number of shares or any shares in any specific time period. James D. Nesci, President and CEO of the Company, remarked that “We are pleased to announce our fourth repurchase program. We believe that share repurchases are a prudent use of capital and are pleased to have the strong capital position that allows us the ability to purchase stock.” About Blue Foundry Bancorp Blue Foundry Bancorp is the holding company for Blue Foundry Bank, a place where things are made, purpose is formed, and ideas are crafted.

FY 2023 sales were $9.4 billion, up 8%, and diluted EPS was $1.96. The company projects 6-8% sales growth and 13-16% core diluted EPS growth for FY 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported Q4 2023 sales growth of 8% and the constant currency growth of 10% indicate a robust performance for Alcon, particularly in the context of the global eye care market. The increase in core diluted EPS by 67%, or 78% in constant currency terms, is a strong indicator of the company's profitability and operational efficiency. This substantial growth in earnings suggests effective cost management and a potentially favorable product mix that may have contributed to higher margins.Looking at the full-year sales growth of 8%, or 10% on a constant currency basis, alongside the 188% increase in diluted EPS, investors can infer that Alcon has not only expanded its market share but has also significantly improved its bottom line. The forecast for FY 2024, projecting a 6% to 8% constant currency sales growth and a 13% to 16% increase in core diluted EPS, reflects management's confidence in the company's growth trajectory and its ability to continue delivering shareholder value. Market Research Analyst Alcon's performance must be contextualized within the global eye care sector. The industry is experiencing growth driven by aging populations, rising prevalence of eye-related diseases and technological advancements in eye care treatments and products. Alcon's solid top-line growth in both of its franchises indicates that the company is effectively capitalizing on these market trends. The successful completion of its transformation program, as mentioned by CEO David J. Endicott, likely contributed to operational improvements that have bolstered its competitive position.The company's advancement in its product pipeline is crucial for sustaining growth. Innovation in eye care, including surgical equipment and vision care products, is key to staying ahead in a highly competitive market. Alcon's ability to innovate and bring new products to market is likely a significant factor in their positive outlook for 2024. Medical Research Analyst Alcon's focus on expanding margins and advancing its product pipeline is indicative of a strategic emphasis on research and development within the eye care field. The development of new medical devices and eye care solutions is essential to meet the growing demand for advanced eye care treatments. The company's investment in R&D is likely to have a long-term impact on its market share and financial health, as innovative products can lead to patent protections, regulatory advantages and premium pricing power.The transformation program mentioned may include streamlining operations, investing in technology and optimizing the supply chain, all of which can improve the company's agility and responsiveness to market changes. This strategic focus is important for stakeholders to consider when assessing the company's future prospects. 02/27/2024 - 04:30 PM Q4 2023 sales of $2.3 billion, up 8%, or 10% constant currency(1) (cc) Q4 2023 diluted EPS of $0.86, compared to a loss in the prior year(3); core diluted EPS(2) of $0.70 up 67%, or 78% cc FY 2023 sales of $9.4 billion, up 8%, or 10% cc FY 2023 diluted EPS of $1.96, up 188%; core diluted EPS of $2.74, up 22%, or 33% cc FY 2024 outlook: 6% to 8% cc sales growth, 13% to 16% cc core diluted EPS growth Ad Hoc Announcement Pursuant to Art. 53 LR GENEVA--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Alcon (SIX/NYSE:ALC), the global leader in eye care, reported its financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023.

Balance sheet and cash flow highlights The Company ended 2023 with a cash position of $1.1 billion.

Both periods were impacted by changes in net working capital. Free cash flow(4), a non-IFRS measure, was an inflow of $730 million in 2023, compared to $581 million in the previous year. The improvement in free cash flow was driven by increased cash flows from operations, partially offset by increased purchases of property, plant and equipment.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This document contains, and our officers and representatives may from time to time make, certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as “anticipate,” “intend,” “commitment,” “look forward,” “maintain,” “plan,” “goal,” “seek,” “target,” “assume,” “believe,” “project,” “estimate,” “expect,” “strategy,” “future,” “likely,” “may,” “should,” “will” and similar references to future periods. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements we make regarding our liquidity, revenue, gross margin, operating margin, effective tax rate, foreign currency exchange movements, earnings per share, our plans and decisions relating to various capital expenditures, capital allocation priorities and other discretionary items such as our market growth assumptions, our social impact and sustainability plans, targets, goals and expectations, and generally, our expectations concerning our future performance. Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties and risks that are difficult to predict such as: cybersecurity breaches or other disruptions of our information technology systems; compliance with data privacy, identity protection and information security laws, particularly with the increased use of artificial intelligence; the impact of a disruption in our global supply chain or important facilities, particularly when we single-source or rely on limited sources of supply; our ability to forecast sales demand and manage our inventory levels and the changing buying patterns of our customers; our ability to manage social impact and sustainability matters; our reliance on outsourcing key business functions; global and regional economic, financial, monetary, legal, tax, political and social change; our success in completing and integrating strategic acquisitions; the success of our research and development efforts, including our ability to innovate to compete effectively; our ability to comply with the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and other applicable anti-corruption laws; pricing pressure from changes in third party payor coverage and reimbursement methodologies; our ability to properly educate and train healthcare providers on our products; our ability to protect our intellectual property; our ability to comply with all laws to which we may be subject; the ability to obtain regulatory clearance and approval of our products as well as compliance with any post-approval obligations, including quality control of our manufacturing; the effect of product recalls or voluntary market withdrawals; the accuracy of our accounting estimates and assumptions, including pension and other post-employment benefit plan obligations and the carrying value of intangible assets; the impact of unauthorized importation of our products from countries with lower prices to countries with higher prices; our ability to service our debt obligations; the need for additional financing through the issuance of debt or equity; the effects of litigation, including product liability lawsuits and governmental investigations; supply constraints and increases in the cost of energy; our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; legislative, tax and regulatory reform; the impact of being listed on two stock exchanges; the ability to declare and pay dividends; the different rights afforded to our shareholders as a Swiss corporation compared to a US corporation; the effect of maintaining or losing our foreign private issuer status under US securities laws; and the ability to enforce US judgments against Swiss corporations. Additional factors are discussed in our filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 20-F. Should one or more of these uncertainties or risks materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements in this document speak only as of the date of its filing, and we assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Intellectual Property This report may contain references to our proprietary intellectual property. All product names appearing in italics or ALL CAPS are trademarks owned by or licensed to Alcon Inc. Product names identified by a ""®"" or a ""™"" are trademarks that are not owned by or licensed to Alcon or its subsidiaries and are the property of their respective owners. Non-IFRS measures as defined by the Company Alcon uses certain non-IFRS metrics when measuring performance, including when measuring current period results against prior periods, including core results, percentage changes measured in constant currency and free cash flow. Because of their non-standardized definitions, the non-IFRS measures (unlike IFRS measures) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. These supplemental non-IFRS measures are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how Alcon management assesses underlying performance. These supplemental non-IFRS measures are not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for IFRS measures. Core results Alcon core results, including core operating income and core net income, exclude all amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets, excluding software, net gains and losses on fund investments and equity securities valued at fair value through profit and loss (""FVPL""), fair value adjustments of financial assets in the form of options to acquire a company carried at FVPL, obligations related to product recalls, and certain acquisition related items. The following items that exceed a threshold of $10 million and are deemed exceptional are also excluded from core results: integration and divestment related income and expenses, divestment gains and losses, restructuring charges/releases and related items, legal related items, gains/losses on early extinguishment of debt or debt modifications, past service costs for post-employment benefit plans, impairments of property, plant and equipment and software, as well as income and expense items that management deems exceptional and that are or are expected to accumulate within the year to be over a $10 million threshold. Taxes on the adjustments between IFRS and core results take into account, for each individual item included in the adjustment, the tax rate that will finally be applicable to the item based on the jurisdiction where the adjustment will finally have a tax impact. Generally, this results in amortization and impairment of intangible assets and acquisition-related restructuring and integration items having a full tax impact. There is usually a tax impact on other items, although this is not always the case for items arising from legal settlements in certain jurisdictions. Alcon believes that investor understanding of its performance is enhanced by disclosing core measures of performance because, since they exclude items that can vary significantly from period to period, the core measures enable a helpful comparison of business performance across periods. For this same reason, Alcon uses these core measures in addition to IFRS and other measures as important factors in assessing its performance. A limitation of the core measures is that they provide a view of Alcon operations without including all events during a period, such as the effects of an acquisition, divestment, or amortization/impairments of purchased intangible assets and restructurings. Constant currency Changes in the relative values of non-US currencies to the US dollar can affect Alcon's financial results and financial position. To provide additional information that may be useful to investors, including changes in sales volume, we present information about changes in our net sales and various values relating to operating and net income that are adjusted for such foreign currency effects. Constant currency calculations have the goal of eliminating two exchange rate effects so that an estimate can be made of underlying changes in the Consolidated Income Statement excluding: the impact of translating the income statements of consolidated entities from their non-US dollar functional currencies to the US dollar; and the impact of exchange rate movements on the major transactions of consolidated entities performed in currencies other than their functional currency. Alcon calculates constant currency measures by translating the current year's foreign currency values for sales and other income statement items into US dollars, using the average exchange rates from the historical comparative period and comparing them to the values from the historical comparative period in US dollars. Free cash flow Alcon defines free cash flow as net cash flows from operating activities less cash flow associated with the purchase or sale of property, plant and equipment. Free cash flow is presented as additional information because Alcon management believes it is a useful supplemental indicator of Alcon's ability to operate without reliance on additional borrowing or use of existing cash. Free cash flow is not intended to be a substitute measure for net cash flows from operating activities as determined under IFRS. Growth rate and margin calculations For ease of understanding, Alcon uses a sign convention for its growth rates such that a reduction in operating expenses or losses compared to the prior year is shown as a positive growth. Gross margins, operating income/(loss) margins and core operating income margins are calculated based upon net sales to third parties unless otherwise noted. Reconciliation of guidance for forward-looking non-IFRS measures The forward-looking guidance included in this press release cannot be reconciled to the comparable IFRS measures without unreasonable efforts, because we are not able to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate amount or nature of exceptional items in the fiscal year. These items are uncertain, depend on many factors and could have a material impact on our IFRS results for the guidance period.
