Janux Therapeutics Announces Pricing of $296.5 Million Underwritten Public Offering of Common Stock and Pre-Funded Warrants,2024-02-29T06:22:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Janux Therapeutics, Inc.

(Nasdaq: JANX) announced the pricing of a public offering, including shares of common stock and pre-funded warrants, to raise approximately $296.5 million. The offering price is $46.50 per share, with additional shares available for purchase by underwriters. Positive None. Negative The offering may dilute existing shareholders' ownership due to the issuance of additional shares at a price lower than the current market value. Financial Analyst The announcement by Janux Therapeutics of its public offering is a significant event that calls for an analysis of its financial implications. The pricing of over 4.4 million shares at $46.50 per share, along with pre-funded warrants, is expected to generate approximately $296.5 million in gross proceeds. This influx of capital is substantial for a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, which typically requires significant investment for research and development. The decision to grant underwriters a 30-day option to purchase additional shares could further increase the capital raised, depending on the demand and market conditions.This capital raise is indicative of the company's growth strategy and its confidence in its proprietary TRACTr and TRACIr platforms. Investors will be interested in how these funds will be allocated, likely towards advancing clinical trials, expanding the company's pipeline and accelerating the path to potential commercialization. The offering's success and the subsequent deployment of capital could have a notable impact on the company's stock performance and market valuation in the short to medium term. Medical Research Analyst From a medical research standpoint, Janux Therapeutics' capital raise through this public offering is pivotal for the progression of its immunotherapy platforms. The TRACTr and TRACIr technologies are designed to activate T cells and immunomodulators selectively within the tumor microenvironment, which could potentially offer a more targeted and less toxic treatment for cancer patients. The funding could significantly impact the company's ability to conduct necessary clinical trials to prove efficacy and safety, which are critical hurdles in the drug development process.It's also important to note that the success of these trials could set a precedent in the field of immunotherapy, possibly influencing the direction of future research and development. The clinical outcomes and the ability to meet regulatory milestones will be closely watched by stakeholders, as these factors will directly affect the company's valuation and the potential return on investment. Market Research Analyst Assessing the broader market implications, Janux Therapeutics' public offering should be viewed in the context of the biopharmaceutical sector's current investment climate. The sector has seen increased investor interest in companies developing innovative treatments, particularly in the oncology space. Janux's focus on novel immunotherapies places it within a highly competitive but rapidly growing market segment.The decision to raise capital through a public offering rather than private funding sources suggests confidence in public market support and may reflect a strategic move to enhance the company's visibility and credibility. The pricing of the offering and the response from investors will provide insights into market sentiment towards emerging biopharmaceutical companies and their technologies. The outcome of this offering could influence not just Janux's future but also the investment patterns in the sector. 02/29/2024 - 01:22 AM SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Janux Therapeutics, Inc.

Total cash returned to shareholders reaches $7.3 billion since May 2018. Barclays Capital Inc. to conduct Buyback for up to $300 million. The purpose is to reduce share capital within regulatory guidelines. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The completion of the share buyback program by CRH plc and the announcement of a new buyback initiative represent a significant allocation of capital towards shareholder returns. This strategy often reflects a management's belief in the company's intrinsic value and a perception that the stock is undervalued. The repurchase of 4.2 million shares and the intention to buy back up to 13 million more indicate a substantial reduction in outstanding shares, which could potentially lead to an increase in earnings per share (EPS) and a higher stock price, assuming demand remains constant.However, this also suggests that CRH may not have identified investment opportunities within the company or the market that could yield a higher return than the buyback. Investors might question whether this is the most effective use of capital, especially considering the cyclical nature of the building materials industry and the need for continuous investment in innovation and expansion. The long-term impact will largely depend on how these buybacks affect the company's financial flexibility and its ability to capitalize on future growth opportunities. Market Research Analyst In the context of the building materials industry, CRH's share buyback program must be analyzed against the backdrop of the current economic climate and sector trends. The construction sector is highly sensitive to economic cycles, with demand for building materials closely tied to the health of the global economy, interest rates and construction activity. A share buyback program of this scale suggests that CRH is generating sufficient cash flow to support such shareholder-friendly actions, which may be interpreted as a positive signal regarding the company's operational efficiency and market position.It's important to note that the buyback is being executed within specific regulatory parameters, including Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18, which aim to prevent market manipulation and ensure transparency. The adherence to these rules underscores the importance of regulatory compliance in such corporate actions. The cancellation of the repurchased shares will also simplify the capital structure, potentially making CRH's financials easier to evaluate for investors and analysts. Legal Expert The legal framework governing the share buyback, specifically the reference to Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as EU Market Abuse Regulation, is crucial in ensuring that CRH's actions are within the bounds of insider trading laws and market abuse regulations. The structured nature of the buyback plan under these rules allows the company to repurchase shares without facing legal repercussions that could arise from trading on nonpublic information.Moreover, the fact that no repurchases will be made outside of the United States is indicative of the legal complexities and potential regulatory risks associated with cross-border financial transactions. This strategic decision may mitigate legal exposure and simplify compliance with the varied regulatory environments in which CRH operates. The cancellation of shares, a common outcome of buybacks, is subject to corporate and securities laws, which dictate the process and reporting requirements, ensuring that shareholders' interests are protected throughout the transaction. 02/29/2024 - 02:05 AM DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CRH plc, the leading provider of building materials solutions, is pleased to announce that it has completed the latest phase of its share buyback program, returning a further $0.3 billion of cash to shareholders. Between December 21, 2023 and February 28, 2024, 4.2 million ordinary shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange were repurchased. This brings total cash returned to shareholders under our ongoing share buyback program to $7.3 billion since its commencement in May 2018. CRH today also announces that it has entered into an arrangement with Barclays Capital Inc. (“Barclays”) to repurchase ordinary shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange on CRH’s behalf for an aggregate maximum consideration of up to $300 million (the “Buyback”). The Buyback will commence today, February 29, 2024, and will end no later than May 9, 2024. Barclays will conduct the Buyback on CRH’s behalf and will make trading decisions under the Buyback independently of CRH in accordance with certain pre-set parameters. The maximum number of ordinary shares which may be acquired pursuant to the Buyback is 13,000,000. The purpose of the Buyback is to reduce the share capital of CRH. The Buyback will be conducted within the parameters prescribed by (i) Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and (ii) the EU Market Abuse Regulation (596/2014) and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1052 as such legislation forms part of the law in the United Kingdom (“UK”) pursuant to the EU (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as may be amended and/or supplemented from time to time). No repurchases will be made outside of the United States. The repurchased ordinary shares will be cancelled. Any decision in relation to any future buyback program will be based on an ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business and general market conditions.

Key Highlights from the Eastern Graphite Trend (See Full Results in Table 1)Current Holes - North ExtensionDrill Hole ST23-31 intersected 6.09% graphitic carbon (Cg) over 13.06 metres (m) starting at 20.33m drilled depth, including 11.32% Cg over 4.47m at 20.33m drilled depth; andDrill Hole ST23-24 intersected 5.60% Cg over 4.75m at 52.96m drilled depth.Previous Holes - South ExtensionDrill Hole ST23-26 intersected 9.79% Cg over 18.84m starting at 72.39 m drilled depth; andDrill Hole ST23-17 intersected 11.88% Cg over 13.32m at 28.61m drilled depth, including 14.44% Cg over 8.68 m at 31.13m drilled depth.(Note: All intersections reported are based on drilled width and have not been converted to the true width. True widths are not currently known.)Holes ST23-24, 28, 30 and 31 evaluated the northern extension of the Eastern Trend. Assay results from the four holes are presented in Table 1 and drill hole locations in Figure 2. The northern most holes of the program, ST23-24 and 31, both encountered significant graphite mineralization, with hole ST23-31 grading 6.09% Cg over a 13.06m down-hole thickness. These encouraging near surface results highlight the considerable untested potential at Standard.

(PRI) releases the Primerica Household Budget Index™ (HBI™), showing middle-income households' purchasing power at 101.6% in January 2024, almost unchanged from December 2023. The index has steadily increased since 2014 but dropped to a low of 86.7% in June 2022 due to inflation. Middle-income families have overspent by $2,425 on basic needs since May 2021, with potential growth to 110% without pandemic and inflation impact. Positive None. Negative None. Economist The introduction of the Primerica Household Budget Index (HBI) provides a quantifiable measure of the purchasing power of middle-income households, which is a significant segment of the economy. The stability of the index from December 2023 to January 2024 suggests a relative stabilization in the economic conditions for these households. However, the increase from the previous year indicates a recovery in purchasing power, which could imply that wage growth is keeping pace with, or outpacing, inflationary pressures.From an economic standpoint, this data is essential for understanding the financial health of the middle class. Since consumer spending is a primary driver of economic growth, the HBI can serve as a leading indicator of consumer confidence and potential spending behavior. A stable or increasing HBI could signal a positive outlook for retail and consumer goods sectors, potentially impacting stock valuations in these industries. Financial Analyst For investors, the HBI serves as a tool to gauge the financial well-being of the consumer base that Primerica and similar financial services companies target. The index's baseline comparison to January 2019 allows for a long-term view of consumer financial trends. The historical context provided, showing a peak in November 2020 and a significant dip during the pandemic, offers insight into the volatility and resilience of the consumer market.Investors can use this data to inform decisions regarding sectors that are sensitive to consumer purchasing power, such as discretionary spending and financial services. The fact that the HBI has remained relatively stable suggests that there may not be immediate concerns about consumer default rates, which could impact the financial sector and credit markets. Market Research Analyst Analyzing the Primerica Household Budget Index from a market research perspective reveals the shifting dynamics of consumer behavior. The index's indication that households have cumulatively spent more than budgeted on necessities could suggest a shift towards more budget-conscious spending habits. This could lead to increased demand for value-based products and services, affecting companies' product development and marketing strategies.Furthermore, the potential of the HBI reaching 110% without the pandemic and inflation indicates a suppressed consumer potential. Businesses should consider this latent purchasing power when strategizing for future growth, particularly as economic conditions improve and inflationary pressures ease. This could lead to a rebound in sectors that have been hit hard by reduced consumer spending during the pandemic. 02/29/2024 - 12:00 AM DULUTH, Ga.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Primerica, Inc. (NYSE: PRI), a leading provider of financial services and products in the United States and Canada, announced today the release of the Primerica Household Budget Index™ (HBI™), a monthly index illustrating the purchasing power of middle-income households with income between $30,000 and $130,000. In January 2024, the average purchasing power for middle-income households was 101.6%, relatively unchanged compared to 101.7% in December 2023. A year ago, the index stood at 95.6%. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240228225625/en/Primerica Household Budget Index™ (HBI™) - In January 2024, the average purchasing power for middle-income households was 101.6%, relatively unchanged compared to 101.7% in December 2023. A year ago, the index stood at 95.6%. (Graphic: Business Wire) HBI™ HISTORICAL BACKGROUND The index baseline is set at January 2019 and can be thought of as when middle-income households set a budget based on their earned income at that time. Between 2014 and 2020, the HBI™ results recorded steady gains in purchasing power for middle-income families, with a peak of 105.1% in November 2020. This means that relative to January 2019, households were in a stronger financial position to pay their monthly bills because wage growth outpaced the cost of everyday goods. Increasing inflation then caused the index to plummet. In June 2022, it reached a post-pandemic low of 86.7%. Since May 2021, when the HBI™ dipped below 100% for the first time since the pandemic, the average middle-income household has cumulatively spent around $2,425 more than budget on basic necessities. In line with this, if the pandemic and ensuing inflation would not have been a factor, the HBI™ today would be closer to 110%. For more information on the Primerica Household Budget Index™, visit www.householdbudgetindex.com. About the Primerica Household Budget Index™ (HBI™) The Primerica Household Budget Index™ (HBI™) is constructed monthly on behalf of Primerica by its chief economic consultant Amy Crews Cutts, PhD, CBE®. The index measures the purchasing power of middle-income families with household incomes from $30,000 to $130,000 and is developed using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US Bureau of the Census, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. The index looks at the cost of necessities including food, gas, utilities, and health care and earned income to track differences in inflation and wage growth. The HBI™ is presented as a percentage. If the index is above 100%, the purchasing power of middle-income families is stronger than in the baseline period and they may have extra money left over at the end of the month that can be applied to things like entertainment, extra savings, or debt reduction. If it is under 100%, households may have to reduce overall spending to levels below budget, reduce their savings or increase debt to cover expenses. The HBI™ uses January 2019 as its baseline. This point in time reflects a recent “normal” economic time prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Periodically, prior HBI™ values may be revised due to revisions in the CPI series and Consumer Expenditure Survey releases by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Beginning with the October 2023 release of the HBI™ data, health insurance costs will no longer be included in the calculation of the HBI™ data as part of the healthcare component because of some newly acknowledged methodology that has been used by the BLS to calculate the health insurance CPI. The health insurance CPI, as calculated by BLS, does not measure consumer costs of health insurance such as the cost of premiums paid or a combination of premiums and deductibles, but rather premium values retained by health insurers we do not believe it accurately reflects consumer experiences. The healthcare component will continue to include medical services, prescription drugs and equipment. Prior published values have been adjusted to reflect this change.

Financial Analyst Verizon's announcement regarding the early participation results of their offers to purchase outstanding notes is a significant event for debt management and the company's capital structure. The increase in the Maximum Principal Amount from €1,500,000,000 to €1,981,215,000 indicates a strong demand for the tender offer, which could be interpreted as investor confidence in Verizon's creditworthiness and future performance. The varying levels of participation across different series of notes, with some series seeing over 50% of the outstanding amount tendered, suggest a strategic reshuffling of Verizon's debt maturity profile, potentially lowering future interest expenses. Investors and analysts often scrutinize such debt repurchase programs as they can lead to changes in the company's leverage ratios and interest coverage metrics. The immediate financial implication includes the cash outflow for the Total Consideration and Accrued Coupon Payments, which will affect the company's liquidity position. However, in the long term, if the repurchased debt carries higher interest rates than current market rates, Verizon may benefit from reduced interest expenses, positively impacting net income and earnings per share. Market Research Analyst The tender offer's success, particularly the high participation rate for the 0.875% Notes due 2027, suggests that investors are receptive to Verizon's financial strategy and may be seeking to reallocate capital within their portfolios. This could reflect broader market conditions where investors are looking for stability and predictability in returns, which established companies like Verizon can provide. The tender offer's completion will likely be viewed positively by the market, as it demonstrates Verizon's proactive financial management and could lead to improved financial ratios. Additionally, the involvement of multiple leading financial institutions as lead dealer managers and co-dealer managers underscores the offer's importance and the complexity of such transactions. The market's response to the completion of these offers could serve as an indicator for similar future transactions by Verizon or other large corporates looking to optimize their debt portfolios. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the adherence to securities and blue sky laws is crucial for the legitimacy of the tender offers. Verizon's clear statement that the offers are not being made in jurisdictions where they would not comply with local laws demonstrates their commitment to regulatory compliance. Additionally, the involvement of an information agent and tender agent like Kroll Issuer Services Limited is indicative of the need for transparency and proper communication with note holders throughout the process. Furthermore, the fact that the offers are not conditioned on a minimum amount of notes being tendered, nor on the consummation of any other offers, simplifies the legal framework and reduces the potential for complications arising from interdependent conditions. The defined withdrawal rights and settlement dates provide a clear legal roadmap for the execution of these offers, which is essential for maintaining investor trust and avoiding legal disputes. 02/29/2024 - 03:00 AM NEW YORK, Feb. 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Verizon Communications Inc. (“Verizon”) (NYSE, NASDAQ: VZ) today announced, in connection with Verizon’s previously announced Offers (as defined below) to purchase its outstanding Notes (as defined below), the early participation results for the Offers as of 4:00 p.m. (London time) on February 28, 2024 (the “Early Participation Date”). In connection with the Offers (as defined below), all Notes (as defined below) validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Participation Date (as defined below) will be accepted for purchase, in accordance with the terms of the Offer to Purchase (as defined below). As a result, the maximum principal amount of originally €1,500,000,000 will be increased to €1,981,215,000 (the “Maximum Principal Amount”), to be purchased in all of the Offers, excluding the applicable Accrued Coupon Payments (as defined below).

The Offers are not conditioned on any minimum amount of Notes being tendered, and none of the Offers is conditioned on the consummation of any of the other Offers.

Accordingly, Verizon will settle all Notes validly tendered at or prior to the Early Participation Date and accepted for purchase, on March 4, 2024 (the “Early Settlement Date”). Because the amount of Notes validly tendered at or prior to the Early Participation Date reached the Maximum Principal Amount, there will be no Final Settlement Date (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) and no Notes tendered after the Early Participation Date will be accepted for purchase.

Financial Analyst The announcement of Okeanis Eco Tankers Corp.'s dividend payment represents a direct financial incentive to shareholders and can influence investor sentiment. A substantial dividend of USD 0.66 per common share indicates a transfer of value from the company to its investors. This payout ratio should be evaluated against the company's earnings to assess sustainability. A high dividend yield can attract income-focused investors, potentially increasing demand for the stock. However, it's crucial to consider the company's cash flow and debt levels to ensure that such distributions do not compromise financial stability or future growth opportunities. Market Research Analyst The declaration of a return of capital implies that the company is returning a portion of the investment back to shareholders, which could be interpreted as a sign of strong cash reserves or a lack of attractive reinvestment opportunities. The market often reacts to dividend announcements and the size of this dividend might lead to a positive short-term price movement. Nonetheless, the long-term effect on the stock price will largely depend on the underlying financial health of OET and the sustainability of its dividend policy amidst industry-specific challenges such as fluctuating oil prices and regulatory changes like the CSDR in Norway. Economist When a company like Okeanis Eco Tankers Corp. announces a return of capital to shareholders, it may reflect broader economic conditions. In a low-interest-rate environment, dividends become a more attractive source of income, which can drive investment towards dividend-paying stocks. Conversely, if this return of capital reflects an inability to find productive investments within the company or industry, it could signal a potential slowdown in sector growth. The impact on the stock market will depend on whether investors view the dividend as a sign of financial strength or a lack of growth prospects. 02/29/2024 - 12:05 AM ATHENS, Greece, Feb. 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Okeanis Eco Tankers Corp.

The Board declared a dividend of $0.66 per share. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results reported by Okeanis Eco Tankers Corp. are indicative of a robust performance in the tanker market, particularly in the VLCC (Very Large Crude Carrier) and Suezmax segments. The company's disclosure of a significant increase in the Time charter equivalent (TCE) rates in Q1 2024 compared to the daily rates in Q4 2023 suggests a bullish trend in the tanker chartering market, likely driven by increased demand for crude transportation or a tightening of supply due to geopolitical factors or fleet dynamics. The strategic financial moves such as the amendments to existing leases and the new sale and leaseback agreement demonstrate active balance sheet management aimed at optimizing capital costs and extending debt maturities, which could enhance the company's financial flexibility and resilience against market volatility.Additionally, the declaration of a dividend, despite being accounted for as a return of paid-in capital, reflects a commitment to shareholder returns and might be positively perceived by the market. However, investors should consider the sustainability of such dividends in the context of the company's long-term earnings potential and capital expenditure requirements. The adjustment of charterhire pricing and the removal of early prepayment fees in lease agreements could potentially reduce interest expenses and provide the company with more operational leeway to navigate the cyclical nature of the shipping industry. Market Research Analyst Okeanis Eco Tankers Corp.'s reported increase in TCE rates for the VLCC and Suezmax vessels is a reflection of current market conditions that favor owners and operators of large tanker vessels. The company's performance must be evaluated in the context of the broader industry trends, including oil production levels, international trade routes and regulatory changes affecting shipping operations. The forward-booking percentages and rates for Q1 2024 provide a positive outlook, suggesting that OET is capitalizing on favorable market conditions, which may result in improved revenue forecasts for the near term.It is essential to monitor the company's operational efficiency through metrics like daily vessel operating expenses (opex), which have been maintained at competitive levels. This operational prudence can be a critical factor in sustaining profitability, especially when juxtaposed with the capital-intensive nature of the shipping industry. The company's recent financial activities, including the restructuring of financial leases and securing new credit facilities, indicate a strategic approach to liquidity management and capital structure optimization, which could enhance investor confidence and potentially influence stock performance. Legal Expert The amendments to existing sale and leaseback agreements and the entry into new financial arrangements reflect a proactive approach to capital management and indicate that Okeanis Eco Tankers Corp. is navigating the complex regulatory and financial landscape effectively. The reduction in charterhire pricing and the extension of maturities, combined with the elimination of early prepayment fees, constitute a renegotiation of terms that can provide the company with more favorable conditions and greater flexibility. Such strategic financial restructuring might be a response to the evolving financial environment influenced by the Term SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate), which has become a benchmark for pricing various financial instruments post-LIBOR.Investors should be aware of the implications of these financial maneuvers on the company's contractual obligations and potential risks associated with the guarantees provided by the company. The legal structuring of these agreements could have significant implications for the company's debt profile and overall risk exposure. 02/29/2024 - 12:00 AM ATHENS, Greece, Feb. 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Okeanis Eco Tankers Corp.

Drill results confirm high tenor mineralisation with potential grades of up to 3-5% nickel equivalent. The discovery showcases opportunities in South Greenland for world-class deposits of strategic metals like copper and nickel. Positive Discovery of a new Ni-Cu deposit at Stendalen Project in Southern Greenland. Drill results indicate high tenor mineralisation with grades up to 3-5% nickel equivalent. Geophysical evidence supports the presence of feeder zones for concentrated massive sulphides. 2024 drilling program to focus on targeting higher-grade sulphides. Sulphide textures and tenors similar to globally important nickel-copper deposits. Amaroq plans to upscale exploration activities with more drill rigs and geophysical teams in 2024. Negative None. Geologist The discovery of a substantial Ni-Cu deposit by Amaroq Minerals Ltd. is a significant event in the mining industry, particularly given the global demand for nickel and copper which are critical in the production of electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies. The geological features described, such as the presence of taxitic textures and magmatic sulphides, are indicative of a dynamic magma chamber which is a positive sign for the concentration of these metals. The potential for massive sulphides suggests a large-scale deposit that could impact the global supply of strategic metals.Furthermore, the non-magnetic nature of the pyrrhotite is a noteworthy detail as it affects the exploration strategy. Traditional magnetic surveys may overlook such deposits, hence the use of MobileMT geophysics is a strategic approach for identifying conductive anomalies indicative of sulphide mineralisation. The geological implication of this discovery is that it could lead to a re-evaluation of similar geological settings where non-magnetic sulphides may have been previously dismissed. Mining Economist The exploration results reported by Amaroq Minerals Ltd. have the potential to significantly alter the economic landscape of Southern Greenland and the strategic metal market. The preliminary grades of up to 3-5% nickel equivalent are competitive and if these grades are found consistently across the deposit, they could offer strong economic incentives for further development. The size of the deposit, indicated to be roughly 6km in diameter, suggests the potential for economies of scale which can reduce production costs.However, it is important to note that the actual economic viability of the project will depend on a range of factors including the depth and consistency of mineralisation, the cost of extraction and processing, commodity prices and geopolitical factors. Greenland's position between North America and Europe provides a geopolitical advantage, potentially reducing transportation costs and supply chain risks for manufacturers in these regions. Environmental Analyst The environmental implications of developing a new Ni-Cu mining project in Greenland are multifaceted. On one hand, the extraction of nickel and copper is essential for the transition to a low-carbon economy, as these metals are key components in green technologies. On the other hand, mining activities can have significant environmental impacts, including habitat disruption, water pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.Given the sensitive Arctic environment, it is crucial that Amaroq Minerals Ltd. adheres to stringent environmental regulations and best practices to mitigate these impacts. The company's approach to exploration, as well as any future mining operations, will be closely watched by environmental groups and regulatory bodies. The use of non-invasive geophysical techniques and the potential for shallow mining access at sea level could reduce the environmental footprint of the project. 02/29/2024 - 02:00 AM ***Discovery of significant new strategic metal project 60km from Nalunaq*****Drill results confirm the presence of high tenor mineralisation, typical of a high grade Nickel-Copper deposits**TORONTO, ON / ACCESSWIRE / February 29, 2024 / Amaroq Minerals Ltd. (TSXV:AIM),(NASDAQ Iceland:AMRQ), an independent mine development corporation with a substantial land package of gold and strategic mineral assets across in Southern Greenland, is pleased to announce a significant new Ni-Cu discovery at its Stendalen Project.OverviewOver 140m of disseminated magmatic sulphides containing nickel, copper & cobalt intersected in the first scout drillhole at Stendalen.Sulphides so far intersected are lower grade and disseminated in style and Amaroq will use these results to target the more concentrated massive sulphides expected to be within the deposit.Geophysical results provide evidence of the location of the feeder zone to the deposit and will be the focus for the 2024 drilling programme.The critical aspects of these results, such as sulphide tenors, textures, scale and minerology, are considered similar to globally important nickel - copper deposits.Calculation of the tenor of the sulphides, based upon the assays received, implies that, due to relative metal content, Stendalen holds the ability to host grades similar to analogous deposits, therefore if intersected, massive sulphide could hold grades of up to 3-5% nickel equivalent.Metals are hosted solely in sulphides, therefore Amaroq anticipates strong future metal recoveries.The 2023 drillhole was the first hole into a body that is roughly 6km in diameter; it is therefore possible that Stendalen hosts multiple large orebodies.This mineral discovery further illustrates the opportunities across South GreenlandThe Company believes these results justify further exploration and plans a significant upscale in activities with at least three drill rigs and a dedicated ground geophysical team planned for 2024.References to the accompanying presentation on the Stendalen results on the website by clicking the link below: https://www.amaroqminerals.com/investors/presentations/Eldur Olafsson, CEO of Amaroq, commented:""A new mineral discovery such as that seen at Stendalen is the culmination of many years of hard work by the Amaroq geological team, and is testament to our belief that South Greenland holds exceptional opportunities to host world class deposits. The discovery of strategic metals such as copper and nickel, critical for the energy transition, in a region with such a strong geopolitical position, cannot be overstated. These initial results give us the confidence to deploy a larger proportion of the Company's Gardaq JV fully funded 3 year exploration programme to this project during 2024 and beyond.""James Gilbertson, VP Exploration of Amaroq, commented:""Our geological team made a number of breakthrough predictions following our detailed geological modelling of South Greenland and I'm exceptionally grateful to the Boards of both Amaroq and our JV partners in having the confidence to allow us to test our hypothesis. This scout programme exceeded all of our expectations. Although the current intersection is disseminated lower grade, the features of the rocks indicate that the magma was dynamic, these Taxite textures are fundamental characteristic of the world's largest high grade nickel-copper deposits, including Talnakh (Noril'sk), Sudbury and Voisey's Bay. Further, the sulphide tenors recorded suggest high grades within the system which are the key objectives for our 2024 exploration.This is the start of the road for Stendalen, with further geophysics and drilling campaigns to come. The success of this programme greatly increases the potential for discovering further strategic metal deposits across other identified targets in Amaroq's portfolio and proves, without doubt, the mineral potential of South Greenland.""Discussion on Results2023 Programme and Exploration ResultsGeophysicsIn early 2023, an airborne MobileMT (Mobile MagnetoTellurics) survey was flown by Expert Geophysics Limited over a 10x17km area at 200m line spacing, targeting conductive Ni-Cu sulphide mineralisation at or below the surface. This survey method measures electrical resistivity of the rocks to a depth of approximately 2,000m. Sulphide minerals are typically highly conductive, and if present in sufficient quantities or near surface then they may be directly detectable using this method. The method can also detect changes in rock type, for example the contact of the Stendalen gabbro intrusion with the metasedimentary basement is visible in the survey data. This allows the geometry of the gabbro intrusion to be modelled, and potential favourable sites for Ni-Cu sulphide mineralisation identified.Core DrillingFollowing the positive initial results from the geophysics, a single 1061m diamond drillhole, STE2301, was drilled in the late summer of 2023, targeting a conductive anomaly. The hole intersected the layered gabbro series from surface down to a depth of 694m, where it continued through the metasedimentary basement until the end of hole at 1061m (495m below sea level).From surface to 540m, the gabbro is finely layered, with varying grain size and mineralogy. Much of this layered sequence is weakly mineralised with disseminated pyrrhotite and stringers of pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite.From 540m to 694m the layering becomes poorly defined. The gabbro here is termed ‘taxitic' (variable grain size and textures in the same rock mass) and is mineralised with magmatic nickel-copper sulphides of various textures. Taxite host-rock textures are features of the world's largest nickel deposits, including Talnakh (Noril'sk), Sudbury and Voisey's Bay. Taxites are thought to form due to fluid interactions where different magmas mix. The current interpretation is that this texture relates to the margins of the magma chamber and zones of possible magma recharge. Taxites indicate that the magma chamber was dynamic. Mixing and mingling of magmas in the chamber and incorporation of wall-rock can further help concentrate Ni-Cu-Co in sulphide melt to form a larger deposit.This taxitic layer is situated at roughly sea level with potential future access via a shallow surface portal.The entire sequence is cut by younger granitic pegmatite dykes, which can reach up to tens of metres in thickness.Based on interpretation of the airborne MagnetoTellurics (""MT"") survey data, geological mapping and core drilling, a preliminary geological model illustrating the potential scale of the mineralisation at Stendalen has been developed. Sulphide mineralisation in this model is expected to be situated at the base of the layered series - sulphide melt is dense so naturally sinks and accumulates at the base of magma chamber. Mineralisation may be laterally extensive along the basal contact of the intrusion, with greater accumulations of sulphide within and around the feeder zone. Interpreted cross sections across Stendalen. Diverse range of magmatic sulphide textures from the mineralised taxitic gabbro from 540 to 694m downhole. NQ core diameter is 47.6mm (1 7/8″).Pyrrhotite is normally weakly magnetic but at Stendalen it is non-magnetic. This has implications for exploration; non-magnetic conductors should not be ruled out as sulphide targets. Much of the pyrrhotite at Voisey's Bay is also non-magnetic.2023 Scout Drillhole LocationHole IDEastingNorthingElevation (m)Total Depth (m)DipAzimuthSTE230157169167152485201061.0174016WGS84 / UTM zone 23NKey Intersections from 2023 Scout Drilling ResultsHole IDFromToInterval (m)1Ni ppmCu ppmCo ppmNiEq%2STE2301541663122419619560.08and incl.595.47607.411.93114918261270.23and incl.615.276204.7311961567900.22and incl.628640127539211070.14 1 Interval is core length, true widths have not been calculated at this time2 Nickel equivalent is calculated based on US$7.25/lb Ni, US$3.8/lb Cu and US$13/lb Co with no adjustments for recoveries and penalties.Hole STE2301 did not encounter significant grades of Platinum Group Elements (PGE) but the potential of higher and lower parts of the intrusion has not yet been tested and the system remains prospective.Sulphide tenorGrade is calculated from the product of sulphide tenor and the proportion of sulphides in the rock. So far scout drilling has only intersected lower grade disseminated sulphides (with sulphur grades of up to 5.5% S). However, their existence confirms that the intrusion has reach ‘sulphur saturation' and there is good potential for the presence of massive sulphides within the system. Massive sulphides have a sulphur grade of ~35% S. Taking the assay results from this initial drillhole, it is possible to calculate the likely grades of massive sulphide, were they intersected. When conducting this calculation for Stendalen, it is seen that the metal concentration or ‘sulphide tenors' are high, and the project therefore holds the ability to host material between 3-5% nickel equivalent.In evaluating nickel-copper sulphide mineralisation, its tenor, is of critical importance. At this early stage of exploration, while assessing the initial discovery hole, sulphide tenor is more important than interval grade. Mineralisation observed at Stendalen consists primarily of the sulphide minerals pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite and pentlandite. Ni and Co are preferentially found in pyrrhotite and pentlandite and Cu in chalcopyrite. These metal-bearing sulphide minerals have a very similar sulphur content, which makes it possible to derive the average sulphide tenor from whole-rock sulphur content. To ensure that this calculation is robust, only samples with sufficiently high sulphur grades have been used.Interestingly, the copper content of these sulphides is moderately high at a ratio of about 1.5 copper to nickel.2024 exploration plansGeophysicsThe intersected sulphide zone is not clearly visible in the 2023 airborne MT survey data, and further data processing is planned. Two further programmes are planned for 2024, ground MT and downhole electromagnetics geophysical surveys. Data from all geophysical surveys will then be combined and used to reprocess and reinterpret the deposit models. This should greatly enhance the Company's ability to discriminate sulphide accumulations and will guide all further drilling. The ground MT survey will be performed early in the 2024 season, giving time for drillhole locations to be optimised.Geological mappingDetailed geological and structural mapping of the Stendalen complex will also be used to refine the geological model and understanding of the mineralisation process.DrillingSeveral deep drillholes are planned within the discovery valley zone, up to a maximum depth of 1500m. Up to three drill rigs will be mobilised in 2024. Holes will target the base of the layered series and the modelled gabbro feeder zone which is thought to have good potential for greater accumulations of Ni-Cu sulphides. All holes will be surveyed with downhole EM geophysics, which will greatly enhance the 3D geophysical model at depth.BackgroundThe Stendalen gabbro intrusion was identified during regional mapping by the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS) in 1992. Reconnaissance work by GEUS and Softrock Minerals Ltd. in 1996 located mineralised boulders on a glacier on the west side of the intrusion, grading up to 0.5% Ni, 0.8% Cu and 0.1% Co. A 6,000 m long and up to 200 m thick contact ‘rust zone' was reported on the West, North and East flanks of the Stendalen Gabbro, just above the contact with the metasedimentary basement, and was assumed to be the source of the Ni-Cu sulphide mineralisation, however this was not followed up. The licence was visited by NunaMinerals in 2010, which focussed on a Ti-V mineralised layer within the intrusion but did not consider the intrusion prospective for Ni-Cu sulphide mineralisation.Amaroq acquired the project in 2021, considering Stendalen highly prospective for Ni-Cu sulphide mineralisation following the Company's Mineral System Modelling of the region, and carried out first exploration in 2023. Location of the Stendalen Discovery in South GreenlandGeologyStendalen is a layered mafic intrusion hosted in sulphide and graphite bearing metasediments (migmatites) and located in South Greenland at the junction of Nørrearm and Lindenow fjords, approximately 60km north-east of Amaroq's Nalunaq gold mine. From Amaroq's Mineral System modelling, Stendalen sits on the eastern end of the Gardar-Voisey's Bay fault zone, providing potential spatial relationship to both the rare earth deposits of the Gardar and Vale's Ni-Cu operation at Voisey's Bay.The intrusion itself comprises an upper homogeneous gabbro separated from a lower layered gabbro series by a 5-10m thick magnetite-ilmenite rich layer, which has previously been targeted for its Ti-V potential and has returned grades of up to 10.5% TiO2 and 0.57% V. The layered gabbro series can be classified as a hornblende gabbro, where layering is defined by varying abundances of the minerals hornblende and plagioclase. This layering has been gently folded and steepens towards the edge of the intrusion resulting in a bowl-like shape.Deformation of the intrusion has taken place after it was formed which has likely remobilised sulphide mineralisation. The effect of this, and the potential for further concentration of grades resulting from this is yet to be tested.The intrusion has not been dated, but is likely to be late Ketilidian in age based on cross cutting granite dykes and its deformation history. Amaroq considers Stendalen to be a member of the regional ""appinite suite"" of hydrous mafic and ultramafic intrusions in South Greenland, all of which are held under licence by Amaroq. Several examples of the appinite suite are known to be mineralised with Platinum Group Elements and Ni-Cu sulphides.Deposit ModelIntrusion-related magmatic sulphide nickel-copper deposits contain economically significant concentrations of nickel and copper, often accompanied by other valuable metals such as cobalt, platinum, palladium, and gold.These deposits are closely tied to the intrusion of mafic and ultramafic magmas from the Earth's mantle into the crust. This magma, enriched with metals like nickel and copper, cools and solidifies, forming intrusive igneous rocks.As the magma is emplaced into the crust it can assimilate and dissolve sulphide and graphite rich ‘country rock'. This can cause the magma to reach ‘sulphur saturation' by adding sulphur and changing the magma chemistry.Sulphide saturation is a critical concept in the formation of magmatic sulphide deposits. It refers to the condition where the magma cannot dissolve any more sulphur, leading to separation of an immiscible sulphide melt. This sulphide melt scavenges ‘sulphur loving' metals (Ni-Cu-Co-PGE) from the surrounding silicate melt. Sulphide melt is dense and tends to sink to the base of the magma chamber, where it cools and crystallises. Pyrrhotite, pentlandite and chalcopyrite are the most common sulphide minerals in these deposits.The degree and timing of sulphide saturation is important for concentration of nickel and copper in the deposit; deposits with high sulphide saturation are more likely to host massive sulphide ores, which are rich in nickel and copper.Subsequent hydrothermal activity can also play a role in enriching these deposits. Hot fluids circulating through the rocks can remobilise metals, leading to the formation of secondary mineralisation zones.Sampling and QAQC DisclosureDrill core was cut in half using a diamond blade core saw. Cut lines were consistently drawn along the core layering axis and the right-hand side of the core was sampled. All drill core samples were placed into thick polymer bags with a sample ticket. All samples were prepared at ALS Geochemistry's containerised preparation laboratory on-site at Nalunaq, before being packaged and sent to an accredited laboratory, ALS Geochemistry, Loughrea, Ireland, for analysis.Sample preparation scheme PREP-31BY was used on all samples. This involves crushing to 70% under 2 mm, rotary split off 1 kg, and pulverizing the split to better than 85% passing 75 microns. 100 g pulps were prepared and sent to ALS Loughrea for analysis. Master pulps and coarse reject material is retained in storage at Nalunaq.All samples were assayed with a 60-element Four-Acid Digestion ICP-MS method (ME-MS61r) and with a portable-XRF method (pXRF-34) for Si, Ti and Zr. In addition, all samples were analysed for Pt, Pd and Au by 50 g fire assay with method PGM-MS24 which has a detection limit of 0.0005 ppm Pt, 0.001 ppm Pd and 0.001 ppm Au.Amaroq's QA/QC program consists of the systematic insertion of certified reference materials of known gold content, blanks, and quarter core field duplicates at a rate of 1 in 20 or 5% per QA/QC type in order to detect gold contamination between samples prepared at Nalunaq. Future drilling programmes at Stendalen will include Ni-Cu-PGE specific certified reference materials. In addition, ALS insert blanks and standards into the analytical process. The average sample mass was 2.10 kg.No QAQC issues were noted with the results reported herein.Enquiries:Amaroq Minerals Ltd.Eldur Olafsson, Executive Director and CEOeo@amaroqminerals.comEddie Wyvill, Corporate Development+44 (0)7713 126727ew@amaroqminerals.comStifel Nicolaus Europe Limited (Nominated Adviser and Broker)Callum StewartVarun TalwarSimon MensleyAshton Clanfield+44 (0) 20 7710 7600Panmure Gordon (UK) Limited (Joint Broker)Hugh RichDougie Mcleod+44 (0) 20 7886 2500Camarco (Financial PR)Billy CleggElfie KentCharlie Dingwall+44 (0) 20 3757 4980For Corporation updates:Follow @Amaroq_Minerals on X (Formerly known as Twitter)Follow Amaroq Minerals Ltd. on LinkedInFurther Information:About Amaroq MineralsAmaroq Minerals' principal business objectives are the identification, acquisition, exploration, and development of gold and strategic metal properties in Greenland.

The deal is expected to be immediately accretive to shareholders, with no issuance of debt or equity. The transaction includes 13.0 million barrels of oil equivalent 1P reserves and 21.7 million 2P reserves, positioning VAALCO for significant future development opportunities. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst The acquisition of Svenska Petroleum Exploration AB by VAALCO Energy represents a strategic move within the energy sector, particularly in the exploration and production (E&P) sub-sector. The transaction details, including the $66.5 million gross consideration and the funding mechanism, suggest a prudent financial strategy by VAALCO, avoiding the issuance of debt or equity and using a pre-closing dividend from Svenska's balance sheet. This approach minimizes dilution for existing shareholders and leverages VAALCO's liquidity.From an operational standpoint, the addition of a 27.39% non-operated working interest in the Baobab field is significant. The field's current production of approximately 4,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOEPD) and the estimated 1P and 2P reserves are poised to be immediately accretive to VAALCO's portfolio. The focus on oil (99% and 97% oil in 1P and 2P reserves respectively) aligns with VAALCO's expertise and market demand for crude oil. The strategic expansion into Cote d'Ivoire, a country recognized for its investment-friendly climate, may provide additional geopolitical diversification benefits to VAALCO. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the acquisition's immediate accretion to key shareholder metrics is noteworthy. The net cash due at closing, estimated to be between $30 to $40 million, indicates a well-calculated investment with a manageable financial outlay for VAALCO. The transaction's structure, leveraging cash on hand, is a positive indicator of VAALCO's liquidity and financial health.Moreover, the attractive concession terms, including an 80% cost recovery cap and a 25% cost recovery uplift on development expenditures, coupled with a 53% contractor profit oil take, suggest favorable conditions for VAALCO to maximize its return on investment. These terms are likely to enhance the profitability of the Baobab field operations and provide a competitive advantage in the region. Market Research Analyst Analyzing the market implications, VAALCO's acquisition of Svenska Petroleum is a strategic enhancement of its asset base in West Africa. The deepwater Baobab field, operated by Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNRL), benefits from CNRL's experience and reputation, which could contribute to efficient operations and potential future development opportunities. The deal also underscores the attractiveness of West African assets in the global E&P market, reflecting a continued interest in the region's resources.The mention of significant de-risking through development drilling and the field's production history suggests a mature asset with a lower exploration risk profile. This is likely to be perceived positively by the market, as it reduces the uncertainty associated with exploration activities. Additionally, the emphasis on strong margins and relatively low expected operating expenses can be seen as a strategic move to position VAALCO for sustainable profitability amidst volatile oil prices. 02/29/2024 - 02:00 AM HOUSTON, Feb. 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- VAALCO Energy, Inc. (NYSE: EGY; LSE: EGY) (“VAALCO” or the “Company”) today announced that it has entered into a sales and purchase agreement (“SPA”) to acquire Svenska Petroleum Exploration AB (“Svenska”), a privately-held exploration and production (“E&P”) company based in Stockholm, Sweden (the “Acquisition”). Svenska’s primary asset is a 27.39% non-operated working interest in the deepwater producing Baobab field in Block CI-40, offshore Cote d’Ivoire in West Africa. The gross consideration for the Acquisition is $66.5 million, subject to customary closing adjustments, with an effective date of October 1, 2023. The gross purchase price will be partially funded by a pre-closing dividend of cash on Svenska’s balance sheet to the Seller with the balance funded by a portion of VAALCO’s cash-on-hand with no issuance of debt or equity. Closing of the Acquisition is expected in the second quarter of 2024, with ultimate timing dependent on final receipt of all necessary approvals. VAALCO currently estimates that the net cash due at closing will be in the range of approximately $30 to $40 million, dependent on timing.

George Maxwell, VAALCO’s Chief Executive Officer commented, “Building a diversified portfolio of high performing assets is a key component of our strategic vision. We believe that this acquisition enhances all the key aspects of our strategy. It provides us with additional diversification, strong production and reserves from a proven producing asset, significant organic upside opportunity that is well defined, enhances our ability to generate sustainable cash flow and continue to return cash to shareholders. The Baobab field in Cote d’Ivoire has many parallels with Etame in terms of the historic production profile and how the upside is realized through development drilling campaigns meaning this is an asset type that we understand well. The field has been significantly de-risked through the drilling of 24 production wells, five injection wells and a near 20-year production history. The planned dry-docking and upgrading of the FPSO in 2025 will position us well for the expected production growth from the 2026 drilling program and for future drilling campaigns for many years to come. We are partnering with a great operator and believe our significant development experience offshore West Africa and the successful managing of our FPSO changeover in 2022 will provide insight and experience to help enhance future success at Baobab. We are adding an asset with strong current production and reserves at a very attractive price and using a portion of our cash on hand to fund the deal. This is highly accretive on key metrics to our shareholder base and provides another strong asset to support future growth.” “Our strategic vision has proven highly successful and VAALCO is financially stronger, with more reserves and production, than at any other time in our history. We are in an even better position now to grow in 2024 and beyond. We continue to have no bank debt and we will use our strong cash position to fund organic and inorganic growth opportunities as we remain focused on growing the business. The diversity and strength of our assets are paramount and support our ability to sustainably grow our production and reserves, and generate cash flow while returning value to our shareholders.” Svenska Acquisition Investor Presentation Additional information regarding the acquisition and assets being acquired is available in an investor deck on VAALCO’s website in the Investor Relations section under Presentations. Overview of the Acquisition VAALCO will acquire 100% of the share capital of Svenska from Petroswede AB (“Petroswede” or the “Seller”) in the Acquisition with an effective date of October 1, 2023. Gross consideration for the Acquisition is $66.5 million, subject to customary closing adjustments, with the net cash payment to be made by VAALCO on closing expected to be approximately $30 to $40 million depending on a number of factors including the timing of closing. The Acquisition is subject to a number of customary closing conditions, including regulatory and government approvals. Svenska’s primary license interest is a 27.39% non-operated working interest (30.43% paying interest) in the CI-40 license, which includes the producing Baobab field, located in deepwater offshore Cote d’Ivoire. The field is operated by CNRL, which holds a 57.61% working interest in the project, with the national oil company, Petroci Holding, owning the remaining 15% working interest (10% of which is carried by the other license partners). The Baobab field is located 30 kilometers off the coast of Cote d’Ivoire in water depths ranging from 900 to 1,300 meters. Baobab consists of five distinguishable reservoir units in Middle to Late Albian sequences. The field was discovered in March 2001 with the Baobab 1X well and a second well, the Baobab 2X, was drilled in 2002 to appraise the field. Commercial production from the field began in August 2005. There have been four drilling campaigns at Baobab to date, with the most recent including four production wells and two water injection wells. All wells are tied back to four subsea manifolds that are connected to an FPSO. Cumulative gross production from the field has been approximately 150 MMBOE, a portion of the estimated over one billion barrels of oil equivalent volumes initially in place. Current production from the Baobab field is approximately 4,500 WI BOEPD, with 1P WI CPR reserves at the Effective Date of 13.0 MMBOE (99% oil), and 2P WI CPR reserves of 21.7 MMBOE (97% oil). These reserve figures reflect currently sanctioned development activities; however, CI-40 has a significant growth runway with incremental development potential on the Baobab field, as well as the nearby Kossipo field, expected to provide a material uplift to the reserve and production volumes, supporting long-term production of the asset into the late 2030s. The Acquisition value represents an attractive valuation multiple at $5.12 per BOE 1P WI CPR reserves, or $3.06/BOE of 2P WI CPR reserves based on the full gross consideration. Adjusted to reflect the expected net cash due on closing from VAALCO, likely in the range of $30 to $40 million, these metrics could reduce to as low as $2.31/BOE and $1.38/BOE, respectively. On a value per flowing WI BOE, at the gross purchase price, this equates to about $14,800 per flowing WI BOE and as low as $6,700 per flowing WI BOE at the low end of the expected net cash payment range, substantially below VAALCO’s current implied market value as of February 28, 2024 of about $19,900 per flowing WI BOE. CI-40 has a long history of production and significantly de-risked reservoirs. With almost 20 years of production to date, the FPSO is planned to come off station at the start of 2025 for planned maintenance and upgrade work to allow the FPSO to continue to produce through the end of the expected extended field license in 2038. The scope of work for the FPSO upgrade is currently being finalized. Production on Baobab is expected to re-start in 2026 following the FPSO work program. In addition, a fully appraised development drilling program is expected to start in 2026, targeting the significant incremental probable reserve base on the field. VAALCO sees reduced geological risk relating to this drilling program and the joint venture partners have already commenced the ordering of certain long-lead drilling items. Further future drilling phases have not yet been sanctioned, but there is significant incremental potential in both the Baobab field itself, as well as the nearby Kossipo development, which has also been appraised by two wells drilled in 2002 and 2019. The CI-40 license has an initial term through mid-2028 with the contractual option to extend the license term by 10 years to 2038. Given the development activities associated with the FPSO upgrade and future drilling program, the license partners are currently in discussion with the relevant government bodies in Cote d’Ivoire to secure early license extension on CI-40. The CI-40 license has an attractive fiscal regime, with a cost oil cap at 80% of revenues, a 25% uplift on development capex for cost recovery purposes and (at reasonably expected production levels) a 53% contractor profit oil take. There is no ring-fencing of activities within the CI-40 license, meaning any investment within the block (for example, the future Kossipo development) can be cost recovered from existing production across the wider license. In addition to the CI-40 license in Cote d’Ivoire, Svenska currently owns a 21.05% working interest in the early stage Uge discovery in the OML 145 concession in Nigeria alongside partners ExxonMobil (21.05%), Chevron (21.05%), Oando (21.05%) and NPDC (15.80%). There are minimal commitments on this license interest and no drilling or development is currently planned.

In addition, forward-looking statements reflect VAALCO’s expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this announcement. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of the assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. No obligation is being undertaken to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. Oil and Natural Gas Reserves This announcement contains crude oil and natural gas metrics which do not have standardized meanings or standard methods of calculation as classified by the SEC and therefore such measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Such metrics have been included herein to provide readers with additional measures to evaluate the proposed Acquisition; however, such measures may not be reliable indicators of the future performance of Svenska and future performance. WI CPR Reserves WI CPR reserves represent proved (1P) and proved plus probable (2P) estimates as reported by Petroleum Development Consultants Limited and prepared in accordance with the definitions and guidelines set forth in the 2018 Petroleum Resources Management Systems approved by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. The SEC definitions of proved and probable reserves are different from the definitions contained in the 2018 Petroleum Resources Management Systems approved by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. As a result, 1P and 2P WI CPR reserves may not be comparable to United States standards. The SEC requires United States oil and gas reporting companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved reserves after the deduction of royalties and production due to others but permits the optional disclosure of probable and possible reserves in accordance with SEC definitions. 1P and 2P WI CPR reserves, as disclosed herein, may differ from the SEC definitions of proved and probable reserves because: Pricing for SEC is the average closing price on the first trading day of each month for the prior year which is then held flat in the future, while the 1P and 2P WI CPR pricing is based on pricing assumptions for future Brent oil pricing for 2023 of $84.5 and up to 2030 the Brent Oil price follows the average of four available forecasts and assumes flat real thereafter. Oil price is escalated 2% per year; Lease operating expenses are typically not escalated under the SEC’s rules, while for the WI CPR reserves estimates, they are escalated at 2% annually beginning in 2024. Management uses 1P and 2P WI CPR reserves as a measurement of operating performance because it assists management in strategic planning, budgeting and economic evaluations and in comparing the operating performance of Svenska to other companies. Management believes that the presentation of 1P and 2P WI CPR reserves is useful to its international investors, particularly those that invest in companies trading on the London Stock Exchange, in order to better compare reserve information to other London Stock Exchange-traded companies that report similar measures. However, 1P and 2P WI CPR reserves should not be used as a substitute for proved reserves calculated in accordance with the definitions prescribed by the SEC. In evaluating VAALCO’s business, investors should rely on VAALCO’s SEC proved reserves and consider 1P and 2P WI CPR reserves only supplementally. Following consummation of the Acquisition, VAALCO will report Svenska’s reserves in accordance with the definitions and regulations promulgated by the SEC. Other Oil and Gas Advisories Investors are cautioned when viewing BOEs in isolation. A BOE conversation ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent (6 MCF: 1 Bbl) is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be an incomplete as an indication of value. Inside Information This announcement contains inside information as defined in Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 on market abuse which is part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“MAR”) and is made in accordance with the Company’s obligations under article 17 of MAR. The person responsible for arranging the release of this announcement on behalf of VAALCO is Matthew Powers, Corporate Secretary of VAALCO. What is the gross consideration for the acquisition of Svenska Petroleum Exploration AB? The gross consideration for the acquisition is $66.5 million. What are the primary assets of Svenska Petroleum Exploration AB? Svenska's primary asset is a 27.39% non-operated working interest in the deepwater producing Baobab field in Block CI-40, offshore Cote d’Ivoire in West Africa. How will the acquisition be funded? The acquisition will be partially funded by a pre-closing dividend of cash on Svenska's balance sheet to the Seller, with the balance funded by a portion of VAALCO's cash-on-hand, with no issuance of debt or equity. When is the closing of the acquisition expected? The closing of the acquisition is expected in the second quarter of 2024, with the ultimate timing dependent on final receipt of all necessary approvals. What are the estimated 1P WI CPR reserves as of October 1, 2023? The estimated 1P WI CPR reserves as of October 1, 2023, are 13.0 million barrels of oil equivalent (99% oil). Who operates the primary asset of Svenska Petroleum Exploration AB? The primary asset is operated by Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNRL), based in Calgary, Canada. What are the concession terms for the asset in Cote d’Ivoire? The asset in Cote d’Ivoire has attractive concession terms with an 80% cost recovery cap, a 25% cost recovery uplift on development expenditures, and a 53% contractor profit oil take."

The operating result was €190 million below last year standing at -€56 million and was impacted by the geopolitical situation in Africa and in the Middle East (€65m) and an increase of the unit cost, although partly compensated by a lower jet fuel price. The group unit cost per ASK at constant fuel and constant currency is up 3.5% versus last year due an increase in operational disruption costs for €70 million and a one-time non-cash impact (IFRS2) related to the employee shareholding plan for €30m. Full-Year 2023 Air France-KLM recorded the highest revenue in its history in 2023, amounting to €30bn, up +15.1% at constant currency. The operating margin stood at 5.7%, sequentially improving by +1.2pt compared to last year thanks to a combination of strong yield and load factor. Net income amounted to €934 million, up by €206 million, which, combined with the quasi equity financings occurred during the year, leads to a return in positive equity (€0.5bn). The full year adjusted operating free cash flow was impacted by the payment of the wage taxes, pensions & social charges accumulated during Covid (€350 million). In January 2024, Air France fully redeemed €610 million of the deferred pensions payment to the Caisse des Retraites des Personnels Navigants (CRPN). The Group thanks the CRPN pilots for their support. The Group will redeem the remaining social charges and wage taxes of around €1.7 billion until 2027.

As capacity increased by 6.0% and traffic grew by 5.3%, the load factor was broadly stable at -0.6 point compared to last year. The Group passenger unit revenue per ASK was up +2.8% at constant currency compared to last year. This increase was driven by an increase in yield across all long-haul geographies and Short & Medium-haul. Upsizing and the completion of a quasi-equity financing of €1.5 billion Following the signing on October 26, 2023, of a definitive agreement between Air France-KLM and Apollo (NYSE: APO) regarding the financing of a dedicated operating affiliate of Air France-KLM, the companies announced on November 30th, that they have completed the transaction for an upsized total amount of €1.5 billion. The financing by Apollo-managed and third-party investment vehicles supports a dedicated operating affiliate of Air France-KLM that holds the trademark and most of the commercial partners contracts related to Air France and KLM’s joint loyalty program (“Flying Blue”) as well as the exclusive right to issue ""Miles” for the airlines and their partners. The financing is accounted for as equity under IFRS. As announced by Air France-KLM during its Q3 2023 results, this outcome materializes the steps implemented by the Group to restore its IFRS equity to positive by year end. The transaction upsize to €1.5 billion reflects strong investor confidence and the quality of Air France-KLM Flying Blue Miles issuance activity. The transaction terms disclosed in late October 26, 2023, remain unchanged, with a fixed coupon of 6.4% p.a. for the first four years, with the right for Air France KLM to redeem with at overall financing fixed cost of 6.75% at the first call date. The agreed structure will incur no material changes for Flying Blue members. Air France-KLM will continue managing and operating the Flying Blue loyalty program, and Air France and KLM will each keep full control on the Flying Blue customer database. In addition, the financing structure will not affect social aspects for Air France, KLM nor Air France-KLM employees’ contracts. Success of Air France-KLM Group's global employee shareholding plan On December 21st, 2023, Air France-KLM has successfully finalized its ""Partners for the future"" employee shareholding offer, a capital increase reserved for approximately 75,000 eligible employees of the Group, launched in November 2023. For this Group's first worldwide operation, approximately 17,000 employees located in 19 countries, representing approximately 22% of the total workforce of the Group, have subscribed to the ""Partners for the future"" offer, enabling them to invest in Air France-KLM shares on preferential terms. The total subscription amounts to nearly 46,073,029 euros, corresponding to the issue of 5,716,256 new shares with a par value of one euro each. As a result, the Company's share capital was increased by 5,716,256 euros, from 257,053,613 euros to 262,769,869 euros. Following this issuance, the employee shareholders in Air France-KLM’s share capital, within the meaning of Article L. 225-102 of the French Commercial Code, is just over 3% of the share capital. 2024 OUTLOOK Capacity The Group expects the capacity in Available Seat Kilometers for Air France-KLM Group including Transavia to increase by 5% in 2024 compared to 2023. Unit cost1 For the first quarter 2024, the Group expects a unit cost up +4% compared to 2023 due to the continuation of high disruption cost in the first two months and a one-time payment of 2% of the yearly salary to the KLM staff as agreed in the Collective Labour Agreement. For the full year 2024, the Group expects a unit cost in the range of 1% to 2% compared to 2023. Capex Full year 2024 net capex is expected to stand between 3.0 billion and 3.2 billion euros.

The operating result was positive and stood at €60 million despite geopolitical tensions. The increase in revenues was driven by the high demand in passenger network despite the weakening of Cargo market. Altogether, the network activity posted a strong operating result at €1,693 million in 2023, representing an improvement of €562 million compared to last year. As a consequence, the operating margin rose by 1.6pt to 6.6%. This result was mainly driven by a combination of strong yield and load factor at passenger business. Like in Q4 2023, Q1 2024 will be impacted as well by operational disruptions, while Air France started to fly again to Tel Aviv as per 24th of January.

Overall a good performance, especially with additional capacity increasing revenues versus 2022. Latin AmericaDemand remained very strong over the fourth quarter, enabling to further increase the yield by 3.9% with a high load factor at 89% against a robust 2022. Dynamic regions were Brazil and Central America. Asia & Middle EastCapacity in the fourth quarter has significantly increased versus 2022, by 34.4% however still -26% below 2019 Growth was mainly driven by the growth in China. Yield and load factor remained stable compared to last year despite the geopolitical disruptions across the area. Middle East was impacted by side effects on Egypt and Lebanon due to cancellation on Israel. Dynamic regions over the quarter were India and South East Asia. Caribbean & Indian OceanThe fourth quarter continued to show capacity reductions compared to 2022 (-14.6%) due to redeployment of fleet to other long-haul areas. This lower capacity pushed the load factor up to 87% and yield improved by 12.3%. AfricaDespite the geopolitical situation in Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso, the Group enjoyed continued strong demand resulting in a moderate growth of capacity where unit revenues kept stable. The yield showed resiliency and was up 1% above 2022 while the load factor was broadly stable (-0.7pt). Short and Medium-haulCapacity increased by +5.4% with different dynamics. KLM Medium Haul went up +11%, last year was relatively low due to operational issues. Air France Short and Medium Haul went moderate up by 2%. Air France reduced further its footprint in France.

The yield is still 32% higher than 2019. Compared to last year, full-year revenues dropped by -22.9% although less than previous quarters. The traffic was stable year over year at 0.9% on the back of a strong demand in 2022. The load factor was 2.0 points below 2022, due to the increased belly capacity. The yield declined as well resulting in a decrease in unit revenue per Available Ton Kilometer of -31.8% at constant currency.

Transavia’s capacity increased by 2.9%, traffic increased by 2.3%, and the number of passengers increased by 2.4% resulting in a broadly stable load factor at 84.2% in the fourth quarter. During 2023, Transavia pursued its growth to respond to the demand and satisfy customer expectations with a capacity increase of +13.6% compared to 2022. In total, the company launched 35 new routes in 2023 to various destinations in Europe and beyond from several French airports. The forward booking load factor for the first half of 2024 is broadly stable compared to last year awhile capacity continues to grow. Transavia France restarted as per 1st of February to fly again to Israel.

The company plans to report data from six Phase 2 proof-of-concept trials by the end of 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results reported by argenx SE demonstrate a significant increase in global net product sales, with a year-over-year growth from $400.72 million in 2022 to $1.2 billion in 2023. This substantial revenue growth is primarily driven by the sales of VYVGART, which has expanded its global footprint in the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG). The company's strategic efforts to increase the commercial reach of VYVGART, inclusive of both intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) formulations, have proven effective, leading to approvals in over 30 countries.From a financial perspective, the increase in operating income and net product sales reflects the successful commercialization and market adoption of VYVGART. However, the company reported an operating loss of $425.049 million for the full year 2023, which is a result of significant investments in research and development (R&D) and selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A). The R&D expenses, which include the amortization of a priority review voucher, suggest a strong commitment to pipeline expansion and potential long-term growth, but they also highlight the high costs associated with the development of novel therapies. The financial guidance for 2024 indicates a continued investment in R&D and SG&A, with anticipated expenses of less than $2 billion and a forecasted net cash utilization of up to $500 million.Investors should note the company's robust cash position, totaling $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2023, which provides a solid foundation for ongoing and future R&D activities. The successful global offering of shares in July 2023, which raised $1.2 billion in net proceeds, has significantly bolstered the company's financial resources. Medical Research Analyst The acceptance of the Supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for VYVGART Hytrulo for priority review by the FDA is a critical development for argenx SE. The target action date of June 21, 2024, for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) represents a potential expansion of the drug's label and market. CIDP is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the peripheral nerves and the availability of new treatment options is highly anticipated by patients and healthcare providers alike.The clinical significance of VYVGART, an antibody fragment targeting the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), lies in its novel mechanism of action, which offers a different therapeutic approach compared to traditional immunosuppressive treatments. The expansion of VYVGART's label to include CIDP, if approved, could address a significant unmet need in the treatment of autoimmune neuropathies.Furthermore, the company's pipeline includes other promising candidates, such as empasiprubart, which is currently undergoing Phase 2 studies for various indications. The breadth of argenx's immunology pipeline, including efgartigimod's development in 15 autoimmune indications by 2025, positions the company as a potential leader in the immunology space. However, the outcome of ongoing and future clinical trials will be pivotal in determining the long-term success and impact of these pipeline candidates on patient care and the company's financial performance. Market Research Analyst argenx SE's strategic decision to expand the label of VYVGART into additional autoimmune indications and broader MG populations, including seronegative patients, reflects an understanding of the market's need for innovative treatments in the immunology sector. The company's approach to leveraging existing infrastructure and relationships within the neurology community for a potential CIDP approval indicates a well-planned market entry strategy that could facilitate rapid adoption if regulatory approval is obtained.The global expansion efforts and regulatory approvals in key markets such as the United States, Japan, Europe and the United Kingdom, underscore the company's commitment to addressing the global demand for effective gMG treatments. The anticipated regulatory decisions for VYVGART in additional countries, along with the approval for primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in Japan, could further enhance the company's market presence and revenue streams in the coming years.It is crucial to monitor the competitive landscape and payer dynamics as the company advances its pipeline and seeks to maintain its market position. The potential approval and commercialization of VYVGART for CIDP and other indications will likely contribute to the company's long-term growth, but the success will depend on market acceptance, pricing strategies and the ability to navigate complex reimbursement environments. 02/29/2024 - 01:00 AM $374 million in fourth quarter and $1.2 billion in full year global net product sales sBLA for VYVGART® Hytrulo for CIDP accepted for priority review by FDA with PDUFA target action date of June 21, 2024 On track to report data from six Phase 2 proof-of-concept trials by end of 2024 Management to host conference call today at 2:30 pm CET (8:30 am ET) February 29, 2024, 7:00 am CET Amsterdam, the Netherlands – argenx SE (Euronext & Nasdaq: ARGX), a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases, today reported financial results for the full year 2023 and provided a fourth quarter business update. “argenx reached thousands of new patients and their families in 2023 by delivering on our commitment to make VYVGART available to the global MG community,” said Tim Van Hauwermeiren, Chief Executive Officer of argenx. “This expansion demonstrates that VYVGART has the potential to address the high unmet need for innovation in patients suffering from MG, and moves us closer to sustainability as we build an integrated immunology company. Clinically, we generated significant data through multiple study readouts, achieving key milestones for both the CIDP and MMN patient communities and importantly advancing our second molecule, empasiprubart. Looking forward to 2024, we will act with a continued sense of purpose to expand our patient reach. We will use the learnings and momentum from our gMG launch to strategically lay the groundwork for a potential CIDP approval, leveraging our current infrastructure and deep relationships in the neurology community to position VYVGART SC for success. CIDP patients have been waiting for innovation, and we are eager to translate the transformative ADHERE data into potential benefit for patients as quickly as possible.” FOURTH QUARTER 2023 AND RECENT BUSINESS UPDATE Reaching More Patients with VYVGART VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) is a first-in-class antibody fragment targeting the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), and is now approved in more than 30 countries globally for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG). VYVGART subcutaneous (SC) (efgartigimod alfa and hyaluronidase-qvfc) is approved in the U.S. (as VYVGART Hytrulo), Japan (as VYVDURA®) and Europe, making VYVGART the only gMG treatment available as both an IV and simple SC injection. argenx is planning to reach more patients commercially through its multi-dimensional expansion efforts, including patients earlier in the MG treatment paradigm and new patient populations through global regulatory approvals for MG and the expansion of use to treat additional autoimmune indications. Generated global net product revenues (inclusive of both VYVGART and VYVGART SC) of $374 million in the fourth quarter and $1.2 billion in the full year of 2023Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) approved VYVGART SC in the United Kingdom for the treatment of adult patients with gMG on February 6, 2024, with self-administrationMinistry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) approved VYVDURA in Japan for the treatment of adult patients with gMG, inclusive of seronegative patients, on January 18, 2024, with self-administrationDecisions on regulatory approvals of VYVGART for gMG expected in Switzerland, Australia, Saudi Arabia and South Korea by end of 2024Decision on approval of VYVGART SC for gMG in China through Zai Lab expected by end of 2024Decision on approval of VYVGART for primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in Japan expected in first quarter of 2024Supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for VYVGART Hytrulo accepted for priority review by FDA for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP); Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of June 21, 2024Regulatory submissions of VYVGART SC for CIDP in Japan, Europe, China and Canada expected in 2024Registrational studies to expand VYVGART label into broader MG populations, including in seronegative patients, expected to start in 2024Update on pre-filled syringe development expected in first half of 2024; ongoing clinical studies expected to support potential approval in gMG and CIDP in 2024 Advancing Current Pipeline argenx continues to demonstrate breadth and depth within its immunology pipeline and is advancing multiple pipeline-in-a-product candidates. With efgartigimod, argenx is solidifying its leadership in FcRn and is on track to be approved or in development in 15 autoimmune indications by 2025. Beyond efgartigimod, argenx is advancing its earlier stage pipeline programs, including empasiprubart (C2 inhibitor) with Phase 2 studies ongoing in multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN), delayed graft function (DGF) and dermatomyositis (DM). In addition, argenx is evaluating ARGX-119, a muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) agonist in both congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

The increase is mainly related to the clinical development milestone argenx achieved with AbbVie following the dosing of the first patient in the Phase 2 trial for ABBV-151. Collaboration revenue for full year in 2023 also includes $1 million in royalty revenue from VYVGART sales in China.Other operating income for the fourth quarter and full year in 2023 was $11 million and $42 million, respectively, compared to $8 million and $35 million for the same periods in 2022. The other operating income for the fourth quarter and full year in 2023, primarily relates to research and development tax incentives and payroll tax rebates. Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter and full year in 2023 were $556 million and $1,694 million, respectively, compared to $297 million and $1,166 million for the same periods in 2022, and mainly consists of: Cost of sales for the fourth quarter and full year in 2023 was $39 million and $118 million, respectively, compared to $13 million and $29 million for the same periods in 2022. The cost of sales was recognized with respect to the sale of VYVGART and VYVGART SC.Research and development expenses for the fourth quarter and full year in 2023 were $306 million and $859 million, respectively, compared to $148 million and $663 million for the same periods in 2022. The research and development expenses mainly relate to external research and development expenses and personnel expenses incurred in the clinical development of efgartigimod in various indications and the expansion of other clinical and preclinical pipeline candidates. The research and development expenses for the fourth quarter and the full year in 2023, includes the amortization of the priority review voucher submitted with the sBLA filling for VYVGART Hytrulo for the treatment of CIDP, which resulted in an expense of $102 million.Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter and full year in 2023 were $209 million and $712 million, respectively, compared to $135 million and $472 million for the same periods in 2022. The selling, general and administrative expenses mainly relate to professional and marketing fees linked to the commercialization of VYVGART and VYVGART SC, and personnel expenses. Financial income for the fourth quarter and full year in 2023 was $40 million and $107 million, respectively, compared to $14 million and $28 million for the same periods in 2022. The increase in financial income is mainly due to an increase in interest income which results from higher interest rates and a higher amount of current financial assets, cash and cash equivalents as a result of the financing round in July 2023. Exchange gains for the fourth quarter and full year in 2023 were $37 million and $14 million respectively, compared to $60 million of exchange gains and $33 million of exchange losses for the same periods in 2022. Exchange gains/losses are mainly attributable to unrealized exchange rate gains or losses on the cash, cash equivalents and current financial assets denominated in Euro. Income tax for the fourth quarter and full year in 2023 was $38 million of tax expense and $9 million of tax benefit, respectively, compared to $3 million and $20 million of tax benefit for the same periods in 2022. Tax expense for the fourth quarter in 2023, consists of $12 million of income tax benefit and $50 million of deferred tax expense, compared to $12 million of income tax expense and $15 million of deferred tax benefit for the comparable prior period. Net loss for the fourth quarter and full year in 2023, was $99 million and $295 million, respectively, compared to $39 million and $710 million over the prior year periods. On a per weighted average share basis, the net loss was $5.16 and $13.05 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Cash, cash equivalents and current financial assets totalled $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2023, compared to $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2022. The increase in cash and cash equivalents and current financial assets resulted primarily from the closing of a global offering of shares, including a U.S. offering, which resulted in the receipt of $1.2 billion in net proceeds in July 2023, partially offset by net cash flows used in operating activities.

The deal involves delivering up to 0.8 million tons of LNG per annum for sixteen years starting in 2027. TotalEnergies aims to support sustainability and customer transition to greener energy. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Market Analyst The agreement between TotalEnergies and Sembcorp Fuels represents a strategic expansion in the LNG market, which is of substantial interest to stakeholders within the energy sector. With the commitment of delivering up to 0.8 Mtpa of LNG for sixteen years, this deal secures a long-term revenue stream for TotalEnergies and reinforces its position as a major player in the global LNG space. From an energy market perspective, the additional supply to Singapore can be seen as a move to diversify the country's energy sources and enhance energy security. Given the growing demand for cleaner energy sources, LNG is increasingly becoming a bridge fuel in the transition towards renewable energy. The long duration of the deal also suggests confidence in the sustained demand for LNG and its role in the global energy mix. Furthermore, the deal is likely to have a positive impact on TotalEnergies' stock, as it reflects the company's ability to secure long-term contracts, which are crucial for stability and growth in the energy sector. The emphasis on decarbonization aligns with global trends and investor preferences for sustainable practices, potentially increasing TotalEnergies' attractiveness to ESG-focused investors. Sustainability Analyst From a sustainability standpoint, TotalEnergies' deal with Sembcorp Fuels is an indication of the company’s proactive approach to supporting the energy transition. LNG, while still a fossil fuel, emits up to 50% less carbon dioxide when combusted in a new, efficient natural gas power plant compared with coal. This positions LNG as a transitional fuel that can aid in reducing carbon emissions while renewable energy infrastructure is further developed. It is essential to analyze the potential environmental impact of increased LNG usage. While it is a step towards decarbonization, it is not an end solution. The sustainability of this strategy depends on the development of renewable energy technologies and the eventual reduction of dependency on fossil fuels. The long-term nature of this contract might raise questions about the pace at which TotalEnergies plans to transition to renewables. Investors with a focus on sustainability will likely scrutinize the balance between TotalEnergies' LNG ventures and its investments in renewable energy. The company's commitment to sustainability is critical for maintaining its social license to operate, especially as regulatory pressures and stakeholder expectations around climate change intensify. Financial Analyst Examining the financial implications of the SPA, the deal can be seen as a positive development for TotalEnergies' financial health. The agreement guarantees a steady cash flow over a significant period, which is beneficial for financial forecasting and planning. The deal's size and duration may also lead to economies of scale in LNG production and distribution for TotalEnergies, potentially improving profit margins. It's important to consider the impact of such a deal on TotalEnergies' balance sheet. The capital required for the infrastructure to fulfill this contract could be substantial, but the long-term nature of the agreement provides a clear path to return on investment. Additionally, the deal may have a favorable effect on TotalEnergies’ credit rating, as it demonstrates the company's ability to secure long-term contracts and provides financial stability. Investors should also pay attention to the price volatility in the LNG market. The fixed nature of the contract may shield TotalEnergies from short-term price fluctuations, but it could also limit the potential upside if prices rise significantly over the contract period. The financial performance of this deal will be an area of interest during TotalEnergies' quarterly earnings calls. 02/29/2024 - 02:15 AM PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News: TotalEnergies (Paris:TTE) (LSE:TTE) (NYSE:TTE) has signed a sale and purchase agreement (SPA) with Sembcorp Fuels, a wholly owned subsidiary of Singapore-based Sembcorp Industries.

The FDA has set a PDUFA target action date of June 26, 2024, for ensifentrine, with no advisory committee meeting planned. Verona Pharma secured a $400 million debt financing facility to support commercialization efforts through at least 2026. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Verona Pharma regarding the PDUFA target action date for ensifentrine signifies a critical juncture for the company's financial trajectory. The potential approval of ensifentrine by the FDA could catalyze a significant shift in the company's revenue streams, transitioning from a development-stage to a commercial-stage entity. The $400 million debt financing facility secured in December enhances the company's liquidity, ostensibly ensuring operational funding through at least 2026. This strategic financial maneuvering showcases a robust balance sheet capable of supporting the commercial launch of ensifentrine, should it receive approval.Investors should monitor the FDA's decision closely as it could lead to substantial volatility in the company's stock price. The lack of an advisory committee meeting might be perceived as a positive signal regarding the FDA's stance on the application, potentially reducing regulatory uncertainty. However, it is crucial to consider the inherent risks of investing in biopharmaceutical companies, especially those in the pre-commercial stage, given the binary nature of pivotal regulatory decisions. Medical Research Analyst The significance of ensifentrine's potential approval lies in its novel mechanism of action as a bronchodilator and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, which could revolutionize the COPD treatment landscape. It is noteworthy that ensifentrine could become the first new inhaled treatment for COPD in over two decades. The clinical data from the ENHANCE trials suggest that ensifentrine may offer benefits in terms of exacerbations, lung function, symptoms and quality of life for COPD patients, which is a substantial unmet medical need.Furthermore, the expansion of Verona Pharma's pipeline, including the development of a fixed-dose combination with glycopyrrolate and exploration of a second indication for non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, indicates a strategic approach to leveraging ensifentrine's therapeutic potential. These initiatives could have far-reaching implications for patient care and the company's growth prospects, pending successful clinical outcomes and regulatory approvals. Market Research Analyst Verona Pharma's commercialization strategy, underscored by its 'Unspoken COPD' disease awareness campaign, is a pivotal component of its market penetration plan. The campaign's aim to educate healthcare providers on the burden of COPD aligns with the company's efforts to establish a strong market presence upon potential approval and launch of ensifentrine. The strategic decision to forgo an advisory committee meeting could streamline the approval process, potentially enabling a faster market entry.Market penetration will hinge on successful pricing, distribution and patient engagement strategies, which are slated for finalization in the first half of 2024. The company's collaboration with Nuance Pharma for the development and commercialization of ensifentrine in Greater China further exemplifies a targeted approach to expanding its global footprint. As the company moves closer to potential commercialization, its market strategy will be a determinant factor in capturing market share within the competitive COPD treatment space. 02/29/2024 - 02:00 AM PDUFA Target Action Date for ensifentrine of June 26, 2024 Commercialization preparations advance Strong balance sheet supports commercialization and Company's growth Conference call today at 9:00 a.m. EST / 2:00 p.m. GMT LONDON and RALEIGH, N.C., Feb. 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Verona Pharma plc (Nasdaq: VRNA) (""Verona Pharma"" or the ""Company""), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on respiratory diseases, announces its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023, and provides a corporate update. ""2023 was a pivotal year for Verona Pharma with the acceptance of our New Drug Application (""NDA"") for review by the US Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"") and continued advancement of our commercialization strategy in preparation for the US launch of ensifentrine, if approved,"" said David Zaccardelli, Pharm. D., President and Chief Executive Officer. ""In August, the FDA accepted for review our NDA seeking approval of ensifentrine for the maintenance treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (""COPD"") and assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (""PDUFA"") target action date of June 26, 2024. ""The NDA acceptance brings us closer to our goal of delivering ensifentrine to the millions of patients suffering from COPD. If approved, ensifentrine is expected to be the first novel inhaled mechanism available for the treatment of COPD in more than 20 years. Supported by the results from our ENHANCE (""Ensifentrine as a Novel inHAled Nebulized COPD thErapy"") trials, we believe ensifentrine’s bronchodilator and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory activity has the potential to change the treatment paradigm for COPD. ""While we remain focused on the US commercialization efforts for ensifentrine, we progressed development of two new programs: a fixed-dose combination formulation with ensifentrine and glycopyrrolate, a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (""LAMA""), for the maintenance treatment of patients with COPD via a nebulizer and a potential second indication for nebulized ensifentrine for the treatment of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (""NCFBE""). ""To support our commercialization activities and continued pipeline expansion, we enhanced our financial flexibility through a $400 million debt financing facility in December. We expect this facility, along with our existing cash, to support Verona Pharma's growth including the commercialization of ensifentrine, if approved, through at least 2026. ""Alongside our progress in 2023, our development partner Nuance Pharma continued to enroll patients into a pivotal Phase 3 trial evaluating ensifentrine for the maintenance treatment of COPD in China. Nuance Pharma are developing and, if approved, will commercialize ensifentrine in Greater China and we look forward to providing future updates. ""We expect 2024 to be a transformational year for Verona Pharma. We are finalizing our US launch preparations and look forward to commercializing ensifentrine in the second half of 2024, if approved. We also look forward to continued progress on our development programs as we work to build-out our pipeline."" Program Updates and Key Milestones The Company’s near-term milestones include: The FDA has assigned a PDUFA target action date of June 26, 2024 and notified the Company that it is not currently planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the application. If approved, the Company intends to launch ensifentrine in the US market in the second half of 2024.In the first half of 2024, the Company will work to finalize key launch activities including pricing, distribution and patient services, healthcare professional and patient engagement plans. Additionally, Verona's disease awareness campaign, titled ""Unspoken COPD,"" will continue to highlight to key healthcare providers the burden of COPD for patients.The Company is developing a fixed-dose combination formulation with ensifentrine and glycopyrrolate, a LAMA, for the maintenance treatment of patients with COPD via delivery in a nebulizer. Following development activities to confirm a feasible formulation, in the second half of 2024, the Company plans to submit an investigational new drug application (""IND"") to the FDA and, subject to clearance, initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of the fixed-dose combination formulation in COPD patients.In the second half of 2024, the Company plans to commence a Phase 2 clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of nebulized ensifentrine in patients with NCFBE, subject to clearance by the FDA. Fourth Quarter and Recent Highlights In October 2023, the Company gave four presentations on pooled and subgroup post hoc analyses from the ENHANCE trials evaluating ensifentrine in COPD covering data related to exacerbations, lung function, symptoms and quality of life endpoints and use of daily rescue medication, at CHEST Annual Meeting 2023. Also at CHEST, the Company launched the ""Unspoken COPD"" disease awareness campaign, highlighting how many COPD patients struggle to talk about their condition.Also in October 2023, the Company presented an update on key launch preparations including the overall market opportunity for ensifentrine, if approved, the finalization of sales force deployment strategy, Hub services and distribution pathway, as well as internal infrastructure needed to support the commercialization of ensifentrine.In December 2023, the Company completed a debt facility providing access to up to $400 million from funds managed by Oxford Finance and Hercules Capital. The debt facility provides non-dilutive capital and further financial flexibility to support Verona Pharma’s continued growth, including the commercialization of ensifentrine. The Company drew $50 million at closing, a portion of which was used to repay amounts outstanding under the previous $150 million debt facility with Oxford, and the remainder is available upon achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones and other conditions.In February 2024, Michael Austwick joined the board as a Non-Executive Director and Rishi Gupta stepped down from the board after 7 years of service. Mr. Austwick brings a wealth of strategic and operational experience in the biopharmaceutical industry including more than 15 years of respiratory expertise in leadership roles across the US, China, Europe and Japan. Most recently, he served as CEO at Vectura, and previously as Nordic General Manager and Head of the Global Respiratory Franchise at Novartis and as Head of US Respiratory and Vice President Global Inhaled Respiratory at AstraZeneca. Mr. Austwick has led the development and commercialization of more than 10 brands. Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Cash position: Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2023, were $271.8 million (December 31, 2022: $227.8 million). The Company believes cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2023, and funding expected to become available under the $400 million debt facility, will enable Verona Pharma to fund planned operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least the end of 2026 including the commercial launch of ensifentrine in the US, if approved.R&D Expenses: Research and development (""R&D"") expenses were $4.1 million for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023 (Q4 2022: $6.8 million). This decrease of $2.7 million was primarily due to a $2.1 million decrease in clinical trial and other development costs as, in the prior year, the Company was incurring costs with the then ongoing Phase 3 ENHANCE program.SG&A Expenses: Selling general and administrative expenses (""SG&A"") were $15.0 million for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023 (Q4 2022: $8.3 million). The increase of $6.7 million was primarily due to a $3.2 million increase in people related costs, inclusive of share-based compensation, and an increase of $3.5 million related to the build-out of the commercial and information technology infrastructures in preparation for a potential commercial launch, marketing and market development expenses, travel and other corporate costs.Net loss: Net loss was $14.1 million for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023 (Q4 2022: net loss $10.5 million). Full Year 2023 Financial Results R&D Expenses: R&D expenses were $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 (full year 2022: $49.3 million), a decrease of $32.1 million.

In the third quarter of 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration accepted for review the Company’s NDA for ensifentrine for the maintenance treatment of patients with COPD and assigned a PDUFA target action date of June 26, 2024. If approved, ensifentrine has the potential to become the first inhaled non-steroidal therapy for the treatment of respiratory diseases that combines bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory activities in one molecule. The Company has evaluated nebulized ensifentrine in its Phase 3 clinical program ENHANCE (""Ensifentrine as a Novel inHAled Nebulized COPD thErapy"") for COPD maintenance treatment. Ensifentrine met the primary endpoint in both ENHANCE-1 and ENHANCE-2 trials demonstrating statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in lung function. In addition, ensifentrine substantially reduced the rate and risk of COPD exacerbations in pooled analysis from ENHANCE-1 and ENHANCE-2. Two additional formulations of ensifentrine have been evaluated in Phase 2 trials for the treatment of COPD: dry powder inhaler (""DPI"") and pressurized metered-dose inhaler (""pMDI""). Ensifentrine also has potential applications in cystic fibrosis, non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, asthma and other respiratory diseases.

Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results released by CRH plc show a robust performance in 2023, with a noteworthy 7% increase in total revenues and a 14% increase in income from continuing operations. The Adjusted EBITDA growth of 15% is significant, as it reflects the operational efficiency and pricing strategy effectiveness. The Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion by 120 basis points to 17.7% signifies the company's ability to enhance profitability amidst market challenges. The earnings per share (EPS) growth of 22% and the pre-impairment EPS growth of 30% are particularly impressive, indicating strong earnings growth and shareholder value creation.From a capital allocation perspective, the $3 billion share buyback program completion and the initiation of a new $0.3 billion tranche, along with a 5% increase in the dividend payout, signal a shareholder-friendly approach and confidence in the company's future prospects. The acquisition of materials assets in Texas and the majority stake in Adbri in Australia demonstrate strategic growth initiatives and market expansion. The strong balance sheet with high cash reserves and the guidance for FY24 suggest continued growth and resilience against inflationary pressures. Market Research Analyst CRH's performance in the construction materials sector is indicative of broader market trends. The 10th consecutive year of margin expansion underscores the company's competitive edge in delivering integrated solutions. The focus on sustainability and the validation of decarbonization targets by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) align with the increasing global emphasis on environmental responsibility, potentially enhancing the company's reputation and market position.The strategic acquisitions, particularly in the high-growth Texas market, align with infrastructure investment trends in North America. The positive outlook for 2024, with expectations of favorable market conditions and continued pricing momentum, suggests that CRH is well-positioned to capitalize on government and EU funding initiatives, particularly in infrastructure and non-residential segments. However, the expected subdued new-build residential activity due to affordability constraints presents a challenge that the company will need to navigate. Construction Industry Analyst CRH's strategic shift from a supplier of base materials to a provider of value-added solutions reflects a deeper industry trend towards specialization and innovation in construction. The company's ability to solve complex problems for customers while simplifying the construction process is a competitive advantage. CRH's emphasis on product innovation and technical expertise, as well as its integrated solutions strategy, are likely to resonate with industry needs for sustainable and efficient construction practices.The acquisitions and investments in strategic bolt-on acquisitions indicate an aggressive growth strategy, which is supported by the company's strong cash flow and efficient capital allocation. The investments in the Texas market and the majority stake in Adbri in Australia suggest a targeted approach to expansion in regions with high growth potential. The company's performance in the Americas and Europe, with particular strength in materials solutions, reflects a well-executed strategy in the face of inflationary pressures and varying market demands. 02/29/2024 - 02:00 AM DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CRH plc (NYSE:CRH) (LSE:CRH): Key Highlights Summary Financials (U.S. GAAP) 2023 Change Total revenues $34.9bn +7% Income from continuing operations $3.1bn +14% Income from continuing operations margin 8.8% +60bps Adjusted EBITDA* $6.2bn +15% Adjusted EBITDA margin* 17.7% +120bps EPS (continuing operations) $4.36 +22% EPS (continuing operations) pre-impairment* $4.65 +30% Return on net segment assets 14.4% +130bps Return on Net Assets* 15.3% +200bps Net cash provided by operating activities $5.0bn +32% Strong performance; further growth in revenues, Adj.

Total revenues of $34.9 billion (2022: $32.7 billion) were 7% ahead of 2022 while organic revenues* were 3% ahead. Income from continuing operations was 14% ahead of 2022 at $3.1 billion (2022: $2.7 billion) and Adjusted EBITDA* of $6.2 billion (2022: $5.4 billion) was 15% ahead, reflecting the continued delivery of our integrated solutions strategy, strong commercial management, ongoing cost control and further operational efficiencies.

Americas Materials Solutions' total revenues were 8% ahead of 2022, primarily driven by price increases across all lines of business. Adjusted EBITDA was 16% ahead, as good commercial management offset the impact of higher input costs. Americas Building Solutions delivered a positive performance with total revenues 13% ahead of 2022, led by price improvements across both Building & Infrastructure Solutions and Outdoor Living Solutions as well as contributions from acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA was 18% ahead supported by price progression and operational efficiencies along with strong performances from recent acquisitions. Europe Materials Solutions benefited from continued pricing progress which more than offset the impact of lower activity levels, resulting in total revenues 4% ahead of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was 17% ahead, driven by commercial excellence measures along with a continued focus on cost management. Europe Building Solutions' total revenues were 2% behind 2022, as positive pricing was offset by subdued demand in new-build residential markets. Adjusted EBITDA was 17% behind as a result of lower activity levels, partially offset by cost saving actions. CRH's earnings per share from continuing operations was 22% higher than 2022 at $4.36 (2022: $3.58). Earnings per share pre-impairment* from continuing operations was 30% higher than 2022 at $4.65 (2022: $3.58). Sustainability Sustainability is deeply embedded in all aspects of our business. We continue to integrate our materials, products and services to offer more sustainable solutions for our customers and advance circularity. We also continue to make progress on our target to deliver a 30% reduction in absolute carbon emissions by 2030. The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) has validated our 2030 decarbonization targets in line with a 1.5°C trajectory, keeping us on the path to achieving our overall ambition of becoming a net-zero business by 2050. Capital Allocation Our strong financial position and cash generation capabilities provide us with the opportunity to continue to return cash to our shareholders, while at the same time investing in our business and delivering on our strategic growth initiatives. In November 2023 the Board announced the acceleration of the 2023 dividend payment by distributing a second interim dividend of $1.08 per ordinary share in lieu of a final dividend (2022: $1.03). This resulted in a full-year dividend per share of $1.33 for 2023 (2022: $1.27), representing a 5% increase compared to the prior year. This second interim dividend was paid on January 17, 2024. As previously announced, commencing in Q1 2024, CRH will transition to quarterly dividends. The Board has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share, representing an annualized increase of 5% on the prior year. The dividend will be paid wholly in cash on April 17, 2024 to shareholders registered at the close of business on March 15, 2024. The ex-dividend date will be March 14, 2024. As part of its ongoing share buyback program, CRH repurchased 54.9 million (2022: 29.8 million) ordinary shares in 2023 for a total consideration of $3.0 billion (2022: $1.2 billion). On December 21, 2023, the Company announced a new tranche of $0.3 billion which completed on February 28, 2024. We are pleased to announce that we are extending the program with an additional $0.3 billion tranche to be completed no later than May 9, 2024. We will continue to assess our share buyback program throughout 2024 with further updates on a quarterly basis. Consistent with CRH’s disciplined approach to capital allocation, the ongoing share repurchases demonstrate our confidence in the outlook for our business and our continued strong cash generation, while retaining the financial flexibility to invest in further growth and value creation opportunities for our shareholders. We remain committed to a policy of consistent long-term dividend growth and maintaining our strong investment-grade credit rating. 2024 Full Year Outlook Overall, we expect a favorable market backdrop and continued positive pricing momentum in 2024 driven by significant infrastructure investment and re-industrialization activity across our key markets in North America and Europe. Our operations in North America are expected to benefit from increased infrastructure activity underpinned by strong federal and state funding, while investments in critical manufacturing and clean energy initiatives are expected to support key non-residential segments. New-build residential activity is expected to remain subdued in 2024 due to ongoing affordability constraints arising from the current interest rate environment, while residential repair and remodel activity is expected to remain resilient. In Europe, we expect to benefit from positive pricing, disciplined cost control and good underlying demand in infrastructure and key non-residential markets which are supported by government and EU funding initiatives, while residential construction activity is expected to remain subdued. Assuming normal seasonal weather patterns and no major dislocations in the macroeconomic environment, CRH remains well positioned for another year of growth in 2024 as we continue to execute our uniquely integrated and value-added solutions strategy, supported by the strength and flexibility of our balance sheet and disciplined approach to capital allocation. 2024 Guidance (in $ billions, except per share data) Low High Net income (i) 3.55 3.80 Adjusted EBITDA* 6.55 6.85 EPS (i) $5.15 $5.45 Capital expenditure 2.2 2.4 (i) 2024 Net income and EPS are based on approximately $0.4 billion interest expense, net, effective tax rate of approximately 23% and approximately 690 million of common shares currently outstanding.

Organic revenues* were 7% behind the prior year. Within Building & Infrastructure Solutions, total revenues declined by 3% compared with 2022. Infrastructure Products delivered growth in total revenues as positive pricing more than offset slower new-build residential activity across most European markets. Precast revenues were behind 2022 as positive commercial progress was offset by lower market activity. Revenues in Construction Accessories were behind the prior year as price increases were offset by subdued new-build residential activity in several markets. Revenues in Outdoor Living Solutions were 4% ahead of the prior year as positive pricing more than offset the impact of lower demand and unfavorable weather in certain key markets. Despite disciplined commercial management, cost saving initiatives and lower raw materials and haulage costs, Adjusted EBITDA in Europe Building Solutions declined by 17% compared with the prior year, a 20% decrease on an organic* basis, primarily driven by a slowdown in residential construction activity. Consequently, Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased by 170bps compared with the prior year. Other Financial Items Depreciation, depletion and amortization charges of $1.6 billion were in line with the prior year (2022: $1.6 billion). Arising from CRH’s annual impairment testing process, non-cash impairment charges of $0.3 billion were recognized in 2023 (2022: $nil) related to the Philippines business which has been impacted by challenging market conditions. An additional impairment charge of $0.1 billion was recognized primarily related to assets held for sale. Gains on disposal of long-lived assets of $66 million were higher than 2022 (2022: $50 million). Interest income of $206 million (2022: $65 million) was significantly higher than 2022 as a result of increased interest rates on deposits. Interest expense of $376 million (2022: $344 million) was higher than the prior year primarily as a result of higher interest rates on floating rate debt, interest rate swaps and new fixed rate debt issued, partially offset by interest on maturing debt. Income from continuing operations before income tax expense and income from equity method investments was $4.0 billion (2022: $3.5 billion), and the associated tax charge of $925 million (2022: $762 million) represented an effective tax rate of 23% (2022: 22%). The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the impact of the non-cash impairment charges recognized in 2023. Earnings per share from continuing operations was 22% higher than 2022 at $4.36 (2022: $3.58). Excluding non-cash impairment charges, earnings per share of $4.65* was 30% higher than the prior year. Balance Sheet and Liquidity 2023 represented another year of improved cash generation for CRH with net cash provided by operating activities of $5.0 billion (2022: $3.8 billion) driven by higher income from continuing operations and lower working capital compared to 2022. Total short-term and long-term debt was $11.6 billion (2022: $9.6 billion). In April 2023, €750 million of euro-denominated notes were repaid. Subsequently, €2 billion in new euro-denominated notes were issued in July 2023, followed by a further repayment of €500 million of euro-denominated notes in November 2023. The increase in year-end Net Debt* to $5.4 billion (2022: $3.9 billion) reflects inflows from operations more than offset by outflows from the purchase of property, plant and equipment, acquisitions and cash returns to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. CRH ended 2023 with $6.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand (2022: $5.9 billion) and $3.9 billion of undrawn committed facilities which are available until 2028. At year end, CRH had sufficient cash balances to meet all maturing debt obligations for the next 4.7 years and the weighted average maturity of the remaining term debt was 12.1 years. CRH also has a $2.0 billion U.S. Dollar Commercial Paper Program and a €1.5 billion Euro Commercial Paper Program of which there were $1.0 billion outstanding issued notes at year end. CRH remains committed to maintaining its robust balance sheet and expects to maintain a strong investment-grade credit rating with a BBB+ or equivalent rating with each of the three main rating agencies. Acquisitions and Divestitures In 2023, CRH completed 22 acquisitions for a total consideration of $0.7 billion. CRH also realized proceeds from divestitures and disposals of long-lived assets (including deferred divestiture consideration received) of $0.1 billion. The largest acquisition in 2023 was in Americas Building Solutions where CRH completed the acquisition of Hydro International, a leading provider of stormwater and wastewater solutions in North America and Europe. In addition, Americas Building Solutions completed a further four acquisitions and Americas Materials Solutions completed eight acquisitions for a total spend of $0.4 billion.

Full statutory financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 prepared in accordance with IFRS, upon which the Auditor has given an unqualified audit report, have not yet been filed with the Registrar of Companies. Full statutory financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, prepared in accordance with IFRS and containing an unqualified audit report, have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. Appendix 2 - Non-GAAP Reconciliation and Supplementary Information CRH uses a number of non-GAAP performance measures to monitor financial performance. These measures are referred to throughout the discussion of our reported financial position and operating performance on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise defined and are measures which are regularly reviewed by CRH management. These performance measures may not be uniformly defined by all companies and accordingly may not be directly comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures by other companies. Certain information presented is derived from amounts calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP but is not itself an expressly permitted GAAP measure. The non-GAAP performance measures as summarized below should not be viewed in isolation or as an alternative to the equivalent GAAP measure. Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization, loss on impairments, gain/loss on divestitures, income/loss from equity method investments, substantial acquisition-related costs and pension expense/income excluding current service cost component. It is quoted by management in conjunction with other GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures to aid investors in their analysis of the performance of the Company. Adjusted EBITDA by segment is monitored by management in order to allocate resources between segments and to assess performance. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by expressing Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenues. Reconciliation to its nearest GAAP measure is presented below: in $ millions 2023 2022 Net income 3,072 3,889 Income from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense – (1,190) Income from continuing operations 3,072 2,699 Loss (income) from equity method investments 17 – Income tax expense 925 762 Loss (gain) on divestitures (i) – 99 Pension income excluding current service cost component (i) (3) (30) Other interest, net (i) 5 – Interest expense 376 344 Interest income (206) (65) Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1,633 1,552 Loss on impairments (ii) 357 – Substantial acquisition-related costs (iii) – 27 Adjusted EBITDA 6,176 5,388 Total revenues 34,949 32,723 Adjusted EBITDA margin 17.7% 16.5% (i) Loss (gain) on divestitures, pension income excluding current service cost component and other interest, net have been included in Other nonoperating (expense) income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. (ii) For the year ended December 31, 2023, the total impairment loss comprised of $62 million within Americas Materials Solutions and $295 million within Europe Materials Solutions. (iii) Represents expenses associated with non-routine substantial acquisitions, which are those not bolt-on in nature and are separately reported in Note 4 “Acquisitions” of the audited financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. Expenses in 2022 include legal and consulting expenses related to the acquisition of Barrette. Adjusted EBITDA is not defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by GAAP. Reconciliation to its nearest GAAP measure for the mid-point of the 2024 Adjusted EBITDA guidance is presented below: in $ billions 2024 Mid-Point Net income 3.7 Income tax expense 1.1 Interest expense, net 0.4 Depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment 1.7 Other (i) (0.2) Adjusted EBITDA 6.7 (i) Other primarily relates to loss (income) from equity method investments and loss (gain) on divestitures. Return on Net Assets (RONA): Return on Net Assets is a key internal pre-tax and pre-impairment (which is non-cash) measure of operating performance throughout the Company and can be used by management and investors to measure the relative use of assets between CRH’s segments. The metric measures management’s ability to generate income from the net assets required to support that business, focusing on both profit maximization and the maintenance of an efficient asset base; it encourages effective fixed asset maintenance programs, good decisions regarding expenditure on property, plant and equipment and the timely disposal of surplus assets. It also supports the effective management of the Company’s working capital base. RONA is calculated by expressing operating income from continuing operations and operating income from discontinued operations excluding loss on impairments (which are non-cash) as a percentage of average net assets. Net assets comprise total assets by segment (including assets held for sale) less total liabilities by segment (excluding finance lease liabilities and including liabilities associated with assets classified as held for sale) as shown below and detailed in Note 3 “Assets held for sale and discontinued operations” of the audited financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K and excludes equity method investments and other financial assets, Net Debt (as defined below) and tax assets and liabilities. The average net assets for the year is the simple average of the opening and closing balance sheet figures. Reconciliation to its nearest GAAP measure is presented below: in $ millions 2023 2022 Operating income A 4,186 3,809 Operating income from discontinued operations — 89 4,186 3,898 Adjusted for loss on impairments (i) 357 — Numerator for RONA computation 4,543 3,898 Current year Segment assets (ii) 38,868 38,504 Segment liabilities (ii) (10,169) (8,883) B 28,699 29,621 Finance lease liabilities 117 81 28,816 29,702 Assets held for sale (iii) 1,268 — Liabilities associated with assets classified as held for sale (iii) (375) — 29,709 29,702 Prior year Segment assets (ii) 38,504 37,951 Segment liabilities (ii) (8,883) (9,246) C 29,621 28,705 Finance lease liabilities 81 83 29,702 28,788 Denominator for RONA computation - average net assets 29,706 29,245 Return on net segment assets (A divided by average of B and C) 14.4% 13.1% RONA 15.3% 13.3% Total assets as reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets 47,469 45,319 Total liabilities as reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets 25,848 22,279 (i) Operating income is adjusted for loss on impairments. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the total impairment loss comprised of $62 million within Americas Materials Solutions and $295 million within Europe Materials Solutions. (ii) Segment assets and liabilities as disclosed in Note 20 “Segment Information” in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. (iii) Assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets classified as held for sale as disclosed in Note 3 “Assets held for sale and discontinued operations” in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. Net Debt: Net Debt is used by management as it gives additional insight into the Company’s current debt position less available cash. Net Debt is provided to enable investors to see the economic effect of gross debt, related hedges and cash and cash equivalents in total. Net Debt comprises short and long-term debt, finance lease liabilities, cash and cash equivalents and current and noncurrent derivative financial instruments (net). Reconciliation to its nearest GAAP measure is presented below: in $ millions 2023 2022 Short and long-term debt (11,642) (9,636) Cash and cash equivalents (i) 6,390 5,936 Finance lease liabilities (117) (81) Derivative financial instruments (net) (37) (86) Net Debt (5,406) (3,867) (i) Includes $49 million cash and cash equivalents reclassified as held for sale. Organic Revenue and Organic Adjusted EBITDA: Because of the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, currency exchange translation and other non-recurring items on reported results each year, CRH uses organic revenue and organic Adjusted EBITDA as additional performance indicators to assess performance of pre-existing (also referred to as underlying, heritage, like-for-like or ongoing) operations each year. Organic revenue and organic Adjusted EBITDA are arrived at by excluding the incremental revenue and Adjusted EBITDA contributions from current and prior year acquisitions and divestitures, the impact of exchange translation, and the impact of any one-off items. Changes in organic revenue and organic Adjusted EBITDA are presented as additional measures of revenue and Adjusted EBITDA to provide a greater understanding of the performance of the Company. Organic change % is calculated by expressing the organic movement as a percentage of the prior year (adjusted for currency exchange effects). A reconciliation of the changes in organic revenue and organic Adjusted EBITDA to the changes in total revenues and Adjusted EBITDA by segment, is presented with the discussion within each segment’s performance in tables contained in the segment discussion above. EPS pre‑impairment: EPS pre‑impairment is a measure of the Company's profitability per share from continuing operations excluding any loss on impairments (which is non-cash) and the related tax impact of such impairments. It is used by management to evaluate the Company's underlying profit performance and its own past performance. EPS information presented on a pre‑impairment basis is useful to investors as it provides an insight into the Company's underlying performance and profitability. EPS pre‑impairment is calculated as income from continuing operations adjusted for (i) net (income) attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests (ii) net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests (iii) adjustment of redeemable noncontrolling interests to redemption value and excluding any loss on impairments (and the related tax impact of such impairments) divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the year.

Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2023 Unaudited Financial Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary iHuman Inc. announces unaudited financial results for Q4 2023 and FY 2023, showcasing revenue growth, profitability, and strategic acquisitions. The company's average total MAUs reached record highs, reflecting a strong market position and international expansion. Positive Revenue growth in Q4 and FY 2023 demonstrates iHuman's resilience and market strength. Strategic acquisitions, like the 'Cosmicrew' IP assets, are expected to enhance product offerings and market reach. Average total MAUs reaching record levels in both periods indicate strong user engagement and market recognition. Profitability maintained for eight consecutive quarters signifies sustainable growth and financial stability. Issuance of a special cash dividend reflects confidence in long-term growth prospects and shareholder value. Enhanced product suite, international expansion, and industry accolades highlight iHuman's successful strategic initiatives. Negative Operating income and net income declined in Q4 2023 compared to the same period last year. Increase in sales and marketing expenses in Q4 2023 may impact profitability despite revenue growth. Decline in gross profit margin in Q4 2023 raises concerns about cost management efficiency. Decrease in average total MAUs in FY 2023 compared to Q4 2023 may indicate potential user retention challenges. Deferred revenue and customer advances decreased, which could impact future revenue streams. Financial Analyst The recent financial results reported by iHuman Inc. reveal a nuanced picture of the company's performance. Despite a marginal year-over-year decline in fourth-quarter revenues and net income, the expansion in average total MAUs and the full-year revenue growth indicate a robust user base and product demand. The decrease in fourth-quarter revenues and operating income could be attributed to normalization post an exceptional year due to pandemic-related demand, a common trend seen across tech and educational sectors as global economies reopen.From an investment perspective, the sustained profitability and the declaration of a special cash dividend are positive signals of the company's financial health and management's confidence in long-term growth. However, investors should be cautious about the marginal decline in quarterly performance and consider the potential implications of China's declining birth rate on the company's domestic market growth prospects. The acquisition of 'Cosmicrew' IP assets indicates strategic content expansion, potentially opening new revenue streams and enhancing user engagement, which could be favorable for long-term value creation. Market Research Analyst iHuman's strategic pivot towards international markets and broader age demographics is a response to external challenges such as China's declining newborn population. The success of their globally-oriented app, 'Aha World' and flagship product, 'iHuman Chinese', in international and domestic markets respectively, illustrates the company's ability to capture diverse market segments. The acquisition of the 'Cosmicrew' IP is a significant move to bolster the company's content offerings and could enhance its competitive position in the children's entertainment sector.Investors should note the company's effective utilization of digital and physical product integration, as seen with the 'iHuman Fantastic Friends' app and its complementary physical products. This strategy could lead to increased user engagement and revenue per user. The company's financial strategy, including the special dividend issuance, suggests a balanced approach to rewarding shareholders while retaining sufficient capital for future growth initiatives. Economist The broader economic context is essential when evaluating iHuman's performance. Despite the global economic downturn, iHuman's financial results indicate resilience and adaptability. The company's growth amidst economic challenges highlights the potential counter-cyclical nature of the educational technology sector, where demand for high-quality educational content may remain stable or even increase during economic uncertainty.The strategic acquisition and international market expansion also suggest that iHuman is seeking to mitigate risks associated with economic fluctuations and demographic changes.

Dr. Peng Dai, Director and Chief Executive Officer of iHuman, commented, ""As we look back on 2023, I am truly inspired by the accomplishments that we have achieved, especially considering the decline in China's newborn population over the past few years. In response to the challenges posed by the declining birth rate, we have been actively expanding our presence in the international markets, diversifying our product portfolio, and developing products that cover a broader age demographic. These strategic efforts have helped us achieve remarkable progress. For instance, our globally-oriented app, Aha World, delivered impressive performance in 2023. By the end of the year, its YouTube and TikTok accounts collectively attracted over 200 million views. It also earned YouTube's Silver Creator Award and rose to rank among the top three most popular children's apps on the U.S. Apple app store in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, our flagship product, iHuman Chinese, has consistently held the No.1 spot in the top-grossing category for children's apps on the Apple app store in China for iPad users for nearly 4.5 years, according to Appfigures, a reputable American data analytics company. This past year has been marked by revenue growth and sustained profitability, and we once again set a new record for average total MAUs in the fourth quarter which further solidified our position as an industry leader."" ""We are also thrilled to announce the acquisition of intellectual property assets related to ""Cosmicrew"" from Kunpeng, an animation production studio within the Perfect World Group. This strategic acquisition is expected to generate significant synergies with our business. Firstly, ""Cosmicrew"" is a popular cartoon adventure series that has established a strong presence in the children's entertainment sector. The light-hearted and delightful nature of this cartoon IP seamlessly compliments our overall product style and aesthetic. With the IP already integrated into some of our products before the acquisition, we now have greater autonomy over our creative content. In addition, we now can expand our product range further by developing additional IP offerings and derivatives, including animations, toys, and more. At the market level, ""Cosmicrew"" is a popular cartoon with a large audience base, and this acquisition will enable us to further extend our market reach and engage with a broader audience."" ""As we continue to progress on our strategic initiatives, we remain fully dedicated to strengthening our core competencies through ongoing product enhancement. We have been enriching the content and functionality of our app products to elevate the digital experience of our users and have made further strides in integrating our online and offline offerings to create a more immersive and holistic journey for users. For example, we rolled out both multi-leveled physical books and a specially developed smart reading pen that complement our leveled English reading app, iHuman Fantastic Friends. This combination allows kids to explore captivating original English stories tailored to their proficiency level in physical and digital formats, offering them a flexible and simple reading experience while enhancing their understanding and engagement with the content."" ""In 2023, we further strengthened our comprehensive product suite, significantly expanded our international presence, and earned increased market recognition with several prestigious industry accolades. We achieved all these milestones despite a highly volatile and challenging macroeconomic climate, which I believe is a testament to the caliber of our products, the effectiveness of our strategies, and the resilience of our team in overcoming diverse economic challenges. As we enter 2024, I am filled with anticipation for the continued success that lies ahead."" Ms. Vivien Weiwei Wang, Director and Chief Financial Officer of iHuman, added, ""Our fourth quarter results ended 2023 on a positive note despite a turbulent global economic environment. While our fourth quarter results saw a marginal decrease year-over-year, it reflected a normalization from the exceptional fourth quarter performance last year, which was caused by a heightened demand driven by more indoor activities during the pandemic. From a full year perspective in 2023, despite the fact that everybody shifted back to regular routines and spent less time at home after the pandemic, we still achieved satisfactory growth as both revenues and MAUs increased compared to fiscal year 2022. We are also proud to announce our eighth consecutive quarter of profitability, with annual net income reaching RMB180.9 million. This achievement marks our second straight year of profitability since our IPO in 2020 and demonstrates that we have successfully charted a path of healthy and sustainable growth. The momentum we have sustained in our business operations has further solidified our financial position, which not only bolsters our capacity for ongoing growth and innovation, but also enables us to enhance returns to our shareholders through issuing a special cash dividend of US$0.02 per ordinary share, or US$0.10 per ADS. The approval of the special dividend by our board of directors reflects our confidence in our long-term growth potential and strong balance sheet. Moving forward, we will continue to execute on our strategic priorities and maintain a growth-oriented approach to create even greater value for our users and shareholders.""

Exchange Rate Information The U.S. dollar (US$) amounts disclosed in this press release, except for those transaction amounts that were actually settled in U.S. dollars, are presented solely for the convenience of the reader. The conversion of Renminbi (RMB) into US$ in this press release is based on the exchange rate set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as of December 29, 2023, which was RMB7.0999 to US$1.00. The percentages stated in this press release are calculated based on the RMB amounts. Non-GAAP Financial Measures iHuman considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted net income per ADS, as supplemental metrics in reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""U.S. GAAP""). iHuman defines adjusted operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted net income per ADS as operating income, net income and diluted net income per ADS excluding share-based compensation expenses, respectively. Adjusted operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted net income per ADS enable iHuman's management to assess its operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses, which are non-cash charges. iHuman believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating the Company's current operating performance and prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, which possibly do not reflect all items of expense that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures iHuman uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.

Positive None. Negative None. Legal Expert The final court approval of Indivior PLC's settlement with the Direct Purchaser class closes a significant chapter in the company's legal affairs. Settling for $385 million, the company eliminates the uncertainty that typically surrounds ongoing litigation. From a legal standpoint, the resolution of such a high-profile antitrust case is noteworthy. Antitrust lawsuits can result in substantial financial penalties and they often indicate systemic issues within a company's business practices that need addressing. The dismissal of the Direct Purchaser class claims suggests that the company has now rectified the alleged anticompetitive behavior, potentially restoring trust among stakeholders and paving the way for a more compliant business operation going forward. Financial Analyst Indivior PLC's settlement of the antitrust MDL has immediate financial implications. The $385 million settlement figure is substantial and would likely have been accounted for in previous financial statements as a contingent liability. Now that the settlement has been finalized, the company's financials will reflect a significant cash outflow. Investors and analysts should examine Indivior's balance sheet strength to assess whether this settlement impacts its ability to invest in growth or return value to shareholders. In the longer term, the resolution of the litigation may remove a cloud of investor uncertainty, potentially leading to a re-evaluation of the company's stock. Depending on the company's insurance coverage for such settlements, the net financial impact could be mitigated. Market Research Analyst For the pharmaceutical industry and particularly for companies specializing in addiction treatment like Indivior, the resolution of antitrust litigation can have broader market implications. Antitrust cases often lead to increased scrutiny of pricing and distribution practices within the industry. While the immediate impact on Indivior is a one-time financial hit, the long-term effect could include changes to how companies in the sector approach market competition. Industry peers will likely monitor this settlement closely, as it may set precedents for how similar cases are handled and resolved. Additionally, Indivior's ability to move past this litigation may provide it with a competitive advantage, as it can now focus on its core business without the distraction and reputational damage associated with ongoing legal battles. 02/29/2024 - 02:02 AM RICHMOND, Va., Feb. 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Indivior PLC (LSE: INDV; Nasdaq: INDV), a leading addiction treatment company, today announced that its subsidiary, Indivior Inc., has received final Court approval for its settlement with the Direct Purchaser class, concluding the anti-trust multi-district litigation (""MDL"") matter. On October 22, 2023, Indivior Inc. entered into a settlement agreement with the remaining Direct Purchaser class for $385m. On February 27, 2024, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania entered an order granting final judgement and order of dismissal approving the Direct Purchaser class settlement and dismissing the Direct Purchaser class claims. This ruling concludes the Antitrust MDL.

We expect to generate US$9.3 billion net cash from the Lease and Operate (“L&O”) and Build-Operate-Transfer (“BOT”) sales components of this backlog, equivalent to EUR46.6/share6. Over the past 5 years we have grown this backlog of future net cash by US$2.9 billion whilst at the same time returning US$1.3 billion to shareholders. This performance reflects the uniquely recognized competitive positioning of SBM Offshore, the resilience of our business model and strong organizational capability to execute our strategy. In 2023, we delivered and commissioned two large FPSOs in industry-leading timeframes, adding significant value for our clients. The gross margin for our portfolio of construction projects remained robust. The 10-year Operations and Maintenance Enabling Agreement (“OMEA”) in Guyana establishes a new benchmark which can be applied to other clients, demonstrating our ability to develop new models and respond to the dynamics of an evolving financing market. On the financing front, we raised US$3.2 billion for two FPSO projects, securing the financing of the entire construction portfolio. We have a positive outlook on the market given the economics and low emission qualities of deepwater resources. We have secured the FEED award and reserved an MPF hull for FPSO Jaguar for the Whiptail project in Guyana. The carbon capture solution developed in partnership with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (“MHI”) aims to reduce FPSO emissions by up to 70%. As a result, we are on target to offer a near zero emission FPSO to the market in 2025, a key enabler of our 2050 net zero ambition. Our expertise in traditional oil and gas deepwater floating systems can be applied to alternative energies such as floating offshore wind, hydrogen and ammonia. The Provence Grand Large windfarm, where three 8.4 MW floating wind units were successfully installed in October, is a testament to our capacity to make innovative ideas come true and contribute to the energy transition. We will pace our activities in alternative energies in line with market developments, remaining selective and disciplined. Our strong financial and operational performance and the positive outlook for our business through the energy transition and beyond seem to be under-appreciated by the market. This is the catalyst for the evolution of our shareholder returns policy: we are introducing flexibility to pay our annual committed fixed cash return via share repurchase in combination with dividend. Based on this we are increasing our fixed cash return by 12% to US$1.22 per share to be paid US$0.83 per share in dividend7 and US$0.39 per share via share repurchase8. It has been a huge privilege to serve the Company as CEO for the last 12 years. I have had the honor of leading a team of talented, dedicated and passionate people in transforming SBM Offshore. Today, the Group has a well-established vision, purpose, and structure with a recognized leading market position and strong growth prospects in the industry. I am especially proud that SBM Offshore has a leadership team which makes an internal succession possible and am extremely pleased to hand over my responsibilities to Øivind Tangen and a talented team of SBMers. Øivind will successfully guide the Company to achieve its ambitious energy transition targets by focusing on the Company strengths.” Financial Overview9 Directional IFRS in US$ million FY 2023 FY 2022 % Change FY 2023 FY 2022 % Change Revenue 4,532 3,288 38% 4,963 4,913 1% Lease and Operate 1,954 1,763 11% 1,563 1,414 11% Turnkey 2,578 1,525 69% 3,400 3,499 -3% EBITDA 1,319 1,010 31% 1,239 1,209 3% Lease and Operate 1,124 1,080 4% 695 719 -3% Turnkey 296 7 >500% 646 569 14% Other (101) (77) -31% (101) (80) -26% Profit attributable to Shareholders 524 115 354% 491 450 9% Earnings per share (US$ per share) 2.92 0.65 350% 2.74 2.53 8% in US$ billion FY 2023 FY 2022 % Change FY 2023 FY 2022 % Change Pro-forma Backlog 30.3 30.5 -1% - - - Net Debt 6.7 6.1 10% 8.7 7.9 10% Directional revenue for 2023 stood at US$4,532 million, a 38% increase when compared with 2022, primarily attributable to the Turnkey segment. Directional Turnkey revenue increased by 69% to US$2,578 million compared with 2022. The strong increase was mainly driven by the sale of FPSO Liza Unity completed in November 2023. Turnkey revenue was additionally positively impacted by (i) the start of FEED work for FPSO Jaguar, and (ii) additional variation orders on FPSO Prosperity. The increase in turnkey revenue was partially offset by (i) the comparative impact from the partial divestment of FPSO Almirante Tamandaré and FPSO Alexandre de Gusmão at the beginning of 2022, (ii) the completion of the FPSO Liza Unity project in February 2022 and (iii) a reduced level of progress during the period compared with the year-ago period on FPSO Almirante Tamandaré and FPSO Alexandre de Gusmão consistent with the commencement of topsides' integration. Directional Lease and Operate revenue was US$1,954 million, an increase versus US$1,763 million in the prior period. This mainly reflects (i) FPSO Prosperity joining the fleet upon successful delivery of the EPCI project during the last quarter of 2023, and (ii) an increase in reimbursable scopes and an improved performance of the fleet, partially offset by (iii) FPSO Capixaba moving to the decommissioning phase after finishing production in 2022 (no contribution to revenue in 2023). Directional EBITDA was US$1,319 million, representing a 31% increase compared with US$1,010 million in 2022. This was mostly attributable to the Turnkey segment which increased from US$7 million in 2022 to US$296 million in 2023. The increase was driven by the sale of FPSO Liza Unity which was partly offset by (i) some prior period positive one-off impacts including a US$9 million gain recognized in the year-ago period from the disposal of the SBM Installer, (ii) the completion of FPSO Liza Unity project in February 2022, (iii) the reduced level of progress on FPSO Almirante Tamandaré and FPSO Alexandre de Gusmão during the current year consistent with the commencement of topsides' integration, and (iv) impacts linked to pressure on the global supply chain and the consequences of the pandemic. Directional Lease and Operate EBITDA was US$1,124 million an increase versus US$1,080 million in the year-ago period. This increase resulted from the same drivers as for the Lease and Operate revenue partially offset by additional non-recurring maintenance costs on the fleet under operation and some prior period positive one-off impacts. The other non-allocated costs charged to EBITDA amounted to US$(101) million in 2023, a US$(24) million increase compared with the US$(77) million in the year-ago period which is mainly explained by the implementation of an optimization plan related to the Company's support functions' activities (including US$11 million of restructuring costs), and continuing investment in the Company's digital initiatives. Directional net profit increased to US$524 million in 2023, or US$2.92 per share, compared with US$115 million in the year-ago period. The increase was mainly the result of the increase in Directional EBITDA in 2023. Liquidity, Funding and Directional Net Debt The Company’s financial position has remained strong as a result of the cash flow generated by the fleet, as well as the positive contribution of the Turnkey activities. Directional Net debt increased by US$572 million to US$6,654 million at year-end 2023. While the Lease and Operate segment continues to generate strong operating cash flow together with the net cash proceeds from the sale of FPSO Liza Unity, the Company drew on the project finance facilities for FPSO Prosperity, FPSO ONE GUYANA, FPSO Almirante Tamandaré, FPSO Alexandre de Gusmão, the Revolving Credit Facility and the new Revolving Credit Facility for MPF hull financing. To diversify its sources of debt and equity funding and to accelerate equity cash flow from the backlog, the Company finalized the funding loan agreement with CMFL and received US$125 million in relation to FPSO Cidade de Ilhabela. Almost half of the Company’s debt at year-end 2023 consisted of non-recourse project financing (US$3.3 billion) in special purpose investees. The remainder (US$3.8 billion) consisted mainly of borrowings to support the ongoing construction of 3 FPSOs which will become non-recourse following completion of construction, the project loan for FPSO Sepetiba (following start up, this has recently become non-recourse), the new US$210 million RCF for MPF hull financing fully drawn to fund MPF capital expenditure, and US$550 million drawn under the RCF as at December 31, 2023. Directional cash and cash equivalents amounted to US$563 million and lease liabilities totaled US$85 million at December 31, 2023. Cash and undrawn committed credit facilities amount to US$2,276 million at December 31, 2023. Directional Pro-Forma Backlog Change in ownership scenarios and lease contract duration have the potential to significantly impact the Company's future cash flows, net debt balance as well as the profit and loss statement. The Company therefore provides a pro-forma Directional backlog based on the best available information regarding ownership scenarios and lease contract duration for the various projects.The pro-forma Directional backlog at the end of December 2023 slightly decreased by US$0.2 billion to a total of US$30.3 billion. This was mainly the result of (i) the signed 10-year OMEA for the Guyana FPSO fleet and (ii) the awarded initial scope to begin FEED activities and secure a Fast4Ward® hull for FPSO Jaguar, offset by turnover for the period which consumed approximately US$4.5 billion of backlog (including the sale of FPSO Liza Unity completed in November 2023 a few months ahead of the end of the maximum lease term in February 2024). The Company's backlog provides cash flow visibility up to 2050. in US$ billion Turnkey Lease & Operate Total 2024 0.5 2.2 2.7 2025 1.3 2.5 3.8 2026 0.1 2.6 2.7 Beyond 2026 2.1 19.0 21.1 Total Directional Backlog 30.3 The pro-forma Directional backlog at the end of 2023 reflects the following key assumptions: The FPSO Liza Destiny contract covers the basic contractual term of 10 years of lease. The FPSOs Prosperity and ONE GUYANA contracts cover a maximum period of lease of two years, within which the FPSOs ownership will transfer to the client.10 years of operations and maintenance is considered for FPSOs Liza Destiny, Liza Unity, Prosperity and ONE GUYANA following signature of the OMEA in 2023.The impact of the subsequent sale of FPSOs Prosperity and ONE GUYANA is reflected in the Turnkey backlog at the end of the maximum two-year period.With respect to FPSO Jaguar, for which the full construction, installation and operations contracts award is subject to necessary government approvals and final work order to be received from the client, the amount included in the pro-forma backlog is limited to the value of the initial limited release of funds to the Company to begin FEED activities and secure a Fast4Ward® hull. The 13.5% equity divestment in FPSO Sepetiba to CMFL has not yet been reflected in the backlog as the transaction remains subject to various approvals, which include the consent from co-owners, lenders and export credit agencies. For further details of the overall assumptions applicable to the backlog, please refer to the 2023 Annual Report.

FPSO Prosperity joined the fleet in Guyana, achieving first oil on November 14, 2023. FPSO Sepetiba achieved first oil on December 31, 2023, and was formally on hire as of January 2, 2024. An update on individual projects under construction is provided below considering latest known circumstances. FPSO Almirante Tamandaré – The topside modules lifting campaign is reaching completion. Integration and commissioning activities are progressing in line with plan. The FPSO delivery continues to be on track for 2024 and the client is expecting first oil from the field in early 2025. FPSO Alexandre de Gusmão – The topside modules lifting campaign is progressing along with their integration. First oil is expected in 2025. FPSO ONE GUYANA – The topsides fabrication is progressing in line with plan allowing the commencement of the lifting campaign. First oil is expected in 2025. Fast4Ward® MPF hulls – The total number of MPF hulls ordered to date under the Company’s Fast4Ward® program, stands at eight with six delivered to projects and exclusivity for the seventh allocated to FPSO Jaguar. Fleet Operational UpdateFleet Uptime – The fleet’s uptime was 98.2%10 in 2023, in line with historical performance. Operations and Maintenance Enabling Agreement - On May 02, 2023, SBM Offshore announced a 10-year Operations and Maintenance Enabling Agreement with Esso Exploration & Production Guyana Ltd. for the operation and maintenance of the fleet of FPSOs in Guyana with estimated impact on the revenue backlog of around US$3 billion11. As a result, an integrated operating model has been established with ExxonMobil Guyana, leveraging the combined operational excellence of both parties. Share Purchase Agreements signed with Sonangol entities – In July 2023, SBM Offshore signed two Share Purchase Agreements with its partner Sonangol EP for (i) the acquisition of Sonangol's equity shares in the lease and operating entities related to FPSOs N’goma, Saxi Batuque and Mondo; and (ii) the full divestment to a Sonangol subsidiary of SBM Offshore’s equity shares in the parent company of the Angolan based Paenal Yard. Those agreements remain conditional upon several conditions precedent, including consent from clients, partners and approval by various competent authorities. Therefore, there was no impact considered in 2023 from theses share purchase agreements. Through this transaction, SBM Offshore is reorganizing its business in Angola, focusing on core lease and operate activities and divesting a non-core construction yard. Safety and SustainabilitySafety – The Company’s Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate for the year was 0.08 compared with the full year 2023 target of below 0.1412. For 2024 the target is set to below 0.12. Responsible recycling – In Brazil, decommissioning of FPSO Capixaba is under final phase. The unit is scheduled to depart Brazil around mid-2024 for recycling at an EU approved green recycling facility in Denmark. Deep Panuke Recycling has been completed with a recycling rate of 97%. Emissions – For 2023, the Company targeted an absolute volume of gas flared below 1.48 mmscft/d as an overall FPSO fleet average during the year. As of December 31, 2023 SBM Offshore outperformed with the actual being 1.18 mmscft/d, which is 17% lower compared with 2022. Net-zero ambitions ­­­­­In support of its 2050 net zero ambition, SBM Offshore has created intermediate targets. By 2030, the Company aims for net-zero on scope 1 and 2 emissions and a 50% reduction of GHG intensity on scope 313 as well as zero routine flaring. The Company is on track to meet these targets. By 2025, under its emissionZERO® program, the Company has an ambition to offer near zero emission FPSOs as a key enabler of the energy transition. During 2023, a partnership agreement with MHI was concluded to offer a CO2 capture solution: the technology can reduce CO2 emissions from overall FPSO operations by an estimated 70%. Sustainable Development GoalsThe Company uses the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) framework to further embed sustainability into its operations with targets linked to Management Board and employee short-term incentive schemes. For the year 2023, the Company set 14 SDG-linked targets out of which 13 have been met or exceeded. Energy Transition Floating offshore wind – SBM Offshore has installed its first commercial pilot project in floating offshore wind. The three 8.4 MW floaters for the Provence Grand Large project, jointly owned by EDF Renewables and Maple Power, accounted for around 10% of the globally installed floating wind electricity generation capacity in 2023. This is the first floating offshore wind project installed in France and the first project worldwide using tension leg mooring technology, which has minimal motion and seabed footprint. The floating offshore wind market will take time to further develop and become commercially mature: SBM Offshore is investigating partnerships to facilitate its pursuit of this promising market on a sustainable basis. Future Energy Markets - SBM Offshore’s expertise in traditional oil and gas deepwater floating systems can be applied to alternative energies such as hydrogen and ammonia and carbon capture utilization and storage. Associated R&D activities are ongoing. The Company will remain selective and disciplined, pacing its activities in line with relevant market developments. Capital allocation and Shareholder Returns The Company is evolving its shareholder returns policy as follows: “The Company’s shareholder returns policy is to maintain a stable annual cash return to shareholders which grows over time, with flexibility for the Company to make such cash return in the form of a cash dividend and the repurchase of shares. Determination of the annual cash return is based on the Company’s assessment of its underlying cash flow position. The Company prioritizes a stable cash distribution to shareholders and funding of growth projects, with the option to apply surplus capital towards incremental cash returns to shareholders.” The policy will be presented for discussion at the Annual General Meeting on April 12, 2024. As a result, following review of its cash flow position and forecast, the Company intends to pay a total cash return to shareholders of US$220 million in 2024. This represents an increase of 12% compared with the dividend paid in 2023. The cash return is to be composed of a proposed dividend of US$150 million (equivalent to c. US$0.83 per share14) combined with a EUR65 million (US$70 million equivalent15) share repurchase program. Shares repurchased as part of the cash return will be cancelled. The share repurchase program will be launched on March 1, 2024, and the dividend will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting on April 12, 2024. Going forward, the Company intends to maintain a material level of dividend as part of the annual cash return with US$150 million as a base level. Guidance The Company’s 2024 Directional revenue guidance is around US$3.5 billion of which around US$2.2 billion is expected from the Lease and Operate segment and around US$1.3 billion from the Turnkey segment. 2024 Directional EBITDA guidance is around US$1.2 billion for the Company.

Announces Pricing of Offering of Class A Common Stock in “Synthetic Secondary” Transaction Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Portillo’s Inc. announced the pricing of its underwritten public offering of 8,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, expecting gross proceeds of approximately $116 million. The offering is non-dilutive and aims to repurchase existing shares, with BofA Securities as the sole underwriter. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Portillo's Inc. regarding its public offering of 8,000,000 shares is a strategic financial move designed to restructure the company's equity without diluting current shareholders' value. The use of proceeds to engage in a 'synthetic secondary' transaction to repurchase shares of Class A common stock and cancel associated Class B common stock is a sophisticated financial engineering technique. It aims to consolidate ownership and potentially streamline the company's capital structure.The expected gross proceeds of approximately $116 million, before expenses and underwriter discounts, indicate a significant capital infusion. However, the fact that the company will not receive any proceeds from this offering might initially seem counterintuitive. Yet, this move can be seen as a positive signal to the market, suggesting that the company is confident in its ability to generate cash flow internally to fund operations and growth initiatives. Moreover, maintaining the total common stock share count stable post-transaction indicates a neutral effect on earnings per share (EPS), which should be well-received by investors concerned about dilution.Investors should monitor the underwriter's 30-day option to purchase additional shares, as this could indicate market demand for Portillo's stock. BofA Securities' involvement as the sole underwriter adds credibility to the offering and the non-dilutive nature of the transaction may be viewed favorably by the market. Market Research Analyst Portillo's Inc.'s public offering and subsequent equity restructuring could reflect broader trends in the fast-casual dining sector, where companies are seeking to optimize their capital structures amid changing market conditions. The fast-casual segment faces intense competition and fluctuating consumer preferences, which necessitates agile financial strategies to support growth and innovation.An increase in the shares of Class A common stock could enhance liquidity in the market, potentially attracting a broader investor base. Furthermore, the transaction's timing and pricing will have been carefully considered in the context of current market conditions, including investor sentiment and stock market performance. The company's decision to execute this transaction could be seen as an attempt to preemptively strengthen its financial position in anticipation of future industry challenges or opportunities.Stakeholders should consider the potential impact of this offering on the company's governance structure. The repurchase of Class A stock and cancellation of Class B stock could alter the balance of voting power, possibly leading to changes in how the company is managed and its strategic direction. Legal Expert From a legal perspective, the transaction's execution under an effective shelf registration statement indicates Portillo's Inc. has complied with the necessary regulatory requirements set forth by the SEC. This compliance ensures transparency for investors and upholds market integrity.The synthetic secondary transaction's structure, involving the purchase and cancellation of certain shares, is legally complex and requires careful navigation of securities laws. It is designed to provide tax efficiencies and align with the company's capital raising objectives while adhering to the legal framework.Investors should be aware that the legal intricacies of such transactions could have implications for shareholder rights and company obligations. The prospectus and other SEC filings will contain crucial information regarding the terms of the offering, the rights attached to the different classes of stock and the potential risks involved. 02/28/2024 - 09:31 PM CHICAGO, Feb. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Portillo’s Inc. (“Portillo’s” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: PTLO), the fast-casual restaurant concept known for its menu of Chicago-style favorites, today announced the pricing of its previously announced underwritten public offering of 8,000,000 shares of Portillo’s Class A common stock (“Class A common stock”). The offering is expected to result in gross proceeds to the Company (before expenses and underwriter discounts and commissions) of approximately $116 million (assuming the underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase additional shares). The offering is expected to close on March 4, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. The underwriter has a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,200,000 shares of Class A common stock at the public offering price, less underwriting discounts and commissions. The proposed offering is considered non-dilutive, as Portillo’s expects to use the net proceeds to (a) purchase limited liability company units of PHD Group Holdings LLC held by certain existing holders (and cancel the associated shares of the Company’s Class B common stock (the “Class B common stock”)) and (b) repurchase shares of Class A common stock from certain existing holders, each in a “synthetic secondary” transaction. As a result, Portillo’s will not receive any proceeds from this offering. Upon close of the transaction, the Company’s total common stock share count, comprised of shares of Class A and Class B common stock, will remain the same; however, the amount of shares of Class A common stock will increase by the same amount of the decrease in the number of shares of Class B common stock. BofA Securities is acting as the sole underwriter of the offering. The offering is being made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement (including a prospectus) filed by Portillo’s with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you should read the prospectus in the shelf registration statement and other documents the Company has filed with the SEC for more complete information about the Company and the offering.

Announces Pricing of Senior Notes Offerings Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Tyson Foods, Inc. announced the sale of $600 million 5.400% Senior Notes due 2029 and $900 million 5.700% Senior Notes due 2034 in underwritten public offerings. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including retiring outstanding debt and investing in interest-bearing securities. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Examining the issuance of $1.5 billion in senior notes by Tyson Foods, Inc., we see a strategic move to restructure the company's debt profile. By issuing notes with a 5.400% interest rate due 2029 and a 5.700% rate due 2034, the company is opting to retire its existing 3.95% Notes due August 2024. This suggests a proactive approach to manage interest rate risk and potential anticipation of a rising interest rate environment. The company's decision to use underwriting syndicates, including reputable financial institutions, indicates a demand for its debt securities and a vote of confidence in its creditworthiness.From a financial perspective, this move could signal a leveraging strategy to optimize the capital structure. Investors should consider the implications of this debt issuance on the company's long-term interest obligations and debt servicing costs. The increase in interest rates compared to the retiring notes may affect net income due to higher interest expenses, which should be weighed against the benefits of extending the maturity of the company's debt and improving liquidity. Market Research Analyst The capital markets' reception to Tyson Foods' senior notes offering can be indicative of the market's appetite for corporate debt within the food industry, which is generally considered defensive. The selection of multiple joint book-running managers and senior co-managers reflects a diversified approach to reach a broad investor base, potentially reducing the cost of capital for Tyson Foods. The company's intention to invest in short-term, interest-bearing securities with the pending proceeds suggests a conservative strategy for liquidity management.It's also important to analyze the competitive landscape in which Tyson Foods operates. If peers are engaging in similar refinancing activities, it could signal a sector-wide shift in capital structure optimization. Conversely, if Tyson Foods is an outlier, it may be pursuing unique strategic goals or reacting to specific challenges. The impact on Tyson Foods' stock may depend on how these actions are perceived in terms of financial prudence and growth facilitation. Economist The issuance of senior notes by Tyson Foods must be contextualized within the broader economic environment. Current and projected federal interest rates influence corporate debt costs significantly. If Tyson Foods anticipates higher rates in the near future, refinancing at current rates could be a hedge against such an increase. Furthermore, the use of proceeds to retire higher-cost debt and reduce reliance on a revolving credit facility or commercial paper can be seen as a move to stabilize long-term liabilities amidst economic uncertainty.The transaction also reflects the overall health of the credit markets. A successful offering would suggest that there is liquidity available for large-cap companies like Tyson Foods, which can be a positive indicator of market confidence. However, the higher interest rates on the new notes compared to the retired ones could reflect a premium that Tyson Foods has to pay due to market conditions or its specific risk profile. 02/28/2024 - 10:21 PM SPRINGDALE, Ark., Feb. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tyson Foods, Inc.

The updated release reads: CHEMOURS ANNOUNCES MANAGEMENT ACTIONS AND DELAY OF FORM 10-K; PROVIDES PRELIMINARY UNAUDITED 2023 YEAR-END RESULTS The Board of Directors of The Chemours Company (“Chemours” or “the Company”) (NYSE: CC) has appointed Denise Dignam as the Interim Chief Executive Officer and Matt Abbott as the Interim Chief Financial Officer (principal financial and accounting officer). Ms. Dignam joined Chemours in 2015 and has served as our President – Titanium Technologies since March 2023 and previously served as our President – Advanced Performance Materials from 2021 to 2023. She previously served as Vice President of Global Operations – Fluoroproducts, from 2019 to 2021; Global Senior Business Director – Fluoropolymers, from 2016 to 2019; and North American Business Director – Diversified Technologies and Industrial Resins, from 2015 to 2016. Previously, she worked at E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (“EID”) in various roles, including Director of Global Supply Chain – Fluoroproducts, from 2013 to 2014; Global Business Manager of Sulfur Products, from 2009 to 2013; and Global Sales Manager of Clean Technologies from 2007 to 2009. Ms. Dignam joined EID in 1988 as a design engineer. Mr. Abbott has served as our Senior Vice President & Chief Enterprise Transformation Officer, with responsibility for Enterprise Capital Projects and Engineering Technology, Information Technology, Cyber Security, Digital and Data Analytics, and Procurement, since June 2023. Mr. Abbott previously served as Chemours’ Vice President, Digital and Data Analytics Leader from 2021 to 2023 where he was central to designing digital strategies to accelerate Chemours’ journey to becoming a data-driven organization. Past roles at Chemours included Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller from 2019 to 2021; and Vice President and Chief Audit Executive from 2017 to 2019. Prior to joining Chemours, Mr. Abbott was a Partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) for five years, with nearly twenty total years of experience serving PwC’s industrial products and high-technology clients. Chair of the Board, Dawn Farrell said “We are fortunate to have two very experienced and capable leaders in our ranks to step up and fill these roles. Denise is highly regarded by the Board of Directors for the work she’s done in leading both of our Titanium Technologies and Advanced Performance Materials businesses. These businesses combined were more than 68% of our Net Sales in 2023.” Chair Farrell continued “Matt Abbott has held senior officer roles in operational, accounting and internal audit areas during his time at Chemours. The Board has confidence in his extensive knowledge of our company and his prior experience as an audit partner with PwC make him the clear choice.” These management actions follow the decision of the Board of Directors of Chemours to place President and Chief Executive Officer Mark Newman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Lock and Vice President, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer Camela Wisel on administrative leave. Mr. Newman’s, Mr. Lock’s and Ms. Wisel’s leave is pending the completion of an internal review being overseen by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors with the assistance of independent outside counsel, which scope includes the processes for reviewing reports made to the Chemours Ethics Hotline, the Company’s practices for managing working capital, including the related impact on metrics within the Company’s incentive plans, certain non-GAAP metrics included in filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission or otherwise publicly released, and related disclosures. As a result, the Company is evaluating one or more potential material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 with respect to maintaining effective controls related to the control environment, including the effectiveness of the “tone at the top” set by certain members of senior management and information and communication components of the COSO internal control framework. The Audit Committee is working with independent outside counsel to complete the review expeditiously, and the Company expects to report on any material weaknesses as of December 31, 2023 and its related remediation efforts in its Annual Report on Form 10-K. Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings and Form 10-K Update The Company previously stated that it expected to issue its fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results after market close on February 28, 2024, and to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 on February 29, 2024. The Company needs additional time to complete its year-end reporting process, including its review of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, and for the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors to complete the internal review described above. As a result, the Company will delay its earnings release and conference call relating to fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results, as well as the filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In connection with this delay, the Company will file a Form 12b-25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company will issue a subsequent press release to announce the date and time of its fourth quarter conference call once the filing date of its Annual Report on Form 10-K is confirmed. 2023 Unaudited Preliminary Year-End Results Set forth below are select unaudited preliminary estimates of operating results and other financial measures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, together for comparison purposes with the same information as previously reported as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company expects to report net sales of approximately $6.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to net sales of $6.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. The expected decrease was primarily attributable to lower volumes in Titanium Technologies and in Advanced Performance Materials’ Advanced Materials portfolio, partially offset by increased pricing and volumes in Thermal & Specialized Solutions. The Company expects to report net loss attributable to Chemours for the year ended December 31, 2023 within a range of $(225) million to $(235) million, compared to net income attributable to Chemours for the year ended December 31, 2022 of $578 million. The estimated net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes $746 million of pre-tax litigation settlements and $153 million of restructuring, asset-related, and other charges, offset by a $106 million net pre-tax gain associated with the 2023 sale of the Glycolic Acid business. At December 31, 2023, the Company maintained cash and cash equivalents of $1.2 billion; it has restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents of $604 million primarily relating to the U.S. public water district settlement. This compares to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2022, excluding restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents of $202 million relating to the escrow account established pursuant to the 2021 Memorandum of Understanding with DuPont de Nemours, Inc., Corteva, Inc. and EIDP, Inc. At December 31, 2023, the Company maintained $0.9 billion of revolving credit facility capacity, net of outstanding letters of credit, compared to $0.8 billion at December 31, 2022. All financial results as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, are preliminary, are based upon estimates which the Company believes are reasonable, are unaudited by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, and may be subject to change after the completion of the year-end reporting process and will not be final until the Company files its audited financial statements in its Annual Report on Form 10-K. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on this preliminary data.

Negative None. Financial Analyst An examination of SQM's financial performance reveals a significant reduction in net income and revenues, with net income dropping by 48.5% and revenues by 30.3% compared to the previous year. This contraction is a crucial indicator of the company's profitability and operational challenges. The decrease in gross profit margin from 53.6% to 41.2% suggests a decline in operational efficiency or a change in product mix. Additionally, the reported capital expenditure of US$1.1 billion for 2023, with an anticipated US$2.4 billion for the next two years, indicates an aggressive investment strategy, which could impact the company's cash flow and debt levels in the short term. However, this also reflects the company's commitment to expansion and could potentially lead to increased production capacity and market share. Market Research Analyst The lithium market dynamics mentioned by SQM's CEO, including a 20% expected growth in global demand driven by the electric vehicle sector, are pivotal for understanding the company's future revenue streams. While the CEO anticipates stable lithium prices, the acknowledgement of excess capacity in the market could signal a potential oversupply scenario, which might suppress prices and affect profit margins. The expansion in Chile and the commencement of spodumene concentrate production at Mt. Holland could position SQM favorably to meet the growing demand. However, the company's ability to navigate the price pressures and maintain cost efficiencies will be critical to its success. Sustainability Analyst From a sustainability perspective, the Memorandum of Understanding with Codelco to develop the Salar Futuro project indicates a strategic move towards sustainable operations, crucial for maintaining a social license to operate, especially in environmentally sensitive regions like the Salar de Atacama. The inclusion of SQM in the DJSI World and Emerging Markets indices reflects positively on its environmental, social and governance (ESG) efforts, which can enhance investor confidence and potentially lead to a more favorable risk assessment from an ESG perspective. These efforts are increasingly important to investors and can have a long-term impact on the company's reputation and access to capital. 02/28/2024 - 09:16 PM SANTIAGO, Chile, Feb. 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Highlights SQM reported net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 of US$2,012.7 million compared to US$3,906.3 million for the same period last year.

SQM's Chief Executive Officer, Ricardo Ramos, stated: ""Our fourth quarter 2023 results reflected record-high sales volumes in lithium business and increased sales volumes in iodine and potassium business lines when compared to the previous quarter and the same period last year. Despite a downturn in lithium market prices when compared to the previous year, our focus on operational efficiency and ability to successfully execute capacity expansion projects have facilitated notable production growth in lithium and iodine businesses over the past year. While we continue with our expansions in Chile and expect our lithium carbonate capacity to reach 210,000 metric tons during the first quarter of this year, we also celebrated first production of spodumene concentrate at our Mt. Holland operation site during the fourth quarter of 2023. In the iodine business, as a result of successful start-up of Pampa Blanca operation, record-high production volumes were achieved during the year, reconfirming SQM´s position as industry leader with ability to deliver growth ahead of competition."" He continued by saying: ""As we enter into 2024, we anticipate another robust year of growth in lithium market, with global demand increasing by at least 20%, supported by electric vehicle sales growth globally and increasing demand for battery materials. However, the excess in lithium and battery materials capacity seen during last year is expected to continue during this year, keeping pressure on lithium market prices. We expect our average lithium prices to remain relatively stable throughout the year and our sales volumes to increase slightly during this year, subject to market conditions and any changes in supply-demand balance."" He finished by saying: ""In December last year, we signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Codelco to jointly develop the Salar Futuro project and sustainably operate in the Salar de Atacama beyond 2030. Together with the communities, we are working on the definitive documentation in the upcoming months and will inform the market once this process is concluded. Last year, SQM was included into both DJSI World and Emerging Markets indices, several years ahead of our internal goal. This is the result of ongoing work and our commitments to increase the transparency and sustainability of our operations."" Total capital expenditure in 2023 was close to US$1.1 billion. For the period 2024-2025, total capex is expected to be approximately US$2.4 billion, including: US$1.4 billion related to lithium capacity expansion projects in Chile, including US$130 million of maintenance.US$700 million related to nitrates and iodine capacity expansion project in Chile, including US$160 million of maintenance.US$340 million related to Mt.

The notes will be guaranteed by TPG and certain subsidiaries, with interest payable quarterly. Proceeds will be used to repay debt and for general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The pricing of a $400 million offering of 6.950% fixed-rate junior subordinated notes due 2064 by TPG Operating Group II, L.P., guaranteed by TPG Inc., represents a significant financial event with potential implications for investors and the company's capital structure. The fixed interest rate of 6.950% is notably higher than current average corporate bond yields, which could suggest a premium is being paid by the company for the capital due to its credit risk profile or market conditions at the time of issuance.This debt issuance is aimed at refinancing existing debt, which could improve the company's debt maturity profile and potentially reduce interest expenses if replacing higher-cost debt. However, the junior subordinated nature of the notes indicates they are lower in priority for repayment in the event of a default, which is a risk factor for investors to consider. The option to defer interest payments for up to five years provides the issuer with financial flexibility but adds an element of risk for note holders.The decision to list the notes on the Nasdaq Global Market could enhance liquidity for the notes, making them more attractive to a broader investor base. The involvement of prominent financial institutions as managers and co-managers indicates a strong market interest and underwriting support for the offering. Market Research Analyst The offering of junior subordinated notes by TPG is indicative of the current trends in the alternative asset management sector, where firms are actively managing their balance sheets amidst fluctuating market conditions. The choice to issue long-term debt with a 40-year maturity aligns with a strategy to lock in interest rates, which could be advantageous if interest rates rise in the future.Investor appetite for such financial instruments is influenced by the prevailing economic environment, including interest rates set by central banks, inflation and market demand for higher-yield debt products. The relatively high fixed interest rate may reflect investor expectations for inflation and interest rates over the long term.Furthermore, the listing of these notes on a prominent exchange like Nasdaq could signal a strategic move by TPG to increase the visibility and credibility of its debt instruments, potentially impacting the company's reputation and stock market performance positively. Legal Expert The issuance of junior subordinated notes involves a complex legal process, including compliance with SEC regulations and the filing of a shelf registration statement. This allows TPG to issue securities expediently within a set timeframe without having to register each offering separately. The legal structure of the notes, including the guarantee by TPG and its subsidiaries, requires careful drafting of terms to protect both the issuer and investors.The legal implications of the issuer's right to defer interest payments, a feature of these notes, must be clearly outlined in the prospectus supplement to ensure transparency and adherence to securities law. The co-managers' roles and responsibilities, including due diligence and ensuring the accuracy of the offering documents, are critical in mitigating legal risks and ensuring regulatory compliance. 02/28/2024 - 09:10 PM SAN FRANCISCO & FORT WORTH, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- TPG Inc.

The company granted underwriters an option to purchase additional shares, with all proceeds going to Viking. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the public offering by Viking Therapeutics represents a significant capital infusion, which is expected to be approximately $550 million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. This influx of capital is crucial for a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, as it provides the financial resources needed for continued research and development, as well as for potential commercialization efforts. The offering price of $85.00 per share also suggests a strong market valuation, which may reflect investor confidence in Viking's pipeline and future prospects.The granting of a 30-day option for underwriters to purchase additional shares could potentially raise additional capital, indicating a safeguard mechanism to capitalize on higher demand. This move is strategic as it provides a buffer to raise additional funds without the need for immediate further dilution, should the market appetite prove strong. The impact on current shareholders will be dilutive, but if the funds are deployed effectively into their pipeline, it could lead to long-term value creation. Market Research Analyst The biopharmaceutical sector is highly competitive and capital-intensive. For Viking Therapeutics, securing a substantial amount of funding indicates that the company is positioning itself to advance its pipeline products, which could involve entering new clinical trials or scaling up manufacturing capabilities. Market reaction to such offerings can be mixed, as investors weigh the benefits of potential growth against the dilution of their shares.It's important to consider the context of the broader market and Viking's specific circumstances. If Viking's therapies address unmet needs within metabolic and endocrine disorders, the future revenue potential could be significant. Analysts and investors will closely monitor the deployment of these funds, looking for milestones and indicators of progress within the company's pipeline. The timing and success of these developments can influence the stock's performance in both the short and long term. Medical Research Analyst In the realm of metabolic and endocrine disorders, the development of novel therapies is both a high-risk and high-reward endeavor. Viking Therapeutics' decision to raise capital through a public offering indicates that they may be nearing critical phases in their product development, such as advancing to late-stage clinical trials or preparing for regulatory submission and commercialization. The size of the offering is substantial, which may suggest confidence in their research outcomes and the potential market size for their therapies.Investors will be interested in the specific indications Viking is targeting, as the prevalence of these conditions and the competitive landscape will greatly influence the potential return on investment. The efficacy and safety profiles of their drug candidates, as well as any partnerships or licensing agreements, will be key factors in their future success. The funds raised will likely accelerate these processes, but it's important to monitor how effectively the company manages these resources to navigate the complex regulatory environment and achieve market penetration. 02/28/2024 - 08:50 PM SAN DIEGO, Feb. 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Viking Therapeutics, Inc.

About Viking Therapeutics, Inc. Viking Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel first-in-class or best-in-class therapies for the treatment of metabolic and endocrine disorders, with three compounds currently in clinical trials. Viking's research and development activities leverage its expertise in metabolism to develop innovative therapeutics designed to improve patients' lives. Viking's clinical programs include VK2809, a novel, orally available, small molecule selective thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist for the treatment of lipid and metabolic disorders, which is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2b study for the treatment of biopsy-confirmed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis. In a Phase 2a trial for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and elevated LDL-C, patients who received VK2809 demonstrated statistically significant reductions in LDL-C and liver fat content compared with patients who received placebo. Viking is also developing VK2735, a novel dual agonist of the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors for the potential treatment of various metabolic disorders. Data from a Phase 1 and a Phase 2a trial evaluating VK2735 (dosed subcutaneously) for metabolic disorders demonstrated an encouraging safety and tolerability profile as well as positive signs of clinical benefit. The company is also evaluating an oral formulation of VK2735 in a Phase 1 trial. In the rare disease space, Viking is developing VK0214, a novel, orally available, small molecule selective thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist for the potential treatment of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD).

Negative Decrease in net sales for 2023 compared to 2022 Net loss for 2023 with significant pre-tax charges Delay in Q4 2023 earnings release and Form 10-K filing Potential material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting Financial Analyst The leadership changes at Chemours, coupled with the ongoing internal review and potential identification of material weaknesses in financial reporting, signal significant corporate governance issues that may have material impacts on the company's financial health and stock performance. The delay in the earnings release and the 10-K filing could lead to increased volatility in Chemours' stock, as investors may speculate on the severity of the issues and the potential for restatements of past financial results. The preliminary net loss for 2023 also indicates a stark reversal from the previous year's profitability, which could be a red flag for investors concerned with the company's operational efficiency and cost management strategies. Legal Expert The appointment of interim executives often follows events that could have legal implications, such as the internal review being conducted at Chemours. The focus on the company's ethics hotline, working capital management and non-GAAP metrics suggests that there may be concerns regarding compliance with SEC regulations and overall transparency. If material weaknesses are confirmed, this could lead to legal challenges, including shareholder lawsuits or regulatory actions, which could further impact the company's reputation and financial standing. Market Research Analyst The preliminary financial results showing a significant drop in net sales and a transition from net income to a net loss year-over-year could be indicative of broader market challenges faced by Chemours, particularly in the Titanium Technologies and Advanced Performance Materials sectors. The increased pricing and volumes in Thermal & Specialized Solutions suggest a shift in market demand or strategic focus. Investors and stakeholders will be interested in understanding the underlying causes of these shifts and what they imply about the company's competitive position and future growth prospects. 02/28/2024 - 10:14 PM WILMINGTON, Del.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Board of Directors of The Chemours Company (“Chemours” or “the Company”) (NYSE: CC) has appointed Denise Dignam as the Interim Chief Executive Officer and Matt Abbott as the Interim Chief Financial Officer (principal financial and accounting officer). Ms. Dignam joined Chemours in 2015 and has served as our President – Titanium Technologies since March 2023 and previously served as our President – Advanced Performance Materials from 2021 to 2023. She previously served as Vice President of Global Operations – Fluoroproducts, from 2019 to 2021; Global Senior Business Director – Fluoropolymers, from 2016 to 2019; and North American Business Director – Diversified Technologies and Industrial Resins, from 2015 to 2016. Previously, she worked at E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (“EID”) in various roles, including Director of Global Supply Chain – Fluoroproducts, from 2013 to 2014; Global Business Manager of Sulfur Products, from 2009 to 2013; and Global Sales Manager of Clean Technologies from 2007 to 2009. Ms. Dignam joined EID in 1988 as a design engineer. Mr. Abbott has served as our Senior Vice President & Chief Enterprise Transformation Officer, with responsibility for Enterprise Capital Projects and Engineering Technology, Information Technology, Cyber Security, Digital and Data Analytics, and Procurement, since June 2023. Mr. Abbott previously served as Chemours’ Vice President, Digital and Data Analytics Leader from 2021 to 2023 where he was central to designing digital strategies to accelerate Chemours’ journey to becoming a data-driven organization. Past roles at Chemours included Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller from 2019 to 2021; and Vice President and Chief Audit Executive from 2017 to 2019. Prior to joining Chemours, Mr. Abbott was a Partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) for five years, with nearly twenty total years of experience serving PwC’s industrial products and high-technology clients. Chair of the Board, Dawn Farrell said “We are fortunate to have two very experienced and capable leaders in our ranks to step up and fill these roles. Denise is highly regarded by the Board of Directors for the work she’s done in leading both of our Titanium Technologies and Advanced Performance Materials businesses. These businesses combined were more than 68% of our Net Sales in 2023.” Chair Farrell continued “Matt Abbott has held senior officer roles in operational, accounting and internal audit areas during his time at Chemours. The Board has confidence in his extensive knowledge of our company and his prior experience as an audit partner with PwC make him the clear choice.” These management actions follow the decision of the Board of Directors of Chemours to place President and Chief Executive Officer Mark Newman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Lock and Vice President, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer Camela Wisel on administrative leave. Mr. Newman’s, Mr. Lock’s and Ms. Wisel’s leave is pending the completion of an internal review being overseen by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors with the assistance of independent outside counsel, which scope includes the processes for reviewing reports made to the Chemours Ethics Hotline, the Company’s practices for managing working capital, including the related impact on metrics within the Company’s incentive plans, certain non-GAAP metrics included in filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission or otherwise publicly released, and related disclosures. As a result, the Company is evaluating one or more potential material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 with respect to maintaining effective controls related to the control environment, including the effectiveness of the “tone at the top” set by certain members of senior management and information and communication components of the COSO internal control framework. The Audit Committee is working with independent outside counsel to complete the review expeditiously, and the Company expects to report on any material weaknesses as of December 31, 2023 and its related remediation efforts in its Annual Report on Form 10-K. Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings and Form 10-K Update The Company previously stated that it expected to issue its fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results after market close on February 28, 2024, and to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 on February 29, 2024. The Company needs additional time to complete its year-end reporting process, including its review of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, and for the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors to complete the internal review described above. As a result, the Company will delay its earnings release and conference call relating to fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results, as well as the filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In connection with this delay, the Company will file a Form 12b-25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company will issue a subsequent press release to announce the date and time of its fourth quarter conference call once the filing date of its Annual Report on Form 10-K is confirmed. 2023 Unaudited Preliminary Year-End Results Set forth below are select unaudited preliminary estimates of operating results and other financial measures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, together for comparison purposes with the same information as previously reported as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company expects to report net sales of approximately $6.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to net sales of $6.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. The expected decrease was primarily attributable to lower volumes in Titanium Technologies and in Advanced Performance Materials’ Advanced Materials portfolio, partially offset by increased pricing and volumes in Thermal & Specialized Solutions. The Company expects to report net loss attributable to Chemours for the year ended December 31, 2023 within a range of $(225) million to $(235) million, compared to net income attributable to Chemours for the year ended December 31, 2022 of $578 million. The estimated net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes $746 million of pre-tax litigation settlements and $153 million of restructuring, asset-related, and other charges, offset by a $106 million net pre-tax gain associated with the 2023 sale of the Glycolic Acid business. At December 31, 2023, the Company maintained cash and cash equivalents of $1.2 billion. And also have restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents of $604 million primarily relating to the U.S. public water district settlement. This compares to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2022, excluding restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents of $202 million relating to the escrow account established pursuant to the 2021 Memorandum of Understanding with DuPont de Nemours, Inc., Corteva, Inc. and EIDP, Inc. At December 31, 2023, the Company maintained $0.9 billion of revolving credit facility capacity, net of outstanding letters of credit, compared to $0.8 billion at December 31, 2022. All financial results as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, are preliminary, are based upon estimates which the Company believes are reasonable, are unaudited by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, and may be subject to change after the completion of the year-end reporting process and will not be final until the Company files its audited financial statements in its Annual Report on Form 10-K. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on this preliminary data.

An Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting will also be held to cancel backup shares issued due to a previous stock split. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The decision by Banco Itaú Chile to distribute 30% of its distributable net income as dividends is a significant move that can have implications for shareholder returns and the bank's capital structure. Dividends are often seen as a signal of financial health and management's confidence in the company's future cash flows. A payout of $492.122037309763 per share represents a substantial return to shareholders and could potentially attract income-focused investors.However, retaining 70% of the profits suggests a cautious approach, possibly aimed at ensuring sufficient capital for future investments or as a buffer against potential financial uncertainties. This balance between dividend payments and profit retention is crucial for maintaining the bank's long-term growth and stability. Investors will be monitoring the impact of this decision on the bank's stock performance, as dividend announcements can influence investor sentiment and stock prices. Market Research Analyst Itaú Chile's resolution to cancel the 6,556 backup shares is a follow-up to the previous Reverse Stock Split. This action is typically aimed at consolidating shares to increase the market value of remaining shares and can sometimes be used to improve perceptions of the stock or to meet stock exchange listing requirements. The cancellation of these shares is a relatively minor adjustment, but it reflects the bank's attention to maintaining orderly capital management practices.For the broader market, the bank's decisions could be indicative of broader trends in the financial services industry regarding capital distribution strategies. These trends can affect investor expectations and investment strategies within the sector. It is important to understand the context and rationale behind such corporate actions to fully assess their potential market impact. Legal Expert The adherence to the Commission for the Financial Market's regulations, as evidenced by the approval of the Reverse Stock Split, highlights Banco Itaú Chile's compliance with legal standards. The formalities of the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting to cancel the backup shares are a necessary step in aligning the bank's share structure with regulatory approvals and previous shareholder agreements.Investors should note that such legal compliance is critical in maintaining corporate governance standards, which can affect investor confidence and the bank's reputation in the market. The legal processes involved in these corporate actions, while often procedural, underscore the importance of transparency and adherence to financial regulations in the banking sector. 02/28/2024 - 09:01 PM SANTIAGO, Chile, Feb. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BANCO ITAÚ CHILE (SSE: ITAUCL) (the “Bank”) today announced that its Board of Directors has agreed, in its ordinary meeting held on this same date, to summon to an Annual General Shareholders’ Meeting, on April 25, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., at Avenida Presidente Riesco 5537, 3rd floor, Las Condes, Santiago, in order to hear and decide on the matters within its competence.

Net sales on a foreign currency adjusted basis increased 16.1 percent in the 2023 fourth quarter. Net sales for the Company’s Monster Energy® Drinks segment, which primarily includes the Company’s Monster Energy® drinks, Reign Total Body Fuel® high performance energy drinks, Reign Storm® total wellness energy drinks, Bang Energy® drinks and Monster Tour Water®, increased 15.1 percent to $1.60 billion for the 2023 fourth quarter, from $1.39 billion for the 2022 fourth quarter.

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2023 fourth quarter was 54.2 percent, compared with 51.8 percent in the 2022 fourth quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of pricing actions in certain markets, decreased freight-in costs and lower input costs.

Certain of the purchased inventory was subsequently sold in the 2023 fourth quarter and was recognized through cost of sales at fair value (the “Bang Inventory Step-Up”).

The effective tax rate for the 2023 fourth quarter was 18.5 percent, compared with 23.3 percent in the 2022 fourth quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the 2023 fourth quarter was primarily due to a large increase in the tax benefit related to the exercise of non-qualified stock options. Net income for the 2023 fourth quarter increased 21.6 percent to $367.0 million, from $301.7 million in the 2022 fourth quarter.

The quarter and the 2023 financial year were again impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. “Gross profit margins in the quarter improved significantly as compared to the 2022 fourth quarter, primarily the result of pricing actions, decreased freight-in costs and lower input costs. Gross profit margins also improved sequentially from the previous quarters. “The Bang Energy acquisition has been successfully integrated and is performing according to expectations.” “Operating expenses for the Alcohol Brands Segment included impairment charges of $39.9 million for the 2023 fourth quarter, relating to certain acquired non-amortizing intangibles as well as property and equipment, as a result of the continuing challenges in the craft beer and seltzer categories,” Schlosberg said. Rodney C. Sacks, Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, said, “Innovation continues to play an important role in our strategy and contributed to our record sales in 2023. In particular, among our innovation products in the United States, Monster Energy® Zero Sugar and Monster Energy Ultra® Strawberry Dreams™ are standouts. We have a wide range of new innovation products planned for 2024 in the United States including our new Monster Energy® Ultra Fantasy Ruby Red™ and Juice Monster® Rio Punch™ products. “Monster Energy® Zero Sugar was launched in Great Britain, Ireland and Poland in the second half of 2023 with additional launches planned throughout EMEA in 2024. “We achieved our goal of securing availability of The Beast Unleashed® throughout most of the United States by the end of last year and have commenced with the roll-out of The Beast Unleashed® in 24 oz. single serve cans in the convenience and gas channel. We are currently launching Nasty Beast™, our new hard tea, in 12 oz. variety packs, as well as in 24 oz. single serve cans. Our innovation pipeline for both our non-alcohol and alcohol beverages remains strong,” Sacks said. 2023 Full-Year ResultsNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased 13.1 percent to $7.14 billion, from $6.31 billion in the comparable period last year.

(STR) announces the acquisition of 13,062 NRAs in the DJ Basin, a $200 million share repurchase program, and updated return of capital framework. The company closed on the sale of Anadarko and Appalachia assets, declared a $0.51 dividend per share, and issued full-year 2024 financial guidance with a pro forma production range of 35,000 - 38,000 Boe/d. Positive Sitio Royalties Corp. (STR) is acquiring 13,062 NRAs in the DJ Basin for $150 million, enhancing its DJ Basin footprint with high-quality acreage in the Greater Wattenberg Field. The company has announced a $200 million share repurchase program to maximize long-term shareholder value and has updated its return of capital framework to include cash dividends and share repurchases. Sitio closed on the sale of Anadarko and Appalachia assets for $114 million and declared a $0.51 dividend per share of Class A Common Stock for the fourth quarter of 2023. The company issued full-year 2024 financial and operational guidance with a pro forma production range of 35,000 - 38,000 Boe/d, with 49% - 51% oil production. Despite a net loss of $91.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, Sitio reported an Adjusted EBITDA of $134.9 million, down 5.3% sequentially from the third quarter of 2023. Sitio reduced long-term debt by $131.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2023, resulting in liquidity of $588.2 million as of December 31, 2023. The company's year-end 2023 proved reserves totaled 85,293 MBOE, with approximately 82% classified as proved developed reserves and 18% as proved undeveloped reserves. Sitio's net average daily production volume for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 35,776 Boe/d, with 47% oil production. The DJ Basin Acquisition is expected to be 6% accretive to Sitio's standalone 2024 return of capital per share and represents a 4.0x purchase multiple of asset-level cash flow. The company plans to fund the DJ Basin Acquisition with cash on hand, cash generated from operations, and revolving credit facility borrowings. Sitio's Board of Directors authorized a $200 million share repurchase program with no expiration date, aimed at maximizing long-term shareholder value. Negative Sitio reported a net loss of $91.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, driven by a non-cash loss on the sale of assets in the Appalachian and Anadarko Basins. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 5.3% sequentially from the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to lower production volumes and decreased realized hedged prices per Boe. The company's year-end 2023 proved reserves saw a net increase of 463 Mboe from acquisitions and divestitures, with PUD reserves accounting for 18% of total reserves. Despite the acquisition of 13,062 NRAs in the DJ Basin, Sitio reported a net loss of $91.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Sitio's net average daily production volume for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 35,776 Boe/d, with 47% oil production. Financial Analyst The acquisition of 13,062 net royalty acres (NRAs) in the DJ Basin for $150 million by Sitio Royalties Corp. appears to be a strategic expansion move, enhancing the company's position in the Wattenberg Field. The 4.0x purchase multiple of asset level cash flow indicates a disciplined investment approach, potentially signaling to investors a value-accretive transaction. The expected 6% accretive impact on 2024 return of capital per share suggests a positive outlook for shareholder value.The announcement of a $200 million share repurchase program further underscores management's confidence in the company's fundamentals and commitment to shareholder returns. This move, coupled with the updated return of capital framework, provides a clearer picture of the company's capital allocation strategy, balancing dividends, share repurchases and debt management. The minimum cash dividend yield based on 4Q 2023 Pro Forma Discretionary Cash Flow (DCF) is particularly noteworthy for income-focused investors. Market Research Analyst The operational metrics reported by Sitio, including the average daily production volume and the pro forma net line-of-sight (LOS) wells, offer insights into the company's growth trajectory and operational efficiency. The increase in average daily production volume pro forma for the acquisitions, despite a net loss in 4Q 2023, suggests a robust underlying business with potential for future revenue growth.The significant presence of rigs in the DJ Basin on the acquisition acreage, compared to Sitio's legacy DJ Basin acreage, indicates a concentrated effort to capitalize on this region's potential. The involvement of top operators like Chevron Corporation and Occidental Petroleum Corporation in these areas may also be viewed as a positive indicator of asset quality and operational prospects. Energy Sector Analyst The focus on the Permian and DJ Basins aligns with broader industry trends favoring these regions due to their lower production costs and higher resource quality. Sitio's strategic shift from the divested Appalachian and Anadarko assets to the DJ Basin assets is consistent with the industry's pursuit of higher returns on investment.However, the reported net loss driven by a non-cash loss on sale of assets and decreased average daily production volumes raises concerns about the immediate impact of the divestitures on the company's financials. The decrease in realized hedged commodity prices also reflects the volatility in the energy market, which could affect future earnings.Lastly, the mention of estimated year-end proved reserves with a majority classified as proved developed reserves is a critical factor for evaluating the company's asset base and long-term sustainability. The extensions contributing to year-over-year changes in reserves highlight the company's ability to grow its resource base organically. 02/28/2024 - 10:54 PM Announces Definitive Agreement to Acquire 13,062 NRAS in the DJ Basin for $150 Million(1) Announces $200 Million Share Repurchase Program and Updated Return of Capital Framework Closed on Previously Announced Sale of Anadarko and Appalachia Assets for $114 Million Declared $0.51 Dividend Per Share of Class A Common Stock for Fourth Quarter 2023 Issues Full Year 2024 Financial and Operational Guidance, With Pro Forma Production Range of 35,000 – 38,000 Boe/d (49% – 51% Oil)(2) DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Sitio Royalties Corp.

We are already off to a great start in 2024 as we entered into an agreement to acquire over 13,000 NRAs in the DJ Basin for a compelling price that is accretive for our shareholders. As we reallocate capital from the recently closed divestiture of assets in the Appalachia and Anadarko Basins into these higher returning assets, we will have transformed our current DJ Basin position into a leading position with enhanced exposure to the Greater Wattenberg Field. Additionally, I'm excited to announce that the Board of Directors has authorized a $200 million share repurchase program as part of our new return of capital framework, which provides us with another method to enhance long-term shareholder value. This repurchase program is a reflection of the confidence we have in the fundamentals of our business. We still plan to allocate at least 65% of DCF to return of capital and utilize the remainder of DCF to pay down debt and make opportunistic cash acquisitions. Under our updated return of capital framework, we intend to allocate a minimum of 35% of DCF to cash dividends and at least 30% of DCF to additional cash dividends, share repurchases or a mix of both.” (1) Definitive agreement to acquire DJ Basin assets from an undisclosed third party signed in January 2024 and is expected to close in early 2Q 2024; $150 million purchase price and final NRAs subject to customary closing adjustments (2) Includes production from the DJ Basin Acquisition for full year 2024 as if the transaction had closed on January 1, 2024 (3) Represents 4Q 2023 metrics plus 4Q 2023 metrics from the DJ Basin Acquisition and 4Q23 Stock Acquisition (collectively the “Oct’23 Effective Date Acquisitions”) as if they were owned on October 1, 2023 and excludes 4Q 2023 metrics from the Appalachian and Anadarko Basin assets that were divested on December 22, 2023; Metrics include production volumes, gathering and transportation costs, and production taxes, as appropriate (4) Includes net wells from the DJ Basin Acquisition as of December 31, 2023 (5) For definitions of non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, please see “Non-GAAP financial measures” (6) 4Q 2023 Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA represents 4Q 2023 Adjusted EBITDA plus Oct’23 Effective Date Acquisitions(2) EBITDA, which reflects as if Sitio had owned the Oct’23 Effective Date Acquisitions since October 1, 2023 (7) The 4Q23 Stock Acquisition is defined as the acquisition of 522 NRAs in the Permian Basin for shares of Sitio’s Class C Common Stock and a corresponding number of common units representing limited partner interests in Sitio Royalties Operating Partnership, LP, a controlled subsidiary of the Company (""OpCo"" and such units, ""OpCo Units"") that closed on December 8, 2023 (8) Calculated as cash taxes paid of $8 thousand divided by net loss before taxes of $112.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023.

Pro forma for net wells from the DJ Basin Acquisition as of December 31, 2023 and excludes wells from the Appalachian and Anadarko Basin assets that were divested on December 22, 2023 (11) Includes NRAs from the DJ Basin Acquisition, subject to closing adjustments MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS On December 8, 2023, Sitio closed on the acquisition of 522 NRAs in the Permian Basin (the ""4Q23 Stock Acquisition"") in exchange for shares of its Class C Common Stock and OpCo Units. The acquired assets produced an average of approximately 46 Boe/d (62% oil) and generated approximately $0.2 million of asset level cash flow for the three months ended December 31, 2023 as if they were owned on October 1, 2023. The 4Q23 Stock Acquisition has an effective date of October 1, 2023 and 4Q 2023 cash flow attributable to the NRAs acquired is included in Sitio's 4Q 2023 Pro Forma DCF. On December 22, 2023, Sitio closed on the divestiture of all of its mineral and royalty interests in the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma and the Appalachian Basin in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia to an undisclosed third party for $114.0 million (the “Appalachian and Anadarko Basins Divestiture”). In January of 2024, Sitio signed a definitive agreement to acquire 13,062 NRAs primarily in the core of the DJ Basin for $150.0 million, subject to customary closing adjustments. The transaction enhances the Company's DJ Basin footprint, adding high-quality acreage in the Greater Wattenberg Field at a compelling price with visible growth through the first half of 2025 from spuds, permits and acreage in several multi-year CAPs and OGDPs with leading operators such as Chevron Corporation, Occidental Petroleum, and Civitas Resources. Monthly net production on the DJ Basin Acquisition acreage has grown by 89% from December 2022 through December 2023, versus a 7% decline on the divested assets over the same time period. As of December 31, 2023, the DJ Basin Acquisition assets had approximately 18.4 net wells online and 5.1 net LOS wells, comprised of 3.4 net spuds and 1.7 net permits. The transaction is expected to close in early 2Q 2024 with an effective date of October 1, 2023; therefore, DJ Basin Acquisition 4Q 2023 asset level cash flow is included in Sitio's 4Q 2023 Pro Forma DCF. Sitio plans to fund the DJ Basin Acquisition with cash on hand, cash generated from operations and revolving credit facility borrowings. FINANCIAL UPDATE Sitio's fourth quarter 2023 average unhedged realized prices including all expected quality, transportation and demand adjustments were $77.91 per barrel of oil, $1.40 per Mcf of natural gas and $18.72 per barrel of natural gas liquids, for a total equivalent price of $43.65 per barrel of oil equivalent. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company received $5.9 million in net cash settlements for commodity derivative contracts and as a result, average hedged realized prices were $80.68 per barrel of oil, $1.66 per Mcf of natural gas and $18.72 per barrel of natural gas liquids, for a total equivalent price of $45.43 per barrel of oil equivalent. This represents a $1.06 per barrel of oil equivalent, or a 2.3% decrease relative to hedged realized prices for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Consolidated net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $91.7 million, compared to consolidated net income of $0.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. This decrease was driven primarily by a $144.5 million non-cash loss on sale from the divestiture of assets in the Appalachian and Anadarko Basins, and lower revenues from decreased average daily production volumes of 1,124 Boe/d, or 3.0% and a $1.06 per Boe decrease in realized hedged commodity prices, offset partially by a non-cash unrealized gain in derivatives of $12.2 million. For the three months ended December 31, 2023, Adjusted EBITDA was $134.9 million, down 5.3% sequentially from third quarter 2023 Adjusted EBITDA, primarily due to decreased average production volumes of 3.0% and a 2.3% decrease in realized hedged prices per Boe. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $877.0 million principal value of total debt outstanding (comprised of $277.0 million of borrowings outstanding under Sitio's revolving credit facility and $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes) and liquidity of $588.2 million, including $15.2 million of cash and $573.0 million of remaining availability under its $850.0 million credit facility. Sitio had approximately $0.4 million of realized gains during 4Q 2023 from its interest rate swap, which had a $202.5 million notional amount during the quarter and expired on December 31, 2023. Sitio did not add to or extinguish any of its commodity swaps or collars during the fourth quarter of 2023. A summary of the Company's existing commodity derivative contracts as of December 31, 2023 is included in the table below.

Of these reserves, approximately 82% were classified as proved developed reserves and 18% were classified as proved undeveloped (“PUD”) reserves. PUD reserves for Sitio included in these estimates relate solely to wells that were spud but not yet producing as of December 31, 2023. The largest driver of year-over-year changes to reserves was extensions of 9,257 MBbls of oil, 26,710 MMcf of natural gas, and 3,723 MBbls of NGLs. Acquisitions increased 2023 year end reserves by 5,803 Mboe; however, the Appalachian and Anadarko Basins Divestiture decreased 2023 year end reserves by 5,340 Mboe, resulting in an overall net increase in 2023 year end reserves from acquisitions and divestitures of 463 Mboe. The following table sets forth information regarding the Company’s net ownership interest in estimated quantities of proved developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas quantities and the changes therein for each of the periods presented.

The 36,500 Boe/d midpoint of the pro forma average daily production range is in-line with pro forma average daily production of 36,623 Boe/d for 4Q 2023 and reflects the Company's current expectations for operator activity on its acreage. Full year 2024 Cash G&A guidance is inclusive of a 25%+ increase in headcount since the end of 2022 and technology development and enhancement projects that are expected to further streamline the Company's large-scale minerals acquisitions and management.

The dividend is payable on March 28, 2024 to the stockholders of record at the close of business on March 15, 2024. Based on a 65% payout ratio of fourth quarter 2023 DCF and not including the pro forma impacts from the Oct’23 Effective Date Acquisitions, Sitio's quarterly dividend would have been approximately $0.47 per Class A common share; however, the Company's Board of Directors approved a fourth quarter 2023 dividend of $0.51 per Class A common share, which equates to a 65% payout ratio including pro forma DCF for the full three months ended December 31, 2023. On February 28, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors also authorized a share repurchase program up to $200 million, and updated its return of capital framework to include share repurchases. The Company has revised its return of capital framework to allow more flexibility to maximize shareholder returns based on market conditions, business outlook, and stock price. The Company plans to continue to allocate a minimum of 65% of DCF to return of capital, comprised of a minimum of 35% of DCF in cash dividends and at least 30% of DCF comprised of additional cash dividends, share repurchases, or a mix of both. Repurchases may be made from time to time through various methods, including but not limited to open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, and by other means in accordance with applicable state and federal securities laws, certain of which may be made pursuant to trading plans meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The timing of repurchases under the repurchase program, as well as the number and value of shares repurchased under the program, will be determined by the Company at its discretion and will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of the Company's Common Stock, oil and gas commodity prices, general market and economic conditions, available liquidity, compliance with the Company's debt and other agreements, applicable legal requirements and other considerations. The exact number of shares to be repurchased by the Company is not guaranteed, and the program may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time without prior notice. The Company is not obligated to purchase any dollar amount or number of shares under the repurchase program.

Adjusted EBITDA, Discretionary Cash Flow, Pro Forma Discretionary Cash Flow and Cash G&A are non-GAAP supplemental financial measures used by our management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors, research analysts and others to assess the financial performance of our assets and their ability to sustain dividends over the long term without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis. Sitio believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to Sitio's management and external users because they allow for a comparison of operating performance on a consistent basis across periods. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus (a) interest expense, (b) provisions for income taxes, (c) depreciation, depletion and amortization, (d) non-cash share-based compensation expense, (e) impairment of oil and gas properties, (f) gains or losses on unsettled derivative instruments, (g) change in fair value of warrant liability, (h) management fee to affiliates, (i) loss on extinguishment of debt (j) merger-related transaction costs, (k) write off of financing costs, and (l) loss on sale of oil and gas properties. We define Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA plus (a) Oct’23 Effective Date Acquisitions EBITDA from October 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 that is not included in Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and (b) Brigham Minerals EBITDA October 1 to December 28, 2022. We define Brigham Minerals EBITDA October 1 to December 28, 2022 as the EBITDA from October 1, 2022 through December 28, 2022 of the assets acquired from Brigham Minerals on December 29, 2022. We define Discretionary Cash Flow for time periods prior to 2024 as Adjusted EBITDA, less cash and accrued interest expense and cash taxes. We define Discretionary Cash Flow in 2024 as Adjusted EBITDA, less cash and accrued interest and estimated cash taxes. We define Pro Forma Discretionary Cash Flow as Discretionary Cash Flow plus (a) Oct’23 Effective Date Acquisitions Discretionary Cash Flow from October 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 that is not included in Discretionary Cash Flow for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and (b) Brigham Minerals Discretionary Cash Flow October 1 to December 28, 2022. We define Brigham Minerals Discretionary Cash Flow October 1 to December 28, 2022 as the DCF from October 1, 2022 through December 28, 2022 of the assets acquired from Brigham Minerals on December 29, 2022. We define Cash G&A as general and administrative expense less (a) non-cash share-based compensation expense, (b) merger-related transaction costs and (c) rental income. We define Loss on sale of oil and natural gas properties as the non-cash losses incurred from the Appalachian and Anadarko Basins Divestiture in December 2023. These non-GAAP financial measures do not represent and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP as measures of our financial performance. Non-GAAP financial measures have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Our computations of Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Discretionary Cash Flow, Pro Forma Discretionary Cash Flow and Cash G&A may differ from computations of similarly titled measures of other companies.

Xero Partners with BILL to Deliver Industry-leading Bill Pay Capabilities for Small Businesses,2024-02-28T22:00:00.000Z,Low,Very Positive,"Xero partners with BILL to enhance accounts payable experience for US customers by embedding a bill pay solution, aiming to streamline payment processes and improve cash flow management for small businesses.","Xero Partners with BILL to Deliver Industry-leading Bill Pay Capabilities for Small Businesses Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags partnership Rhea-AI Summary Xero partners with BILL to enhance accounts payable experience for US customers by embedding a bill pay solution, aiming to streamline payment processes and improve cash flow management for small businesses. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The strategic partnership between Xero and BILL represents a significant development in the fintech space. The integration of BILL's payment solutions into the Xero platform is poised to enhance the accounts payable process for small and midsize businesses (SMBs) in the U.S. This collaboration could potentially streamline operations, reduce manual work and improve cash flow management for a large segment of the market, given that there are over 33 million SMBs in the U.S.From a financial perspective, the automation of bill payments and the ease of reconciliation could lead to increased efficiency and cost savings for businesses. The ability to access BILL's proprietary network of 5.8 million members offers a valuable expansion of financial operations capabilities. This move could be seen as a strategic effort by Xero to increase its market share in the U.S. by offering differentiated services that address the pain points of manual financial processes.The long-term implications for stakeholders may include improved financial health of SMBs due to better cash flow management. However, it is essential to monitor the adoption rate of the new solution and the actual impact on Xero's revenue and market positioning. As the fintech industry continues to evolve, such partnerships are likely to become more common as companies seek to leverage each other's strengths to provide more comprehensive solutions to their customers. Market Research Analyst The partnership between Xero and BILL underscores a growing trend in the financial technology industry towards embedded finance. Embedded finance allows non-financial companies to integrate financial services into their offerings, thereby creating a seamless user experience. This trend is particularly relevant for SMBs that may lack the resources to manage complex financial operations.By focusing on the user experience and reducing the need for manual financial processes, Xero and BILL are tapping into a demand for more integrated and user-friendly financial services. The potential for increased customer retention and acquisition for Xero through this partnership is significant, as businesses are likely to gravitate towards platforms that offer more comprehensive and automated financial management tools.It is important to note that the success of such integrations hinges on the reliability and security of the payment solutions. As SMBs are increasingly targeted by cyber threats, the security measures implemented by Xero and BILL will be a critical factor in the adoption of the embedded bill pay solution. The market response to this partnership will be an indicator of the viability of embedded finance solutions in the SMB sector and could influence future strategic decisions within the industry. Technology Analyst The integration of BILL's payment solutions into the Xero platform is a significant technological advancement for SMBs. The embedded finance solution leverages the capabilities of both companies to create a more efficient and streamlined accounts payable experience.

(CLPT) announced a proposed underwritten public offering of its common stock, with the potential for additional shares to be offered. The offering is subject to market conditions, with Lake Street Capital Markets, LLC acting as the book-running manager. The SEC declared the shelf registration statement effective in November 2023. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst ClearPoint Neuro, Inc.'s announcement of a proposed underwritten public offering of its common stock is a significant event that has the potential to influence the company's capital structure and stock liquidity. The decision to offer additional shares can be a strategic move to raise capital for further investment in their precise navigation technologies for brain and spine therapies, which could accelerate growth or fund new research and development initiatives. However, it is crucial to assess the offering's size relative to the company's existing market capitalization to understand dilution effects. If the offering is large in proportion to the current number of outstanding shares, existing shareholders might see a decrease in their ownership percentage, potentially affecting the stock price negatively in the short term.Moreover, the market's reception of this offering will be telling of investor confidence in ClearPoint Neuro's growth prospects. The 30-day option for underwriters to purchase additional shares, up to 15% of the number sold, could indicate the underwriters' optimism about the stock's demand. However, investors should be cautious as the final terms and success of the offering are contingent on market conditions, which are unpredictable and can be affected by broader economic factors. Market Research Analyst The medical device and therapy sector is highly competitive and capital intensive, with constant pressure to innovate and comply with regulatory standards. ClearPoint Neuro's entry into the public offering space must be juxtaposed against current industry trends, such as the increasing demand for minimally invasive surgeries and the rising prevalence of neurological disorders. The funds raised could help the company maintain a competitive edge by investing in cutting-edge technology or expanding its market reach.Analysts should also consider the timing of the offering. If the market is receptive to healthcare and biotech investments, the offering could be well-received. However, if there's a downturn or skepticism in the market, it could lead to less favorable terms or a potential postponement of the offering. Key factors such as the company's past financial performance, growth trajectory and the management's strategic plans should be scrutinized to evaluate the potential success of this capital raise. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the involvement of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the effectiveness of a shelf registration statement are pivotal. This suggests that ClearPoint Neuro has complied with SEC regulations, allowing for a quicker response to market conditions. Investors should note that the shelf registration permits the company to sell securities to the public without the need for a separate SEC filing for each issuance, providing flexibility in timing the offering.It is also important to understand the legal implications of the underwriters' additional purchase option. This 'greenshoe' option provides a mechanism to stabilize the stock price after the offering, which can be beneficial in mitigating the risk of stock price volatility. However, investors should be aware of the terms detailed in the prospectus and any potential risks disclosed by the company, as these will outline the legal rights and obligations associated with the investment. 02/28/2024 - 04:45 PM SOLANA BEACH, Calif., Feb. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ClearPoint Neuro, Inc.

After the offering, approximately 61,554,064 shares of Class A common stock will be outstanding.","Portillo’s Inc. Announces Offering of Class A Common Stock in “Synthetic Secondary” Transaction Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Portillo’s Inc. (PTLO) announced an underwritten public offering of 8,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, with an option for an additional 1,200,000 shares. The offering aims to be non-dilutive, with proceeds used for strategic transactions. BofA Securities is the sole underwriter. After the offering, approximately 61,554,064 shares of Class A common stock will be outstanding. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Portillo's Inc. of an underwritten public offering of 8,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, with a 30-day option for the underwriter to purchase an additional 1,200,000 shares, is a strategic financial move with implications for the company's equity structure and investor relations. The transaction, being non-dilutive, indicates that the company is not increasing its total share count but rather is restructuring the ownership of existing shares. The synthetic secondary transaction will result in the conversion of certain Class B shares into Class A shares, thus maintaining the same total common stock share count. This maneuver can potentially enhance liquidity for Class A shares and could be seen as an attempt to consolidate voting power or simplify the company's capital structure.For investors, this offering provides an opportunity to evaluate the company's strategic priorities, as the proceeds are intended for internal restructuring rather than external growth or operational funding. It is also noteworthy that BofA Securities is the sole underwriter, which may suggest confidence in the offering's success. However, investors should be aware of market conditions that could affect the sale price of these shares and the overall valuation of the company. The pricing of the shares relative to market value will be an important factor to monitor, as it can influence investor sentiment and stock performance in the short term. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Portillo's Inc.'s decision to engage in a public offering and the subsequent rebalancing of its Class A and Class B shares could signal to the market the company's intent to streamline its equity structure and possibly improve corporate governance. The fact that Portillo's will not receive any proceeds from the offering suggests that this move is more about shareholder alignment than raising capital for immediate operational needs. The impact of this offering on the stock's liquidity and market perception is contingent on the execution of the sale and the market's response to the increase in available Class A shares.Investors and potential shareholders may interpret this restructuring as a positive sign of the company's maturity and a commitment to a more standardized equity framework, which could influence the stock's attractiveness. Additionally, the involvement of a prominent underwriter like BofA Securities could lend credibility to the offering and potentially attract institutional investors. The market's reaction to this offering will be telling, especially in terms of the stock's trading volume and price stability in the days following the transaction. Legal Expert In terms of legal and regulatory considerations, Portillo's Inc.'s public offering is being conducted under an effective shelf registration statement, which allows the company to sell securities to the public without the need for a separate registration for each offering. This approach provides Portillo's with the flexibility to act quickly in response to market conditions and investor interest. The role of the SEC in this process is to ensure that all necessary disclosures and legal requirements are met, providing protection for investors.It is crucial for investors to review the prospectus and other SEC filings to fully understand the terms of the offering and the rights associated with Class A versus Class B common stock. The distinction between the two classes typically lies in voting rights and dividend entitlements, which can affect shareholder influence and investment returns. Investors should also be aware of the underwriter's over-allotment option, as its exercise could lead to additional changes in the share distribution and potentially impact the stock's market performance. 02/28/2024 - 04:45 PM CHICAGO, Feb. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Portillo’s Inc. (“Portillo’s” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: PTLO), the fast-casual restaurant concept known for its menu of Chicago-style favorites, today announced the launch of an underwritten public offering of 8,000,000 shares of Portillo’s Class A common stock (“Class A common stock”). The underwriter has a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,200,000 shares of its Class A common stock. The proposed offering is considered non-dilutive, as Portillo’s expects to use the net proceeds to (a) purchase limited liability company units of PHD Group Holdings LLC held by certain existing holders (and cancel the associated shares of the Company’s Class B common stock (the “Class B common stock”)) and (b) repurchase shares of Class A common stock from certain existing holders, each in a “synthetic secondary” transaction. As a result, Portillo’s will not receive any proceeds from this offering. Upon close of the transaction, the Company’s total common stock share count, comprised of shares of Class A and Class B common stock, will remain the same; however, the amount of shares of Class A common stock will increase by the same amount of the decrease in the number of shares of Class B common stock. After this offering, it is expected that approximately 61,554,064 shares of Class A common stock and 11,579,326 shares of Class B common stock will be outstanding (or, if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, 62,438,104 shares of Class A common stock and 10,695,286 shares of Class B common stock). BofA Securities is acting as the sole underwriter of the offering. The underwriter proposes to offer the shares of Class A common stock from time to time for sale in one or more transactions on the Nasdaq, in the over-the-counter market, through negotiated transactions or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices.

Financial results show $31.1 million collaboration revenue and $416.2 million cash on hand. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The acquisition of CymaBay by Gilead Sciences represents a significant strategic move in the biopharmaceutical sector. The transaction's valuation at $4.3 billion underscores Gilead's commitment to expanding its portfolio in liver diseases, with CymaBay's seladelpar presenting a potentially transformative treatment for PBC. From a financial perspective, the deal signals confidence in the commercial viability of seladelpar, given the FDA's priority review and the anticipation of market launch. Investors should note the immediate cessation of financial guidance from CymaBay, which suggests a focus on the seamless integration of operations post-acquisition. The collaboration revenue from Kaken indicates strategic partnerships that could bolster the drug's international market presence, diversifying revenue streams for Gilead post-acquisition. Medical Research Analyst The prioritized FDA review of seladelpar and its designation as a Breakthrough Therapy are pivotal for Gilead's acquisition rationale. These regulatory milestones not only expedite the drug's approval process but also reflect its potential to outperform existing PBC treatments in terms of ALP reduction and pruritus relief, as evidenced by the RESPONSE study results. The doubling of the IDEAL study's patient count demonstrates a commitment to robust clinical data, which is critical in a therapeutic area with high unmet need. The broadening of the study to include more patients enhances the statistical power and may improve the drug's marketability upon successful outcomes. Stakeholders should monitor the AFFIRM study closely, as its focus on clinical outcomes in patients with compensated cirrhosis could further differentiate seladelpar in a competitive market. Market Research Analyst The pre-commercial launch planning and medical affairs team deployment reflect CymaBay's strategic approach to market penetration for seladelpar. By focusing on PBC education and building experienced commercial strategy and operations teams, they are laying the groundwork for a successful product introduction. The anticipation of regulatory review completion in 2025 by EMA and MHRA indicates a longer-term strategy for market expansion into Europe and the U.K., potentially increasing the drug's market share and revenue generation. The increase in general and administrative expenses correlates with these commercialization efforts. The market's response to the acquisition and subsequent drug launch will be contingent on the successful navigation of the competitive landscape and the ability to differentiate seladelpar based on its clinical benefits. 02/28/2024 - 04:45 PM Gilead Sciences, Inc. has proposed to acquire CymaBay for $32.50 per share in cash or a total equity value of $4.3 billion. U.S. FDA accepted seladelpar NDA for priority review, and seladelpar marketing applications were submitted to the EMA and MHRA for review in Europe and the U.K. Due to the pending transaction with Gilead, CymaBay will not be hosting a conference call to review the financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023 or commenting on its financial guidance for the future quarters. NEWARK, Calif., Feb. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CymaBay Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: CBAY), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapies for liver and other chronic diseases with high unmet need, today announced corporate updates and financial results for the year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023. “2023 was a seminal year for CymaBay with critical achievements in the development of our investigational therapeutic, seladelpar. The Phase 3 RESPONSE data presented in 2023 and recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine, indicate that seladelpar has the potential to raise the bar in PBC second-line treatment and improve quality of life for people living with this debilitating condition,” said Sujal Shah, President and CEO of CymaBay. “Our team moved at speed to submit seladelpar to regulatory agencies and with an updated breakthrough therapy designation were able to secure FDA priority review. These accomplishments were recognized with the recent announcement of the pending acquisition of CymaBay by Gilead. I am incredibly proud of the team and everything that has been achieved in 2023 to help bring seladelpar to people living with PBC, and believe that through Gilead, seladelpar can reach a broad range of people that may benefit in 2024 and beyond.” 2023 and Recent Corporate Highlights Pending Acquisition by Gilead: On February 11, 2024, CymaBay entered into a definitive agreement with Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead) under which Gilead will acquire CymaBay for $32.50 per share in cash or a total equity value of $4.3 billion. The transaction is anticipated to close during the first quarter of 2024, subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. Regulatory Updates and Launch Readiness: In February 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted a New Drug Application (NDA) for seladelpar, an investigational treatment for the management of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) including pruritus in adults without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis (Child Pugh A) who are inadequate responders or intolerant to ursodeoxycholic acid. The FDA has granted priority review and set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act target action date of August 14, 2024. The agency has notified the company that it is not currently planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the application.CymaBay has received validation of its application to the U.K. Medicines Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for seladelpar for the treatment of PBC. Seladelpar has also been submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and validation of the application is anticipated in H1 2024. Review by both agencies is anticipated to be completed in 2025.In the U.S., this application was further supported by the Breakthrough Therapy Designation for seladelpar, that was updated by the FDA in October 2023, with clinical results that indicate seladelpar may provide meaningful improvement over existing therapy based on a reduction in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and improvement in pruritus in patients without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis.In preparation for the potential launch of seladelpar in the U.S. in 2024, CymaBay hired, trained and deployed a medical affairs team with a range of expertise across PBC, rare disease and liver diseases to drive PBC education. Our pre-commercial launch planning efforts in the U.S. accelerated in the fourth quarter as we built strong commercial strategy, marketing, market access, commercial operations and analytics teams with experience in launching new treatments in rare diseases and competitive therapeutics areas and markets. Clinical Development: In mid-2023, CymaBay announced initiation of the IDEAL study, a 52-week, placebo-controlled, randomized, Phase 3 study. The IDEAL study aimed to enroll 75 patients with PBC who have an incomplete response or intolerance to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), with ALP levels greater than the upper limit of normal (ULN) but less than 1.67x ULN, and total bilirubin less than or equal to 2x ULN. To ensure IDEAL is well powered to effectively assess both liver biochemistry and pruritus impact we are now doubling the study size to 150 patients with a 2:1 ratio of patients receiving seladelpar vs. placebo. The primary outcome measure is the ALP composite of normalization and a greater than or equal to 15% decrease in ALP at 52 weeks. A key secondary endpoint is evaluating the change in pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) at six months in subjects with moderate to severe pruritus at baseline.Enrollment in the long-term ASSURE study continues. ASSURE is an open-label study of seladelpar in patients with PBC intended to collect additional long-term safety and efficacy data to further support registration. There are now over 300 patients taking seladelpar 10 mg daily, through the study including those from prior studies of seladelpar and patients who have completed RESPONSE.In 2023, CymaBay initiated AFFIRM, a randomized, placebo-controlled confirmatory study to evaluate the effect of seladelpar 10 mg daily on clinical outcomes in patients with compensated cirrhosis due to PBC. The AFFIRM study is planned to enroll approximately 192 patients with PBC who have compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A or Child-Pugh B) based on prespecified clinical criteria. Patients will be randomly assigned using a 2:1 ratio to seladelpar or placebo for a fixed duration of three years. The primary outcome measure is the time to the first occurrence of clinical events (all-cause death, liver transplant, hospitalization for other serious liver-related events, and progression to Child-Pugh C decompensated cirrhosis). Additional key outcomes include overall survival, liver transplant-free survival, and time to hospitalization for serious liver-related events. Presentations and Publications: The pivotal Phase 3 RESPONSE study was presented at The Liver Meeting® 2023 of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, in Boston Massachusetts, and later published online in the New England Journal of Medicine in February 2024. The clinical data includes: RESPONSE was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, global study of one-year duration that randomized 193 PBC patients in a 2:1 ratio to seladelpar 10 mg or placebo, once daily. Eligible patients had an inadequate response or intolerance to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) with serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≥ 1.67× the upper limit of normal (ULN) after at least 12 months of treatment. The primary endpoint was a composite of ALP and total bilirubin previously accepted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) for registration studies in PBC. The composite endpoint was achieved in 61.7% of patients on seladelpar vs. 20.0% on placebo (p<0.0001).The key secondary endpoint of ALP normalization occurred in 25% of patients receiving seladelpar vs. 0% for patients on placebo (p<0.0001). The average decrease in ALP for patients on seladelpar was -133.9 U/L vs. -16.9 U/L for patients on placebo (p<0.0001).The study also measured the impact on patient-reported pruritus (itching), one of the most challenging symptoms experienced by people with PBC, as a key secondary endpoint using the daily numerical rating scale (NRS; 0-10). The pruritus endpoint was met at Month 6 among patients with baseline NRS > 4 reporting decreases of 3.2 points with seladelpar (n=65) vs. 1.7 for patients on placebo (n=20; p<0.005). Notably, these improvements were sustained through Month 12 (p<0.005). A statistically significant reduction in pruritus was also observed at Month 6 and at Month 12 for patients in the intent-to-treat population, which includes all patients irrespective of their NRS score at baseline. CymaBay published a post-hoc analysis of the Phase 3 ENHANCE study in the open access journal Hepatology, demonstrating the impact of seladelpar on serum interleukin-31 (IL-31) levels and its correlation with pruritus improvement in people with PBC. Financial Updates: Held $416.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments as of December 31, 2023. Fourth Quarter and Year Ended December 31, 2023, Financial Results: Collaboration revenue recognized for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $31.1 million and was associated with the collaboration and license agreement with Kaken Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Kaken) entered into in January 2023, to develop and commercialize seladelpar in Japan. As reported earlier, $31.0 million of this revenue was recognized upon completion of the initial technology transfer to Kaken in the second quarter of 2023. Of the $34.2M upfront payment received from Kaken, $2.7 million remains deferred as of December 31, 2023 and will be recognized upon completion of CymaBay’s ongoing clinical data delivery and CMC development performance obligations.Research and development expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $22.8 million, and $16.2 million, respectively. Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022 were $80.8 million and $68.0 million, respectively. Research and development expenses for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023 increased compared to the corresponding periods in 2022 driven by higher clinical activities supporting our clinical studies and higher spend supporting our regulatory filings.General and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $19.8 million and $7.2 million, respectively. General and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $51.9 million and $25.1 million, respectively. General and administrative expenses for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023 were higher than the corresponding periods in 2022 driven by investments to prepare for potential commercialization of seladelpar in PBC as well as increase in other corporate expenses.Net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $41.9 million and $26.6 million, or ($0.35) and ($0.30) per share, respectively. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $105.4 million and $106.0 million, or ($0.99) and ($1.21) per share, respectively. Net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was higher than the three months ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to higher operating expenses. Net loss in the year ended December 31, 2023 was slightly lower than the corresponding period in 2022 due primarily to $31.0 million of collaboration revenue related to the Kaken upfront payment during the second quarter of 2023 and higher interest income earned on our investments and other income due to refundable tax credits, offset in part by an increase in operating expenses and interest expense from the Abingworth development financing arrangement.

The agreement includes a focus on the civilian market, sports events, and animal training, with plans for a definitive agreement by March 31st, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The recent announcement by KWESST Micro Systems Inc. regarding the binding Letter Of Intent with O'Dell Engineering Ltd. for the sale and distribution of PARA OPS products in Canada represents a strategic move to penetrate the civilian market. This expansion into non-military applications, such as sports events and animal training, diversifies KWESST's product offering and potentially opens up new revenue streams.In analyzing the potential market impact, it is important to note that the civilian use of such products is subject to stringent regulations. However, the management's optimism about the applicability of PARA OPS technology as a safe alternative to traditional methods indicates a well-thought-out strategy to navigate these regulatory landscapes. The initial stocking order, while small, is a typical approach to test market reception and manage inventory risks.Furthermore, the outsourced shipping and handling component could improve customer service responsiveness, which is a critical factor for success in consumer markets. The partnership with a well-established distributor like O'Dell Engineering, which has an existing network and market presence, is likely to enhance market penetration efficiency and speed. Financial Analyst The binding LOI between KWESST and O'Dell Engineering could be indicative of KWESST's financial strategy to expand its revenue base and decrease reliance on military contracts. The move towards the consumer market may reflect an attempt to stabilize cash flows and reduce the volatility associated with defense spending.Investors should consider the implications of the company's entry into the civilian market, which includes potential increases in operational costs due to marketing and distribution efforts. However, the use of a distributor like O'Dell could mitigate some of these costs. Additionally, the market's response to the initial stocking order will provide valuable insights into the demand and scalability of PARA OPS products in this new segment.The timeline set for the Definitive Agreement suggests a clear roadmap and commitment from both parties. It is crucial to monitor the progress towards this deadline, as any delay could affect investor confidence and the stock's performance. Legal Expert From a legal perspective, the transition of KWESST's PARA OPS products into the civilian market necessitates careful consideration of the regulatory environment. Products that are positioned as alternatives to pepper spray or bear spray, for instance, must comply with Health Canada regulations. The company's navigation through this legal framework will be pivotal in ensuring the successful launch and sustained distribution of their products.The definitive agreement's conclusion by the end of March 2024 will be a significant milestone, as it will formalize the terms of the partnership and distribution strategy. It is essential for stakeholders to understand the legal obligations and protections that will be established in this agreement to evaluate the potential risks and legal compliance of the venture. 02/28/2024 - 04:41 PM Distribution to the Canadian consumer market to include variant for sports events and animal trainingAgreement contemplates initial stocking orderAlso includes outsourced shipping and handling of PARA OPS and ARWEN products for responsive customer serviceOttawa, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - February 28, 2024) - KWESST Micro Systems Inc.

Positive None. Negative None. 02/28/2024 - 04:48 PM WASHINGTON, Feb. 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Cochlear assembled a team of hearing experts to emphasize the importance of hearing health for policy makers at the Australian Embassy in Washington D.C. ahead of World Hearing Day on Sunday March 3rd. ""After I took action and received my first cochlear implant in 1993, my life absolutely changed for the better.""According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), one in every three people 65 years of age and one in every two 75 years of age and over has hearing loss.1 The event introduced ways to educate not only those in attendance, but the public, to better understand hearing, how it changes over time and the importance of treatment, including the introduction of the Hearing Number by Dr. Frank Lin, Director, Cochlear Center for Hearing and Public Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Echoing Dr. Lin's education messaging, panelist Barbara Kelley, Executive Director of The Hearing Loss Association of America (HLAA) spoke about changing mindsets, urging Americans to protect hearing in noisy environments, check hearing with regular exams and treat hearing loss as soon as possible. Most people know their basic medical information as they age including height, weight, vision and even blood pressure, but one that is left off all too often is hearing, which can have consequences. The Hearing Number hopes to help medical professionals and patients act sooner. Untreated hearing loss can impact a person's brain health, balance, speech and overall quality of life.2 The sentiment of the importance of understanding how hearing effects healthy aging was highlighted by the moderator of the event, Dr. Brian Kaplan, SVP, Global Clinical Strategy & Innovation at Cochlear, Chairman of the Department of Otolaryngology, and Director of the Cochlear Implant Program at the Greater Baltimore Medical Center. ""If left unaddressed, hearing loss poses significant challenges to overall health and can be progressive, leading to greater hearing loss over time. Research has shown untreated hearing loss is connected to increased social isolation and loneliness, balance issues and risk for falls, and there's emerging evidence associating untreated hearing loss with diminished brain health and mental sharpness as well,"" Dr. Kaplan said. Someone who knows all too well the impact of hearing loss and is passionate about educating others on the help he received is Lawrence Burns, the former Vice President of Research & Development and Planning for General Motors who suddenly lost his hearing in 1992 and was a panelist at the event today talking about the importance of his hearing treatment with cochlear implants. ""I could feel myself slowly isolating more and more after I lost my hearing. It got to the point where I wouldn't go out to dinner with my family because it was just too hard and I was often questioning if I would ever reach my full potential,"" Burns said. ""After I took action and received my first cochlear implant in 1993, my life absolutely changed for the better. It helped me get back to fully engaging all aspects of my life from work to family, to basic tasks. The biggest impact that I can reflect on now is that it gave me my independence back, which I will never take for granted,"" he said. Burns' story of isolation due to hearing loss is all too common, more than 37 million (15%) Americans have hearing loss.3 ""There are too many people out there suffering that don't know there are treatments available to bring them back into the hearing world. Assembling this group today is one step to bringing awareness and action to this issue. We hope the introduction of the Hearing Number will better equip the public with the necessary tools to assess their hearing and seek treatment when needed,"" Lisa Aubert, President of Cochlear Americas, said. ""Our goal and what we challenge those here today to do is implement a standard of care and peer support, ensuring equitable access to treatment and care for every child and adult with hearing loss to improve their quality of life."" About the EventThe event opened with remarks from Cochlear Americas President Lisa Aubert. Moderated by Dr. Brian Kaplan, SVP, Global Clinical Strategy & Innovation at Cochlear, Chairman of the Department of Otolaryngology, and Director of the Cochlear Implant Program at the Greater Baltimore Medical Center, the event included a panel of experts at the Australian Embassy which included Dr. Frank Lin, Director, Cochlear Center for Hearing and Public Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Barbara Kelley, the executive director of the Hearing Loss Association of America (HLAA) and Lawrence Burns a Cochlear recipient and former Vice President of Research & Development and Planning for General Motors.

Secured a long-term contract with QatarEnergy for LNG supply in Bangladesh. Authorized $50 million in stock repurchases and declared a quarterly dividend of $0.025 per share. CEO Steven Kobos highlighted the company's focus on growth and shareholder returns in 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported net income and Adjusted EBITDA from Excelerate Energy are critical indicators of the company's profitability and operational efficiency. The net income of $126.8 million for the full year and $20.0 million for the fourth quarter signifies robust performance, especially when considering the volatile energy market. The Adjusted EBITDA figures provide insight into the company's earning potential before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which is a key metric for investors to assess a company's financial health. The authorization of a $50 million Class A common stock repurchase program indicates confidence in the company's intrinsic value and a shareholder-friendly capital allocation policy.The declaration of a quarterly dividend, albeit modest, is a signal of the company's commitment to providing returns to shareholders and the sustainability of its cash flows. However, the projected range for 2024 Adjusted EBITDA suggests a potential contraction compared to 2023, which could indicate expected headwinds or conservative guidance. Investors should monitor the capital expenditure forecasts, as they reflect the company's investment in growth and maintenance, which are essential for long-term sustainability. Energy Sector Analyst The long-term contract with QatarEnergy to purchase 0.85 to 1.0 MTPA of LNG on a delivered ex-ship basis in Bangladesh is a strategic move for Excelerate Energy. This deal not only secures a steady supply of LNG but also strengthens Excelerate's position in the Asian energy market, which is of particular interest given Asia's growing energy demand. The duration of the contract (15 years) provides a clear visibility of revenue streams well into the future, which is favorable for the company's valuation.Moreover, the focus on the core regasification business and contracts in Brazil indicates a targeted approach to market selection and service offering. The energy sector, particularly LNG, is subject to geopolitical, supply and demand risks, so Excelerate's integrated strategy and diversified portfolio could mitigate some of these risks. The emphasis on executing growth strategy and optimizing the business to deliver superior returns suggests a proactive management approach to navigate the complexities of the global energy market. 02/28/2024 - 04:53 PM THE WOODLANDS, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Excelerate Energy, Inc. (NYSE: EE) (the Company or Excelerate) today reported its financial results for the full year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023. RECENT HIGHLIGHTS Reported Net Income of $126.8 million for the full year 2023 and $20.0 million for the fourth quarter Reported Adjusted EBITDA of $346.8 million for the full year 2023 and $71.4 million for the fourth quarter Secured supply for previously announced Petrobangla SPA by executing a long-term contract to purchase 0.85 to 1.0 MTPA of LNG from QatarEnergy on a delivered ex-ship basis in Bangladesh for 15 years, beginning January 2026 Authorized up to $50 million of Class A common stock repurchases through February 2026 Declared a quarterly dividend of $0.025 per share, payable on March 28, 2024 CEO COMMENT “Excelerate Energy delivered an exceptionally strong year of financial results in 2023. The consistent earnings contribution from our core regasification business and the solid performance of our contracts in Brazil highlighted the unique potential of our integrated strategy,” said Steven Kobos, President and Chief Executive Officer of Excelerate. Kobos continued, “In 2024, Excelerate Energy is committed to moving from strategy to action. We remain focused on executing our growth strategy and optimizing our business to deliver superior returns for our shareholders. Additionally, we will be using our balance sheet to return capital to shareholders through a new $50 million share repurchase program while maintaining the flexibility to pursue our organic and inorganic growth opportunities.” 2024 GUIDANCE Full year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA expected to range between $315 million and $335 million Committed Growth Capex, which is defined as capital allocated and committed to specific investments currently in execution, is expected to range between $70 million and $80 million Maintenance Capex expected to range between $50 million and $60 million Actual results may differ materially from the Company’s outlook as a result of, among other things, the factors described under “Forward-Looking Statements” below. FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS For the three months ended For the full year ended (in millions) December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Revenues $ 240.1 $ 275.5 $ 1,159.0 $ 2,473.0 Operating Income $ 39.9 $ 67.5 $ 210.6 $ 186.7 Net Income $ 20.0 $ 46.5 $ 126.8 $ 80.0 Adjusted Net Income (1) $ 20.0 $ 46.5 $ 126.8 $ 108.7 Adjusted EBITDA (1) $ 71.4 $ 106.9 $ 346.8 $ 296.4 Earnings Per Share (diluted) $ 0.14 $ 0.40 $ 1.11 $ 0.51 (1) See the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measure in the section titled ""Non-GAAP Reconciliation"" below. Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2023 increased primarily due to new charters in Finland and Germany, higher rates on charters in Brazil, Argentina, and the UAE, higher direct margin on gas sales and lower operating lease expense due to the acquisition of the FSRU Sequoia, partially offset by drydocking expense for the FSRU Excellence. Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter decreased sequentially from the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to drydocking expenses related to the FSRU Excellence, spot LNG cargo sales during the third quarter that did not reoccur in the fourth quarter, and planned vessel repairs and maintenance in the fourth quarter. KEY COMMERCIAL UPDATES QatarEnergy In January 2024, Excelerate signed a 15-year LNG Sales and Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) with QatarEnergy. Under the agreement, Excelerate will purchase 0.85 to 1.0 million tonnes per annum (""MTPA"") of LNG from QatarEnergy on a delivered ex-ship basis beginning in January 2026. Excelerate will purchase 0.85 MTPA of LNG in 2026 and 2027 and 1.0 MTPA from 2028 to 2040. The contract is expected to provide reliable LNG supply for Excelerate’s previously announced SPA with Petrobangla in Bangladesh. Bangladesh In November 2023, Excelerate signed a long-term LNG SPA with Petrobangla. Under the agreement, Petrobangla has agreed to purchase 0.85 to 1.0 MTPA of LNG from Excelerate for a term of 15 years beginning in January 2026. Excelerate will deliver 0.85 MTPA of LNG in 2026 and 2027 and 1 MTPA from 2028 to 2040. The take-or-pay LNG volumes are expected to be delivered through Excelerate’s two existing FSRUs, Excellence and Summit LNG, in Bangladesh. Capital Deployment Plan For the full year 2024, Excelerate expects committed growth capex, which is defined as capital allocated and committed to specific investments currently in execution, to range between $70 million and $80 million. Beyond committed growth capex, the Company expects to deploy significant growth capital through 2026 in support of its portfolio of inorganic and organic commercial opportunities. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As of December 31, 2023, Excelerate had $555.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, $49.4 million of letters of credit issued and no outstanding borrowings under its $350 million revolving credit facility. During the fourth quarter, the Company paid down $68.3 million of debt, including a $55.2 million discretionary repayment of debt on its Term Loan. On February 22, 2024, Excelerate’s Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend equal to $0.025 per share of Class A common stock, which will be paid on March 28, 2024, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 13, 2024. SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM The Excelerate Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to $50 million of its outstanding Class A common stock through February 2026. Under the program, repurchases can be made using a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, block trades, privately negotiated transactions and/or a non-discretionary trading plan, all in compliance with the rules of the SEC and other applicable legal requirements.

Our computation of Adjusted Gross Margin may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies, and you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this information. Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure included as a supplemental disclosure because we believe it is a useful indicator of our operating performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, accretion, non-cash long-term incentive compensation expense and items such as charges and non-recurring expenses that management does not consider as part of assessing ongoing operating performance. In the first quarter of 2023, we revised the definition of Adjusted EBITDA to adjust for the impact of non-cash accretion expense, which results in a metric that is consistent with how management will review performance going forward. Management believes accretion expense does not directly reflect our ongoing operating performance. Adjusted Net Income The Company uses Adjusted Net Income, a non-GAAP financial measure, which it defines as net income plus the early extinguishment of lease liability related to the acquisition of Excellence, and restructuring, transition and transaction expenses. Management believes Adjusted Net Income is useful because it provides insight on profitability excluding the impact of non-recurring charges related to our IPO. The Company adjusts net income for the items listed above to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within its industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of the Company's operating performance or liquidity. These measures have limitations as certain excluded items are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDA. The Company's presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income should not be construed as an inference that its results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. The Company's computations of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. For the foregoing reasons, each of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income has significant limitations which affect its use as an indicator of its profitability and valuation, and you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this information.

(NASDAQ: TMUS): This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240226463134/en/Ericsson and T-Mobile Team-up to Help Boost Enterprise 5G Laptop Connectivity and Security (Photo: Business Wire) What’s the news: Ericsson has chosen T-Mobile as the connectivity provider for 5G laptops in its Enterprise Virtual Cellular Network (EVCN) pilot in the U.S. Why it matters: By 2025, an estimated 32.6 million Americans will be working remotely, which equates to about 22% of the workforce. In this world, 5G laptops can eliminate the challenges and security concerns around time consuming VPN configurations and public Wi-Fi, providing a streamlined solution for enterprise IT teams and employees. Who it’s for: Enterprises looking to reduce cybersecurity risks, simplify network IT and give employees an easy way to connect to corporate tools and applications. T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS) today announced that Ericsson has selected T-Mobile as the 5G provider for the first phase of its internal EVCN pilot in the U.S. Under the agreement, T-Mobile will deliver connectivity along with Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) capabilities for employees’ 5G laptops. EVCN is a managed IT service that enables enterprises to have their own 5G virtual network. It makes it easier for enterprise IT teams to bring employees a dependable and secure corporate network connection when working remotely. Let’s face it, organizations with a large percentage of hybrid employees are struggling to ensure ‘work from anywhere’ can happen reliably and securely. Public and even home Wi-Fi networks aren’t always dependable when and where work happens and — most concerning — they can present cyberattack vulnerabilities every time someone clicks ‘join.’ EVCN with T-Mobile is set to help change all of that by automating eSIM profile management, giving enterprises control of the ordering, downloading and activation of eSIM profiles on 5G laptops. This offers enterprises the ability to maintain their own virtual cellular network and connect employee laptops quickly and securely to T-Mobile’s 5G network. T-Mobile SASE + Enterprise 5G = power couple One of the key advantages that T-Mobile brings to Ericsson’s EVCN solution in the U.S. is its groundbreaking SASE solution with T-SIMsecure, delivered through T-Mobile’s Security Slice. This Zero Trust Network Access platform marks the nation’s first SIM-based SASE solution, utilizing International Mobile Subscriber Identity and International Mobile Equipment Identity for clientless authentication. This means that 5G laptops connected to T-Mobile’s network are automatically authorized through the eSIM, further simplifying the work for IT and security teams while delivering improved experiences for employees who are on-the-go. Employees will be automatically connected to the nation’s most awarded 5G network by a simple eSIM profile activation. So, enterprises can be confident that employees are securely connected, whether they’re working from home, a remote workspace or travelling to the U.S. from overseas. “We are excited to be working with T-Mobile to deliver 5G laptops to our employees in the U.S. EVCN provides eSIM management at scale and enables employees to securely connect their 5G laptops to the Ericsson corporate network from virtually anywhere in the U.S.,” said Mats Hultin, CIO and Head of Ericsson Enterprise IT. “This allows us to deliver the best possible employee experience and increases productivity of our hybrid workforce. Together we are reimagining a new reality for hybrid working, with 5G unlocking new possibilities for Enterprises to shape a sustainable future through digitalization and infra light IT architectures.” ""Enterprise IT and security teams are overwhelmed with a growing number of cyberthreats from various vectors. The mobile workforce should not be an additional concern,"" said Mishka Dehghan, SVP, Strategy, Product, and Solutions Engineering, T-Mobile Business Group. ""We’re thrilled to support Ericsson’s EVCN pilot as it’s more critical than ever for businesses and organizations to embrace the latest 5G and SASE innovations to help improve the protection of their networks, applications and information as well as the productivity of their people.""

However, it can impact the stock's liquidity and market perception.From a financial perspective, the increase in the number of shares available for trading can lead to greater stock liquidity. This can be beneficial for existing shareholders who may seek to trade the stock. Conversely, such offerings can dilute the ownership of current shareholders and may lead to short-term price volatility as the market absorbs the additional share supply.Investors should also consider the potential reasons behind the Selling Shareholders' decision to offload a significant stake. It could be interpreted as a lack of confidence in the company's future prospects, or simply a strategic move to realize gains or diversify holdings. The market's reaction to this offering will depend on investor sentiment and the perceived value of GFL's stock. Market Research Analyst The sale of a large block of shares by major investors in GFL Environmental Inc. can serve as a bellwether for industry trends. Investors often look at such transactions to gauge the appetite for environmental services stocks. If the offering is well-received, it could indicate a robust market for similar stocks, potentially attracting more investors to the sector.On the other hand, if the market reacts negatively, it could reflect broader concerns about the sector's growth potential or profitability. This offering may also influence the valuations of peer companies, as market participants reassess the comparative investment appeal within the environmental services industry.It is important to monitor the performance of this offering as it could set a precedent for future equity transactions within the industry. The role of RBC Capital Markets as underwriter is noteworthy, as their involvement suggests a level of confidence in the transaction's success, given their reputation and expertise in capital markets.

(USPH) reported financial highlights for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $77.7 million, Operating Results rose to $36.3 million. Net income was $28.2 million for 2023. The company added 46 new clinics and closed 15 in 2023, raising the total clinic count to 671. Management expects Adjusted EBITDA for 2024 to be in the range of $80 million to $85 million. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in Adjusted EBITDA and Operating Results for U.S. Physical Therapy, Inc. (USPH) indicates a positive operational performance trend year-over-year. While net income saw a decrease, largely due to non-cash impairment charges, the underlying operational metrics such as patient visits and clinic additions are strong. The growth in patient visits and the strategic expansion through acquisitions and de novos reflect a robust demand for USPH's services and an effective growth strategy.However, a slight decrease in the net rate per patient visit and an increase in shares outstanding suggest some pressure on per-share metrics. The dividend rate increase signals confidence by the board in the company's financial health and future prospects. Investors should note the impact of the Medicare rate reduction on future EBITDA growth, as well as the company's focus on rate negotiations and cost efficiencies to mitigate these headwinds. Market Research Analyst The outpatient physical therapy sector is experiencing increased demand, as evidenced by USPH's record-high average daily visits per clinic. The company's ability to grow its clinic count while maintaining operational efficiency is commendable. The strategic closure of underperforming clinics and the addition of new ones through acquisitions and de novos are indicative of a proactive management approach to optimize its clinic portfolio.From a market perspective, the increase in dividends could make USPH's stock more attractive to income-focused investors. Additionally, the company's guidance for 2024 Adjusted EBITDA suggests a positive outlook, despite the challenges posed by Medicare rate reductions. Investors should closely monitor the company's ability to negotiate rates and manage costs, as these factors will be crucial for sustained profitability and market performance. Economist USPH's financial results reflect broader economic trends, including the impact of healthcare policy changes such as Medicare rate adjustments. The company's response to these changes through rate negotiations and volume growth strategies demonstrates adaptability in a shifting economic landscape. The increased patient volumes and clinic additions could be partially attributed to demographic trends, such as an aging population requiring more physical therapy services.Investors should consider the long-term economic implications of healthcare policies on companies like USPH. The ability to successfully navigate these changes and continue to grow in a challenging environment could be a positive indicator of the company's economic resilience and management effectiveness. 02/28/2024 - 04:45 PM Company Provides 2024 Guidance HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- U.S. Physical Therapy, Inc. (“USPH” or the “Company”) (NYSE: USPH), a national operator of outpatient physical therapy clinics and provider of industrial injury prevention services, today reported results for the fourth quarter and the full year ended December 31, 2023.

Operating Results (1), a non-GAAP measure, for Full Year 2023 were $36.3 million, an increase of $1.3 million from $35.0 million for Full Year 2022. On a per share basis, Operating Results were $2.56 in Full Year 2023 compared to $2.70 in Full Year 2022, with the decrease attributable to the increase in shares outstanding associated with the Company’s secondary offering completed in May 2023.

USPH net income for Fourth Quarter 2023 was $0.7 million compared to $2.6 million for Fourth Quarter 2022, including the non-cash impairment charges previously mentioned in both periods. In accordance with GAAP, the revaluation of non-controlling interest, net of taxes, is not included in net income but is charged directly to retained earnings; however, this change is included in the computation of earnings per share. Loss per share for Fourth Quarter 2023 was $0.38 compared to $0.01 for Fourth Quarter 2022. Total net revenue for Fourth Quarter 2023 increased $13.6 million, or 9.6%, to $154.8 million.

Fourth Quarter 2023 gross profit was $30.5 million, a $2.7 million increase from Fourth Quarter 2022.

MANAGEMENT’S COMMENTS Chris Reading, Chief Executive Officer, said, “Our team finished the year strong with record physical therapy volume for each quarter of 2023 as well as the year. Injury prevention also finished the year with some acceleration in both progress and opportunity. Looking forward, we have a great balance sheet bolstered by our capital raise in 2023 and you will see us put that to good use this year attracting more partner-owners looking for a great home for their teams and companies. Our partners across the entirety of our Company make a huge difference for us and for that we are all grateful. While we have been operating in a changing and challenging environment, we have the people and the resources to continue to grow.” Carey Hendrickson, Chief Financial Officer, added, “We have tremendous confidence in our team to produce EBITDA growth in 2024, despite headwinds from the Medicare rate reduction, with continued progress in rate negotiations, growth in volumes at our existing clinics and a continued focus on cost efficiencies. We’ll also benefit from a full year of operations from clinics we acquired in 2023 and a partial year of operations from acquisitions we expect to complete in 2024.” FOURTH QUARTER 2023 VERSUS FOURTH QUARTER 2022 Additional supplemental tables of financial and performance metrics are presented on page 14 of this release.

Net revenue from physical therapy operations increased $11.8 million, or 9.6%, to $134.6 million for the Fourth Quarter 2023 from $122.8 million for the Fourth Quarter 2022. This increase was primarily due to a record-high average daily visits per clinic for a fourth quarter in the Company’s history of 29.9 visits, and an increase in volume from the 31 net new clinics added since the comparable prior year period, partially offset by a decrease in net rate per patient visit. The number of patient visits increased 10.0% over the Fourth Quarter 2022, with visits at mature clinics up 2.2%. Net rate per patient visit was $103.68 for the Fourth Quarter 2023, sequentially improving from $102.03 in the second quarter of 2023 and $102.37 in the third quarter of 2023. This compares to a $104.28 net rate per patient visit in the Fourth Quarter 2022. The decrease in net rate in the Fourth Quarter 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily due to the combined Medicare rate reductions in 2022 and 2023. All other payor categories increased 2.1% on a combined basis as compared to the prior year. Operating costs from physical therapy operations increased $10.1 million, or 10.3%, to $108.4 million in the Fourth Quarter 2023 from $98.2 million in the Fourth Quarter 2022 driven by costs associated with the 31 net new clinics since the comparable prior year period as well as increased patient visits at mature clinics. Salaries and related costs per visit decreased to $59.72 in the Fourth Quarter 2023 from $60.04 in the Fourth Quarter 2022 while total operating costs per visit was roughly flat at $84.09 as compared to $84.05 over the same periods, respectively. Operating costs for mature clinics increased $2.4 million, or 2.7%, in the Fourth Quarter 2023 as compared to the Fourth Quarter 2022. Gross profit from physical therapy operations in the Fourth Quarter 2023 increased $1.7 million, or 7.0%, to $26.2 million from $24.5 million in the Fourth Quarter 2022.

The gross profit margin from IIP operations increased to 21.2% in the Fourth Quarter 2023 from 17.9% in the Fourth Quarter 2022. Corporate Office and Other Expenses Corporate costs increased $2.0 million, or 16.6%, to $13.9 million in the Fourth Quarter 2023 from $11.9 million in Fourth Quarter 2022 with an increase in support costs related to the larger number of clinics and the timing of certain expenses. A non-cash impairment charge of $17.5 million was recognized during the Fourth Quarter 2023 related to a reporting unit in the Company’s IIP segment. This compares to a $9.1 million non-cash impairment charge in the comparable prior year period related to the same reporting unit. Operating loss was $0.9 million for the Fourth Quarter 2023 compared to operating income of $6.8 million for the Fourth Quarter 2022.

The revaluation of a put-right liability resulted in $2.9 million of income (a decrease in the related liability) for the Fourth Quarter 2023 compared to $0.8 million of expense (an increase in the related liability) for the Fourth Quarter 2022. The put-right, which expires in November 2026, relates to the potential future purchase of a company that provides physical therapy and rehabilitation services to hospitals and other ancillary providers in a distinct market area. The provision for income taxes was $1.4 million in the Fourth Quarter 2023 compared to $1.2 million during the Fourth Quarter 2022. USPH Net Income and Non-GAAP Measures Net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest (temporary and permanent) was $1.9 million in the Fourth Quarter 2023 compared to ($0.7) million in the Fourth Quarter 2022. USPH net income was $0.7 million for the Fourth Quarter 2023 as compared to $2.6 million for the Fourth Quarter 2022 while loss per share was $0.38 and $0.01 over the same periods, respectively. USPH net income included a non-cash impairment charge, prior to allocation to minority interest and income taxes, of $17.5 million in the Fourth Quarter 2023 ($9.1 million net of $5.2 million allocated to minority interest and $3.1 million of income tax) and $9.1 million in the Fourth Quarter 2022 ($4.7 million net of $2.7 million allocated to minority interest and $1.6 million of income tax).

The increase in both non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Operating Results was primarily associated with clinic additions since the comparable prior year period and increased volume at mature clinics. See pages 12 and 13 of this release for the definition and reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Operating Results to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. FULL YEAR 2023 VERSUS FULL YEAR 2022 Total net revenue for the Full Year 2023 increased $51.7 million, or 9.3%, to $604.8 million from $553.1 million for the Full Year 2022 while operating costs increased $42.2 million, or 9.6%, to $483.3 million from $441.1 million over the same periods, respectively. Gross profit for the Full Year 2023 was $121.5 million, or 20.1% of net revenue, compared to $112.0 million for the Full Year 2022, or 20.3% of net revenue. Revenues from physical therapy operations increased $50.5 million, or 10.6%, to $526.5 million in Full Year 2023 compared to $476.1 million in Full Year 2022. This increase was primarily due to a record-high average daily visits per clinic for a full year in the Company’s history of 30.0 visits, and an increase in volume from the 31 net new clinics added since the comparable prior year period, partially offset by a decrease in net rate per patient visit to $102.80 for Full Year 2023 from $103.63 for Full Year 2022. Gross profit from physical therapy operations increased $9.0 million, or 9.4%, to $105.1 million for Full Year 2023 from $96.1 million for Full Year 2022 while the gross profit margin from physical therapy operations decreased slightly to 20.0% for Full Year 2023 from 20.2% for Full Year 2022.

Corporate office costs were $52.0 million, or 8.6% of net revenue, in Full Year 2023, compared to $46.1 million, or 8.3% of net revenue, in Full Year 2022, with an increase in support costs related to the larger number of clinics. Operating income was $52.1 million for Full Year 2023 compared to $56.8 million for Full Year 2022, including the non-cash impairment charge of $17.5 million in Full Year 2023 and $9.1 million in Full Year 2022. Other expenses increased $1.5 million to $2.7 million in 2023 from $1.2 million in 2022 primarily due to higher interest expense and expense related to fair value adjustments of certain contingent liabilities partially offset by income related to the revaluation of a put liability and interest income from investing excess cash associated with proceeds from the Company’s secondary offering completed in May 2023. The provision for income tax was $12.2 million for Full Year 2023 and for Full Year 2022. The effective tax rate was 30.1% and 27.4% over the same periods, respectively. The Full Year 2023 includes an adjustment of $1.0 million related to the return to provision analysis for such period. USPH net income was $28.2 million for the Full Year 2023 as compared to $32.2 million for the Full Year 2022 while earnings per share was $1.28 for Full Year 2023 compared to $2.25 for Full Year 2022.

Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA increased $4.1 million to $77.7 million for Full Year 2023 from $73.7 million in Full Year 2022 while non-GAAP Operating Results increased $1.2 million to $36.3 million, or $2.56 per share, in Full Year 2023 from $35.0 million, or $2.70 per share, in the Full Year 2022. The increase in both non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Operating Results was primarily associated with clinic additions since the comparable prior year period and increased volume at mature clinics. See pages 12 and 13 of this release for the definition and reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Operating Results to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. For additional information on full year 2023 results, please refer to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K which is expected to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 29, 2024. BALANCE SHEET AND CASH FLOW Total cash and cash equivalents were $152.8 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $31.6 million as of December 31, 2022. Additionally, the Company had $144.4 million of outstanding borrowings and $175.0 million in available credit under its credit facilities as of December 31, 2023, compared to $179.1 million of outstanding borrowings and $144.0 million in available credit under its credit facilities as of December 31, 2022. On May 30, 2023, the Company completed a secondary offering of its common stock resulting in net proceeds of $163.6 million after deducting fees associated with the transaction. A portion of the net proceeds was used to repay the $35.0 million then outstanding under the Company’s credit facility while the remainder is expected to be used primarily for acquisitions. The Company’s cash is currently invested in a high-yield savings account which generated interest income of approximately $3.8 million in 2023. ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES The Company is in various stages of completing several acquisitions that management expects to close in or shortly after the first half of 2024. The Company’s strategy is to continue acquiring outpatient physical therapy practices, develop outpatient physical therapy clinics as satellites in existing partnerships, and continue acquiring companies that provide or serve the Company’s industrial injury prevention services. QUARTERLY DIVIDEND The Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly dividend on February 27, 2024, from $0.43 per share to $0.44 per share. The Board of Directors subsequently declared a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share payable on April 5, 2024, to shareholders of record on March 12, 2024. 2024 EARNINGS GUIDANCE Management expects the Company’s Adjusted EBITDA for 2024 to be in the range of $80 million to $85 million. The previously announced Medicare rate reduction of approximately 3.5% effective January 1, 2024, is expected to reduce the Company’s revenue by approximately $6.0 million in 2024 as compared to 2023, which equates to an EBITDA reduction of approximately $5.3 million net of non-controlling interests. Management expects to more than offset the decreases in revenue and EBITDA related to the Medicare rate reduction from: the full-year impact of rate negotiations in commercial and other payor categories completed during 2023 the partial-year impact of rate negotiations in commercial and other payor categories expected to be completed during 2024 volume increases at the Company’s existing clinics continued discipline in expense control full-year contribution from acquisitions completed in 2023; and, partial-year impact of EBITDA from acquisitions expected to be completed during or shortly after the first half of 2024. As noted previously, the Company is currently in the process of completing several acquisitions that are expected to close in or shortly after the first half of 2024. The guidance range includes the expected EBITDA contribution from such acquisitions. The annual guidance figures will not be updated unless there is a material development that causes management to believe that Adjusted EBITDA will be significantly outside the given range.

S. PHYSICAL THERAPY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES ADJUSTED EBITDA AND OPERATING RESULTS (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS) The following tables provide details of the basic and diluted earnings per share computation and reconcile net income attributable to USPH shareholders calculated in accordance with GAAP to Adjusted EBITDA and Operating Results (non-GAAP measures). Management believes providing Adjusted EBITDA and Operating Results to investors is useful information for comparing the Company's period-to-period results. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, is defined as net income attributable to USPH shareholders before interest income, interest expense, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash asset impairment charge, change in fair value of contingent earn-out consideration, Relief Funds, changes in revaluation of put-right liability, equity-based awards compensation expense, and related portions for non-controlling interests. Operating Results, a non-GAAP measure, equals net income attributable to USPH shareholders less non-cash asset impairment charge, changes in revaluation of put-right liability, Relief Funds, changes in fair value of contingent earn-out consideration, and any allocations to non-controlling interests, all net of taxes. Operating Results per share also exclude the impact of the revaluation of redeemable non-controlling interest and the associated tax impact. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Operating Results, which eliminate certain items described above that can be subject to volatility and unusual costs, as the principal measures to evaluate and monitor financial performance period over period. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Operating Results are useful measures for investors to use in comparing the Company's period-to-period results as well as for comparing with other similar businesses since most do not have redeemable instruments and therefore have different equity structures. Adjusted EBITDA and Operating Results are not measures of financial performance under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Operating Results should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or substitute for, net income attributable to USPH shareholders presented in the consolidated financial statements.

This move, while resulting in a 22.1% year-over-year decrease in revenue, may suggest a focus on more profitable or strategic areas of the business. The increase in average revenue per customer to $610,000 is a positive sign of customer value growth.The net loss reduction from $41.7 million to $40.5 million year-over-year, coupled with a significant improvement in adjusted operating loss from $16.1 million to $4.0 million, reflects better operational efficiency. However, the substantial decrease in cash from $391.8 million to $210.8 million raises concerns about liquidity and cash burn, which could impact the company's ability to invest in growth initiatives or weather economic downturns.The forward-looking guidance suggests a continued revenue decline but an improvement in adjusted EBITDA, indicating that the company is expecting to improve profitability margins. This outlook will be critical for investor sentiment as it balances revenue declines with profitability improvements. Market Research Analyst LivePerson's operational focus on product integration and orchestration capabilities, as mentioned by the CEO, aligns with the increasing market demand for comprehensive digital customer interaction solutions. The company's confidence in a multi-billion dollar market opportunity and the signing of 62 deals, including three seven-figure deals, signals potential for growth in market share.The strategic partnerships in Southeast Asia and with a leading personal loan provider could open new revenue streams and diversify the client base geographically and across sectors. The expansion and renewal of contracts with several financial services companies suggest a strong customer retention strategy, which is vital for sustainable growth.However, the revenue guidance for 2024 shows a planned year-over-year decrease, which may reflect market saturation, increased competition, or a conservative approach due to macroeconomic conditions. The emphasis on B2B Core recurring revenue, expected to represent 92% of total revenue, reinforces the company's shift towards a more predictable and stable revenue model. Legal Expert LivePerson's financial report includes a significant amount of non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating loss. These measures exclude several expenses like stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles, which can provide investors with a view of the company's operational performance excluding non-cash and one-time costs. However, it's important to consider the GAAP measures as well, as they provide a complete picture of the company's financial health.The lack of quantitative reconciliation for forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures due to unpredictability highlights the inherent uncertainties in forecasting. This serves as a reminder to stakeholders of the potential volatility and unpredictability of future financial outcomes. 02/28/2024 - 04:30 PM -- Total Revenue of $95.5M, above the midpoint of our guidance range -- -- Adjusted EBITDA above the midpoint of our guidance range -- NEW YORK, Feb. 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- LivePerson, Inc. (NASDAQ: LPSN) (""LivePerson"" the ""Company"", ""we"" or ""us""), the enterprise leader in digital customer conversations, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023. Fourth Quarter Highlights Total revenue was $95.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, above the midpoint of our prior guidance and a decrease of 22.1% as compared to the same period last year driven by our exit of lower-margin and non-core business lines. LivePerson signed 62 deals in total for the fourth quarter, consisting of 16 new and 46 existing customer contracts, including 3 seven-figure deals. Trailing-twelve-months average revenue per enterprise and mid-market customer increased 11.9% for the fourth quarter to $610,000, up from approximately $545,000 for the comparable prior-year period. Beginning with the second quarter of 2022, in order to provide a more consistent and meaningful measure of ARPC, we started calculating this metric using only B2B Core recurring revenue, which is consistent with the revenue base for calculating Net Revenue Retention. ""This is a critical time in LivePerson's history, and I'm honored to be leading the company through its transformation by driving results through improved commercial and operational execution,"" said CEO John Sabino. ""There is a multi-billion dollar market opportunity ahead of us as we execute on our go-to-market strategy, lean into our product's integration and orchestration capabilities, and strengthen our capital structure. I am excited to share that these operational initiatives are already underway, and I am confident they will place LivePerson on a path to profitable growth."" ""I'm excited to partner with John on the path ahead and I share the board's confidence in his leadership,"" said CFO and COO John Collins. ""The rapid growth in our market, coupled with repeated validation of our product by customers, investors, and third party research, makes it clear that LivePerson has a compelling growth opportunity following the rebuild of its sales and customer success motion.""

Adjusted operating loss, a non-GAAP financial metric, for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $4.0 million, as compared to a $16.1 million adjusted operating loss for the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted operating loss excludes amortization of purchased intangibles and finance leases, stock-based compensation expense, other litigation, consulting and other employee costs, restructuring costs, impairment of goodwill, impairment of intangibles and other assets, gain on divestiture, leadership transition costs, contingent earn-out adjustments, IT transformation costs, acquisition and divestiture costs, interest (income) expense, and other (income) expense. Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $3.7 million as compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $5.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA excludes amortization of purchased intangibles and finance leases, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation, other litigation, consulting and other employee costs, restructuring costs, impairment of goodwill, impairment of intangibles and other assets, leadership transition costs, IT transformation costs, gain on divestiture, contingent earn-out adjustments, provision for income taxes, acquisition and divestiture costs, interest (income) expense, and other (income) expense. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures has been provided in the financial tables included in this press release. An explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures and how they are calculated is included below under the heading ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures."" Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company's cash balance was $210.8 million at December 31, 2023, as compared to $391.8 million at December 31, 2022. Financial Expectations The following forward-looking measures and the underlying assumptions involve significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary materially from these forward-looking measures. The Company does not present a quantitative reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures (or otherwise present such forward-looking GAAP measures) because it is impractical to forecast certain items without unreasonable efforts due to the uncertainty and inherent difficulty of predicting, within a reasonable range, the occurrence and financial impact of and the periods in which such items may be recognized. In particular, these non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items, including amortization of purchased intangibles and finance leases, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation, other litigation, consulting and other employee costs, restructuring costs, impairment of goodwill, impairment of intangibles and other assets, leadership transition costs, gain on divestiture, contingent earn-out adjustments, provision for income taxes, IT transformation costs, acquisition and divestiture costs, interest (income) expense, and other (income) expense, which depend on future events that the Company is unable to predict. Depending on the size of these items, they could have a significant impact on the Company's GAAP financial results. For the full year 2024, we expect total revenue to range from $300M - $315M or (24)% to (20)% year over year (excluding $7.2M of Kasamba revenue generated in Q1 2023).

For the first quarter, we expect total revenue to range from $79M - $83M or (21)% to (17)% year over year (excluding $7.2M of Kasamba revenue generated in Q1 2023).

The Tanyard Zone is a new diatreme breccia zone discovered 150 m south of the historic Brewer Breccia. The Tanyard Zone was discovered in drill hole B21C-015 in 2021, which intersected 62.4 m of 1.03 g/t Au and 0.15% Cu from 44.6 m (see news release dated 24 November, 2021).Drill results for B23C-021 include: 9.5 m @ 0.36 g/t Au from 55.0 m10.5 m @ 0.42 g/t Au from 76.0 m62.5 m @ 8.45 g/t Au from 111.5 m Inc. 16.3 m @ 2.83 g/t Au and 1.0% Cu from 132.0 mAnd 2.5 m @ 168.72 g/t from 170.5 mIntercepts based on minimum 4.0 m @ >0.3 g/t Au are uncut and allows for 3 m of internal dilutionLayton Croft, President and CEO, stated: ""Hole 21 is the most significant hole that we've drilled at Brewer to date. To report these results on the heels of a re-negotiated option agreement, in which we have nearly seven years to explore the property on a no-cost basis, is game-changing for the project and our company.""Patrick Quigley, Senior Geologist and Exploration Manager, stated: ""We are thrilled to release the results of hole 21, which includes the highest gold grades ever reported at Brewer. These results demonstrate the significance of the newly discovered Tanyard Zone, which remains open in all directions. To make a near-surface discovery a stone's throw from the former mine is testament to how underexplored the Brewer property is.""The Tanyard Breccia Zone: At surface, the Tanyard Zone consists of a sequence of thin-bedded, highly altered, mainly fine grain sedimentary and volcanoclastic sediments. The sequence was folded into an east-west trending syncline that is exposed for about 1.0 km. The sequence is interpreted to rest unconformably upon the quartz-pyrophyllite altered felsic volcanoclastic rocks which host the main Brewer Breccia. The Tanyard Breccia was intercepted at depth below the Tanyard sequence and is believed to be similar to the Brewer Breccia, with the exception of containing very high-grade gold - telluride mineralization in addition to copper-gold mineralization identified in Drill Hole 21. The Tanyard sequence may represent the upper expression of a Maar Diatreme that was generated with the Tanyard Breccia. Geology, alteration mapping, and induced polarization results indicate that the Brewer and Tanyard breccias are part of a large, +2.0 km diameter diatreme breccia complex, possibly overlying a copper-gold porphyry system.Figure 1: Geology Map with Drill HolesTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/5156/199740_44c725aad49fd9e4_003full.jpgFigure 2: Cross section showing hole 21 and 15To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/5156/199740_44c725aad49fd9e4_004full.jpgTable 1: Drill Results for Hole 21Hole IDFrom (m)To (m)Interval (m)Au (g/t)Cu (%)B23C-02155.0064.509.500.36<0.1076.0086.5010.500.420.16Including76.0080.154.150.660.35111.50174.0062.508.450.28Including132.70149.0016.302.831.00And170.50173.002.50168.72<0.10Including170.50171.501.00372.00<0.10 Reported intervals are composited based on minimum 4.0 m width @ >0.3 g/t Au are uncut and allows for 3 m of internal dilution.Figure 3: Plan Map showing Chargeability at 50 m ElevationTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/5156/199740_44c725aad49fd9e4_005full.jpgAdditional Drill Results Pending: Results are also pending for hole 23, drilled ~ 100m east of the Tanyard Zone to test a geochemical anomaly, hole 25, drilled ~ 100m west of the Tanyard Zone to test an IP anomaly, and hole 24, drilled ~ 350 meters west of the former mine to test a geophysical target. Quality Assurance and Quality Control StatementThe Company's 2023-2024 exploration diamond core drilling was HQ and/or NQ size. The core was logged and marked for sampling and assaying by geologists contracted by Rush. Samples, typically 1.5 meters in length, were sawn in half using a diamond core saw and one-half of the core was placed in sample bags and tagged with unique sample numbers, while the remaining half was kept in the core box for storage. Each bagged core sample was shipped to ALS Laboratory in Twin Falls, ID where it was dried, crushed and pulverized to >80% passing -200 mesh. Gold was analyzed by fire assay (30 g) with an AA (atomic absorption) finish (method Au-AA23) with detection limits of 0.005 g/t gold. Samples containing greater than 10.0 g/t gold are analyzed by fire assay with a gravimetric finish (method Au-GRA21). Multielement analyses were analyzed with ICP-MS following a four-acid digestion (method ME-MS61) and samples containing >1.0% copper are analyzed via method Cu-OG62. Strict sampling and QA/QC protocols are followed, and assay integrity is monitored internally with a quality control program including the insertion of gold standards and blanks in the sample stream on a regular basis.Qualified PersonThe technical information in this news release has been prepared in accordance with Canadian regulatory requirements as set out in NI 43-101 and reviewed and approved by Patrick Quigley, MSc, CPG-12116, a Qualified Person as defined by NI 43-101.About Carolina RushCarolina Rush Corporation (TSXV: RUSH) (OTCQB: PUCCF) is exploring the Carolina Terrane in the southeastern USA.

Quaker Houghton Announces Quarterly Dividend and $150 Million Stock Repurchase Authorization,2024-02-28T21:30:00.000Z,Low,Negative,Quaker Houghton (KWR) announces a quarterly cash dividend of $0.455 per share and a new $150 million share repurchase program. CEO Andy Tometich emphasizes long-term growth opportunities and value enhancement for shareholders.,"Quaker Houghton Announces Quarterly Dividend and $150 Million Stock Repurchase Authorization Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags buyback dividends Rhea-AI Summary Quaker Houghton (KWR) announces a quarterly cash dividend of $0.455 per share and a new $150 million share repurchase program. CEO Andy Tometich emphasizes long-term growth opportunities and value enhancement for shareholders. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Quaker Houghton's new share repurchase program represents a significant capital allocation decision that could influence investor perception and the company's capital structure. Share repurchase programs are often interpreted as a signal of management's confidence in the company's future performance and valuation. By allocating $150 million towards buying back its own shares, Quaker Houghton is effectively communicating its belief that the stock is undervalued or that it is an optimal use of its cash resources to enhance shareholder value.In the short term, this action may lead to an increase in the company's earnings per share (EPS) by reducing the number of shares outstanding, which can have a positive effect on the stock price. However, investors should consider the opportunity cost of this capital deployment. The funds used for repurchasing shares could have been invested in growth opportunities, acquisitions, or debt reduction. It's crucial to evaluate whether the repurchase program is the best use of capital in terms of return on investment compared to alternative uses.Furthermore, the method of the share repurchase, whether through open market transactions or privately negotiated deals, can also have implications. For instance, open market repurchases can provide ongoing support for the stock price, while block trades could lead to a more immediate impact. The timing and scale of the repurchases, subject to market conditions and company discretion, will also play a role in the financial outcome of this program. Market Research Analyst Quaker Houghton's decision to initiate a share repurchase program must be contextualized within the broader market and industry trends. Share repurchases have been a common practice among companies seeking to return capital to shareholders, especially in industries that generate significant cash flow. The move can be perceived as a mechanism to optimize the balance sheet, especially when the company's management believes its shares are trading below their intrinsic value.An analysis of the company's past performance, industry position and competitive landscape is essential to understand the potential impact of this program. If Quaker Houghton operates in a mature industry with limited growth prospects, the repurchase program could be a prudent way to utilize excess cash. On the other hand, if the industry is experiencing rapid growth, it might raise questions about potential missed investment opportunities.Additionally, the market's reaction to such announcements can be influenced by the current economic climate, investor sentiment and the company's financial health. In times of economic uncertainty or market volatility, share repurchases can provide a stabilizing effect on the stock price. However, if the market perceives the action as a lack of viable growth avenues, it could have an adverse effect. Economist The macroeconomic environment plays a crucial role in the effectiveness and reception of share repurchase programs. In a low-interest-rate environment, companies may favor buybacks as a method of shareholder return due to the relatively low cost of borrowing. Conversely, in a scenario of rising interest rates, the opportunity cost of repurchasing shares increases, as companies could allocate capital towards higher-yielding investments or debt reduction.Quaker Houghton's strategy to fund the repurchases using cash on hand and expected free cash flow suggests a strong liquidity position and confidence in future cash generation capabilities. This approach could be favorable in maintaining financial flexibility without increasing leverage. However, it is important to monitor the company's cash flow projections and ensure that they are not overly optimistic, which could lead to liquidity issues if the expected cash flows do not materialize.Additionally, the economic outlook can influence the timing and method of repurchases. During economic expansions, companies may be more aggressive in repurchasing shares, while during downturns, a more cautious approach might be warranted. The company's statement regarding compliance with debt and other agreements is also a critical factor, as maintaining a healthy debt-to-equity ratio is important for financial stability. 02/28/2024 - 04:30 PM CONSHOHOCKEN, Pa., Feb. 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The Board of Directors of Quaker Houghton (NYSE: KWR) today declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.455 per share, payable on April 30, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 16, 2024. In addition, the Board of Directors has approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to an aggregate of $150 million of its common stock. The Company has terminated its prior 2015 share repurchase program. Andy Tometich, Chief Executive Officer and President, commented, ""We are excited by the long-term growth opportunities for Quaker Houghton and are committed to enhancing value for our shareholders. Our balanced capital allocation strategy remains, and we will maintain a disciplined approach to capital deployment with a priority towards our dividend and growth investments."" The Company is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock from time to time through various methods, including in open market transactions, block trades, accelerated share repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, derivative transactions or otherwise, certain of which may be made pursuant to a trading plan meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, in compliance with applicable state and federal securities laws. The timing, as well as the number and value of shares repurchased under the program, will be determined by the Company at its discretion and will depend on a variety of factors, including our assessment of the intrinsic value of the Company's common stock, the market price of the Company's common stock, general market and economic conditions, available liquidity, compliance with the Company's debt and other agreements, applicable legal requirements, the nature of other investment opportunities available to the Company, and other considerations. The Company is not obligated to purchase any shares under the repurchase program, and the program may be suspended, modified, or discontinued at any time without prior notice. The Company expects to fund the repurchases by using cash on hand and expected free cash flow to be generated in the future. Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains ""forward-looking statements"" that fall under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. We have based these forward-looking statements on assumptions, projections and expectations about future events that we believe are reasonable based on currently available information,, including statements regarding the potential effects of the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East; inflation and global supply chain constraints on the Company's business, results of operations, and financial condition; our expectation that we will maintain sufficient liquidity and remain in compliance with the terms of the Company's credit facility; expectations about future demand and raw material costs; and statements regarding the impact of increased raw material costs and pricing initiatives.

A major risk is that demand for the Company's products and services is largely derived from the demand for its customers' products, which subjects the Company to uncertainties related to downturns in a customer's business and unanticipated customer production slowdowns and shutdowns, including as is currently being experienced by many automotive industry companies as a result of supply chain disruptions. Other major risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to inflationary pressures, including the potential for continued significant increases in raw material costs; supply chain disruptions; customer financial instability; rising interest rates and the possibility of economic recession; economic and political disruptions, including the impacts of the military conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and Hamas; tariffs, trade restrictions, and the economic and other sanctions imposed by other nations on Russia and/or other government organizations; suspensions of activities in Russia by many multinational companies and the potential expansion of military activity; foreign currency fluctuations; significant changes in applicable tax rates and regulations; future terrorist attacks and other acts of violence; the impacts of consolidation in our industry, including loss or consolidation of a major customer; and the potential occurrence of cyber-security breaches, cyber-security attacks and other security incidents. Furthermore, the Company is subject to the same business cycles as those experienced by our customers in the steel, automobile, aircraft, industrial equipment, aluminum and durable goods industries. Our forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about the Company and its operations that are subject to change based on various important factors, some of which are beyond our control. These risks, uncertainties, and possible inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results.

Declares Quarterly Dividend Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary ESSA Bancorp, Inc. declares a dividend of $0.15 per share, payable to shareholders of record as of March 15, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a dividend by ESSA Bancorp, Inc. is a reflection of the company's current financial health and its ability to generate adequate cash flow. Dividends are typically distributed to shareholders when a company has surplus earnings and wishes to reward its shareholders. In this case, a dividend of $0.15 per share indicates that the company is confident in its financial stability and profitability.Investors often view regular dividends as a sign of a company's reliability and may use dividend yield as a key metric when evaluating the attractiveness of a stock. The announcement of a dividend can also have implications for the stock's price, as it may lead to an increase in demand for the stock by income-focused investors. However, it is essential to consider the dividend payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends to shareholders. A high payout ratio could signal that the company is not reinvesting enough in its own growth, which might be a concern for long-term value growth. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the announcement of a dividend can be indicative of a company's sector performance. Financial institutions like ESSA Bancorp, Inc. that manage to sustain or increase dividends may be seen as stable by the market, especially in an industry where interest rates and regulatory changes can significantly impact profitability. The timing of the dividend announcement is also crucial as it can affect investor sentiment during specific market cycles.It is also important to analyze the dividend in the context of the company's historical dividend policy and how it compares to its peers. Consistency in dividend payments or increases can be a positive sign to investors who prioritize steady income streams. Conversely, if competitors are offering higher dividend yields or if there is a significant change in dividend policy, it could influence investor preference and capital flows within the sector. 02/28/2024 - 04:31 PM STROUDSBURG, PA / ACCESSWIRE / February 28, 2024 / ESSA Bancorp, Inc.

(MIST) announces the commencement of an underwritten public offering of common shares and pre-funded warrants to certain investors. The company aims to use the net proceeds for the development of etripamil in cardiovascular indications and general corporate purposes.,"Milestone Pharmaceuticals Announces Proposed Public Offering of Common Shares and Pre-Funded Warrants Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Milestone Pharmaceuticals Inc. (MIST) announces the commencement of an underwritten public offering of common shares and pre-funded warrants to certain investors. The company aims to use the net proceeds for the development of etripamil in cardiovascular indications and general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The commencement of an underwritten public offering by Milestone Pharmaceuticals is a strategic move that could potentially bring in significant capital to the company. The offering includes both common shares and pre-funded warrants, which indicates a flexible approach to attract a broad range of investors. By granting underwriters a 30-day option to purchase additional shares, the company also hedges against immediate over-supply, potentially stabilizing the stock price post-offering.Investors and analysts will be closely monitoring the success of this offering, as it could influence Milestone's financial stability and its ability to fund ongoing projects. The use of proceeds for the development of etripamil for PSVT and AFib-RVR suggests a focused strategy on advancing its pipeline, which could, in the long run, enhance shareholder value if the clinical outcomes are positive. The market's reaction to this offering will be telling of investor confidence in Milestone's growth prospects. Medical Research Analyst Etripamil, the drug in development for PSVT and AFib-RVR, represents a significant part of Milestone's value proposition. As a non-invasive, patient-administered nasal spray, it could offer a differentiated approach to managing these cardiac conditions, which currently have limited treatment options. The success of etripamil in clinical trials could disrupt the cardiovascular treatment market.Investors should understand that drug development is inherently risky and the allocation of proceeds from the offering to etripamil's development underscores the importance of its clinical success to Milestone's future. The potential market size for PSVT and AFib-RVR treatments and the competitive landscape will be key factors in determining the long-term return on this investment. Market Research Analyst The decision by Milestone to engage in a public offering is indicative of a broader trend within the biopharmaceutical industry, where companies often rely on capital markets to fund research and development. The structure of the offering, including common shares and pre-funded warrants, is designed to appeal to a diverse investor base, which may include both institutional investors and retail investors.Market conditions at the time of the offering will heavily influence its success. Factors such as current interest rates, investor sentiment towards the biopharmaceutical sector and overall market volatility play crucial roles. The involvement of Piper Sandler & Co. as the sole bookrunning manager indicates Milestone's intent to leverage the firm's expertise and investor network to ensure the offering's success. 02/28/2024 - 04:37 PM MONTREAL and CHARLOTTE, N.C., Feb. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Milestone® Pharmaceuticals Inc.

Management will decide the timing, method, and price based on various factors, with an expiration date of December 31, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of a new share repurchase program by The First Bancshares, Inc. is a significant move that warrants a closer look from a financial perspective. Share repurchase programs are often instituted by companies seeking to return value to shareholders, as they can help to increase earnings per share and return on equity by reducing the number of shares outstanding. Furthermore, it can be a signal of management's confidence in the company's financial health and future prospects.From an investor's standpoint, the $50 million allocation for repurchases represents a commitment to shareholder value but must be weighed against other potential uses of capital such as investment in growth opportunities or debt reduction. The discretionary nature of the program allows the company flexibility in timing and execution, which can be advantageous in managing market conditions and optimizing the repurchase price. However, investors should monitor the implementation of this program as aggressive buybacks could potentially strain the company's cash reserves or divert funds from other strategic initiatives. Market Research Analyst Assessing the impact of The First Bancshares' share repurchase program on the market requires an understanding of the current banking industry landscape. In the context of a competitive banking sector, share buybacks can be a tool for adjusting capital structure and potentially improving return metrics. It is also indicative of the company's strategic priorities and financial management approach.One must consider the broader economic conditions, including interest rate trends and regulatory changes, which could influence the timing and effectiveness of share repurchases. If executed during a period of undervaluation, the buyback could be beneficial for the stock price. Conversely, if market conditions deteriorate, the repurchase program might be viewed as less favorable. It is also essential to evaluate the company's performance relative to its peers to determine if the repurchase program aligns with industry norms or represents an outlier. Legal Expert In the context of a share repurchase program, legal and regulatory considerations play a critical role. The First Bancshares must navigate the rules set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding buybacks, including disclosure requirements and anti-manipulation rules. The company's statement that repurchases will be subject to applicable legal and regulatory requirements indicates an awareness of these constraints.It is important for investors to note that the company's management will have to carefully plan repurchases to avoid potential legal pitfalls, such as insider trading regulations. The legal framework is designed to protect investors and the integrity of the market and adherence to these regulations is crucial for the success of the repurchase program and maintaining investor confidence. 02/28/2024 - 04:30 PM HATTIESBURG, Miss.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The First Bancshares, Inc. (NASDAQ: FBMS) (“First Bancshares” or the “Company”), the holding company for The First Bank, announced today that the Company’s board of directors has approved a new share repurchase program for the 2024 calendar year.

The actual timing and method of any purchases, the target number of shares and the maximum price (or range of prices) under the program, will be determined by management at its discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of the Company's common stock, general market and economic conditions, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. The new share repurchase program has an expiration date of December 31, 2024, and is effectively a renewal of the Company’s 2024 share repurchase program. About The First Bancshares, Inc.

(INN) reported an operating income of $58.8 million for full year 2023. Adjusted EBITDAre increased by 5.1% to $190.0 million, with Adjusted FFO per share at $0.92. The company achieved RevPAR growth of 6.6%, outperforming the industry by 170 basis points. With strategic asset sales, the company recycled proceeds into high-quality hotels in high-growth markets. A new $200 million term loan financing was completed, extending debt maturities until 2026. Despite a net loss, the company increased its common dividend by 50% in 2023. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The disclosed financial results of Summit Hotel Properties, Inc. reveal several key metrics that are essential for assessing the company's performance and future prospects. The reported Operating Income of $58.8 million for the full year 2023, coupled with the 5.1% increase in Adjusted EBITDAre to $190.0 million, suggest operational efficiency and a growing ability to generate earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent/restructuring costs. These figures, however, must be contextualized within the broader industry performance and the company's historical data to understand their significance fully. The Adjusted FFO Per Share of $0.92 is a critical measure for real estate investment trusts (REITs), as it indicates the company's ability to generate cash flows from its operations. A year-over-year comparison with the Adjusted FFO of $0.94 per diluted share and unit in the previous year suggests a slight decline, which could be a point of concern for investors looking for growth in distributable earnings. Furthermore, the company's strategy of accretive dispositions and reinvestment into high-quality hotels suggests an active management approach to portfolio optimization. The sale of two additional hotels and the acquisition of others in high-growth markets at favorable capitalization rates demonstrate the company's agility in capitalizing on market opportunities. The completion of a $200 million term loan financing and the extension of debt maturity dates to 2026 enhance the company's financial stability and reduce near-term refinancing risk. The maintenance of a weighted average cost of debt at approximately 4.75 percent and the fixed interest rate on 80 percent of the balance sheet are prudent measures in a volatile interest rate environment. These actions, along with the company's liquidity position, provide flexibility and a buffer against market fluctuations, which is particularly relevant given the uncertain macroeconomic conditions. Market Research Analyst Summit Hotel Properties' performance indicators, such as the 6.6 percent RevPAR growth which outpaced the industry, highlight the company's competitive advantage in the market, especially in urban areas. This outperformance is a testament to the strategic positioning of the company's assets and the effectiveness of its operational strategies. The emphasis on urban hotels, which have shown strong performance, indicates a targeted approach to asset selection that aligns with market demand trends. The company's outlook for 2024 appears positive, with expectations of continued growth in urban markets. This forward-looking statement suggests confidence in the company's ability to maintain its competitive edge. However, it is important for investors to consider the potential risks associated with relying heavily on specific market segments, as any downturn in urban hospitality demand could disproportionately affect the company. Additionally, the capital expenditures forecasted for FYE 2024, ranging from $65 million to $85 million, reflect ongoing investments in the company's properties, which could enhance long-term asset value but also impact short-term cash flows. It's also noteworthy that the company's strategic capital recycling program, which involves selling and reinvesting in different assets, is indicative of an active approach to portfolio management. This strategy can lead to a more optimized asset base and improved returns over time. The reported capitalization rates on both disposals and acquisitions provide insight into the investment yield the company is achieving, which is valuable information for investors assessing the company's asset management proficiency. Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) Analyst The financial results from Summit Hotel Properties need to be evaluated from a REIT perspective, focusing on metrics that are specific to the real estate sector. The Adjusted Funds From Operations (FFO), which offers a clearer picture of the company's performance by removing the distorting effects of depreciation and other non-cash charges, is slightly down from the previous year. This decline may raise questions about the company's growth trajectory, as FFO is a key indicator of a REIT's ability to pay dividends and fund growth. The company's decision to increase the common dividend by 50 percent during the year could be seen as a positive signal to shareholders about the company's financial health and future prospects. However, the sustainability of this dividend level should be closely monitored, especially in relation to the Adjusted FFO and the company's long-term strategic plans. The balance sheet's robustness, with a significant portion of debt at fixed interest rates, is a defensive measure against interest rate volatility and enhances the company's credit profile. Lastly, the company's outlook and guidance for the full year 2024, with a projected Pro Forma RevPAR Growth of 2-4 percent, suggests cautious optimism. This forecast will be an important factor for investors, as it provides a benchmark against which future performance can be measured. The company's ability to meet or exceed this guidance may influence investor confidence and the stock's performance in the market. 02/28/2024 - 04:30 PM Operating Income of $58.8 Million for Full Year 2023 Adjusted EBITDAre Climbs 5.1 Percent to $190.0 Million; Adjusted FFO Per Share of $0.92 for Full Year 2023 Accretive Dispositions Continue with Sale of Two Additional Hotels New $200 Million Term Loan Financing Completed; No Significant Debt Maturities Until 2026 AUSTIN, Texas, Feb. 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Summit Hotel Properties, Inc. (NYSE: INN) (the ""Company""), today announced results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. ""We are proud of the Company's many successes in 2023, led by RevPAR growth of 6.6 percent which outpaced the overall industry by approximately 170 basis points and was primarily driven by the strong performance of our urban hotels. We continue to enhance our portfolio through strategic asset sales, including the sale of six hotels since the beginning of 2023 for nearly $50 million at an attractive blended capitalization rate of 2.6 percent after foregone capital expenditures. A portion of those proceeds were recycled into two high quality hotels located in high-growth markets, at capitalization rates over 9 percent on a blended basis. The improved performance of our portfolio and our ongoing efforts to prudently allocate capital allowed us to increase our common dividend by 50 percent during the year,"" said Jonathan P. Stanner, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer. ""Since the beginning of 2023, we have successfully completed approximately $1 billion of financing activity that has further enhanced our well-positioned balance sheet by extending debt maturity dates, maintaining attractive pricing and preserving overall flexibility to execute on our strategic initiatives. Most recently, our new $200 million term loan financing replaced our last remaining meaningful tranche of debt scheduled to mature in 2025. As a result, we have no significant debt maturities until 2026, nearly $400 million of liquidity, a weighted average cost of debt of approximately 4.75 percent and, inclusive of attractively priced interest rate swaps and preferred equity, approximately 80 percent of our balance sheet has fixed interest rates. Our outlook for 2024 remains positive, supported by stable demand trends and the expectation that growth in our urban markets will continue to lead portfolio performance, which we believe is positioned to once again outperform the broader industry in 2024,"" commented Mr. Stanner.

Transaction Activity Dispositions Subsequent to year-end, the Company completed the sale of the 127-guestroom Hyatt Place Dallas / Plano for a gross sales price of $10.3 million through its joint venture with GIC. The sales price for the transaction represents a 4.3 percent capitalization rate based on net operating income after a 4.0 percent FF&E reserve for the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2023. The joint venture will forego approximately $5.2 million of future near-term required capital expenditures at the hotel as a result of the sale, which reduces the all-in capitalization rate to approximately 2.9 percent. Throughout 2023, the Company continued its strategic capital recycling program that included the sale of five hotels for a gross sales price of $36.4 million at a blended capitalization rate of 2.5 percent after consideration of foregone capital expenditures. Combined, the Company has sold six hotels for $46.6 million ($41.6 million on a pro rata basis) since the beginning of 2023 at a blended capitalization rate of 2.6 percent after consideration of $30.9 million of foregone capital expenditures.

Non-GAAP financial measures are financial measures not prescribed by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""). These measures are as follows: (i) Funds From Operations (""FFO"") and Adjusted Funds from Operations (""AFFO""), (ii) Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (""EBITDA""), Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate (""EBITDAre"") and Adjusted EBITDAre, and Hotel EBITDA (as described below). We caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions of non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies, since not all companies calculate these non-GAAP financial measures in the same manner. Our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, net income (loss) as a measure of our operating performance. Our non-GAAP financial measures may include funds that may not be available for our discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures, property acquisitions, debt service obligations and other commitments and uncertainties. Although we believe that our non-GAAP financial measures can enhance the understanding of our financial condition and results of operations, these non-GAAP financial measures are not necessarily better indicators of any trend as compared to a comparable measure prescribed by GAAP such as net income (loss). Funds From Operations (""FFO"") and Adjusted FFO (""AFFO"") As defined by Nareit, FFO represents net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding preferred dividends, gains (or losses) from sales of real property, impairment losses on real estate assets, items classified by GAAP as extraordinary, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, plus depreciation and amortization related to real estate assets, and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships, and joint ventures. AFFO represents FFO excluding amortization of deferred financing costs, franchise fees, equity-based compensation expense, transaction costs, debt transaction costs, premiums on redemption of preferred shares, losses from net casualties, non-cash interest income and non-cash income tax related adjustments to our deferred tax asset. Unless otherwise indicated, we present FFO and AFFO applicable to our common shares and common units. We present FFO and AFFO because we consider FFO and AFFO an important supplemental measure of our operational performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO and AFFO when reporting their results. FFO and AFFO are intended to exclude GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization, which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time. Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. Because FFO and AFFO exclude depreciation and amortization related to real estate assets, gains and losses from real property dispositions and impairment losses on real estate assets, and certain transaction costs related to lodging property acquisition activities and debt, FFO and AFFO provide performance measures that, when compared year over year, reflect the effect to operations from trends in occupancy, guestroom rates, operating costs, development activities and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. Our computation of FFO differs slightly from the computation of Nareit-defined FFO related to the reporting of depreciation and amortization expense on assets at our corporate offices, which is de minimus. Our computation of FFO may also differ from the methodology for calculating FFO used by other equity REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. FFO and AFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions. Where indicated in this release, FFO is based on our computation of FFO and not the computation of Nareit-defined FFO unless otherwise noted. EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, and Hotel EBITDA In September 2017, Nareit proposed a standardized performance measure, called EBITDAre, which is based on EBITDA and is expected to provide additional relevant information about REITs as real estate companies in support of growing interest among generalist investors. The conclusion was reached that, while dedicated REIT investors have long been accustomed to utilizing the industry's supplemental measures such as FFO and net operating income (""NOI"") to evaluate the investment quality of REITs as real estate companies, it would be helpful to generalist investors for REITs as real estate companies to also present EBITDAre as a more widely known and understood supplemental measure of performance. EBITDAre is intended to be a supplemental non-GAAP performance measure that is independent of a company's capital structure and will provide a uniform basis for one measurement of the enterprise value of a company compared to other REITs. EBITDAre, as defined by Nareit, is calculated as EBITDA, excluding: (i) loss and gains on disposition of property and (ii) asset impairments, if any. We believe EBITDAre is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it provides investors with an indication of our ability to incur and service debt, to satisfy general operating expenses, to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs or reinvest cash into our business. We also believe it helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the effect of our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization) from our operating results. We make additional adjustments to EBITDAre when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional non-recurring or unusual items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAre, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income, is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it provides investors with an indication of our ability to incur and service debt, to satisfy general operating expenses, to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs or reinvest cash into our business. We also believe it helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the effect of our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization) from our operating results. With respect to hotel EBITDA, we believe that excluding the effect of corporate-level expenses and non-cash items provides a more complete understanding of the operating results over which individual hotels and operators have direct control. We believe the property-level results provide investors with supplemental information on the ongoing operational performance of our hotels and effectiveness of the third-party management companies operating our business on a property-level basis. We caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions of EBITDA, EBITDAre, adjusted EBITDAre, and hotel EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies, since not all companies calculate these non-GAAP measures in the same manner. EBITDA, EBITDAre, adjusted EBITDAre, and hotel EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative measure of our net income (loss) or operating performance. EBITDA, EBITDAre, adjusted EBITDAre, and hotel EBITDA may include funds that may not be available for our discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures and property acquisitions and other commitments and uncertainties. Although we believe that EBITDA, EBITDAre, adjusted EBITDAre, and hotel EBITDA can enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations, these non-GAAP financial measures are not necessarily a better indicator of any trend as compared to a comparable GAAP measure such as net income (loss). Above, we include a quantitative reconciliation of EBITDA, EBITDAre, adjusted EBITDAre and hotel EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial performance measure, which is net income (loss) and operating income (loss).

The deal accelerates clinical trials and production capacity for emu™ brain scanner, improving stroke care and patient outcomes.","EMVision Sets Sight on US With US$10M Keysight Investment Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Keysight Technologies acquires a strategic equity stake in EMVision, providing fully funded path to market for Aussie Medtech with a US$10 million investment. The deal accelerates clinical trials and production capacity for emu™ brain scanner, improving stroke care and patient outcomes. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The strategic investment by Keysight Technologies in EMVision represents a significant milestone in the advancement of medical imaging technology, particularly for the diagnosis and treatment of stroke and other neurological conditions. The emu™ brain scanner is poised to disrupt the current imaging paradigm by offering a portable, rapid diagnostic tool that can be used outside of traditional hospital settings. This has the potential to greatly enhance the speed and accessibility of care, particularly in remote or underserved areas where CT and MRI availability is limited.From a medical research perspective, the acceleration of clinical trials and the expansion of EMVision's production capacity are crucial steps towards validating the efficacy and safety of the emu™ device. The trial data will be instrumental in obtaining regulatory approvals and will be closely scrutinized for its ability to meet stringent medical standards. The investment will also facilitate the development of the first responder device, which could transform emergency care by enabling rapid, on-site neurological assessments. However, it is important to note that until the devices receive regulatory clearance, their impact on healthcare practices remains speculative. Financial Analyst Keysight Technologies' equity stake acquisition in EMVision carries substantial financial implications for both companies. For EMVision, the US$10 million investment provides a fully funded commercial runway, which is critical for a medtech company at this stage of development. It reduces financial risk and underscores investor confidence in EMVision's technology and market potential. The capital infusion is expected to expedite the path to market, which is particularly relevant given the planned market entry next year.For Keysight, the investment represents a diversification into the medical imaging sector, indicating a strategic move to leverage its technology in new applications. The market capitalization of approximately US$26 billion for Keysight suggests that the investment, while significant, is a calculated risk in the context of its overall portfolio. Investors and analysts will be monitoring the impact of this investment on Keysight's financial performance, as well as any potential synergies that may arise from the partnership. Market Research Analyst The partnership between Keysight Technologies and EMVision highlights a growing trend in the healthcare sector towards innovative point-of-care diagnostics. The market for portable diagnostic devices is expanding, driven by the need for more decentralized and rapid healthcare solutions. EMVision's emu™ device is strategically positioned to capitalize on this trend, with the potential to capture a significant share of the market, particularly in stroke care, which is a leading cause of disability and death worldwide.However, market adoption will depend on several factors, including the outcomes of clinical trials, regulatory approvals and the ability of EMVision to scale production and distribution effectively. It is also essential to consider the competitive landscape, as other companies may be developing similar technologies. The OEM supply partnership and the 'fast sweep' feature give EMVision a competitive edge, but continuous innovation and strategic partnerships will be key to maintaining its market position. 02/28/2024 - 04:30 PM Following a long-standing relationship, Keysight Technologies has acquired a strategic equity stake in EMVision, providing the Aussie Medtech with a fully funded path to market SYDNEY--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- EMVision, an Australian medical device company focused on developing innovative portable brain imaging technology, has announced a US$10 million (~A$15.28m) strategic investment from Keysight Technologies, a global leader in test and measurement technology.

It accelerates clinical trials, generating essential data supporting the upcoming regulatory approval pathway and adoption in the world’s largest healthcare market. The new capital will also increase the company's production capacity for additional emu™ devices to be used in expanded clinical trials, including leading stroke centres in the United States. With a market capitalisation of approximately US$26 billion, the deal marks Keysight’s first investment globally in enabling innovation in point-of-care medical imaging, demonstrating its strong support for the clinical and commercial value of EMVision's innovative neuroimaging technology. Portable brain imaging for improved patient care EMVision's emu™ brain scanner is a pioneering advancement in stroke care, intended to provide rapid diagnostic imaging to accelerate the delivery of urgent, life-saving care, particularly in settings where traditional imaging modalities such as CT and MRI are not readily available. The device is operated at the point of care, with a simple cap placed on the patient's head for quick scans and image generation. It couples safe, ultra-high frequency radio signals with powerful Artificial Intelligence to produce rapid insights directly at the patient’s bedside. emu™ can be operated by any healthcare professional with minimal training. Targeted for use in intensive care units, stroke and neurology wards, and rural emergency departments, emu™ has the potential to improve survival rates and quality of life after stroke and other neurological events requiring urgent intervention. The investment follows an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) supply partnership entered into by both companies in 2022, whereby EMVision secured exclusivity in the neuroimaging field for the VNA “fast sweep” feature. This component acts as the ‘brain’ of all EMVision devices, giving the company a substantial competitive advantage. Scott Kirkland, Founder and CEO at EMVision, said, “Keysight's investment is an endorsement of our mission to improve global stroke outcomes and we're thrilled to embark on this next phase of growth together. Their commitment to being at the frontline of innovation aligns perfectly with EMVision's progress towards making ubiquitous portable brain imaging a reality.” Huei Sin, Keysight Technologies President, Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, said, “We are delighted to strengthen our relationship with EMVision as we forge ahead in pioneering ground-breaking advancements in medical imaging technology. Keysight's technology leadership, particularly our industry-leading data acquisition speeds, alongside EMVision's brain scanning innovation, strategically positions our companies to spearhead significant developments in cutting-edge imaging solutions.” EMVision is also developing a first responder device. The backpack-sized scanners will weigh less than 10 kilograms and are intended for deployment via road and air ambulances. It would allow paramedics to scan and send images to specialists from the site of a suspected stroke, meaning patients could be diagnosed and treated more quickly than has previously been possible. Market entry for the emu™ device is planned for next year, with the first responder device to follow. Under the agreement, Keysight will be issued 7,454,231 new ordinary shares in EMVision at A$2.05 per share to acquire an 8.73% shareholding in EMVision. The agreement and issue of shares to Keysight, which will occur with EMVision's existing Listing Rule 7.1 headroom without the need for shareholder approval, is expected to be completed in the next two days. The emu™️ and the first responder device are neither available for sale nor evaluated by the FDA or other global regulators. The devices may only be used by authorized sites in controlled clinical investigations.

Financial Analyst The reported increase in locations and gaming terminals for Accel Entertainment indicates a strategic expansion that has the potential to enhance market share and drive revenue growth. The 6% increase in locations and 7% increase in gaming terminals year-over-year, even when excluding new territories like Nebraska, suggests organic growth in established markets. This is a positive signal for investors as it could mean better economies of scale and potentially increased bargaining power with suppliers and partners.Furthermore, the company's record revenue and Adjusted EBITDA figures reflect a strong operational performance. The growth in same-store sales in Illinois, albeit modest, shows resilience in core markets which is crucial for sustained profitability. However, the decrease in net income year-over-year warrants attention. It could be indicative of rising costs or other financial pressures that may affect future earnings. The stock repurchase program demonstrates management's confidence in the company's value, which could be reassuring for investors concerned about the net income dip. Market Research Analyst Accel Entertainment's performance in different states, particularly the impressive growth in Montana and Nevada compared to the previous year, shows the company's effectiveness in penetrating new markets. This geographical diversification reduces reliance on a single market and could mitigate risks associated with regulatory changes or economic downturns in any one state.However, the growth in gaming terminals outpacing the growth in locations could lead to market saturation, potentially reducing the average revenue per terminal over time. It is important for investors to monitor how Accel manages terminal density to maintain profitability. Additionally, the reduction in net debt is a strong indicator of financial health, providing the company with more flexibility for future investments or to weather economic uncertainties. Legal Expert The gaming industry is heavily regulated and Accel's ability to navigate these regulations is key to their continued expansion and financial success. The company's focus on local gaming markets suggests a strategic approach that aligns with regulatory frameworks, which often vary significantly from state to state. By successfully managing these regulatory environments, Accel positions itself as a compliant and reliable operator, which is crucial for maintaining licenses and avoiding costly legal disputes.Investors should be aware of the ongoing legal and legislative developments in the gaming industry, as these can have significant implications for Accel's operations and financial performance. For instance, changes in gaming tax rates, licensing fees, or the legalization of gaming in new jurisdictions could all impact Accel's bottom line. 02/28/2024 - 04:30 PM CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Accel Entertainment, Inc.

We amortize the upfront cash payment over the life of the contract, including expected renewals, beginning on the date the location goes live, and recognizes non-cash amortization charges with respect to such items. Future or deferred cash payments, which may occur based on terms of the underlying contract, are generally lower in the aggregate as compared to established practice of providing higher upfront payments, and are also capitalized and amortized over the remaining life of the contract. Future cash payments do not include cash costs associated with renewing customer contracts as we do not generally incur significant costs as a result of extension or renewal of an existing contract. Location contracts acquired in a business combination are recorded at fair value as part of the business combination accounting and then amortized as an intangible asset on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the contract of 15 years. “Amortization of intangible assets and route and customer acquisition costs” aggregates the non-cash amortization charges relating to upfront route and customer acquisition cost payments and location contracts acquired, as well as the amortization of other intangible assets. (2) Stock-based compensation consists of options, restricted stock units, performance-based stock units, and warrants. (3) (Gain) loss on change in fair value of contingent earnout shares represents a non-cash fair value adjustment at each reporting period end related to the value of these contingent shares. Upon achieving certain exchange conditions, shares of Class A-2 common stock convert to Class A-1 common stock resulting in a non-cash settlement of the obligation. (4) Other expenses, net consists of (i) non-cash expenses including the remeasurement of contingent consideration liabilities, (ii) non-recurring lobbying and legal expenses related to distributed gaming expansion in current or prospective markets, and (iii) other non-recurring expenses. (5) Calculated by excluding the impact of the non-GAAP adjustments from the current period tax provision calculations. (6) Emerging markets consist of the results, on an Adjusted EBITDA basis, for non-core jurisdictions where our operations are developing. Markets are no longer considered emerging when we have installed or acquired at least 500 gaming terminals in the jurisdiction, or when 24 months have elapsed from the date we first install or acquire gaming terminals in the jurisdiction, whichever occurs first. We currently view Iowa and Pennsylvania as emerging markets. Prior to April 2023, Nebraska was considered an emerging market. Prior to July 2022, Georgia was considered an emerging market.

We cannot guarantee the accuracy of the forward-looking statements, and you should be aware that results and events could differ materially and adversely from those contained in the forward-looking statements due to a number of factors including, but not limited to: Accel’s ability to operate in existing markets or expand into new jurisdictions; Accel’s ability to offer new and innovative products and services that fulfill the needs of location partners and create strong and sustained player appeal; Accel’s dependence on relationships with key manufacturers, developers and third parties to obtain gaming terminals, amusement machines, and related supplies, programs, and technologies for its business on acceptable terms; the negative impact on Accel’s future results of operations by the slow growth in demand for gaming terminals and by the slow growth of new gaming jurisdictions; Accel’s heavy dependency on its ability to win, maintain and renew contracts with location partners; unfavorable macroeconomic conditions or decreased discretionary spending due to other factors such as interest rate volatility, persistent inflation, actual or perceived instability in the U.S. and global banking systems, high fuel rates, recessions, epidemics or other public health issues, terrorist activity or threat thereof, civil unrest or other macroeconomic or political uncertainties, that could adversely affect Accel’s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial conditions and other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in documents filed or to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

These and other factors could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in this press release. Non-GAAP Financial Information This press release includes certain financial information not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (“GAAP”), including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income, and Net Debt. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income, and Net Debt are non-GAAP financial measures and are key metrics used to monitor ongoing core operations. Management of Accel believes Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income, and Net Debt enhance the understanding of Accel’s underlying drivers of profitability and trends in Accel’s business and facilitates company-to-company and period-to-period comparisons, because these non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effects of certain non-cash items, represents certain nonrecurring items that are unrelated to core performance, or excludes non-core operations. Management of Accel also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are used by investors, analysts and other interested parties as measures of financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income, and Net Debt Although Accel excludes amortization of intangible assets and route and customer acquisition costs from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income, Accel believes that it is important for investors to understand that these route, customer and other intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Any future acquisitions may result in amortization of intangible assets and route and customer acquisition costs. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income, and Net Debt are not recognized terms under GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income, and these measures may vary among companies. These non-GAAP financial measures are unaudited and have important limitations as an analytical tool, should not be viewed in isolation and do not purport to be alternatives to net income as indicators of operating performance.

About Hyperfine, Inc. and the Swoop® Portable MR Imaging® System Hyperfine, Inc. (Nasdaq: HYPR) is the groundbreaking health technology company that has redefined brain imaging with the Swoop® system—the world’s first FDA-cleared, portable, ultra-low-field, magnetic resonance brain imaging system capable of providing imaging at multiple points of care. The Swoop® system received initial U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance in 2020 as a portable magnetic resonance brain imaging device for producing images that display the internal structure of the head where a full diagnostic examination is not clinically practical. When interpreted by a trained physician, these images provide information that can be useful in determining a diagnosis. The Swoop® system has been approved for brain imaging in several countries, including Canada and Australia, has UKCA certification in the United Kingdom, CE certification in the European Union, and is also available in New Zealand. The mission of Hyperfine, Inc. is to revolutionize patient care globally through transformational, accessible, clinically relevant diagnostic imaging and data solutions. Founded by Dr. Jonathan Rothberg in a technology-based incubator called 4Catalyzer, Hyperfine, Inc. scientists, engineers, and physicists developed the Swoop® system out of a passion for redefining brain imaging methodology and how clinicians can apply accessible diagnostic imaging to patient care. Traditionally, access to costly, stationary, conventional MRI technology can be inconvenient or not available when needed most. With the portable, ultra-low-field Swoop® system, Hyperfine, Inc. is redefining the neuroimaging workflow by bringing brain imaging to the patient’s bedside. For more information, visit hyperfine.io.

The award is named after Larry Lemon of Haskell Lemon Construction in Oklahoma City.

(NYSE:CBRE) climbs to No. 3 on Barron’s list of the 100 most sustainable U.S.-based companies for 2024, up from No. 4 last year. This is the seventh consecutive year CBRE has made the top 100 list. The company received an A- performance score from CDP on its 2023 climate change disclosure, recognized for best practices in climate change governance. Positive None. Negative None. Sustainability Analyst CBRE Group's ascent to No. 3 on Barron's list of sustainable companies signals a growing recognition of the firm's environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives. In the realm of sustainability, ESG metrics are critical as they provide a quantitative framework for evaluating corporate behavior in areas that are not traditionally captured in financial statements. CBRE's high score indicates a strong commitment to sustainability practices, which can be attractive to socially conscious investors and may influence investment decisions.Moreover, CBRE's A- score from CDP in climate change disclosure reflects its leadership in areas such as emissions reduction and risk management. The emphasis on Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions showcases CBRE's comprehensive approach to carbon footprint assessment, encompassing direct emissions, indirect emissions from purchased energy and all other indirect emissions that occur in a company's value chain. This level of detail and transparency is increasingly demanded by stakeholders who are concerned with the long-term risks and opportunities associated with climate change. Commercial Real Estate Expert CBRE's role as the world's largest commercial property manager places it in a unique position to influence the commercial real estate industry's sustainability trajectory. The company's focus on developing scalable sustainability solutions could have a significant ripple effect across the industry, potentially setting new benchmarks for competitors. Real estate, being a major contributor to carbon emissions, is under increasing pressure to decarbonize. Innovations in this sector, such as CBRE's partnership with Emitwise to address supply chain decarbonization, could lead to substantial improvements in the industry's overall sustainability profile.Recognition by entities like Forbes and 3BL further cements CBRE's reputation as a leader in corporate responsibility. Such accolades could enhance the company's brand value and potentially lead to new business opportunities as clients increasingly seek partners with strong sustainability credentials. Investment Analyst CBRE's recognition for its sustainability efforts is likely to have a positive impact on investor perception. Sustainable investing is a growing trend, with many investors integrating ESG factors into their investment decisions. CBRE's advancement in sustainability rankings could, therefore, have favorable implications for its stock performance, as it may attract ESG-focused funds and socially responsible investment portfolios.However, investors should also consider the costs associated with implementing such initiatives and whether these investments will translate into long-term value creation for shareholders. While sustainability is often associated with long-term risk mitigation and potential cost savings, the immediate financial impact of these initiatives should be monitored to ensure they align with the company's overall strategic objectives. 02/28/2024 - 04:30 PM DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CBRE Group, Inc. (NYSE:CBRE) climbed to No. 3 on the Barron’s list of the 100 most sustainable U.S.-based companies for 2024 – up from No. 4 last year. This is the seventh consecutive year that CBRE has made the top 100 list. The 1,000 largest U.S.-based publicly traded companies are evaluated under the Barron’s program. They are scored on more than 230 environmental, social, and governance performance metrics across five categories: shareholders, employees, customers, community and the planet. Scores are weighted according to the financial materiality of each category to a company’s industry. The Barron’s accolade follows CBRE’s achieving an A- performance score from CDP on its 2023 climate change disclosure. CDP’s annual climate change disclosure and scoring process is recognized as the global standard of corporate transparency on climate impacts, risks and opportunities. The A- score is within CDP’s Leadership band, reserved for companies implementing best practices in climate change governance. CDP gave CBRE high marks in several categories, including emissions reduction initiatives and low carbon products; opportunity and risk disclosure; risk management processes; targets; and Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. CBRE’s partnership with Emitwise was also recently highlighted by CDP as an innovation in tackling one of climate change’s biggest hurdles—decarbonizing the supply chain. “CBRE has a unique opportunity and obligation as the world’s largest commercial property manager to accelerate sustainability across the commercial real estate industry. It’s an honor to have our own sustainability efforts recognized, as we navigate many of the same challenges that our clients face and are focused on developing solutions that can be replicated to drive progress at scale,” said Rob Bernard, chief sustainability officer, CBRE. CBRE was also recently recognized on Forbes’ inaugural Net Zero Leaders list as the highest-ranked commercial real estate company and appeared on 3BL’s annual 100 Best Corporate Citizens ranking for the fifth consecutive year.

Financial Analyst The reported increase in Total Income for UMH Properties, Inc. reflects a robust growth trajectory, indicative of the company's ability to expand revenue streams year-over-year. A 13% annual increase is a solid performance, particularly when viewed against a backdrop of economic uncertainties that have prevailed in recent times. This growth rate surpasses the average industry growth rate for REITs, which typically hovers around 3-5% annually. Such an uptick could be a harbinger of strong operational efficiency and an expanding asset base.However, the Net Loss Attributable to Common Shareholders presents a dichotomy in the financial health of the company. The reduction in net loss from the previous year is a positive sign, suggesting that the company has taken effective measures to manage its costs or improve its operational efficiency. Yet, investors should be cautious and scrutinize the reasons behind the net losses, as they could point to underlying issues that might not be immediately apparent from the income statement alone.The increase in Funds from Operations (FFO) and Normalized FFO is particularly noteworthy for investors, as these are key metrics for REITs, reflecting the cash flow generated by their operations. The substantial improvement in FFO, by over 79% year-over-year, signals strong operational performance and could be indicative of effective capital management strategies. FFO is often used by investors to gauge a REIT's performance and ability to pay dividends and thus, an increase in this metric could be seen as a positive sign for dividend sustainability and potential growth. Real Estate Investment Expert UMH Properties, Inc.'s strategic moves, such as the acquisition of new communities and the expansion of existing ones, have contributed to their increased Total Income and FFO. These actions are reflective of a growth-oriented strategy, which is essential in the real estate sector to maintain competitiveness and market share. The company's entry into Georgia and the joint venture in Pennsylvania are indicative of geographic diversification, which can help mitigate risks associated with regional economic downturns.The improvement in Same Property Net Operating Income (NOI) and occupancy rates suggests that UMH is not only expanding its portfolio but also enhancing the profitability of its existing assets. A 230 basis point increase in occupancy rates is significant, as it points to the company's ability to attract and retain tenants, which is critical for revenue stability.UMH's reduction in Net Debt to Total Market Capitalization from 38.2% to 31.3% is a positive sign for the company's leverage and financial risk profile. Lower debt levels relative to market cap can improve the company's agility in securing new investments and weathering potential market downturns. This metric will be of interest to investors concerned with the balance between growth and financial stability. Market Research Analyst The reported financials suggest that UMH Properties, Inc. is positioned to capitalize on the high demand for manufactured home communities. This sector has seen increased interest due to its affordability amid rising housing costs. The company's proactive approach to increasing its rental home portfolio and sales of manufactured homes by 23% aligns with market trends and consumer demand.Moreover, the management's commentary on the anticipated delivery of similar operating results in 2024 provides a forward-looking perspective that may influence investor expectations. The company's confidence in continued earnings growth, despite recent supply chain disruptions and rising interest rates, suggests a resilient business model adaptable to external pressures.The emphasis on organic growth through the development of vacant lots and land is a strategic move that could yield long-term benefits. However, investors should consider the execution risks and market conditions that could impact the success of such development projects. 02/28/2024 - 04:30 PM FREEHOLD, NJ, Feb. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- UMH Properties, Inc.

The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Note: (1) Non-GAAP Information: We assess and measure our overall operating results based upon an industry performance measure referred to as Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Shareholders (“FFO”), which management believes is a useful indicator of our operating performance. FFO is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating performance measure of a REIT. FFO, as defined by The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”), represents net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders, as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), excluding gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets, impairment charges related to depreciable real estate assets, the change in the fair value of marketable securities, and the gain or loss on the sale of marketable securities plus certain non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization. Included in the NAREIT FFO White Paper - 2018 Restatement, is an option pertaining to assets incidental to our main business in the calculation of NAREIT FFO to make an election to include or exclude gains and losses on the sale of these assets, such as marketable equity securities, and include or exclude mark-to-market changes in the value recognized on these marketable equity securities. In conjunction with the adoption of the FFO White Paper - 2018 Restatement, for all periods presented, we have elected to exclude the gains and losses realized on marketable securities investments and the change in the fair value of marketable securities from our FFO calculation. NAREIT created FFO as a non-U.S. GAAP supplemental measure of REIT operating performance. We define Normalized Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Shareholders (“Normalized FFO”), as FFO excluding certain one-time charges. FFO and Normalized FFO should be considered as supplemental measures of operating performance used by REITs. FFO and Normalized FFO exclude historical cost depreciation as an expense and may facilitate the comparison of REITs which have a different cost basis. However, other REITs may use different methodologies to calculate FFO and Normalized FFO and, accordingly, our FFO and Normalized FFO may not be comparable to all other REITs. The items excluded from FFO and Normalized FFO are significant components in understanding the Company’s financial performance. FFO and Normalized FFO (i) do not represent Cash Flow from Operations as defined by U.S. GAAP; (ii) should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities; and (iii) are not alternatives to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. FFO and Normalized FFO, as calculated by the Company, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other REITs. The reconciliation of the Company’s U.S. GAAP net income (loss) to the Company’s FFO and Normalized FFO for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are calculated as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended Year Ended December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Shareholders $6,832 $283 $(8,714) $(36,265)Depreciation Expense 14,448 12,766 55,719 48,769 Depreciation Expense from Unconsolidated Joint Venture 188 114 692 371 Loss on Sales of Investment Property and Equipment 11 73 -0- 169 (Increase) Decrease in Fair Value of Marketable Securities (6,884) (21,185) 3,555 21,839 (Gain) Loss on Sales of Marketable Securities, net -0- 17,922 (183) (6,394)FFO Attributable to Common Shareholders 14,595 9,973 51,069 28,489 Redemption of Preferred Stock (2) -0- -0- -0- 12,916 Amortization (2) 543 511 2,135 1,956 Non-Recurring Other Expense (3) 226 837 1,329 3,479 Normalized FFO Attributable to Common Shareholders $15,364 $11,321 $54,533 $46,840 The diluted weighted shares outstanding used in the calculation of FFO per Diluted Common Share and Normalized FFO per Diluted Common Share were 67.2 million and 63.7 million shares for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, and 56.8 million and 55.3 million shares for the three months and year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. Common stock equivalents resulting from stock options in the amount of 613,000 shares and 936,000 shares for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were excluded from the computation of Diluted Net Income (Loss) per Share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. Common stock equivalents resulting from stock options in the amount of 315,000 shares and 571,000 shares for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were included in the computation of Diluted Net Income (Loss) per share. (2) During 2022, the Company incurred the carrying cost of excess cash for the redemption of preferred stock. Additionally, due to the change in sources of capital, amortization expense, a non-cash expense, is expected to become more significant and is therefore included as an adjustment to Normalized FFO for the three months and years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. (3) Consists of special bonus and restricted stock grants for the August 2020 groundbreaking Fannie Mae financing, which were being expensed over the vesting period ($0 and $862, respectively) and non-recurring expenses for the joint venture with Nuveen ($42 and $135, respectively), one-time legal fees ($1 and $76, respectively), fees related to the establishment of the Opportunity Zone Fund ($0 and $37, respectively), and costs associated with acquisitions and financing that were not completed ($183 and $219, respectively) for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023.

"Societal CDMO Enters Into Definitive Agreement to be Acquired by CoreRx, Inc.",2024-02-28T21:29:00.000Z,High,Neutral,"Societal CDMO is set to be acquired by CoreRx, Inc., in a deal worth $1.10 per share. The merger will create an enhanced CDMO with capabilities spanning early-stage formulation development through commercial manufacturing and packaging. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2024.","Societal CDMO Enters Into Definitive Agreement to be Acquired by CoreRx, Inc. Rhea-AI Impact (High) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Societal CDMO is set to be acquired by CoreRx, Inc., in a deal worth $1.10 per share. The merger will create an enhanced CDMO with capabilities spanning early-stage formulation development through commercial manufacturing and packaging. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The acquisition of Societal CDMO by CoreRx represents a strategic consolidation in the CDMO sector, which is significant given the increasing demand for outsourced pharmaceutical services. The offer price of $1.10 per share needs to be evaluated against Societal CDMO's current financial health, historical stock performance and industry multiples. Investors should consider whether the premium offered reflects the intrinsic value of Societal CDMO, taking into account its revenue streams, growth potential and the synergy benefits that CoreRx anticipates.It is also important to assess the liquidity and capital structure implications for both companies. CoreRx's ability to finance the acquisition, possibly affecting its leverage and liquidity ratios, is a key factor. The tender offer followed by a second-step merger is a common acquisition structure, which typically suggests a swift consolidation post-tender offer acceptance. The transaction's expected closure in the second quarter of 2024 indicates a rapid integration timeline, which could lead to quicker realization of synergies but also poses integration risks. Market Research Analyst The CDMO market is highly competitive with a focus on innovation, quality and scalability. The combined capabilities of Societal CDMO and CoreRx could provide a competitive advantage by offering a more comprehensive suite of services. The ability to cover the entire drug development lifecycle from early-stage formulation to commercial-scale production could attract a larger client base and potentially increase market share. Analyzing the competitive landscape post-acquisition will provide insights into how the new entity might alter market dynamics.Furthermore, the impact on the client retention and acquisition strategy is crucial. Existing relationships with pharmaceutical companies could be strengthened and the enhanced service offering might attract new clients looking for a one-stop-shop solution. The expertise in small molecule therapeutics is particularly noteworthy, as it remains a core area in pharmaceuticals, with high demand for specialized formulation and manufacturing services. Legal Expert From a legal perspective, the unanimous approval by Societal CDMO’s board and their recommendation for shareholders to tender their shares indicates a high level of confidence in the transaction's benefits. However, shareholder response to the tender offer will be a determinant in the transaction's success. The structure of the deal, which involves a tender offer followed by a second-step merger, is designed to expedite the acquisition process but also requires careful scrutiny to ensure compliance with securities and antitrust laws.The potential for regulatory scrutiny exists, especially if the combined entity controls a significant market share. Additionally, the 'without the vote of Societal CDMO shareholders' clause in the second-step merger is a legal mechanism that may raise questions among minority shareholders, although it is a standard procedure in such transactions. The role of Raymond James & Associates as financial advisor is to ensure that the transaction is financially fair and in the best interest of Societal CDMO's shareholders. 02/28/2024 - 04:29 PM Societal CDMO to be Acquired by CoreRx, Inc. to Create an Enhanced CDMO with Broad Capabilities Spanning Early-Stage Formulation Development through Commercial Manufacturing and Packaging CoreRx to Commence a Tender Offer for all Outstanding Shares of Societal CDMO, Inc.

Market Research Analyst The launch of Princess Cruises' new Sun Princess cruise ship represents a significant investment in the cruise line's fleet and has the potential to influence the company's financial performance. The introduction of innovative venues and partnerships with celebrity collaborators could attract a broader customer base, potentially leading to increased bookings and revenue. The emphasis on luxury and unique experiences, such as the glass-enclosed Dome and the Sphere Atrium, aligns with the industry trend towards more immersive and high-end cruise offerings. Additionally, the focus on family and generational cruising could tap into a growing market segment, contributing to long-term customer loyalty and brand strength. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the capital expenditure required to build the Sun Princess is substantial and the return on investment will be closely monitored by stakeholders. The stock market will likely react to the initial success and customer feedback from the maiden voyage, as these are indicators of the ship's future performance. The diversified culinary and entertainment options could justify higher ticket prices, enhancing profit margins. However, it is essential to consider the operational costs associated with maintaining such a large and luxurious vessel, as well as the potential risks in the event of economic downturns that could affect discretionary spending on travel and leisure. Tourism Industry Expert The launch of Sun Princess is a strategic move within the competitive cruise industry, where differentiation is key. By offering unique attractions like The Dome and exclusive dining experiences, Princess Cruises is positioning itself to compete not just with other cruise lines but also with luxury resorts and experiential travel options. The emphasis on culinary excellence and partnerships with celebrity chefs could set a new industry standard for onboard dining. However, the success of these initiatives depends on consistent execution and the ability to maintain high service standards, which are critical factors in customer satisfaction and repeat business. 02/28/2024 - 04:29 PM Most Impressive, Luxurious and Stunning Love Boat Ever Created Sets Sail ROME, Feb. 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The Sun is shining!

The company aims to advance its Smart Cities and Roadways business, collaborate with new AI partners, and secure additional funding for future growth. Positive None. Negative None. 02/28/2024 - 04:29 PM BREMERTON, Wash., Feb. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via IBN -- Premier Products Group, Inc. (OTC: PMPG) today issued a letter to shareholders from Terry L Stein, Interim CEO. Dear shareholders, We would like to provide you with a long overdue update. A year and a half ago the company found itself on the ""Expert Market"". This was due to the prior management's failure to ensure that all necessary filings were kept up to date. Quotations in Expert Market securities are restricted from public viewing – restricting access to only broker-dealers and professionals or sophisticated investors. Upon this significant corporate default, I made a decision to file a default against the management group and take over voting control of the company in an effort to repair the damage done and protect shareholders. This kicked off a series of events to return the company back to both compliant with SEC requirements (including its current audited financials and disclosures) and to allow for a published Bid and Ask quote for the company's stock. The first action was to vote out and replace the then current officers and directors that had allowed this to occur. As many of you know, this is a somewhat contentious action and we did not exactly receive a lot of cooperation (or any) on the turnover/transition. During this period a great deal of time and money has been spent to rebuild the company financials, perform audits and confirmations, complete business valuations, attorney reviews and legal actions, meeting with stakeholders, and position the company to advance its business objectives. Looking back, it does seem like a considerable amount of time from a shareholder's point of view, but please know that we have worked as diligently as possible, and spent a considerable amount of resources, to complete these numerous tasks and protect the integrity of the company for the future – which in turn benefits all shareholders. So, what's left to complete? The auditor is finishing up their work so we can file the 2021, 2022, and then 2023 annual financials to become fully compliant as to the SEC filing requirements. Immediately following this, we will work with OTC Markets and others to complete the 15c-211 process and get back trading! As for the business in the future, PMPG is still very much moving forward with the Smart Cities and Roadways business. The plan is to expand the offering and bring in new partners in Artificial Intelligence to make this a reality. This will require more funding for sure but we feel confident we will be able to accomplish this in a timely manner once we are back on track. Also, we are working with two other exciting companies that we believe will bring value to our company going forward and look forward to making those announcements in the near future. In closing, I would like to tell you that I understand the frustrations of all the shareholders of Premier Products Group Inc – and know that I feel it as well – but we all need to take a step back and examine what was left to work with. I have spent endless hours working to save what was left and have spent what seems like endless dollars to save this company for the shareholders because I believe this will be something we can all be proud of, but it will take more work and additional funding to achieve that goal. So we will get there, we just have to continue to stay positive and have a bit more of that patience. Sincerely, Terry L SteinInterim CEO Wire Service Contact: IBN Los Angeles, California www.InvestorBrandNetwork.com 310.299.1717 Office Editor@InvestorBrandNetwork.com What is the content of the shareholder update letter from Premier Products Group, Inc.? The letter from the Interim CEO, Terry L Stein, discusses efforts to address past management failures, achieve SEC compliance, and prepare for stock trading on OTC Markets. It also outlines plans for advancing the Smart Cities and Roadways business, collaborating with new AI partners, and securing additional funding for future growth. What actions did the company take to rectify the prior management's failures? The company voted out and replaced the then current officers and directors responsible for the management failures that led to the company's default. They have also spent time and resources on rebuilding financials, audits, business valuations, legal actions, and stakeholder meetings to repair the damage done. What are the company's plans for achieving SEC compliance? The company is finalizing its auditor's work to file the 2021, 2022, and 2023 annual financials to meet SEC filing requirements. They plan to work with OTC Markets to complete the 15c-211 process and resume trading. What is Premier Products Group, Inc.'s focus for the future in terms of business? The company is still focused on advancing its Smart Cities and Roadways business. They plan to expand offerings, bring in new AI partners, and secure additional funding to support growth initiatives. They are also working with two other companies to create value for shareholders. How does the Interim CEO address shareholder frustrations in the letter?

Positive Impressive financial and operational results for Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. in 2023. Revenues surged by 229% to $388 million, net income reached $261.2 million, and adjusted EBITDA stood at $419.9 million. BTC production increased by 210% to a record 12,852 in 2023.

Plans to grow hash rate to 35-37 exahash in 2024 and 50 exahash by the end of 2025. Strong balance sheet with $997 million in combined unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, and bitcoin as of December 31, 2023. Negative None. Financial Analyst The remarkable turnaround in Marathon Digital Holdings' financial performance, highlighted by a 229% increase in revenue and a significant shift from a net loss to substantial net income, is indicative of the company's successful scaling and operational efficiency improvements. The reduction of debt by 56% at a discount, resulting in notable cash savings, demonstrates prudent financial management. This deleveraging, combined with the substantial growth in bitcoin production and energized hash rate, paints a picture of a company that has not only weathered the volatile crypto market but has emerged stronger with a robust balance sheet.Investors should note the exponential increase in hash rate capacity and the company's ambitious growth targets. The strategic acquisition of data centers, expanding the mining portfolio, suggests a forward-thinking approach to infrastructure investment. However, the reliance on the volatile crypto market and prices, as well as the implementation of new FASB fair value accounting rules, introduces a layer of complexity to the financial analysis. The gains on digital assets may not be sustainable if crypto asset prices were to decline sharply, which is a risk factor that should be closely monitored. Market Research Analyst Marathon's operational advancements, including a 21% improvement in fleet efficiency and a diversified bitcoin mining portfolio across multiple continents, showcase the company's commitment to technological innovation and risk mitigation. The increase in bitcoin production and the company's share of available miner rewards reflect a growing competitive edge in the mining sector. The adoption of new accounting standards for crypto assets aligns the company with evolving financial reporting practices, which could affect investor perceptions and the comparability of financial statements across the industry.Looking at the broader market, Marathon's growth trajectory and strategic positioning could influence the competitive dynamics within the bitcoin mining industry. Their expansion plans and the potential to double their current capacity by 2025 could set a new benchmark for scale in the sector. This aggressive growth strategy could put pressure on smaller players and potentially lead to market consolidation. Cryptocurrency Expert The reported increase in Marathon's bitcoin holdings to over 15,000 BTC is a significant asset on the balance sheet, which could provide a hedge against operational costs and serve as a source of liquidity. The company's strategic decision to sell a portion of the bitcoin produced to cover expenses reflects a balanced approach to treasury management in a market known for its volatility. The focus on improving mining efficiency, measured in joules per terahash, is particularly crucial for maintaining profitability amidst rising energy costs and potential regulatory changes around energy consumption for cryptocurrency mining.Marathon's performance must be contextualized within the broader crypto ecosystem, where network difficulty adjustments, bitcoin halving events and regulatory developments can have material impacts on mining profitability. The company's ability to navigate these factors, while maintaining operational efficiency and cost management, will be critical to sustaining their growth and profitability in the long term. 02/28/2024 - 04:30 PM - Revenues Increase 229% to a Record $388 Million in 2023- Net Income Improves to $261.2 Million, or $1.06 per Diluted Share, in 2023- Adjusted EBITDA Improves to $419.9 Million in 2023- BTC Production Increases 210% to a Record 12,852 in 2023 Fort Lauderdale, FL, Feb. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MARA) (""Marathon"" or ""Company""), a leader in supporting and securing the Bitcoin ecosystem, reported its financial and operational results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Fiscal Year 2023 Financial and Operational Highlights Energized hash rate increased 253% to 24.7 EH/s in 2023 from 7.0 EH/s in 2022Bitcoin production increased 210% to a record 12,852 BTC in 2023 from 4,144 BTC in 2022Revenues increased 229% to a record $387.5 million in 2023 from $117.8 million in 2022Net income improved to a record $261.2 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, from a net loss of $694 million, or $(6.12) per diluted share, in 2022Adjusted EBITDA improved to a record $419.9 million in 2023 from a loss of $543.4 million in 2022Combined unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and bitcoin increased to $997.0 million as of December 31, 2023Debt reduced by 56% to $331 million from $748 million, at a 21% discount to par, resulting in $101 million, or $0.55 per share, in cash savingsFleet efficiency improved 21% to 24.5 J/TH (joules per terahash) from 30.9 J/THEntered into an agreement to acquire two data centers, increasing mining portfolio to more than 900-megawatts of capacity, 45% of which resides on sites now directly owned by the CompanyBitcoin mining portfolio diversified across 11 sites on three continents as of December 31, 2023 Management Commentary “2023 was a record-breaking year for Marathon, during which we achieved our primary objectives of energizing our fleet of previously purchased mining rigs and optimizing our performance,” said Fred Thiel, Marathon’s chairman and CEO. “In 2023, we grew our hash rate 253% to 24.7 exahash; we improved our fleet efficiency 21% to 24.5 joules per terahash; and, we increased our Bitcoin mining portfolio to over 900 megawatts of total capacity, diversified across 11 different sites on three continents. “We produced a record 12,852 bitcoin in 2023 and drove a 230% increase in revenue to a record $387.5 million for the fiscal year. With 15,126 bitcoin on our balance sheet at year-end, our bottom line benefitted substantially from the adoption of the new FASB fair value accounting rules. But even without these accounting changes, we would have produced positive net income of approximately $33 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, in 2023. The year was capped with a record fourth quarter, during which we produced 4,242 bitcoin, surpassing all of fiscal 2022’s production, and generated $156.8 million in revenue, a 452% increase year-over-year. “In 2024, we plan to grow our hash rate to approximately 35 to 37 exahash. By the end of 2025, we plan to be at 50 exahash, which is approximately double our current capacity. With orders for 22 exahash of miners already placed and options to add an additional 23 exahash to these orders, we believe there may be opportunities to accelerate our growth targets. “Today, Marathon is one of the largest Bitcoin miners in North America, and whether it be financially, operationally, or technologically, we believe we are setting the pace for this industry. Given our momentum, our strong balance sheet, and the differentiators we are building with our technology stack, we are optimistic that the most exciting times for our organization are still to come.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Production Highlights Year-over-year Comparison Quarter-over-quarter comparison Metric Q4 2023 Q4 2022 % Δ Q4 2023 Q3 2023 % Δ BTC Produced 4,242 1,562 172% 4,242 3,490 22%Average Bitcoin Produced per Day 46.1 17.0 172% 46.1 37.9 22%Share of available miner rewards1 4.4% 1.8% 141% 4.4% 4.0% 11%Energized Hash Rate (EH/s)2 24.7 7.0 319% 24.7 19.1 29% Average Operational Hash Rate3 (EH/s) 19.4 N/A 19.4 14.2 37%Installed Hash Rate (EH/s)4 25.2 7.0 260% 25.2 23.1 9% 1.

Revenues increased 452% to $156.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 from $28.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022.

The Company sold 56% of the bitcoin it produced during the quarter to fund operating costs. There were no impairments in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to total impairments of $376.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Fourth quarter 2022 impairments included a $332.9 million impairment of mining equipment and advances to vendors, a $26.4 million impairment of digital assets, and a $16.7 million impairment of deposits due to vendor bankruptcy filing. Gains on digital assets were $213.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to none during the fourth quarter of 2022. The gains during the fourth quarter of 2023 were primarily due to the Company’s early adoption of ASU No. 2023-08, Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets, which requires the on-going measurement of crypto assets to fair value. Adjusted EBITDA improved to $260.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 from a loss of $374.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The year-over-year improvement was primarily due to improving profitability as total margin, excluding depreciation and amortization, improved to $81.7 million from a loss of $1.3 million in the year-ago period, combined with the aforementioned $213.6 million gains on digital assets and the absence of impairments recorded in 2022.

Revenues increased 229% to $387.5 million in 2023 from $117.8 million in 2022.

The Company sold 74% of the total bitcoin it produced in 2023 to fund operating costs. There were no impairments in 2023, compared to total impairments of $572.4 million 2022.

WRAC plans to delist its securities and terminate registration under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Williams Rowland Acquisition Corp. regarding the liquidation payment to shareholders is a significant financial event. The specified liquidation price of $10.51833316 per share is a critical figure for investors, as it directly affects the realized return on their investment. When assessing the implications, it is important to consider the original IPO price and the performance of the SPAC over its lifecycle to determine if investors are experiencing a gain or loss.Furthermore, the delisting from the NYSE American and the termination of the securities' registration have implications for market liquidity and the ability of shareholders to trade these securities. This move typically signifies the end of the SPAC's lifecycle and can be indicative of the company's inability to find a suitable acquisition target within the allotted timeframe.Investors should closely monitor the company's compliance with regulatory filings, as any delays or issues in filing the Form 25 or Form 15 could affect the timing of the liquidation process and payment distributions. Market Research Analyst Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) like Williams Rowland Acquisition Corp. have been a popular vehicle for taking companies public in recent years. However, the liquidation of a SPAC indicates that the company was unsuccessful in executing its primary objective of merging with a private entity to bring it to the public market. This liquidation event could reflect broader market trends, possibly signaling a contraction in the SPAC market or a shift in investor sentiment toward these types of investment vehicles.Analysts might investigate the performance of similar SPACs and the overall health of the SPAC market to provide context for this liquidation. This could help in understanding whether this event is an outlier or part of a larger industry trend. Legal Expert The process of delisting and deregistration outlined by Williams Rowland Acquisition Corp. follows a legal framework set by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The filing of a Form 25 initiates the delisting process and subsequently, a Form 15 is used to deregister the securities, exempting the company from further SEC reporting obligations. This is a standard procedure for a company in liquidation but requires careful legal oversight to ensure all regulatory requirements are met.It is essential for the company to adhere to the SEC's guidelines to prevent any legal complications that could delay the liquidation process. Stakeholders should be aware of the legal nuances of this process, as any missteps could potentially impact the timing and receipt of the liquidation payments. 02/28/2024 - 08:38 PM Westport, CT, Feb. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Williams Rowland Acquisition Corp.

Ball Corporation Announces Early Results of Cash Tender Offers for Certain Outstanding Debt Securities,2024-02-29T00:11:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Ball Corporation announces early results of Tender Offers for its Senior Notes due 2025 and 2026, with significant principal amounts tendered and accepted. The Total Consideration includes an Early Tender Premium and Accrued Interest, funded by proceeds from the sale of Ball's aerospace business.","Ball Corporation Announces Early Results of Cash Tender Offers for Certain Outstanding Debt Securities Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Ball Corporation announces early results of Tender Offers for its Senior Notes due 2025 and 2026, with significant principal amounts tendered and accepted. The Total Consideration includes an Early Tender Premium and Accrued Interest, funded by proceeds from the sale of Ball's aerospace business. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The early results of Ball Corporation's Tender Offers for their 2025 and 2026 Senior Notes suggest a strategic move to restructure the company's debt profile. By repurchasing a significant portion of their outstanding notes, Ball is potentially reducing future interest expenses and extending the maturity of its debt obligations. The high participation rate, with over 80% of the 2025 Notes and approximately 66% of the 2026 Notes tendered, indicates investor confidence in the company's liquidity and its ability to pay the Total Consideration, which includes an Early Tender Premium.This debt repurchase could improve Ball Corporation's balance sheet and potentially lead to a more favorable credit rating, which in turn may reduce the cost of borrowing in the future. However, this transaction will require a substantial outlay of cash, which is expected to be funded from the proceeds of the sale of Ball's aerospace business. Investors should monitor the company's cash flow statements in subsequent quarters to assess the impact of these transactions on liquidity. Market Research Analyst The Tender Offers may reflect broader market trends where corporations are taking advantage of favorable conditions to refinance or retire existing debt. The timing of the Tender Offers and the use of proceeds from the sale of a major business segment to fund them could indicate Ball's strategic focus on core operations and a streamlined business model.For the stock market, such financial maneuvers are often seen as a sign of proactive financial management. Provided the aerospace business sale does not detract from Ball's overall market position, this could be viewed positively by investors. It's important to consider the potential impact on Ball's operational capabilities without the aerospace segment and whether the company is repositioning for growth in its remaining divisions. Legal Expert The conditions and stipulations outlined in the Offer to Purchase document are legally binding and critical for understanding the implications of the Tender Offers. The fact that Ball Corporation reserves the right to amend, extend, or terminate the Tender Offers or waive any condition without taking similar action with respect to the other offer is a common legal provision that provides the company with flexibility in managing the Tender Offers. Stakeholders should be aware of these provisions as they could affect the timing and success of the Tender Offers.Additionally, the legal framework governing these transactions ensures that Ball is not obligated to accept for payment, or pay for, any tendered Notes if certain conditions are not satisfied. This protects the company from unforeseen circumstances that may arise before the completion of the Tender Offers. 02/28/2024 - 07:11 PM WESTMINSTER, Colo., Feb. 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Ball Corporation (""Ball"") (NYSE: BALL) announced today the early results of its previously announced offers to purchase for cash (i) any and all of the $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 5.25% Senior Notes due 2025 (the ""2025 Notes"") and (ii) any and all of the $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 4.875% Senior Notes due 2026 (the ""2026 Notes"" and, together with the 2025 Notes, the ""Notes"").

(NYSE: NL) declares a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share on its common stock, payable on March 21, 2024. The company operates in component products and chemicals businesses. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a quarterly dividend by NL Industries, Inc. signals a sustained commitment to returning value to shareholders. A dividend of eight cents ($0.08) per share, although modest, indicates the company's confidence in its ongoing profitability and financial stability. This confidence is particularly notable given the cyclical nature of the component products and chemicals sectors.Investors should consider the dividend yield in relation to the current stock price to assess the return on investment. The consistency and growth of dividend distributions over time are key indicators of a company's financial health and are often scrutinized by investors seeking stable income streams. However, it's essential to balance dividend payments with the need for reinvestment in the company for long-term growth.Furthermore, the timing of the dividend payment should be noted. Shareholders of record by March 11, 2024, will be eligible for the dividend payout, which could influence stock trading patterns around this date. The ex-dividend date, typically set two business days before the record date, is also a critical point for investors to be aware of. Market Research Analyst Within the broader context of the market, NL Industries' dividend announcement can be a reflection of its sector's health. Companies in the component products and chemicals industries often face fluctuating demand based on macroeconomic factors. The recreational marine components segment, for instance, is sensitive to consumer discretionary spending, which can be influenced by economic cycles.Investors may view the consistent payment of dividends as a positive sign amid economic uncertainties. It suggests that NL Industries is managing its capital effectively and is not overly burdened by debt or other financial obligations that could otherwise divert funds from shareholder payouts.It's also important to consider how NL Industries' dividend policy compares with industry peers. A higher or lower dividend yield could reflect the company's market position, operational efficiency and strategic priorities. For instance, a company prioritizing growth may reinvest profits rather than pay out dividends, while a more mature company might distribute regular dividends to shareholders. 02/28/2024 - 04:20 PM Dallas, Texas, Feb. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NL Industries, Inc. (NYSE: NL) today announced that its board of directors has declared a quarterly dividend of eight cents ($0.08) per share on its common stock, payable on March 21, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 11, 2024.

Earnings call scheduled for February 29, 2024, to discuss Q4 operating results. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported GAAP net income for ACRES Commercial Realty Corp. (ACR) indicates a tangible performance metric that directly affects shareholder value. The figure of $1.7 million, or $0.20 per share-diluted, is a critical data point for evaluating the company's profitability and financial health. It is essential to compare this result with previous quarters or years to assess whether the company is on a growth trajectory or facing challenges. Furthermore, the net income figure can influence the company's stock price as it reflects the company's ability to generate earnings. Investors and analysts will also examine the company's operational efficiency and the management's effectiveness in maintaining credit quality, as highlighted by the CEO. Market Research Analyst ACRES Commercial Realty Corp.'s focus on maintaining and managing commercial real estate mortgage loans and equity investments is a strategy that aligns with current real estate market trends. The emphasis on credit quality of investments is particularly noteworthy in a fluctuating economic environment where interest rates and property values can impact loan performance. The real estate investment trust (REIT) sector is subject to specific market forces, such as changes in property demand, rent levels and occupancy rates, which can significantly impact the revenue streams from equity investments. The company's performance in this context is a barometer for the sector's health and can signal broader market trends to investors. Real Estate Investment Trust Analyst As a REIT, ACRES Commercial Realty Corp. must distribute at least 90% of its taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends, which makes the net income figure particularly relevant for dividend expectations. The reported earnings per share (EPS) provide insights into the company's dividend-paying potential. Additionally, the management's commitment to enhancing shareholder value through careful investment selection and credit quality management is a positive sign for potential and current investors. However, it is important to analyze the company's payout ratio, debt levels and the sustainability of its dividend policy, especially in a sector where cash flow predictability is vital. 02/28/2024 - 04:15 PM UNIONDALE, N.Y., Feb. 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- ACRES Commercial Realty Corp.

Financial results show increased collaboration revenue, extended cash runway, and progress in key partnerships.","Merus Announces Financial Results for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 and Provides Business Update Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Merus N.V. announces plans for transformative year in 2024 with phase 3 trials, BLA submissions, and ongoing clinical developments. Financial results show increased collaboration revenue, extended cash runway, and progress in key partnerships. Positive Merus N.V. is set for a significant year in 2024 with plans to initiate phase 3 trials for petosemtamab in head and neck cancer, evaluate in colorectal cancer, and submit BLAs for Zeno in NRG1+ lung and pancreatic cancer. The company's financial results for 2023 indicate increased collaboration revenue, extended cash runway until 2027, and progress in key partnerships with Incyte and Loxo Oncology at Lilly. Merus continues to focus on developing innovative antibodies through its Biclonics® and Triclonics® platforms, with a strong emphasis on clinical advancements and potential regulatory approvals. The company's strategic collaborations with Incyte and Loxo Oncology at Lilly have resulted in milestone achievements, reimbursement for research activities, and potential commercial milestones and royalties for approved products. Merus' clinical developments include ongoing trials for petosemtamab and Zeno in various cancer indications, with plans for phase 3 trials, BLA submissions, and potential commercialization partnerships. The company's financial performance for 2023 reflects increased collaboration revenue, decreased research and development expenses, and extended cash runway, showcasing a strong financial position for future growth and development. Negative None. Financial Analyst Merus N.V.'s announcement regarding their clinical trials and financial results has significant implications for investors and stakeholders. The initiation of phase 3 trials for petosemtamab in 2L+ HNSCC and the planned evaluation in 2L colorectal cancer (CRC) represent milestones that could lead to accelerated and regular FDA approvals, contingent upon positive outcomes. This is noteworthy as successful phase 3 results often serve as a catalyst for stock price appreciation, given their role in the drug approval process.Moreover, the financial stability of the company, with a cash runway extending into 2027, suggests a reduced risk of near-term dilution for shareholders. This is a positive signal for the stock market, as it implies that the company has sufficient funds to support its operations and clinical trials without the immediate need for additional capital raises that could potentially dilute existing shares. The increased collaboration revenue, especially from Incyte, along with milestone payments, reflects a strong partnership foundation, which could lead to future revenue streams and further bolster investor confidence. Medical Research Analyst The Fast Track Designation (FTD) and Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) granted by the FDA to petosemtamab and zenocutuzumab (Zeno), respectively, are critical factors in the potential expedited development and review of these drugs. The FTD for petosemtamab targets a patient population with unmet medical needs, which could lead to a faster path to market and a competitive advantage. The BTD for Zeno in NRG1+ cancers, including lung and pancreatic cancer, underscores the potential of this therapy in addressing rare and hard-to-treat cancers, potentially leading to a significant impact on patient care and a strong market positioning if approved.The interim data showing favorable safety profiles and efficacy results for petosemtamab and Zeno are promising indicators of their potential therapeutic value. The ORR and median duration of response (DOR) are key metrics in oncology that can influence regulatory decisions and market adoption. The data presented at medical congresses can increase visibility among the medical community, potentially fostering early adoption if the drugs are approved. Market Research Analyst Merus N.V.'s focus on developing multispecific antibodies, such as Biclonics® and Triclonics®, positions the company at the forefront of a growing segment within the biopharmaceutical industry. The advancements in their Multiclonics® platforms and the potential to develop innovative antibodies for both their pipeline and collaborators highlight the company's R&D capabilities and the potential for future licensing deals or partnerships. Such deals could lead to additional revenue streams and strategic growth opportunities.The company's collaborations with Incyte and Loxo Oncology at Lilly demonstrate the industry's interest in Merus' technology and could be indicative of the company's potential to secure more partnerships. This not only validates the company's technology but also diversifies the risk associated with the company's pipeline.

(Nasdaq: MRUS) (Merus, the Company, we, or our), a clinical-stage oncology company developing innovative, full-length multispecific antibodies (Biclonics® and Triclonics®), today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year and provided a business update. “2024 is poised to be a transformational year for Merus. For petosemtamab, we plan to start a phase 3 registration trial in 2L+ HNSCC in mid-2024. In the first-line setting, we plan to provide initial data on the combination with pembrolizumab in the second quarter and are preparing for a potential first-line phase 3 trial. This year, we also plan to evaluate petosemtamab in 2L colorectal cancer,” said Bill Lundberg, M.D., President, Chief Executive Officer of Merus. “Additionally, for Zeno we are preparing our first potential BLA submissions in NRG1+ lung and NRG1+ pancreatic cancer. We are also excited by continued enhancements to our productive Multiclonics® platforms, which serve as our engine to develop innovative antibodies both for our own pipeline and for our collaborators.” Petosemtamab (MCLA-158: EGFR x LGR5 Biclonics®): Solid TumorsPhase 3 registration trial in 2L+ head & neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) on track to initiate mid-2024; dose comparison of petosemtamab monotherapy 1100 vs 1500 mg in previously treated (2L+) HNSCC ongoing; evaluation in combination with pembrolizumab as first-line (1L) therapy ongoing; planned initiation of 2L colorectal cancer (CRC) cohort in 2024 Merus plans to initiate a phase 3 clinical trial in mid-2024 to evaluate petosemtamab monotherapy in 2L+ HNSCC. In the planned trial, patients will be randomized to petosemtamab monotherapy or investigators’ choice of single agent chemotherapy or cetuximab. Merus believes a randomized registration trial in HNSCC with an overall response rate (ORR) endpoint could potentially support accelerated approval and the overall survival (OS) results from the same study could potentially verify its clinical benefit to support regular approval. Merus continues to evaluate approximately 40 patients treated with petosemtamab monotherapy at either 1100 or 1500 mg dose levels to confirm a suitable dose for future potential phase 3 trials. Merus plans to share clinical data from this cohort in the second half of 2024. Merus also continues to evaluate patients with untreated advanced PD-L1+ HNSCC treated with petosemtamab 1500 mg in combination with pembrolizumab. Initial safety data from this single arm cohort may support the initiation of a 1L phase 3 trial with this combination. Among the initial patients dosed in the 1L combination cohort, the safety profile has been observed to be generally favorable. Merus plans to report initial interim efficacy and safety data from this cohort in the second quarter of 2024. At the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2023, Merus provided interim data on 49 2L+ HNSCC patients that were treated with petosemtamab at the recommended phase 2 dose of 1500 mg intravenous every two weeks. 43 patients were evaluable for efficacy. As of a February 1, 2023 data cutoff date, the ORR was 37.2% by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 per investigator assessment. Petosemtamab continued to demonstrate a manageable safety profile. Merus plans to provide updated efficacy, durability and safety data of this cohort in the second half of 2024. The U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track Designation (FTD) for petosemtamab for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC whose disease has progressed following treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and an anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) antibody. FTD is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill unmet medical needs. In 2024, Merus is planning to initiate the evaluation of petosemtamab monotherapy in 2L CRC. Zenocutuzumab (Zeno or MCLA-128: HER2 x HER3 Biclonics®): NRG1 fusion-positive (NRG1+) lung, pancreatic and other solid tumorsSufficient clinical data expected in 1H24 to support potential BLA submissions in NRG1+ non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and NRG1+ pancreatic cancer (PDAC) Zeno is being investigated in the phase 1/2 eNRGy trial and Early Access Program (EAP) which are assessing the safety and anti-tumor activity of Zeno monotherapy in NRG1+ cancer. In 2023, Merus met with the FDA and based on these productive and collaborative discussions, the Company believes it will have sufficient clinical data in the first half of 2024 to support potential Biologics License Application (BLA) submissions in NRG1+ NSCLC and NRG1+ PDAC. Merus believes that obtaining a commercialization partnership agreement will be an essential step in bringing Zeno to patients with NRG1+ cancer, if approved. In 2023, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) to Zeno for the treatment of patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic NRG1+ pancreatic cancer following progression with prior systemic therapy or who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. Additionally, the FDA granted BTD to Zeno for the treatment of patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic NRG1+ NSCLC, following progression with prior systemic therapy. Merus shared updated interim clinical data on our Zeno program (eNRGy trial and EAP) in patients with NRG1+ NSCLC and NRG1+ PDAC at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2023. In 78 evaluable NRG1+ NSCLC patients, as of a July 31, 2023 data cutoff date, a 37% ORR per RECIST v1.1 by investigator assessment and 14.9 months median duration of response (DOR) was reported. In 33 evaluable NRG1+ PDAC patients, a 42% ORR per RECIST v1.1 by investigator assessment and 9.1 months median DOR was reported. Zeno continued to demonstrate a well-tolerated safety profile. Merus also evaluated patients with castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) treated with Zeno in combination with an androgen deprivation therapy (enzalutamide or abiraterone), irrespective of NRG1+ status. Enrollment is complete and Merus plans to continue monitoring these patients. The Company also continues to monitor and evaluate patients treated with Zeno in combination with afatinib but no further enrollment is planned at this time. The Company is also conducting ongoing translational work on potential biomarkers outside of NRG1+ cancer which may support development opportunities for Zeno in additional areas of unmet need. MCLA-129 (EGFR x c-MET Biclonics®): Solid TumorsInvestigation of MCLA-129 continues in the MET ex14 NSCLC expansion cohort in the phase 1/2 trial; MCLA-129 in combination with chemotherapy in 2L+ EGFR mutant (EGFRm) NSCLC planned to start in 2024 MCLA-129 is in clinical development in a phase 1/2, open-label clinical trial evaluating MCLA-129 monotherapy in patients with MET ex14 NSCLC and Merus plans to start a cohort of MCLA-129 in combination with chemotherapy in 2L+ EGFRm NSCLC in 2024. In December at the ESMO Asia Congress 2023 interim data was presented on MCLA-129 from ongoing expansion cohorts in NSCLC and in previously treated HNSCC. Patients with advanced/metastatic EGFRm NSCLC were treated with MCLA-129 combined with osimertinib as first-line therapy or in the 2L+ setting after progression on osimertinib. In the 1L setting, all 16 evaluable patients experienced tumor shrinkage. In the 2L+ setting, 34 patients were evaluable for response with 11 experiencing confirmed PRs and 1 unconfirmed PR by RECIST v1.1. per investigator assessment. We continue to monitor these patients and evaluate potential for biomarkers to maximize efficacy, while proactively addressing safety signals seen to date. We also remain interested in exploring partnering MCLA-129 with other companies to sufficiently resource the development of MCLA-129 and potential benefit it may have for patients. MCLA-129 is subject to a collaboration and license agreement with Betta Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd. (Betta), which permits Betta to develop MCLA-129 and potentially commercialize exclusively in China, while Merus retains global rights outside of China. MCLA-145 (CD137 x PD-L1 Biclonics®): Solid TumorsInvestigation continues of the phase 1 trial of MCLA-145 in combination with pembrolizumab MCLA-145 is in clinical development in a global, phase 1, open-label, clinical trial evaluating MCLA-145 in patients with solid tumors. The trial is in the dose expansion phase, with the Company monitoring and evaluating patients on treatment with the combination of MCLA-145 with pembrolizumab. Collaborations Incyte CorporationSince 2017, Merus has been working with Incyte Corporation (Incyte) under a global collaboration and license agreement focused on the research, discovery and development of bispecific antibodies utilizing Merus’ proprietary Biclonics® technology platform. The agreement grants Incyte certain exclusive rights for up to ten bispecific and monospecific antibody programs. The collaboration is progressing, with multiple programs in various stages of preclinical and clinical development. For each program under the collaboration, Merus receives reimbursement for research activities and is eligible to receive potential development, regulatory and commercial milestones and sales royalties for any products, if approved. Further, Incyte announced, in 2023, that INCA33890, a novel TGFBr2xPD-1 bispecific antibody developed through the collaboration is currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Merus achieved a milestone and received a payment of $2.5 million related to the advancement of this program in the third quarter of 2023. Merus also achieved an additional milestone of $1 million for candidate nomination in the fourth quarter of 2023. This is the third program to undergo candidate nomination under the collaboration. Loxo Oncology at LillyIn January 2021, Merus and Loxo Oncology at Lilly, a research and development group of Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly), announced a research collaboration and exclusive license agreement to develop up to three CD3-engaging T-cell re-directing bispecific antibody therapies utilizing Merus’ Biclonics® platform and proprietary CD3 panel along with the scientific and rational drug design expertise of Loxo Oncology at Lilly. The collaboration is progressing with multiple active research programs underway.

Positive The IPO raised transformative capital for growth. Total assets increased by 26.2% to $4.53 billion. Net loans grew by 29.0% to $3.86 billion. Net interest income rose by 23.9% to $130.1 million. Noninterest income increased by 67.9% to $15.6 million. Noninterest expense surged by 68.5% to $119.9 million, including one-time costs. The allowance for credit losses was $32.2 million. Non-performing loans totaled $10.8 million. The 2024 annual meeting of shareholders is set for May 22, 2024. Negative Net income declined to $9.8 million due to one-time expenses. The net interest margin decreased to 3.41%. Noninterest expense increased by 68.5% to $119.9 million. The Company recorded provisions for credit losses of $13.9 million. Delinquencies were $10.0 million at December 31, 2023. Financial Analyst Reviewing NB Bancorp, Inc.'s financial results reveals a complex year influenced by significant one-time expenses. The net income of $9.8 million, when adjusted for conversion and IPO-related expenses, suggests an underlying operational strength with a $34.3 million figure, surpassing the previous year's net income. This indicates a robust core business performance, despite the superficial dip in reported net income.The $19.1 million charitable contribution, while substantial, is a strategic move that could yield long-term community goodwill and potential tax benefits. However, investors should note the dilutive effect of the additional 1.7 million shares issued. The balance sheet expansion by 26.2% and the growth in net loans by 29.0%, particularly in commercial and industrial loans, signal aggressive expansion and could suggest confidence in future economic conditions or a strategic shift to capture more market share. Market Research Analyst The financial results indicate NB Bancorp, Inc. is actively responding to market demands, with significant growth in commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. This pivot towards commercial lending is a trend seen across the banking sector, as institutions seek higher yields in a rising interest rate environment. The increase in net interest income by 23.9% reflects effectively capitalizing on higher rates, although the slight decrease in net interest margin suggests a competitive lending landscape and possibly rising funding costs.The growth in customer deposits, particularly certificates of deposit, indicates successful deposit-gathering strategies amid a competitive rate environment. This could suggest customer loyalty and trust in the institution, which is crucial for sustaining growth. Additionally, the substantial increase in noninterest income, including swap contract income and Employee Retention Credit income, diversifies revenue streams, reducing reliance on traditional interest-based income. Economist The financial results from NB Bancorp, Inc. provide insights into broader economic trends. The rapid asset growth and the increase in loan originations, particularly adjustable-rate residential loans, suggest that the housing market in their operating regions remains active. However, this could also expose the bank to interest rate risk if rates continue to rise. The adoption of the CECL methodology for credit losses indicates compliance with recent regulatory changes aimed at more accurately forecasting loan losses, which is critical in the current economic climate of uncertainty and potential for increased loan defaults.Investors should consider the potential impact of economic slowdowns on NB Bancorp's aggressive growth strategy. While the current expansion appears sustainable, a downturn could increase the risk profile of the new loans. The decrease in non-performing loans and delinquencies is a positive sign, but continuous monitoring of asset quality is essential, especially given the bank's focus on commercial lending, which can be more volatile than consumer lending. 02/28/2024 - 07:04 PM NEEDHAM, Mass., Feb. 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- NB Bancorp, Inc. (the ""Company"") (Nasdaq Capital Market: NBBK), the holding company of Needham Bank, today announced its 2023 financial results. Concurrent with its mutual-to-stock conversion and as described in the prospectus for its initial public offering (""IPO""), the Company made a one-time donation of $2.0 million in cash and 1.7 million shares of common stock to the Needham Bank Charitable Foundation at a total market value of $19.1 million. This contribution, in addition to a one-time conversion and IPO-related compensation, pension termination expense and tax expense related to the impact of public company tax laws resulted in net income of $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to net income of $30.1 million reported for the year ended December 31, 2022. Net income excluding conversion and IPO-related expenses, which excludes these one-time amounts, was $34.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $30.1 million reported for the prior year. ""The capital that the Company raised from its IPO will be transformative as we move forward. It will provide us with the ability to grow in a safe and prudent manner, allowing us to be selective in how we deploy the capital into growing market share and serving our customers' needs,"" said Joseph Campanelli, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. ""The team's efforts in completing the IPO were exceptional. We look forward to continue building on our 132-year history of serving the local communities.""

The increase in interest income was attributable to increases from both rates and volume, which contributed $53.9 million and $46.1 million, respectively.

The Company will not receive any proceeds from the offering, expected to close on March 4, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The secondary offering of Sotera Health Company's common stock represents a notable event for current and potential investors. The pricing at $14.75 per share for 25 million shares indicates a considerable liquidity event for the selling stockholders, which include prominent private equity firms and company insiders. This transaction may have implications for the company's stock liquidity and could potentially affect the stock price due to the increased number of shares available in the market.Investors should be aware that the company itself is not receiving any proceeds from this offering, which means the capital structure and operational funds remain unchanged. However, the sale by major affiliates and insiders might be interpreted as a signal about their perspective on the company's valuation or future prospects. The underwriters' option to purchase additional shares could further dilute existing shareholders if exercised.It is also noteworthy that the company has agreed to pay certain offering expenses, which could impact its financial statements, albeit likely minimally in comparison to its overall financial position. The involvement of a robust team of underwriters and co-managers suggests a high level of interest and confidence in managing the offering successfully. Market Research Analyst From a market dynamics perspective, the secondary offering by Sotera Health Company could be a strategic move by the selling stockholders to capitalize on favorable market conditions or to diversify their investment portfolios. The pricing of the offering relative to the current market price will be a critical factor for the market's reception of this event.Analyzing the company's recent performance and market trends can provide insights into the timing of the offering. If the company's sector is experiencing growth, the offering might attract more interest, potentially minimizing any negative impact on the stock price. Conversely, if the sector is facing headwinds, the additional shares could weigh on the stock's performance.Furthermore, the secondary offering could increase the stock's float, which is the number of shares available for trading. A larger float can lead to better price discovery and more stable trading volumes, which might appeal to institutional investors seeking liquidity. However, it could also mean more volatility if the market absorbs the new shares with difficulty. Legal Expert In terms of compliance and regulatory considerations, the announcement indicates that a registration statement for the securities has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and has become effective automatically. This suggests that Sotera Health Company has met all the necessary regulatory requirements for the offering, which is critical for investor confidence.The effectiveness of the registration statement also means that the company has provided the SEC and, by extension, potential investors, with requisite information about the offering, including financial statements and risks associated with the company. This transparency is essential for informed investment decisions.It is also important to note that the offering is restricted from being sold in jurisdictions where it would be unlawful without proper registration or qualification under the applicable securities laws. This legal framework helps protect investors and maintain orderly markets. 02/28/2024 - 06:40 PM CLEVELAND, Feb. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sotera Health Company (Nasdaq: SHC) (the “Company”) today announced the pricing of its secondary offering (the “Offering”) of 25,000,000 shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at a price to the public of $14.75 per share.

Despite challenges, the company remains optimistic about the future, focusing on innovation and growth opportunities.","Intchains Group Limited Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Unaudited Financial Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Intchains Group Limited (ICG) announced its unaudited financial results for Q4 and full year 2023, with a decrease in ASIC chip sales volume but an increase in revenue. Despite challenges, the company remains optimistic about the future, focusing on innovation and growth opportunities. Positive Sales volume of ASIC chips decreased by 36.5% in Q4 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. Revenue for Q4 2023 increased by 5.3% from the previous year, driven by a one-off sale of intelligent router products. Net income for Q4 2023 decreased by 36.2% compared to the same period in 2022. Full year 2023 saw a 55.0% decrease in ASIC chip sales volume compared to 2022. Revenue for full year 2023 decreased by 82.6% from 2022 due to challenges in the cryptocurrency market. Net loss for full year 2023 was RMB26.8 million compared to a net income of RMB355.2 million in 2022. Negative The company experienced significant declines in sales volume and revenue for both Q4 and full year 2023. Net income decreased for both Q4 and full year 2023, indicating financial challenges. The net loss for full year 2023 was substantial, highlighting the impact of market conditions on the company's financial performance. Financial Analyst The reported financial results for Intchains Group Limited indicate a mixed performance, with a decrease in sales volume of ASIC chips by 36.5% in Q4 2023 and a significant year-over-year decrease of 55.0% for the full year. However, the company managed a 5.3% revenue increase in Q4 due to a one-off sale of intelligent router products. The full-year revenue decrease of 82.6% is a stark contrast to the previous year, highlighting the volatility in the cryptocurrency market and its impact on companies like Intchains that supply ASIC chips for blockchain applications. The net income for Q4 decreased by 36.2% and the company recorded a net loss for the full year, compared to a net income in the previous year, which is a concerning sign for stakeholders.From a financial perspective, the acquisition of the Goldshell brand and the upcoming mass production of their new 12nm ASIC chip could potentially turn around the company's fortunes. However, investors should be cautious and monitor the cryptocurrency market trends closely, as they directly affect the demand for ASIC chips. The company's efforts to optimize capital utilization and diversify its product offerings may mitigate some risks associated with market volatility. Market Research Analyst Intchains Group's strategic moves, including the acquisition of Goldshell brand assets and the introduction of new computing equipment for blockchain applications, indicate an attempt to diversify and strengthen its market position. The shift towards a 12nm process node for ASIC chip manufacturing may offer competitive advantages in terms of power efficiency and performance, which is crucial in the blockchain and cryptocurrency markets.However, the overall decrease in sales volume and the significant full-year revenue drop reflect the broader downturn in the cryptocurrency market, which has been affected by regulatory uncertainties and market sentiment. The company's future performance will likely hinge on the recovery of the cryptocurrency market and the successful adoption of its new products. Investors and industry observers should watch for the market's reception of the Goldshell-branded equipment and the performance metrics of the new ASIC chips once they enter mass production. Technology Analyst The transition to a 12nm process node for ASIC chip manufacturing by Intchains Group is a noteworthy development in the semiconductor industry. This move places the company within a competitive technological landscape, where efficiency and performance are paramount. The ASIC chip market for blockchain applications is highly sensitive to technological advancements and Intchains' ability to innovate could play a pivotal role in its market share capture and overall business resilience.Furthermore, the acquisition of Goldshell brand assets suggests an expansion into the consumer-facing side of blockchain hardware, which may open up new revenue streams. However, the success of these initiatives will depend on the company's execution and the ability to scale production in response to market demand. Stakeholders should consider the potential of Intchains' R&D investments to yield products that meet the evolving needs of the blockchain industry. 02/28/2024 - 06:00 PM SHANGHAI, China, Feb. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Intchains Group Limited (Nasdaq: ICG) (“we,” or the “Company”), a provider of integrated solutions consisting of high-performance computing ASIC chip products and ancillary software and hardware for blockchain applications, today announced its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Fourth Quarter 2023 Operating and Financial Highlights Sales volume of ASIC chips was 423,040 units for the fourth quarter of 2023, representing a decrease of 36.5% from 666,420 units for the same period of 2022. Fourth quarter ASIC chip sales consisted of 287,872 units sold directly to customers and 135,168 units embedded in computing equipment for blockchain applications that we began offering to customers in the fourth quarter of 2023.Revenue was RMB35.5 million (US$5.0 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023, representing an increase of 5.3% from RMB33.7 million for the same period of 2022.Net income was RMB8.1 million (US$1.1 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023, representing a decrease of 36.2% from RMB12.7 million for the same period of 2022. Full Year 2023 Operating and Financial Highlights Sales volume of ASIC chips was 1,457,373 units for the year ended December 31, 2023, representing a year-over-year decrease of 55.0% from 3,235,235 units for 2022. Full year 2023 ASIC chip sales consisted of 1,322,205 units sold directly to customers and 135,168 units embedded in computing equipment for blockchain applications that we began offering to customers in the fourth quarter of 2023.Revenue was RMB82.2 million (US$11.6 million) for the year ended December 31, 2023, representing a year-over-year decrease of 82.6% from RMB473.7 million for 2022.Net loss was RMB26.8 million (US$3.8 million) for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to a net income of RMB355.2 million for 2022. Mr. Qiang Ding, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “2023 was a year filled with accomplishments as well as challenges for Intchains. Our successful first quarter listing on the Nasdaq marked the commencement of an exciting new stage in our development. Throughout the year, we actively addressed evolving market conditions with investments in innovative technology, enhancing our competitiveness, and extending our presence across the industry value chain. Our latest ASIC chip, designed and manufactured using a 12nm process node, completed the relevant IC verification and trial production processes in February 2024 and is set to enter mass production in March 2024. Furthermore, following our successful acquisition of the Goldshell brand and related assets in February 2024, we expect to officially launch our Goldshell-branded computing equipment for blockchain applications in March 2024. In addition to these positive developments, our revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 experienced significant growth of 418.2% compared to the third quarter, due to the fourth quarter rebound of the cryptocurrency market, following a downturn in the preceding quarter. As a result, we achieved quarterly profitability for the fourth quarter of 2023. Despite short-term volatility, we are confident in the industry’s trajectory for 2024 and the long-term prospects of the entire WEB3 landscape. We will continue to optimize capital utilization efficiency as we pursue further development opportunities along the value chain, laying a robust foundation for our sustainable growth.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Revenue Revenue was RMB35.5 million (US$5.0 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023, representing an increase of 5.3% from RMB33.7 million for the same period of 2022. Our revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily comprised revenue derived from the sales of our ASIC chips, computing equipment that incorporated our ASIC chips for blockchain applications, ancillary software and hardware and others. The increase was primarily attributable to a one-off sale of intelligent router products which generated RMB12.6 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023. These intelligent router products were acquired from third parties and integrated with our software solutions for resale purposes. This was a one-off transaction for us and we currently have no intention to continue this business in the future. This increase in revenue was partially offset by the decrease in ASIC chip sales volumes. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue was RMB14.1 million (US$2.0 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023, representing a decrease of 29.3% from RMB20.0 million for the same period of 2022. The decrease was mainly attributable to the reversal of the write-off of the intelligent router products referenced above. We wrote off the intelligent router products in the second quarter of 2023 due to our belief that they could not be sold considering the adverse market conditions. This write-off was reversed in full in the fourth quarter of 2023 upon the sale of the intelligent router products. This reversal reduced our total cost of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023. The decrease in our ASIC chip sales volumes also contributed to the decrease in our cost of revenue. Operating Expenses Total operating expenses were RMB22.8 million (US$3.2 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023, representing an increase of 79.0% from RMB12.7 million for the same period of 2022. This increase was due to an increase in each category of operating expenses. Research and development expenses increased by 40.2% to RMB14.0 million (US$2.0 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023 from RMB10.0 million for the same period of 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to increased intellectual property expenses, labor costs and depreciation and amortization expenses for the design of ASIC chips.Sales and marketing expenses increased by 65.3% to RMB1.8 million (US$0.3 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023 from RMB1.1 million for the same period of 2022, mainly driven by increased personnel-related expenses.General and administrative expenses increased by 316.6% to RMB7.0 million (US$1.0 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023 from RMB1.7 million for the same period of 2022, primarily due to increased lease-related expenses, labor costs, and professional expenses. Interest Income Interest income increased by 22.3% to RMB4.2 million (US$0.6 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023 from RMB3.5 million for the same period of 2022, mainly attributable to our effective cash management. Other Income, net Our other income, net, decreased by 29.6% to RMB7.5 million (US$1.1 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023 from RMB10.6 million for the same period of 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in grants received from the local government. The grants were issued in support of eligible IC industry projects with no repayment obligations. Net Income As a result of the foregoing, we recorded a net income of RMB8.1 million (US$1.1 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023, representing a decrease of 36.2% from RMB12.7 million for the same period of 2022. Basic and Diluted Net Earnings Per Ordinary Share Basic and diluted net earnings per ordinary share decreased by 36.4% to RMB0.07 (US$0.01) for the fourth quarter of 2023 from RMB0.11 for the same period of 2022. Each ADS represents two of the Company’s Class A ordinary shares. Full Year 2023 Financial Results Revenue Revenue was RMB82.2 million (US$11.6 million) in 2023, representing a decrease of 82.6% from RMB473.7 million in 2022. The decrease was mainly due to the overall challenging cryptocurrency market in 2023, leading to decreases in the sales volume and average selling price of our ASIC chips, partially offset by the revenue of RMB13.8 million derived from the sales of certain intelligent router products referenced above. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue was RMB73.1 million (US$10.3 million) for the year ended December 31, 2023, representing a decrease of 15.9% from RMB87.0 million for 2022. The decrease was mainly attributable to the decline in sales volume of our ASIC chips, largely offset by an inventory write-down and a prepayment write-down, totaling approximately RMB24.7 million. Operating Expenses Total operating expenses were RMB74.0 million (US$10.4 million) for 2023, representing an increase of 15.7% from RMB64.0 million for 2022. This increase was primarily due to increases in both sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses, partially offset by a decrease in research and development expenses. Research and development expenses decreased by 12.6% to RMB42.3 million (US$6.0 million) for 2023 from RMB48.4 million for 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to the different stages of our research and development projects during the reporting period, partially offset by an increase in labor costs and depreciation and amortization expenses.Sales and marketing expenses increased by 60.5% to RMB6.5 million (US$0.9 million) for 2023 from RMB4.1 million for 2022, mainly due to an increase in personnel-related expenses.General and administrative expenses increased by 118.1% to RMB25.2 million (US$3.6 million) for 2023 from RMB11.6 million for 2022, primarily due to an increase in rental expenses, labor costs and professional expenses. Interest Income Interest income increased by 50.5% to RMB16.8 million (US$2.4 million) for 2023 from RMB11.1 million for 2022, mainly attributable to our effective cash management. Other Income, net Our other income, net decreased by 55.6% to RMB13.2 million (US$1.9 million) for 2023 from RMB29.7 million for 2022. The decrease was primarily due to decreased grants received from the local government. The grants were issued in support of eligible IC industry projects with no repayment obligations. Net Loss As a result of the foregoing, we recorded a net loss of RMB26.8 million (US$3.8 million) for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared with a net income of RMB355.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Ordinary Share Basic and diluted net loss per ordinary share were RMB0.22 (US$0.03) for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared with basic and diluted net earnings per ordinary share of RMB3.02 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Each ADS represents two of the Company’s Class A ordinary shares.

Despite increasing expenses, the company shows positive performance and outlines a growth outlook for 2024. Positive Strong Q4 and full year 2023 financial results with revenue growth Introduction of Cytek Orion reagent cocktail preparation system Strategic agreement with CRG and UPF for technological innovation Share repurchase program and positive net income outlook for 2024 Increased headcount and personnel expenses impacting operating costs Negative Decrease in gross profit margin for Q4 and full year 2023 Significant increase in operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 Loss from operations and net loss reported for the year ended December 31, 2023 Financial Analyst The reported financial results by Cytek Biosciences indicate a robust 21% increase in total revenue for Q4 2023 and an 18% increase for the full year, compared to the previous year. These figures, particularly the revenue growth from the product lines acquired from Luminex, suggest strong performance and successful integration of the new product lines. The revenue growth is slightly lower on a constant currency basis, which could imply the effect of foreign exchange rates on reported revenue.The gross profit margin shows a decline from 61% to 57% in Q4 and from 62% to 57% for the full year, which may raise concerns about cost management or pricing pressures. The increase in operating expenses, primarily due to the Luminex acquisition, aligns with the company's expansion but warrants monitoring to ensure it does not erode profitability in the long term. The share repurchase program reflects management's confidence in the company's valuation and future prospects.Looking ahead, the projected revenue growth of 5% to 10% for 2024 is modest, suggesting a cautious outlook possibly due to market saturation or increased competition. The expectation of positive net income for 2024 is a reversal from the net loss reported in 2023, indicating management's focus on cost control and operational efficiency. Market Research Analyst Cytek's expansion of its organic installed base and the introduction of the Cytek Orion reagent cocktail preparation system demonstrate the company's commitment to innovation and market leadership. The strategic agreement with the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) and the Pompeu Fabra University (UPF) could enhance Cytek's research capabilities and lead to future product developments, strengthening its market position.The stock repurchase indicates a potential undervaluation by the market, which could be an attractive signal to investors. However, the decline in gross profit margin and the increase in operating expenses may concern investors seeking long-term profitability. The company's forward-looking statements about revenue growth and profitability for 2024 should be weighed against the backdrop of the competitive landscape in the cell analysis solutions industry. Biotechnology Industry Analyst The financial results of Cytek Biosciences reflect the impact of strategic acquisitions and product innovation within the biotechnology and cell analysis sector. The acquisition of Luminex's product lines has contributed significantly to Cytek's revenue, underscoring the importance of mergers and acquisitions in driving growth in this industry. The fully automated antibody cocktail preparation instrument for flow cytometry represents a technological advancement that may increase efficiency for researchers and could be a differentiator in the market.However, the reported decline in gross profit margins suggests that the costs associated with integrating acquisitions and developing new technologies are substantial. It is crucial for Cytek to balance innovation with cost management to maintain profitability. The repurchase of shares could be a strategic move to invest in the company's own growth potential, reflecting confidence in its future performance within the biotech industry. 02/28/2024 - 05:05 PM FREMONT, Calif., Feb. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cytek® Biosciences, Inc.

Negative None. 02/28/2024 - 06:57 PM Preclinical data show that therapeutic treatment with Auxora in a rat model of AKI improves kidney function as measured by glomerular filtration rate LA JOLLA, Calif., Feb. 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- CalciMedica Inc. (CalciMedica or the Company) (Nasdaq: CALC), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channel inhibition therapies for acute and chronic inflammatory and immunologic diseases, today announced that data from its most recent preclinical study of Auxora™ (zegocractin) in acute kidney injury (AKI) will be presented in a poster and oral presentation at the 29th International Acute Kidney Injury and Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy Conference (AKI & CRRT) being held March 12-15, 2024 in San Diego, CA. The data will highlight the promising therapeutic benefits of Auxora in a rat model of AKI and suggest that Auxora can hasten recovery of renal function. The study was conducted to evaluate whether the selective CRAC channel inhibitor Auxora would improve glomerular filtration rate (GFR), an important indicator of kidney function, when given therapeutically in a rat model of AKI induced by ischemia reperfusion injury, a timed ligation of the renal artery. Presentation Title: The Store-operated Calcium Channel Inhibitor Auxora Improves Renal Function Following Ischemia-induced Acute Kidney Injury in Rats Presenter: David P. Basile, Ph.D., Indiana University Session Date and Time: Tuesday, March 12, 5:30-7:30 p.m. Session Title: Oral Session 2: Translational Research About AKIAcute kidney injury (AKI) denotes a sudden reduction in kidney function, or the organ's ability to clean and filter the blood, as measured by increased serum creatinine (a cellular waste product) or decreased urine volume. AKI can result as a complication of other serious illnesses such as sepsis, respiratory infections and failure, acute pancreatitis, trauma, surgery and burns. There are approximately 3.7 million hospitalized with AKI in the United States each year. The majority have Stage 1 AKI and recover with supportive care alone. However, approximately 1.1 million of these patients advance to stage 2 and stage 3 AKI, over half of whom have associated acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF). The risk of serious morbidities and mortality is significant for advanced stage 2 and stage 3 AKI patients. There are currently no approved therapies for AKI. About Auxora™CalciMedica's lead clinical compound, Auxora™, is a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of Orai1-containing CRAC channels that is being developed for use in patients with acute inflammatory and immunologic illnesses. CRAC channels are found on many cell types, including pancreatic acinar cells, endothelium cells and immune system cells, where aberrant activation of these channels may play a key role in the pathobiology of acute and chronic inflammatory syndromes. Auxora is currently being evaluated in: (i) a Phase 2b trial for acute pancreatitis (AP) with accompanying systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), called CARPO, (ii) an investigator-sponsored Phase 1/2 trial called CRSPA being conducted in pediatric patients with asparaginase-induced pancreatic toxicity (AIPT) as a side effect of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment with asparaginase, (iii) a Phase 2 dose-ranging pharmacodynamic study in critical COVID-19 patients, and (iv) a Phase 2 trial in AKI with associated AHRF, called KOURAGE expected to initiate in the first half of 2024. There are currently no approved therapies to treat either AP, AIPT or AKI. In previous trials, patients responded well to Auxora regardless of severity or cause of disease. CalciMedica is also exploring the potential of Auxora treatment for other acute indications including acute respiratory distress syndrome. About CalciMedicaCalciMedica is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel CRAC channel inhibition therapies for inflammatory and immunologic diseases. CalciMedica's proprietary technology targets the inhibition of CRAC channels to modulate the immune response and protect against tissue cell injury, with the potential to provide therapeutic benefits in life-threatening inflammatory and immunologic diseases for which there are currently no approved therapies. CalciMedica's lead product candidate Auxora™, a proprietary, intravenous-formulated CRAC channel inhibitor, has demonstrated positive and consistent clinical results in multiple completed efficacy clinical trials. CalciMedica is currently conducting a Phase 2b trial for a planned 216 patients (called CARPO – NCT04681066) for AP with SIRS, with topline data expected in the first half of 2024, as well as supporting the ongoing Phase 1/2 CRSPA AIPT study (called CRSPA – NCT04195347), with additional data expected by 2H 2024. CalciMedica plans to initiate its Phase 2 KOURAGE study in AKI in 1H 2024.

The company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per Class A share in January 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial and operating results announced by Cactus, Inc. for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 demonstrate significant growth in revenue and profitability. The reported revenue of $274.9 million and net income of $62.1 million for the fourth quarter, along with a robust net income margin of 22.6%, indicate a strong performance relative to the same period in the previous year. A critical factor contributing to this growth is the successful integration of FlexSteel, which appears to have enhanced margins and diversified revenue streams.From a financial perspective, the adjusted EBITDA margin of 36.4% is particularly noteworthy, as it exceeds industry norms, suggesting efficient management and operational execution. The company's liquidity position is solid, with a significant cash balance and no outstanding bank debt, which offers financial flexibility and supports potential growth initiatives. The planned capital expenditures for 2024 align with the company's strategy for supply chain diversification and international expansion, indicating a proactive approach to scaling operations. Market Research Analyst Cactus, Inc.'s strategic focus on customer service, margins and returns has culminated in setting annual records for revenues and Adjusted EBITDA, signaling strong market positioning. The company's performance in the Pressure Control and Spoolable Technologies segments reflects a balanced portfolio, capable of weathering fluctuations in U.S. land activity levels.Despite the sequential decrease in revenue for the Spoolable Technologies segment, the modest increase in Adjusted Segment EBITDA margins suggests an ability to manage costs effectively. The company's anticipation of flat U.S. land activity levels for the first quarter of 2024 and their initiatives to enhance margins could resonate well with investors, as these efforts may mitigate potential revenue volatility in a challenging market environment. Energy Sector Analyst The energy sector is known for its cyclical nature and Cactus, Inc.'s results reflect an adeptness at navigating this landscape. The company's focus on diversifying its revenue downstream of the wellhead through the acquisition of FlexSteel is a strategic move that could reduce dependency on the more volatile upstream activities. The integration of FlexSteel is particularly relevant as it provides growth opportunities outside the traditional oil and gas markets, which is crucial in an industry facing increasing pressure to innovate and adapt to changing energy demands.Moreover, the company's proactive approach to managing branch expenses and repair costs in response to reduced domestic activity levels demonstrates a keen understanding of the operational levers that can be pulled to maintain profitability even when market conditions are not favorable. 02/28/2024 - 05:30 PM HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cactus, Inc. (NYSE: WHD) (“Cactus” or the “Company”) today announced financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023.

These figures assume Cactus, Inc. held all units in its operating subsidiary at the beginning of the period. Additional information regarding non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are in the Supplemental Information tables. (2) Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures. See definition of these measures and the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in the Supplemental Information tables. (3) Operating income includes a $1.8 million loss and a $5.1 million gain during the fourth quarter of 2023 and third quarter of 2023, respectively, related to the remeasurement of the earn-out liability associated with the FlexSteel acquisition. Both quarters also include $4.0 million of intangible amortization expense related to purchase price accounting. Scott Bender, CEO and Chairman of the Board of Cactus, commented, “I am proud of our company's continued focus on execution as well as its integration of FlexSteel. In the fourth quarter, Adjusted EBITDA margins in both segments exceeded expectations, and we generated substantial free cash flow.” “In the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate that U.S. land activity levels will be approximately flat from the fourth quarter of 2023. In Pressure Control, we expect a slight decline in revenues relative to the fourth quarter, as sales in that period were augmented by higher production equipment sales relative to the rig count. In Spoolable Technologies, we anticipate revenues to increase modestly on increased customer demand.” Mr. Bender concluded, “Our continuous focus on customer service, margins and returns led us to achieve several financial milestones in 2023. Both businesses set records for annual revenues and Adjusted EBITDA. We have made substantial progress in integrating FlexSteel, our first acquisition as a public company, which has enhanced margins and diversified our revenue further downstream of the wellhead, providing growth opportunities both inside and outside of upstream oil and gas. Although current industry expectations for 2024 U.S. land drilling and completion activity are modest, we have several initiatives underway to further enhance margins and remain focused on diversifying our international revenue streams through growth in both of our segments.” Segment Performance Upon completion of the FlexSteel acquisition, we re-evaluated our reportable segments and now report two business segments, Pressure Control (legacy Cactus) and Spoolable Technologies (FlexSteel). Starting with Q4 2023, corporate and other expenses not directly attributable to either segment are presented separately as Corporate and Other Expenses below. These expenses were previously included within the Pressure Control segment. Prior periods presented have been recast to conform to the new presentation. Historical results reconciling the prior and new presentation from 2021 through 2023 are available on the Company's website at the following link: click here. Pressure Control Fourth quarter 2023 Pressure Control revenue decreased $2.0 million, or 1.1%, sequentially, as sales of wellhead and production related equipment declined primarily due to lower customer activity. Operating income increased $1.2 million, or 2.2%, sequentially, with margins increasing 100 basis points due to lower equipment repair costs and efforts to reduce our branch expenses in response to reduced domestic activity levels. Adjusted Segment EBITDA increased $1.5 million, or 2.3%, sequentially, with Adjusted Segment EBITDA margins increasing 120 basis points. Spoolable Technologies Fourth quarter 2023 Spoolable Technologies revenues decreased $11.0 million, or 10.4%, sequentially, due to reduced customer activity levels. Operating income decreased $11.6 million, or 29.2%, sequentially, with operating income margins decreasing 790 basis points due primarily to the quarter over quarter change in the remeasurement of the earn-out liability associated with the FlexSteel acquisition. Adjusted Segment EBITDA decreased $4.5 million, or 10.2%, sequentially, with Adjusted Segment EBITDA margins increasing 10 basis points due to more favorable input costs. Corporate and Other Expenses Fourth quarter 2023 Corporate and Other expenses decreased $1.3 million, or 18.9%, sequentially, due to lower transaction expenses related to the FlexSteel acquisition and lower stock-based compensation expenses. Liquidity, Capital Expenditures and Other As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $133.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, no bank debt outstanding, and $216.0 million of availability on our revolving credit facility. Operating cash flow was $91.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. During the fourth quarter, the Company made dividend payments and associated distributions of $9.5 million. Net capital expenditures were $9.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2023. Net capital expenditures for the full year of 2023 were $38.6 million. For the full year 2024, the Company expects net capital expenditures to be in the range of $45 million to $55 million, inclusive of capital directed towards supply chain diversification efforts and organic international expansion. As of December 31, 2023, Cactus had 65,409,329 shares of Class A common stock outstanding (representing 82.3% of the total voting power) and 14,033,979 shares of Class B common stock outstanding (representing 17.7% of the total voting power).

Cactus, Inc. – Supplemental Information Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin (unaudited) EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are not measures of net income as determined by GAAP but are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management and external users of the Company’s consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. Cactus defines EBITDA as net income excluding net interest, income tax and depreciation and amortization. Cactus defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding the other items outlined below. Cactus management believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful because they allow management to more effectively evaluate the Company’s operating performance and compare the results of its operations from period to period without regard to financing methods or capital structure, or other items that impact comparability of financial results from period to period. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, net income or any other measure as determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s computations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Cactus defines Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue.

Cactus defines Adjusted Segment EBITDA as segment operating income excluding depreciation and amortization and the other items outlined below, in each case, that are attributable to the segment.
