Motley Fool,"The Ultimate Growth Stock to Buy With $1,000 Right Now",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ultimate-growth-stock-buy-1-190000658.html,This business proves that worthy investment ideas are hiding in plain sight.,"The Nasdaq Composite index is in record territory. While that's exciting news for some, it may be discouraging for those who have been on the sidelines.But don't let the market's rise keep you from seeking out compelling investment opportunities. There are still some quality companies selling at attractive valuations.If you've got $1,000 you're ready to invest, then don't look past Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Here's why it's the ultimate growth stock to buy right now.Sizable growth potentialAmazon generated $575 billion in net sales in 2023. That's more than the GDP of some countries, like Ireland and Thailand. And it puts Amazon behind only Walmart on the Fortune 500 list.To be clear, this revenue figure makes Amazon a colossal organization. But investors would be delighted to know that the business still has meaningful opportunities to expand, thanks to multiple growth tailwinds.Amazon's business was built on the expectation of the expansion of online shopping. Today, nearly 40% of all e-commerce spending in the U.S. happens on its website. There's still a massive runway for online activity to take share from brick-and-mortar shopping, which should lift the business in the years ahead.The popularity of Amazon Prime membership not only feeds into greater e-commerce sales, but it can also lead to Prime Video attracting more TV viewing time. Consequently, Amazon also benefits from the streaming trend.Then there's digital advertising, a segment that raked in $14.7 billion in revenue just in the last three months. That total was up 26% year over year. In the U.S., Amazon is behind only Alphabet and Meta Platforms in the industry, something most investors might not realize.Perhaps the most exciting part of the equation is the cloud division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). While growth here has slowed due to macro headwinds, the industry-leading segment boasts a Q4 operating margin of 30%. And AWS gives Amazon a major avenue to introduce artificial intelligence innovations to its client base.Story continuesPay the priceIt's not difficult to convince someone that Amazon is a great business. The facts speak for themselves. It's no wonder shares have soared 8,300% in the last 20 years.But even at a market cap of almost $1.9 trillion today, it still makes for a worthy investment candidate. That's because Amazon shares trade at a price-to-sales multiple of just under 3.3 right now. Even after the stock soared 113% since the start of 2023, its valuation is about in line with its trailing 10-year average.Paying that price for Amazon looks like the right move. This business possesses numerous competitive advantages that give me confidence in its ability to thrive far into the future. It has a scale and logistics footprint that rivals can't match, particularly when it comes to better serving its customer base.And even more importantly, Amazon continues to develop its data advantage. There are very few companies that can collect the massive amounts of data from its customers like Amazon can. And management can constantly find ways to glean insights that better drive marketing and product development efforts. Investors have reason to be even more optimistic, though. After years of aggressive capital expenditures, executives are now focused on creating a more efficient organization, cutting costs across the board.This means that Amazon, which saw its operating income surge 202% in 2023, could see accelerating bottom-line gains. And this can propel the stock even further.Now looks like a good time for prospective investors to add Amazon to their portfolios.Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,1 Warren Buffett Stock Down 26% in 2024. Is It a Buy on the Dip?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-warren-buffett-stock-down-183400329.html,America's only satellite radio provider was one of three U.S. stocks that Buffett bought during the fourth quarter.,"Warren Buffett took control of Berkshire Hathaway in 1965 and began stuffing its portfolio with shares of publicly traded companies and businesses it controls. Investors of all stripes watch Buffett closely, because shares of Berkshire Hathaway have delivered a 4,121,700% return since he took the helm.A major component of Berkshire's strategy involves buying exceptional businesses at fair prices to hold over long periods. Last year, Berkshire did more selling than buying, but one of the stocks it enthusiastically acquired was Sirius XM Holdings (NASDAQ: SIRI), America's only satellite radio provider.During the last six months of 2023, Berkshire bought 40.2 million shares of Sirius XM stock. So far, the investment isn't working out. Since the end of 2023, Sirius XM stock has fallen by 26%, which means you could get in at even lower prices than Buffett. Let's look at what makes the stock attractive to see if it's a buy on the dip.What makes Sirius XM a Buffett stockBuffett famously appreciates businesses with economic moats that can hold back competition. Sirius XM must compete with traditional radio and online streaming services, but it's the only satellite-radio operator authorized to operate in America.Satellite radio might not seem important if you don't regularly drive long distances. For millions of folks who do, Sirius XM is more than just a preferred option for talk radio, sports, and music. In many cases, it's the only viable option for its customers' preferred programming. That's how it finished last December with 31.9 million paying subscribers, or 33.9 million if you include potential self-pay customers who are still in a promotional period.As the only U.S. satellite radio provider, the company had enough pricing power to raise monthly revenue generated per user by 16% since 2018, to $15.56 in 2023. Subscriptions aren't rising quickly, but neither are expenses, because satellites tend to float around for a long time.Story continuesSIRI EPS Diluted (TTM) ChartThe acquisition of Pandora in 2019 aside, returning profit to investors is a top priority for Sirius XM. The company's outstanding share count has declined 17% over the past five years. The lower denominator supercharged modest net income growth and allowed earnings per share to rise by a healthy 45% since 2019.Berkshire Hathaway doesn't pay dividends, but it likes to buy stocks that do. At recent prices, Sirius XM offers a 2.7% dividend yield. The quarterly payout has risen by 120% over the past five years, but the dividend is still well funded. The company needed just 32% of the $1.2 billion in free cash flow it generated last year to meet its dividend commitment.Another box that Sirius XM ticks for Buffett at the moment is a relatively low valuation. After falling about 26% this year, the stock trades for just 12.5 times trailing earnings. The market's expectations are so low that long-term investors could come out way ahead over the long run, even if annual earnings creep forward each year at a low-single-digit percentage.Image source: Getty Images.A buy on the dip?Being the only U.S. satellite radio provider isn't nearly as strong of an advantage as it was just a few years ago, and streaming services such as Spotify are eating Sirius XM's lunch. Spotify finished 2023 with 11% more monthly active users in North America than it had at the end of 2022.Promotional subscriptions that come with new vehicles are traditionally how Sirius XM acquires most of its paid subscribers. Unfortunately for Sirius XM, America's 5G networks are now robust enough that fewer automobile manufacturers build vehicles with satellite radio hardware. The number of potential subscribers using paid promotions at the end of 2018 was 5.1 million. That figure plunged over the past five years to just 1.9 million at the end of 2023.Sirius XM launched a new smartphone app last year, but it isn't competing well with the likes of Apple Music and Spotify. The satellite radio operator finished 2023 with 31.9 million self-pay subscribers, which was less than it had two years earlier.The company's attempt to expand outside of its satellite radio niche by acquiring Pandora in 2019 hasn't gone well. Pandora finished 2023 with fewer paid subscribers than it had at the end of 2019.Sirius XM is profitable and trading at a low multiple of earnings, but growth will be increasingly difficult to achieve as fewer new vehicles come equipped with satellite radio hardware.Shares of stagnant but profitable businesses can produce market-beating gains over time, but only if you buy them at extremely low valuations. Until this stock falls to a single-digit earnings multiple, it's best to watch its story play out from a safe distance.Should you invest $1,000 in Sirius XM right now?Before you buy stock in Sirius XM, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Sirius XM wasn’t one of them.

Shares are still down 85% from their previous peak, but analysts at Needham see a buying opportunity.The firm recently maintained its buy rating for the stock with a price target of $25, which also happens to be close to the average price target for all analysts covering the stock.Why buy Chewy stock?There are a few factors weighing on the stock price. The company is struggling to grow its active customer count, which declined slightly in the fiscal 2023 third quarter to 20.3 million.Meanwhile, Chewy reported a net loss of $35.8 million in the same period, down from a $2.3 million profit in the year-ago quarter. A combination of sluggish growth and weak profitability is not what investors want to see.Chewy is testing the patience of investors, but there are a few things that could prove Needham's analyst right. Chewy is still a leading brand for pet supplies. This is an attractive market that should only continue to grow over the long term thanks rising pet ownership.Moreover, the shares are quite cheap with a price-to-sales ratio of 0.67, a discount to the broad market. One reason the stock could be significantly undervalued is management's ongoing plan to boost profits over the long term by investing in automated fulfillment centers.It's for these reasons the stock could indeed hit the analyst's price target this year, although the company will need to show its rebound is picking up steam in the next few quarters. Chewy still has tremendous long-term growth potential and could make a rewarding investment at these lower share prices.Should you invest $1,000 in Chewy right now?Before you buy stock in Chewy, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Chewy wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,"Near a 2-Year High, Is Palantir Technologies Stock Still a Buy?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/near-2-high-palantir-technologies-180500047.html,The artificial intelligence (AI) specialist has a long and lucrative path ahead.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has existed for decades, but recent advancements have taken these sophisticated algorithms to the next level. Businesses of all sizes have been captivated by the potential for increased productivity, sparking something of an AI gold rush. Investors recognized the opportunity to cash in on this secular tailwind, buying up shares of companies positioned to profit from the trend.Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) is one such company. The company first made a name for itself among government agencies for its ability to ferret out terrorist plots before they could succeed. The company has expanded beyond government contracts to provide data mining and business analytics services for commercial enterprises.Thanks to its decades of AI experience in the field, Palantir pivoted quickly when generative AI burst onto the scene. The company has developed an intriguing approach to help its customers get the most out of AI, and this strategy is paying off in a big way.Image source: Getty Images.The advent of AIBusinesses are always looking for ways to boost their bottom line, which is why the adoption of generative AI is accelerating. These AI systems can make short work of a growing number of time-consuming tasks, freeing up workers to focus on more important things. For example, these systems can:Prioritize and summarize emails and draft responsesCreate tables or charts based on existing dataSearch the internet or internal company systems for data or documentsDraft original documents and suggest revisionsWrite and debug computer codeCreate presentations with a few prompts.While these systems are far from perfect -- and still require human review -- it's easy to see how these automation systems can save time. And as the old saying goes, time is money.A unique approachThe vast diversity of the workforce means different jobs have different priorities. By identifying the most repetitive and time-consuming tasks, generative AI systems can be tailored to meet the needs of a specific job or company. That's what makes Palantir's approach so brilliant.Story continuesThe company created its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) to develop generative AI solutions that address real-world business problems. Palantir works with businesses to identify mission-critical needs and high-value use cases. They then embark on ""immersive, hands-on-keyboard sessions [that] allow new and existing customers to build live alongside Palantir engineers, all working toward the common goal of deploying AI in operations."" This reportedly helps businesses ""go from zero to use case in just one to five days."" Palantir says it has a ""growing backlog of AIP Bootcamps due to the overwhelming demand.""Consider this gem, dropped by chief revenue officer Ryan Taylor during Palantir's earnings call last month:In October, we set a goal of executing 500 AIP Bootcamps within one year. We have already blown that goal out of the water, having completed more than 560 Bootcamps across 465 organizations to date ... We're already seeing evidence of Bootcamps helping to significantly compress sales cycles and accelerate the rate of new customer acquisition.That strategy is bearing fruit, as evidenced by Palantir's fourth-quarter results. U.S. commercial revenue grew 70% year over year and 12% sequentially, driven by strong demand for AIP. Furthermore, for 2024, management is guiding for the segment to grow at least 40% -- which could end up being conservative.A new two-year highExcitement regarding the rapid adoption of AI and Palantir's recent blockbuster results have sent the stock soaring 240% over the past year. Its valuation has risen as well with the stock trading at 77 times forward earnings estimates and 17 times expected 2025 revenue. That might seem prohibitively expensive -- at least at first glance -- but those numbers only tell part of the story.These metrics fail to take into account the company's accelerating growth trajectory. On the other hand, the stock's forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio -- which factors in Palantir's multiyear growth outlook -- is less than 1, the standard for an undervalued stock.With decades of real-world experience, a brilliant go-to-market strategy, and strong secular tailwinds, Palantir has a solid foundation and a clear path forward. I would argue that even at a two-year high, Palantir stock is a buy.Should you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?Before you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Did Adobe Just Signal a Red Flag for AI Growth Stocks?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/did-adobe-just-signal-red-173700677.html,Adobe's weak guidance is fueling a massive sell-off in the SaaS stock.,"Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) stock sold off on Friday after the software giant reported record revenue but muted Q2 fiscal 2024 guidance. The stock is now down around 20% since Feb. 1 in what has otherwise been a great period for the broader market and for artificial intelligence (AI) fueled growth stocks.Let's dive into Adobe's results and management commentary to determine if this is a bad omen for the AI theme, or if Adobe's issues are more company-specific.Image source: Getty Images.An AI-driven investmentTo some extent, Adobe has always been an AI play. It's just that the buzzword is being thrown around more nowadays.The company's flagship bundle, Creative Cloud, features a suite of applications and tools to help creators design, edit, and interact with different forms of media -- namely text, images, and video. However, Adobe's growth had slowed in recent years, and the company needed a new catalyst to spur investment excitement.On March 21, Adobe unveiled Firefly, a generative AI tool for Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, Experience Cloud, and Adobe Express workflows. The launch of Firefly and the prospect of monetizing AI helped Adobe stock gain over 77% last year.Adobe's recent earnings call marked a momentum change and the harsh reality that although these new applications have a long runway, that doesn't necessarily mean there will be an immediate impact on its short-term results.Adobe's Q2 fiscal 2024 guidance was weak, and the company chose not to give an update on full-year guidance, whereas it had given fiscal full-year 2024 guidance on its Q4 fiscal 2024 earnings call in December. The market hates uncertainty, so it's no surprise why the bulk of the question-and-answer session consisted of analysts obsessing over quarterly results and fiscal 2024 performance instead of Adobe's long-term investments and where the company could be three to five years from now.AI's measurable impact on Adobe's growthUsers of Adobe Firefly through Creative Cloud and Adobe Express have already generated 6.5 billion assets like images, vectors, designs, and text effects. Adobe reported record new commercial subscriptions in Creative Cloud and teased new products for Adobe Express with Firefly for mobile, Firefly Services, and an AI assistant for Adobe Acrobat. The company is investing heavily in its product rollout and making noticeable progress across its existing products and mobile tools, and even introducing new products like AI-powered Enhance Speech, which automatically dubs a video into a language of the user's choice.Story continuesThat said, if there were ever a time to take quarterly results with a grain of salt, it's now. Adobe is dealing with a one-time $1 billion charge for terminating its acquisition of Figma, a deal announced in September 2022. What's more, a lot of the investments in product innovation probably won't be felt for several years.On the earnings call, Adobe clarified that it is focused on acquiring as many users as possible. The idea is that with good customer acquisition and retention, Adobe can monetize its user base over time. Adobe was one of the pioneers of the software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model, and it is sticking to its roots in how it approaches AI.A key part of the earnings call was when Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen expressed the differences between experimentation and monetization on its platforms. In many ways, Adobe is still figuring out what will stick with users. It does no good to invest billions of dollars in tools that users either won't use or that the company can't justify price increases for down the line.That leads us to the most significant challenge with Adobe, which is making money from AI. Since Adobe is a subscription business, it has to support increased capital expenditures by growing its customer base and revenue per user. A comparison would be Netflix, which has to justify price increases by making its service more valuable to consumers through quality shows and content spending.The good news is that Adobe's customer base is mostly businesses and, to a lesser extent, students and individual creators. So it isn't that dependent on the strength of the consumer. If its customers can use AI-based tools like Firefly to do their jobs faster and better, then price increases should be absorbed naturally. But it would be a mistake to assume this is a given.A sizable buyback programAdobe's investment thesis is all about consistency. Gradual growth from reliable subscription revenue fuels innovation and an underrated capital return program.Over the last 10 years, Adobe has reduced its outstanding share count by 9.2% despite its stock-based compensation soaring over 400%. It just announced a new $25 billion stock repurchase program over the next four years. At a market cap of around $227 billion at the time of this writing, simple math tells us that Adobe plans to reduce its share count by 11% or so over the next four years, which is more than double the rate over the last decade.Buying back stock spreads earnings over a smaller number of shares, which boosts earnings per share (EPS) and makes Adobe a better value. It's a way to artificially boost EPS even when the underlying business isn't posting the best organic growth.Adobe isn't in that position; in fact, its organic growth is quite good. But the company's decision not to update its full-year guidance indicates growth may not be as good as investors hoped when Adobe was hovering around a 52-week high just six weeks ago.Reeling in expectationsAdobe didn't signal a red flag for AI growth stocks, but it did remind investors of where their focus should be, which isn't on the next quarter or year, but on how AI enhances the overall investment thesis. Adobe has a clear, straightforward way to monetize AI, which makes it one of the more intriguing long-term plays out there.Even after selling off, Adobe isn't a cheap stock. It's better not to focus too much on trailing earnings because of the Figma one-time impairment. For fiscal 2025, analysts expect $20.30 in EPS, which would mean a price-to-earnings ratio of 24.6. But that's based on full-year earnings seven quarters from now.Adobe isn't a screaming buy, but the market is underestimating its growth potential. Adobe is worth adding to a watch list or even opening a starter position in. But if Adobe undergoes a prolonged sell-off, the valuation will look too cheap to ignore.Should you invest $1,000 in Adobe right now?Before you buy stock in Adobe, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Adobe wasn’t one of them.

Just months earlier, he agreed to a $60 billion takeover that would make Exxon the biggest US shale producer.Woods is also becoming much more strident about climate goals in speeches and interviews, arguing that fossil fuels will still be needed for years to come to meet energy demand and the world is not on a path to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 because people are unwilling to pay for cleaner alternatives.The message may be controversial, but it’s resonating on Wall Street, where “ESG” is fast becoming a loathed moniker as ambitious environmental, social and governance pledges are rubbing against the need for secure and affordable energy. Exxon is up 89%, more than four times that of the S&P 500, since losing a climate-fueled proxy battle with Engine No. 1. in 2021.It’s a remarkable turnaround from the pandemic era, when Exxon posted its biggest-ever loss, employees were leaving in droves and the shareholder rebellion forced Woods to replace a quarter of his board. Exxon’s revival is emblematic of a resurgent American oil industry, which is now pumping 40% more crude each day than Saudi Arabia, forcing OPEC and its allies to retreat.“It wasn’t that long ago it looked like taking the green approach was what the industry needed to attract capital,” said Jeff Wyll, a senior analyst at Neuberger Berman, which manages about $440 billion. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “flipped the switch and energy security became more important. Exxon benefited because they never stepped back from their traditional business.”Story continuesWhen Woods takes center stage at the CERAWeek by S&P Global energy conference in Houston this week, he’s likely to double down on his long-held view that fossil fuels will be in demand for decades to come and that governments and consumers — rather than just Big Oil — will need to pay for any meaningful transition to greener energy.For those who see Exxon and Big Oil as responsible for decades of delay and misinformation about climate change, it’s an unpopular argument. But it’s one made from a position of increasing financial strength.Exxon paid out $32 billion in dividends and buybacks in 2023, the fourth-highest in the S&P 500, and is pledging more this year. Its pending $60 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources Co. will make it the country’s dominant producer of shale oil, putting it at the top of the industry largely responsible for OPEC+ losing market share to the US.Exxon also operates one of the world’s fastest-growing major oil developments in Guyana, the biggest crude discovery in a decade, and recently completed a raft of refinery and petrochemical expansions.Its supermajor rivals are now racing to catch up.Chevron agreed to buy Hess Corp. for $53 billion, in large part to gain a 30% stake in Exxon’s Guyana project. But Exxon claims the deal “attempted to circumvent” a contract that gives it right of first refusal over the stake, and is taking the dispute to arbitration at the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris.Shell Plc and BP Plc, meanwhile, are now switching more of their investment dollars back toward oil and gas under new CEOs after their stocks slumped following a pivot toward renewables.The European supermajors’ struggles demonstrate the perils of replacing high, steady cash flows from fossil fuels with low-margin renewables, according to Greg Buckley, a portfolio manager at Adams Funds who helps manage about $3.5 billion including Exxon shares.“ESG was popular but I think that return on capital is more popular at the end of the day,” he said. Shell and BP “found out the hard way.”The shift away from ESG terminology is a recognition that the energy transition will be complex and won't unfold the same way in every part of the globe, Dan Yergin, the vice chairman of S&P Global, which organizes the CERAWeek conference, said in an interview. Conflicts around the world, including in the Middle East and Ukraine, have underscored the need for reliable energy supply, while investors remain focused on returns, he said.“The energy companies have demonstrated a discipline in their capital investment and have been responsive to investors,” Yergin said. “You can see that in their spending and that's refurbished the social contract between the companies and investors.”Woods is also learning from his own experience with activist shareholders. In January, the company filed a lawsuit against US and Dutch climate investors who buy stock to push for lower emissions. The process by which they get votes on the ballot at company meetings “has become ripe for abuse by activists with minimal shares and no interest in growing long-term shareholder value,” Exxon said in the suit.Woods is also being more vocal about his views on a lower-carbon future. “The dirty secret nobody talks about is how much all this is going to cost and who’s willing to pay for it,” he said in a recent Fortune podcast. The world “waited too long” to consider all the solutions needed to reduce emissions.The comments invoked ire from environmentalists.“It is an infuriating bit of rhetoric, especially from Exxon because they are the most associated with the effort to slow progress on climate change,” said Andrew Logan, oil and gas senior director at CERES, a coalition of environmentally-minded investors with $65 trillion under management. “They have a long history of over-promising and under delivering on low carbon.”Emily Mir, a spokeswoman for Exxon, pushed back at Logan’s comments in a statement. The company has said it’s pursuing more than $20 billion in lower-emission investments from 2022 through 2027, in addition to its $4.9 billion acquisition of Denbury Inc., a deal that gave the oil giant the largest network of carbon dioxide pipelines in the US. Those pipes will be key to capturing carbon from heavily polluting facilities like refineries and chemical plants.“Facts that don’t align with ill-informed prejudice are often infuriating,” Mir said. “That doesn’t make them wrong. Someone needs to tell the truth about what it’s going to take to get to a net-zero future.”In November, Woods tried to flip the script on a slogan from the long-running “ExxonKnew” environmental campaign, which claims that company executives downplayed warnings from their own scientists since the 1970s that carbon dioxide causes climate change. Exxon has denied deliberately misleading the public on global warming.“We’ve got the tools, the skills, the size — and the intellectual and financial resources — to bend the curve on emissions,” he said at the APEC CEO Summit 2023 in San Francisco. “That’s what Exxon Mobil knows.”But the energy transition still looms large. Fears that oil demand will peak as soon as 2030 have led investors to discount the ability of Exxon and its peers to sustain dividends and buybacks as the transition takes hold. The S&P 500 is now dominated by tech stocks, whose earnings are seen as more resilient for decades into the future.Even after its rally over the past few years, Exxon is only the S&P 500’s 17th largest company, trading at 12.2 times earnings, 42% below the index’s average. Energy stocks make up less than 4% of the index despite the US becoming the world’s biggest oil producer.“Exxon and the industry has yet to make a case of how they will generate cash in a carbon-constrained future,” Logan said.—With assistance from Naureen S Malik.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekAn Influential Economics Forum Has a Troubling Surplus of TrollsAmerica’s Plumber Deficit Isn’t Good for the EconomyGold-Medalist Coders Build an AI That Can Do Their Job for ThemWhen It Comes to Texas, Is Musk All Hat and No Cattle?Make Up or Break Up: Will Trump and Musk Merge?©2024 Bloomberg L.P."
Motley Fool,2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-artificial-intelligence-ai-growth-160000733.html,These technology companies will continue to profit from AI-powered tailwinds for several years.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has become the hottest investment theme, captivating the minds of both seasoned investors and newbies alike. This is not surprising, considering multiple research firms expect the AI market to be worth more than $1 trillion by 2030.With the AI trend having the potential to generate windfall returns, investor interest in AI stocks is at an all-time high. Two stocks, namely Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL), can prove to be compelling additions to any AI-focused stock portfolio. Here's why these stocks are smart picks now.1. NvidiaWidely known as the poster child of the ongoing AI revolution, semiconductor giant Nvidia is making history in front of our eyes.Nvidia has posted impressive results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (ending Jan. 28, 2024), with both revenue and earnings surpassing consensus estimates. This is an impressive performance, especially since the U.S. government's rising restrictions on chip exports to China may force Nvidia to cancel billions of dollars of chip orders in 2024. Nvidia is also battling competition from other chip players such as Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, as well as from its key clients who are developing their proprietary AI chips.Despite this, the technological superiority of Nvidia's AI chips has enabled it to capture nearly 92% share in the global data center GPU market. The company's state-of-the-art GPUs (A100 and H100 chips) and advanced networking technologies (which include the InfiniBand solutions used in high-performance AI infrastructures and the recently launched Spectrum-X end-to-end ethernet-based solution for AI-optimized networking) are being used extensively by data centers transitioning their trillion-dollar installed bases from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. Furthermore, enterprises across industries are also leveraging generative AI technologies across use cases, which can also present a trillion-dollar opportunity for Nvidia's AI-optimized hardware offerings. Plus, the demand for Nvidia's chips is far outpacing supply, which has allowed the company to enjoy significant pricing power -- a key factor driving its solid data center revenue in the past few quarters.Story continuesBesides hardware, Nvidia's CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) programming software stack has been helping clients to optimally program its GPUs for accelerated computing applications. With the increasing adoption of accelerated computing, enterprises also need support to maintain the complex software infrastructure. Since the companies do not have large engineering teams, Nvidia considers this to be a large opportunity for its Nvidia AI Enterprise cloud-native software platform.While Nvidia's growth potential may seem solid, investors are rightly concerned about its sky-high valuation. Trading at 77 times its earnings, Nvidia can be considered to be a very expensive stock. However, this valuation is still cheaper than the company's three-year average price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 95.9 and five-year average P/E multiple of 86.9. Thanks to its cutting-edge offerings, Nvidia has always traded at a solid premium. Yet, it has delivered a mind-boggling 300% return in the past year.Hence, with multiple robust tailwinds and a lower-than-historical valuation, it makes sense to start accumulating a position in this stock. Investors can also opt for a dollar-cost-averaging strategy and invest their money over a longer time, to control their risk.2. Marvell TechnologyShares of fabless semiconductor player Marvell Technology dropped nearly 11.4% in a single day after the company released its latest earnings results (Q4 of fiscal 2024 ending Feb. 3, 2024) on March 7. Despite significant weaknesses in other end markets such as carrier infrastructure, enterprise networking, and the consumer market, the AI-driven data center business continues to be a bright spot.Marvell has been investing aggressively in AI-optimized networking products and chips to benefit from the explosive growth in AI and accelerated computing markets. The company saw solid demand for its high-speed optical interconnect products (100 gig per lane 800 gig PAM products used to move huge amounts of data between chips), accelerators, and switches in traditional cloud data centers and AI-optimized data centers, in the fourth quarter. AI accounted for 10% of the company's data center revenue in fiscal 2024. Marvell expects to deploy its even faster optical interconnect products (200 gig per lane 1.6T PAM solutions) by the end of 2024.Marvell has also recently announced an extension of its long-standing partnership with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing for developing a technology platform capable of producing 2-nanometer chips for accelerated computing. This deal will enable the company to play a pivotal role in improving performance and power efficiency for next-generation AI workloads.Besides AI, there is also solid growth potential in Marvell's other business segments. While currently in a cyclical downturn, Marvell expects its carrier infrastructure, enterprise networking, and consumer segments to recover gradually in the second half of fiscal 2025. Increasing connectivity and bandwidth requirements in vehicles is also proving to be a major growth driver for the company's automotive business.Considering the increasing demand for its AI-optimized networking products and anticipated recovery in other end markets shortly, starting a position in this stock may be a smart move in 2024.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,"Meet the Most Innovative ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock, According to This Key Metric",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meet-most-innovative-magnificent-seven-154500323.html,Meta Platforms is now a mature business that can directly reward shareholders without compromising its long-term growth.,"Nvidia captured the market's spotlight in 2023 and so far in 2024. But Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is just as good -- if not a better story.In less than 1 1/2 years -- between Nov. 2, 2022 and March 8, 2024, Meta went up a staggering 458.8%. The stock went from an eight-year low to an all-time high in a relatively short period. A lot of it was due to Meta being oversold in 2022, but the bigger story is that Meta has one of the best business models in the world.Here's the metric that shows why Meta Platforms is the most innovative ""Magnificent Seven"" company and why it could be worth buying, even though the stock price is the highest it's ever been.Image source: Getty Images.Investing in product improvementsOn an absolute basis, Meta Platforms spends the second-most money on research and development (R&D) behind only Alphabet. But as a percentage of revenue, no Magnificent Seven company comes even close to Meta, which has an R&D-to-revenue ratio of 28.5%.META R&D to Revenue (TTM) ChartPart of the reason Alphabet and Meta have such high R&D expenses is the nature of their businesses. The two largest companies in the communications sector profit from their platforms. For Alphabet, it's mainly Google, Google Cloud, and YouTube. For Meta, it's driven by Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.These platforms are cash cows but take fine-tuning. And in Meta's case, Instagram required a major overhaul to combat TikTok. The threat of TikTok was largely responsible for Meta's sell-off in 2022, compounded by a broader tech sell-off and disgruntled shareholders who were tired of the company spending money on the metaverse and its unprofitable Reality Labs segment.However, Instagram's improvement has worked wonders for the company. Meta estimated it has over 3.1 billion people who use at least one of its apps every day. The company leverages artificial intelligence (AI) through its apps, and AI was a big part of making Meta's answer to TikTok -- reels -- a resounding success.Story continuesMeta has a wide moatIf you listened to Meta's Q4 2023 earnings call, you probably heard the company talk at length that it has been investing in AI and the metaverse for some time and continues to do so. But now it operates a lean business and plans to keep it that way.How can Meta invest so aggressively in growth while also staying lean? Simply put, it's because it doesn't need to spend a lot of money relative to what its platforms provide.Apple has to make and sell new phones and physical products.Tesla has to sell cars.Nvidia has to sell GPUs.Amazon has to sell subscriptions, products through its e-commerce platform, and book clients through Amazon Web ServicesMicrosoft has to sell software subscriptions, physical products, and manage Microsoft Azure clients.Alphabet has the closest business model to Meta Platforms of the Magnificent Seven companies. It has built a wide moat in search, but its platforms are more vulnerable to disruption than Meta's.Purely from a business model standpoint, there is arguably no better cash cow than Meta. Its digital real estate has become one of the most valuable touchpoints for advertisers to interact directly with consumers based on their preferences.Meta has physical products, too, like the Meta Quest virtual-reality headset. Its business isn't reliant on the performance of these products, so they act as a cherry on top of the investment thesis rather than a make-or-break factor.Meta's ability to address the threat of TikTok in a relatively short period is largely due to its cash-cow business model and strong balance sheet. But cash would mean nothing if Meta didn't use it effectively. The company proved it can effectively innovate, pivot, accept its mistakes, and improve.Competition has a way of bringing out the best in even great companies. And although it was painful for Meta at that moment, TikTok arguably made Instagram even more valuable to long-term investors.Rewarding shareholdersMeta has enough money to fund its operations, R&D, organic growth, and return money to shareholders and recently announced its first-ever dividend. It has reduced its outstanding share count by over 10% in the last three years and authorized an additional $50 billion in share repurchases. (For context, Meta spent $20 billion on share buybacks in 2023.) It can fully fund future buybacks and the dividend with free cash flow (FCF), considering it earned a staggering $43.9 billion in 2023.META Revenue (Annual) ChartMeta's price-to-earnings ratio of 34 and price-to-FCF ratio of 30.3 aren't nearly as cheap as they used to be. But it's still not a bad deal for a fast-growing company. Given Meta's rally, you'd think the stock would be far more expensive, but its current valuation shows just how beaten down it was in late 2022.A balanced buyMeta can support an expensive R&D program, which can help improve its platforms in the face of stiff competition. It can fuel growth with cash and support a sizable capital-return program.The company has blossomed into a balanced tech play, its platforms proving stickier than ever. The stock isn't a steal at these levels, but there's no denying the business is at the top of its game.Should you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.
