The release also includes expanded HazardHub data for Canada, offering deeper property risk insights. Jasper aims to improve policy issuance efficiency and regulatory compliance, available on April 5, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Insurance Technology Specialist The introduction of Guidewire's Jasper release represents a strategic move in the P&C insurance technology landscape. By integrating features such as layered coinsurance, schedule import and the U.S. Bureau Content Solution, Guidewire is addressing critical needs for efficiency and regulatory compliance within the industry.Layered coinsurance is a significant enhancement, allowing insurers to diversify risk more effectively. This feature aligns with the industry's push towards more sophisticated risk management strategies. The ability to automate splits and charges can save insurers time and reduce errors, potentially leading to cost savings and improved customer satisfaction.The schedule import functionality simplifies the data entry process for underwriters and agents, which could lead to increased business capture and throughput. The ease of uploading and importing data is a competitive advantage in an industry where speed and accuracy are paramount.Finally, the U.S. Bureau Content Solution is a proactive approach to regulatory adherence. With ever-changing rates, rules and forms, having a system that updates continuously could be a game-changer for insurers, especially in reducing the administrative burden and ensuring faster time-to-market for compliant products. Risk Management Analyst The expanded HazardHub data for Canada included in the Jasper release is a noteworthy development for underwriters and actuaries. The addition of 11 new risk factors and 100 new data elements offers a more granular view of property risks, particularly in areas prone to wildfires. This level of detail is essential for accurate risk assessment and pricing.Enhanced risk insights can lead to more tailored insurance products and potentially lower claims costs through better risk selection and pricing. However, it also raises questions about data privacy and the use of personal data in underwriting decisions. Insurers must balance the benefits of detailed risk assessment with the ethical considerations and regulatory requirements related to data use.From a market perspective, insurers armed with these insights might gain a competitive edge by offering more accurate and potentially lower-priced premiums. This could shift the market dynamics, prompting other insurers to seek similar data enhancements to remain competitive. Regulatory Compliance Expert The Jasper release's emphasis on regulatory compliance is particularly relevant given the current environment of stringent insurance regulations. The inclusion of the U.S. Bureau Content Solution demonstrates Guidewire's commitment to helping insurers navigate the complex landscape of insurance regulation.Staying current with ISO, NCCI and state workers' compensation bureaus is a substantial operational challenge for insurers. The automated updates provided by the new solution could reduce the risk of non-compliance and associated penalties. It could also free up resources typically dedicated to manual updates, allowing insurers to reallocate them to other strategic initiatives.However, insurers must ensure that their reliance on such automated systems does not lead to complacency. Regular audits and checks are still necessary to guarantee that the system functions as intended and that all regulatory updates are captured accurately. 03/28/2024 - 03:05 AM SAN MATEO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Guidewire (NYSE: GWRE) announces Jasper, its latest release, which boosts commercial lines agility for P&C insurers with support for layered coinsurance, schedule import, and a new U.S. Bureau Content Solution.* Additionally, expanded HazardHub data for Canada gives insurers deeper property risk insights for underwriting precision. Jasper release will be generally available on April 5, 2024. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240328607054/en/ “Commercial lines insurers face both risk and opportunity. On the one hand, there are economic fluctuations, including inflation, geopolitical complexities, capital limitations, and environmental challenges. On the other hand, the protection gap creates growth opportunities for insurers that innovate to stay ahead of the evolving risk landscape,” said Eugene Lee, senior vice president and general manager, InsuranceSuite, Guidewire. For P&C insurers seeking to improve commercial lines efficiency, Jasper enables faster policy issuance and processing through its flexible, cloud-based platform designed specifically for commercial lines.

Admission of new shares to the Official List and trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange PLC. Negative Unaudited debt balance reduction of $12.4 million in Q1 2024. Debt balance with Galaxy Digital Holdings, reduced to $12.8 million. Potential dilution for existing shareholders due to the issuance of new ordinary shares. Financial Analyst The sale of Argo Blockchain's Mirabel, Quebec data center for $6.1 million and the subsequent debt reduction presents a strategic financial maneuver. By repaying the $1.4 million mortgage on the facility and reducing the Galaxy debt by 63%, the company has effectively lowered its leverage. This is a positive signal to investors, as a lower debt load can improve financial ratios and potentially lead to a more favorable credit rating. Furthermore, the consolidation of operations is projected to save $0.7 million annually, which could marginally improve EBITDA margins over time. However, investors should monitor the impact of this facility sale on the company's mining capacity and whether the cost savings will offset any potential revenue loss. Market Research Analyst Argo Blockchain's decision to consolidate its mining operations may reflect a broader industry trend towards efficiency and cost management in the cryptocurrency mining sector. Given the volatile nature of cryptocurrency prices, operational efficiency is paramount. The $0.7 million annual savings on non-mining operating expenses could enhance the company's competitive position. However, the issuance of new shares may dilute existing shareholders' equity. Investors should weigh the potential benefits of a deleveraged balance sheet against the dilutive effects of the new share issuance when assessing the company's market valuation. Cryptocurrency Industry Expert The transaction detailed by Argo Blockchain highlights the company's agility in adapting to the dynamic cryptocurrency market. The reduction of high-interest debt, particularly with a SOFR + 11% rate, is a strategic move that can reduce financial risk amidst crypto market volatility. The relocation of mining equipment to a single facility in Baie Comeau could lead to operational efficiencies, but stakeholders should consider the potential risks associated with centralizing operations, such as increased vulnerability to local disruptions or regulatory changes. The industry is known for rapid shifts and Argo's ability to navigate these while managing its capital structure will be critical for its long-term success. 03/28/2024 - 03:00 AM Closing on Sale of Mirabel, Quebec Data CenterAllotment of New SharesShare Capital and Total Voting RightsLONDON, UK / ACCESSWIRE / March 28, 2024 / Argo Blockchain plc (LSE:ARB)(NASDAQ:ARBK), a global leader in cryptocurrency mining, is pleased to announce that it has closed on the previously announced sale of its data center located in Mirabel, Quebec (the ""Mirabel Facility"") for total consideration of $6.1 million (the ""Transaction"").The net proceeds from the Transaction were used to first repay the Mirabel Facility's outstanding mortgage of $1.4 million, with the remainder used to repay debt owed to Galaxy Digital Holdings, Ltd.

(""Nano One"" or the ""Company"") (TSX:NANO)(OTC PINK:NNOMF)(Frankfurt:LBMB) is a clean technology company with patented processes for the production of lithium-ion battery cathode active materials (""CAM"") that enable secure and resilient supply chains by driving down cost, complexity, energy intensity, and environmental footprint. Nano One has filed its audited annual consolidated financial statements (the ""financial statements""), and management's discussion & analysis (""MD&A"") as at and for the year ended December 31, 2023 (""2023 Q4"") and is pleased to provide the following highlights.Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)On December 6, 2023, the Company announced the results of a third-party LCA report which demonstrated the environmental and economic benefits of Nano One's technologies including 50% fewer green house gas (""GHG"") emissions and 80% less water use, when considering lithium iron phosphate (""LFP"") and lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (""NMC"") production benchmarked against the complexity and energy intensity of conventional CAM processes operating in various jurisdictions.Automotive OEM Validates Nano One LFP and Kicks Off Tonne-Scale EvaluationsOn December 19, 2023, the Company announced it had confirmed orders for approximately 1.3 tonnes of LFP samples made from its pilot plant for the purposes of commercial evaluation, collaboration and securing offtake agreements with collaborators in the automotive, energy storage systems, defence, and industrial sectors.2023 Q4 - Financial PositionCash and cash equivalent position of $31.9 million at year end.Working capital of $30.1 million at year end.Total assets of $53.0M at year end.Total liabilities of $5.5M with no long-term debt at year end.2023 - Earlier Headlines2023 saw a global shift towards LFP batteries that could eventually mirror the 60-70% market share that LFP already has in China. This shift is driven by lower costs and safety, by battery pack energy densities and electric vehicle (""EV"") range now on par with NMC, and by the need to diversify supply chains away from foreign entities of concern. Nano One's One-Pot LFP addresses these needs by driving down cost, complexity and GHG emissions in the supply chain, by enabling refined critical mineral inputs that can be easily sourced in free-trade jurisdictions, and by eliminating waste streams that are difficult to permit in western countries.The Company has also achieved significant milestones on its commercialization roadmap including the recommissioning of its recently acquired Candiac LFP production facility. Testing, piloting and showcasing of LFP is underway in full scale equipment that demonstrates the commercial, environmental and security advantages of producing of LFP using the One-Pot process. A significant outcome from these achievements is the September 2023 C$17M strategic investment made by Sumitomo Metal Mining (""SMM"") and the resulting collaboration to accelerate the commercial adoption of the One-Pot process for LFP and NMC through potential licensing and joint venture opportunities. SMM is a world-renowned miner, refiner and producer of cathode active materials dating back to applications in early portable electronics and the emergence of hybrid and fully electric vehicles.Secured $17M investment and collaboration with Sumitomo Metal Mining.Awarded $10M in grant funds from SDTC.Successfully completed NMC evaluations with global OEM and expanded collaboration to include LFP.Demonstrated, de-risked and fast-tracked tonne-scale sampling of One-Pot LFP.Completed pre-feasibility study (""FEL2"") of 12,500 tpa LFP production line.Laid out commercialization plans for LFP and other materials.Signed JDA with Our Next Energy to collaborate on the validation, qualification, and production of a North American supply of LFP CAM.Japan: Formation of lithium metal oxide cathodes from elemental metal.2024 Q1 - Corporate Milestones and DevelopmentsAdditional Lithium Battery Manufacturing Patents added in AsiaOn February 21, 2024, the Company announced the addition of four new patents in Asia, thereby expandingits portfolio to 40 patents with 55+ pending. These additional patents showcased the depth and global relevance of Nano One's innovative One-Pot process. They also added to shareholder value and Nano One's technology offering while enhancing Nano One's leadership position and safeguarding commercial advantages. The issued patents were as follows:Taiwan: Battery enhancement using simplified electrolyte and One-Pot cathode.China and Korea: Simultaneous formation of coating and cathode in single step.Feasibility Study (FEL3) StudyOn February 27, 2024, the Company announced the commencement of a feasibility study (""FEL3"") for a 25,000 tpa LFP commercial plant to support customer offtake, feedstock supply, and future project funding efforts. The plant design will also form the basis of Nano One's turn-key Design-Once-Build-Many strategy to address the broader LFP market. The FEL3 study will provide an optimal production line layout and maximum utility of key equipment. Furthermore, this study will address Nano One's mid-to-longer-term objective of deploying multi-line facilities under license or joint venture with partners in Asian, Indo-Pacific, North American and European jurisdictions. Progress at Nano One's pilot plant has helped de-risk, improve, and optimize the One-Pot process for LFP in commercial scale equipment while informing engineering plans and providing confidence to Nano One's collaborators on the long-term competitive viability of Nano One's CAM production technologies.For a more detailed discussion of Nano One's Q4 2023 and annual results, please refer to the Company's financial statements, MD&A, and AIF which are available at www.sedarplus.ca.###About Nano One®Nano One Materials Corp.

Further information on the financial and operating results for the Year and the quarter ended December 31, 2023 (the ""Quarter"" or ""Q4"") can be found in the Management Discussion and Analysis (""MD&A""), and the audited financial statements, which are available on the Company's website and which are being filed on SEDAR. Following the trading update of March 4, 2024, the Company is trading in line with both market expectations and production guidance for 2024. The Company also declares a quarterly dividend of 14 United States cents (US$0.14) on each of the Company's shares. 2023 Financial Summary (USD) Gross revenue of $146.3 million (2022: $142.1 million). Revenue for the Year was 3% higher than in 2022 due to a 7.8% increase in the average realised price of gold sold.Gross profit of $41.5 million (2022: $61.8 million). Gross profit decreased due to higher production costs at Blanket Mine (“Blanket”) of $69.6 million and operating costs at the small scale, temporary Bilboes oxide mine in the Year of $13.1 million. The Bilboes oxide mine was returned to care and maintenance with effect from October 1 2023.Revenue and gross profit exclude the benefit of 3,057 ounces of gold work-in-progress at the end of December which were sold in the first week of January.Administrative expenses of $17.4 million (2022: $11.9 million). Administrative expenses during the Year were 46% higher than in 2022, predominantly due to increased salaries and wages (which included a one-off settlement payable to the former Chief Operating Officer) and payment for advisory services on conclusion of the Bilboes acquisition in January 2023.EBITDA of $29.7 million (2022: $50.4 million) was lower than in 2023 primarily due to the Bilboes oxide mining cost of $13.1 million and several one-off costs including, those listed above, higher than expected labour and power costs of $5.5 million, and $2.5 million of foreign exchange losses in the year.On-mine cost per ounce1 was $1,047 (2022: $735). Excluding the costs of the small-scale temporary Bilboes oxide mine (which was placed on care and maintenance from October 1, 2023), on-mine costs would have amounted to $912 per ounce compared to $735 per ounce in 2022, the increase being due to increased labour and electricity costs.All-in sustaining cost per ounce1 of $1,445 (2022: $878) being a 64.6% increase year-on-year, predominantly due to the higher on-mine cost per ounce (above) and an increase in sustaining capital expenditure following the classifying of capital expenditures on projects due to Blanket’s investment phase nearing its end.Adjusted earnings per share (“EPS”)1 of 17.1 cents (2022: 219.9 cents).Net cash from operating activities of $14.8 million (2022: $42.6 million).Net cash and cash equivalents of $(11.0) million (2022: $1.5 million). The decrease is predominantly due to cash consumption from the Bilboes oxide mine operating activities, the higher cost at Blanket and the once-off costs highlighted above.The dividend for 2023 was maintained at the same level as in 2022. As set out in a separate news release issued today, Caledonia has declared a quarterly dividend of 14 cents per share, payable on April 26, 2024. This reflects our confidence in Blanket’s operations and its cash generation. Operating Highlights Annual gold production at Blanket of 75,416 ounces (“oz”) in 2023, in line with guidance.Quarterly gold production at Blanket of 20,172 oz in Q4.2024 gold production guidance at Blanket of 74,000 oz to 78,000 oz2.Gold sales in Q4 excluded 3,057 oz that were held as work-in-progress as at December 31, 2023 and which were sold early in January 2024.Further encouraging results from the deep-level drilling programme at Blanket, as announced in January 2024, which is currently evaluating the continuity of the mineralised zones on the Blanket and Eroica ore bodies. Total drilling for 2023 was 13,280 metres and this, together with ongoing drilling, will be reflected in a revised mineral resource statement expected to be released in the second quarter of 2024. Post Year-end events, Outlook and Strategic Focus The operating and financial performance at Blanket has been in line with management expectations in the first quarter of 2024.The Company is evaluating the initial results of the ongoing work on revised feasibility studies for Bilboes with a specific focus on reducing the initial capital expenditure profile, thereby enhancing the project economics.Dana Roets left the business as Chief Operating Officer on February 29, 2024. A process is well-advanced to appoint a replacement.Tariro Gadzikwa has joined the board as an independent non-executive director.Caledonia’s immediate strategic focus is to: Produce between 74,000 oz to 78,000 oz in 2024 at Blanket and at a similar level in 2025.Complete a revised resource statement thereby extending the life of mine at Blanket.Complete the updated feasibility study on the Bilboes sulphide project to determine the best implementation strategy and estimate the funding requirements, and commence development of the project.Continue with exploration activities at the Motapa exploration project. Mark Learmonth, Chief Executive Officer, commented: “The performance of Blanket remains robust; operating cash flows across the second half of the year show a continuation of the improved operating performance compared to the first half of 2023. We continue to see Blanket as the solid foundation for growth as we pursue our strategy to become a multi-asset gold producer. “I am pleased that the Company also announces today its quarterly dividend of 14 cents which reflects managements confidence in the operations of the business. Future dividend payments will reflect operational performance and an assessment of capital allocation. “At a consolidated level, group profitability for the Quarter was adversely affected by several unanticipated one-off costs, and by higher than expected labour and power costs. Management has taken steps to address these and is evaluating measures to reduce electricity consumption and improve labour efficiency. Gold sales in the Quarter exclude 3,057 ounces of gold that were held as work-in-progress as at December 31, 2023 and which were sold early in January 2024. “We are highly encouraged by the results from the underground exploration programme at Blanket which we restarted during the year; in general, the drilling results, which we announced in July 2023 and January 2024, indicated significantly better widths and grades than previously modelled and we expect to publish a revised resource statement in the second quarter of 2024 which should incorporate an increase in Blanket's life of mine. “Caledonia’s vision has evolved over the last couple of years from being a relatively small operator of a single asset towards a strategy focussed on becoming a multi-asset, Zimbabwe focussed gold producer with an ambition to produce over 250,000 ounces of gold per annum. The acquisition of Bilboes in January 2023 builds on the earlier acquisitions of Motapa and Maligreen to create a portfolio of high-quality exploration and development assets in Zimbabwe. “I look forward to announcing the results of the updated feasibility study for the Bilboes sulphide project soon and firmly believe that we have the potential to create and deliver greater shareholder value from the future inclusion of this project in our production profile.” CommentaryRevenue in the Quarter was 13.1% higher than the last quarter of 2022 (the “comparative quarter”) due to a 0.9% increase in the quantity of gold sold and a 12.2% increase in the average realised price of gold sold. Revenue for the Year was 3.0% higher than in 2022 due to a 7.8% increase in the average realised price of gold sold, offset by 4.4% lower oz sold in the Year compared to 2022. Sales in the Quarter exclude 3,057 oz that were held as work-in-progress at December 31, 2023 and which were sold early in January 2024. Production at Blanket for the Year of 75,416 oz was in line with guidance. Finance costs paid in the Quarter and the Year increased due to overdraft interest of $0.7 million in the Quarter and $1.7 million in the Year (Q4 2022: $0.1 million; 2022: $0.2 million) to accommodate working capital fluctuations at Blanket. In addition, finance costs for the Year included interest of $0.6 million (2022: $nil) related to the Motapa loan notes that were fully repaid on July 3, 2023. Gross profit for the Quarter and Year decreased from the comparative quarter and previous year, due to higher production costs, in particular at the Bilboes oxide mine and electricity and labour costs at Blanket. Increased non-cash, depreciation costs were also incurred as a result of a shortening of the useful life of certain property, plant and equipment items at Blanket in the Year in areas that are planned to be mothballed over the next few years as the mine transitions towards producing entirely from below 750 meters, serviced by the Central Shaft. Blanket’s Q4 production costs increased due to the higher than anticipated use of electricity arising from the continued heavy use of infrastructure at the No. 4 Shaft and Jethro Shaft. These will be used more sparingly going forwards following the commissioning of the Central Shaft. Electricity usage is expected to reduce in 2024 and 2025 as Blanket transitions from the old mine infrastructure and mining activities become centralised in areas accessible by the Central Shaft. Management is reviewing the timing of closing down other shafts and machinery and using infrastructure more efficiently, to reduce future power consumption. The poor quality of electricity supply from the Zimbabwe grid is the most significant production risk at Blanket. In Q4, Blanket’s power supply from the grid was interrupted due to an imbalance between electricity demand and supply. Management is investigating options to alleviate the instability in the utility supply and further reduce the cost of diesel generator usage to supplement low voltage occurrences and power outages. Further work is in process to reduce Blanket's overall electricity consumption by utilising the available shafts and machinery more efficiently. The management of the labour force has improved since December 2023 and, as a result, the overtime costs reduced significantly in December 2023. These efficiencies are expected to continue. Administrative expenses in the Quarter were 43.0% higher than the comparative quarter predominantly due to increased salaries and wages (including the settlement amount paid to the Chief Operating Officer on leaving the business). Administrative expenses in the Year include a one-off fee of $3.1 million paid for advisory services on conclusion of the Bilboes acquisition in January 2023. Excluding both of these costs, which are non-recurring, administration expenses for the Year increased by 5.0% compared to 2022. Finance costs paid in the Quarter and the Year increased due to overdraft interest of $0.7 million in the Quarter and $1.7 million in the Year (Q4 2022: $0.1 million; 2022: $0.2 million) to accommodate working capital fluctuations at Blanket. In addition, finance costs for the Year included interest of $0.6 million (2022: $nil) related to the Motapa loan notes that were fully repaid by July 3, 2023. Net profit for the Quarter and Year was affected by increased production costs, higher depreciation and higher administrative expenses compared to the comparative quarter and previous year. Further, net profit for the Year was negatively affected by foreign exchange losses compared to foreign exchange gains in the previous year. Due to the oxide mining activities at Bilboes incurring losses, it returned to care and maintenance with effect from October 1, 2023, following which the costs at Bilboes reduced from approximately $1 million per month to $200,000 per month, being the costs of security and other care and maintenance costs. Leaching of the oxide ore on the heap leach continued and will continue as long as the gold recovered from the heap contributes to care and maintenance costs. Oxide mining will resume when the stripping of the waste for the sulphide project commences. The ongoing underground drilling program at Blanket targeted the Eroica, Blanket and AR south ore bodies and has yielded encouraging results which were published on July 10, 2023 and January 30, 2024. Total drilling for 2023 was 13,280 metres and the results indicate that the existing Blanket, Eroica and AR South ore bodies have grades and widths which are generally better than expected. This new information will be reflected in a revised resource statement which is expected to be published in the second quarter of 2024 and, in due course, an updated technical report in respect of Blanket. Bilboes Feasibility StudyWork on a revised feasibility study for the large-scale sulphide project at Bilboes is well-advanced and the Company is considering the initial results. Further work continues, particularly focused on reducing the initial capital expenditure with a view to enhancing the project economics. This will require the preparation of a new technical report which reflects the work that has already been performed and the further work that is currently in progress. Management has always stressed that it will consider alternative development paths for Bilboes with a view to optimising capital allocation and thereby maximising the uplift in value for Caledonia shareholders.

The company secured investments from EDF Australia and Canberra Airport Group, along with funding agreements from the Australian and German governments. Vast reported total revenue of $768,000, available cash of $16.5 million, and a net loss of ($281.5) million for the six months ending December 31, 2023. Positive None. Negative The net loss of ($281.5) million for the six months ending December 31, 2023, is a significant increase compared to the net loss of ($3.9) million during the same period in 2022, primarily due to non-cash listing expenses and derivative losses related to the close of the business combination. The total diluted loss per share of ($66.44) for the six months ended December 31, 2023, is substantially higher than the diluted loss per share of ($1.83) for the same period in 2022, indicating a significant negative impact on shareholders. Although the company reported total revenue of $768,000 for the six months ending December 31, 2023, the net loss of ($281.5) million raises concerns about the company's financial performance and sustainability. The increase in total debt outstanding from $5.4 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $26.9 million as of June 30, 2023, indicates potential financial challenges for the company. The significant non-cash listing expenses of $106.0 million and derivative losses of $164.3 million related to the close of the business combination contribute to the substantial net loss reported by Vast Renewables Financial Analyst The financial results released by Vast Renewables Limited indicate a significant net loss of $281.5 million, which is substantially higher than the previous year's loss of $3.9 million. A closer examination of the components contributing to this loss reveals that it is largely due to non-cash listing expenses and derivative losses associated with a business combination. The magnitude of these losses, particularly the derivative losses of $164.3 million, suggests a substantial impact on the company's financial position. However, it is important to note that these are non-recurring expenses that do not directly affect the company's operational cash flow. The increase in revenue, though modest, is a positive sign and reflects the company's ability to secure grant funding and customer revenue, which could be indicative of growing market acceptance of their CSP technology.Moreover, the capital raised from strategic partners like EDF Australia and Canberra Airport Group, along with the conditional funding agreements from the Australian and German governments, positions the company favorably for future growth. The available cash and equivalents of $16.5 million provide a cushion for near-term operations, but the significant net loss raises questions about the company's longer-term financial sustainability without further successful capital raises or a substantial increase in revenue-generating projects. Renewable Energy Analyst Vast Renewables' focus on concentrated solar thermal power (CSP) energy systems positions it within a niche yet growing segment of the renewable energy market. CSP technology is less widespread than photovoltaic solar power but offers advantages such as energy storage for consistent power supply. The company's Solar Methanol 1 project, aimed at producing green methanol, represents an innovative application of CSP technology and reflects the broader industry trend towards diversifying renewable energy applications beyond electricity generation.The strategic investments and partnerships with entities like EDF Australia and Canberra Airport Group underscore the increasing interest in renewable energy solutions for industrial applications, such as sustainable aviation fuel. These partnerships could provide Vast with a competitive edge in the CSP market and foster collaborative advancements in CSP applications. However, the successful deployment and commercialization of their CSP v3.0 technology will be critical to validate the company's value proposition and secure its position in the competitive renewable energy landscape. Market Research Analyst The renewable energy sector is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological advancements. Vast Renewables' operational update, including the progress on the VS1 utility-scale project and the hiring of key personnel with CSP expertise, indicates the company's commitment to strengthening its market position. The partnerships with Worley Ltd. for engineering and design work and the strategic hires for project management, suggest a forward-looking approach to project execution and an investment in human capital that is essential for innovation and growth in this sector.However, the market will be closely monitoring the execution of the VS1 project and the Solar Methanol 1 project for indicators of the company's operational efficiency and technological viability. The ability to deliver these projects on time and on budget will be key to investor confidence and the company's future financial performance. Furthermore, the renewable energy market is influenced by regulatory policies and incentives, making government support a critical factor for Vast's projects. The conditional nature of the government funding agreements means that Vast must meet certain milestones or conditions to secure this financing, which introduces an element of uncertainty in the company's funding outlook. 03/28/2024 - 01:15 AM Operational and Funding Highlights Investment of €10.0 million from EDF Australia, a subsidiary of EDF GroupEquity investment from the Canberra Airport Group valued at USD $9.2 millionSubsequently announced funding agreements for up to AUD $40.0 million from the Australian and German governments to construct the Solar Methanol 1 project along with consortium partner Mabanaft in January 2024Closed business combination with Nabors Energy Transition Corp. on December 18, 2023 Financial Metrics for Six Months Ending December 31, 2023 Total revenue consisting of $768,000, made up of both customer and grant revenueAvailable cash and equivalents of $16.5 millionNet loss of ($281.5) million primarily attributable to non-cash listing expenses of ($106.0) million and derivative losses of ($164.3) million related to the close of the business combinationTotal diluted common shares outstanding as of December 31, 2023 of 29,291,884 SYDNEY, Australia, March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vast Renewables Limited (“Vast” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: VSTE), a renewable energy company specializing in concentrated solar thermal power (“CSP”) energy systems that generate zero-carbon, utility-scale electricity and industrial process heat today announced operational and financial results for the first half of the Company’s fiscal 2024, comprising the six months ended December 31, 2023. Funding Commitments During the first half of fiscal year 2024, Vast announced several funding commitments from strategic partners. In connection with the closing of Vast’s business combination, EDF Australia, a subsidiary of France’s EDF Group, which operates in more than 25 countries worldwide, executed on its capital commitment to Vast of a capital commitment of €10 million in conjunction with an agreement between the companies to partner on development of Australian CSP projects. In addition, Canberra Airport Group executed on its capital commitment valued at $9.2 million. “The support Vast has received from our strategic partners has been very meaningful to the progress of our company, both from a financial as well as operational standpoint,” said Craig Wood, CEO of Vast. “Canberra Airport Group and EDF Australia have shown their enthusiasm for CSP and their commitment to the clean energy transition through their commitments to Vast, with each bringing their own strategic imperatives to the partnerships with an eye to sustainable aviation fuel production and clean energy production. We are very excited to progress and expand our relationships with these two firms.” Subsequent to the end of the first half of the Company’s fiscal 2024, Vast announced the award of a total of up to approximately AUD $40.0 million in conditional funding agreements, in conjunction with the Company’s consortium partner, Mabanaft. As a result of the Solar Methanol 1 (SM1) project’s selection for funding from the German-Australian Hydrogen Innovation and Technology Incubator (HyGATE), Vast will receive up to AUD $19.5 million from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), and Mabanaft is to receive up to €12.4 million from Projektträger Jülich on behalf of the German government. The funding relates to development of Vast’s Solar Methanol 1 (SM1) project in Port Augusta, South Australia, which aims to produce green methanol through use of Vast’s CSP v3.0 technology. Operational Events During the first half of fiscal year 2024, Vast continued to make progress on its first utility-scale project for power generation, known as VS1, located in Port Augusta in South Australia. On June 6, 2023 Vast announced the award to Worley Ltd. of contracts for basic engineering and front-end engineering and design (FEED) work for the VS1 project. “I am pleased by the progress on Vast’s VS1 project and excited by the partnership we have so far forged with Worley,” said Mr. Wood. “Bringing VS1 online using our CSP v3.0 technology will be a team effort, and we could not have selected a better teammate. Initial engineering on this first-of-its-kind project is crucial to its success, and we are confident in Worley’s approach. As VS1 moves forward through calendar 2024, we will look to further expand our world-class team.” Key Hires and Board of Directors On August 23, 2023, Vast announced the hiring of Marshall D. (Mark) Smith as chief financial officer. Based between Vast’s Sydney headquarters and Houston, Texas, Mr. Smith brings more than 30 years of experience to the position, including energy industry expertise and leadership in operations, capital allocation, business development, and financial management. Most recently, he was CFO for a Texas-based privately held oil and gas company, having previously served as CFO for Guidon Energy, an oil and gas company that was Blackstone Energy Partners’ largest energy-focused investment. Mr. Smith also held executive positions at California Resources Corporation, Occidental Petroleum, Ultra Petroleum, and J.M. Huber Energy. Prior to that, he served as a Managing Director of Investment banking at Nesbitt Burns Securities (now BMO Capital Markets). On September 9, 2023, the Company announced the hiring of Federico Sandoval as project director for the VS1 project. Mr. Sandoval brings a wealth of CSP expertise and a global track record of success to this role. His previous role as construction manager at Noor Energy in the UAE and his prior experiences with multiple CSP projects worldwide should make him an invaluable contributor to the Vast team and the delivery of VS1. On January 12, 2024, the Company announced its complete seven-member board of directors. Vast’s board of directors is comprised of Chairman Peter Botten, an experienced energy executive, including over 26 years as managing director of Oil Search; Vast CEO Craig Wood; William Restrepo, chief financial officer of Nabors Industries Inc.; Colleen Calhoun, formerly of General Electric and Quaise Energy; Tom Quinn, an experienced energy and infrastructure executive with global experience; Colin Richardson, an experienced investment banker; and John Yearwood, an experienced board member and former CEO, President and COO of Smith International, Inc. Financial Results For the six months ending December 31, 2023 Vast reported total revenue of $768,000, compared to $547,000 for the same period in 2022. This included approximately $440,000 in revenue received in the form of grants and approximately $328,000 in revenue received from customers. The overall increase in revenue during the six months ending December 31, 2023 was related to (a) increased activity in relation to the design, engineering and project management services for a solar facility owned by Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), and (b) higher estimated refundable Research & Development tax rebate recoveries due to higher spend incurred on eligible activities. During the period, Vast reported a net loss of ($281.5) million compared to a net loss of ($3.9) million during the previous year’s period. This is equal to diluted loss per share of ($66.44) for the six months ended December 31, 2023 as compared to diluted loss per share of ($1.83) for the same period in 2022. The increase in net loss was primarily related to non-cash accounting activities related to the close of the business combination, predominantly (a) share based listing expense recognized upon consummation of the business combination, amounting to $106.0 million, and (b) the loss realized recorded upon conversion of Convertible financial instruments previously issued by Vast, immediately prior to the consummation of the business combination, amounting to $170.4 million. On December 31, 2023, the Company had total available cash and equivalents of $16.5 million compared to $2.1 million on June 30, 2023. The Company reported total debt outstanding of $5.4 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $26.9 million as of June 30, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, Vast had total diluted common shares outstanding of 29,291,884.

The accompanying notes form part of the consolidated financial statements Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements 1. General information The consolidated financial statements comprise of Vast Renewables Limited (formerly Vast Solar Pty Ltd) and the entities it controls. Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this report to “we,” “us,” “our,” “the Company,” or “Vast” mean Vast Renewables Limited and the entities it controls. Vast is an Australian public company limited by shares incorporated on March 27, 2009. We are a leading renewable energy company that has developed concentrated solar power (CSP) systems to generate, store and dispatch carbon free, utility-scale electricity and industrial heat, and to enable the production of green fuels. Our unique approach to CSP utilizes a proprietary, modular sodium loop to efficiently capture and convert solar heat into these end products. Our vision is to provide continuous carbon-free energy globally by deploying our CSP technology and complementary technologies (e.g., intermittent solar PV and wind) to deliver renewable and dispatchable electricity, heat and storage on a continuous basis. We believe our CSP technology is capable of providing competitive, dispatchable and carbon-free power for on- and off-grid power generation applications, energy storage, process heat, and has the potential to unlock green fuels production. Vast's registered office and principal place of business is as follows: Level 7, Suite 02, 124 Walker Street North Sydney NSW 2060 With consummation of the SPAC Merger with Nabors Energy Transition Corp. (“NETC”) on December 18, 2023 (the “Closing Date”) as provided in note 19, this transaction is accounted for as a capital reorganization. The SPAC Merger, which is not within the scope of IFRS 3 as NETC does not meet the definition of a business in accordance with IFRS 3, is accounted for within the scope of IFRS 2. As such, the SPAC Merger was achieved with the Company issuing shares to NETC shareholders in exchange for the net liabilities of NETC ($11.2 million) as of the Closing Date, accompanied by a share recapitalization. The net liabilities of NETC are stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Any excess of the fair value of the Company’s shares issued considering a fair value of the Vast Ordinary Shares of $11.99 per share (price of Vast Ordinary Shares at the Closing Date) over the fair value of NETC’s identifiable net liabilities acquired represents compensation for the service of a share exchange listing for its shares and is expensed as incurred (“share based listing expense”) and further details of share based listing expense is provided in note 19. As a result of the SPAC Merger, NETC became a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of the Company. On December 19, 2023, the Ordinary Shares and public Vast Warrants commenced trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, or “Nasdaq,” under the symbols “VSTE” and “VSTEW,” respectively. The following table provides information relating to our directors and executive officers as of the date of approving these condensed financial statements.

Significant accounting policiesa) Basis of preparation The condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the half-year reporting period ended December 31, 2023 have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. These financial statements comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”), as applicable to interim financial reporting. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the notes of the type normally included in an annual financial report. Therefore, these financial statements should be read together with the annual financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those applied in the Company’s 2023 annual financial statements, except as disclosed below in note 1 (c). Functional and presentation currency The functional currency of Vast is Australian dollars (“AUD”) being the primary economic environment in which it operates. The presentation currency of Vast is United States (“US” or “$”) dollars. b) Going concern Vast incurred a net loss of $281.5 million and $3.9 million for the half-years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively and used net cash in operating activities of $28.0 million and $2.8 million for the half-years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had net current assets of $7.1 million and total net assets of $2.2 million. As of December 31, 2023, promissory notes totalling $5.4 million held by EDF were outstanding and included in the Company’s liabilities. On January 12, 2024, Vast issued an additional 681,620 Ordinary Shares to Nabors Lux 2 S.a.r.l (“Nabors”) for a consideration of $7.0 million pursuant to the Nabors Backstop Agreement, as contemplated in the Business Combinations Agreement (“BCA”). In addition, under the BCA, Nabors granted Vast a term loan in the form of the Backstop Loan Agreement in an amount of up to $5.0 million which Vast expects to draw upon within the next 12 months. The Company is forecasting that it will continue to incur significant operating cash outflows to fund the contracting, construction and commissioning of its current projects and to meet all of its obligations, including interest and principal payments on the outstanding debt. In particular, the development and delivery of projects “VS1” (a 30 MW / 288 MWh reference CSP plant located in Port Augusta, South Australia) and “SM1” (a 20 ton per day solar methanol demonstration facility that will be co-located with and partially powered by VS1) will require substantial funding. These projects are expected to rely on outside sources of financing. The Australian Renewable Energy Agency’s (ARENA) has announced funding of up to AUD 65 million on February 13, 2023 for VS1. On January 27, 2023, ARENA also announced that Vast will receive up to AUD 19.5 million from ARENA and Vast’s consortium partner, Mabanaft will receive up to EUR 12.4 million from Projektträger Jülich on behalf of the German government for SM1, in each case as part of the HyGATE Program. The funding awards for VS1 and SM1 are each subject to multiple conditions precedent, including but not limited to the ability to provide sufficient equity to meet the balance of funding requirements for the projects, the projects achieving financial close prior to specified dates and securing relevant permitting and approvals such as a grid connection. In addition, the Australian Federal government has announced financial support for the development of VS1 of up to AUD 110 million, the terms and conditions of which (including, inter alia, achievement of financial close of VS1 by a specified date) are to be negotiated with the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water and approved by the Australian Federal Government. Vast intends to raise additional funding through an external capital raise commencing early in the financial year ending June 30, 2025. Vast’s ability to pursue its growth strategy and to continue as a going concern is principally dependent on the ability of the Company to meet its cash flow forecasts and to raise additional funding as and when necessary. As a result of the above, there is material uncertainty related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt (or raise substantial doubt as contemplated by PCAOB standards) on Vast’s ability to continue as a going concern, and therefore, that the Company may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. c) Application of new and amended accounting standards adopted by the group A number of amended standards became applicable for the current reporting period. The group did not have to change its accounting policies or make retrospective adjustments as a result of adopting these amended standards. 3. Revenue from customers Six Months Ended December 31, 2023 2022 (In thousands of US Dollars)Consulting fees$326$146Margin fees 2 62 $328$208 Consulting fees Revenue from consulting fees is recognised predominantly in relation to the design, engineering and project management services for a solar facility owned by Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), based on the actual services provided to them at the end of the reporting period as a proportion of the total services to be provided. Revenue is recognised over time as the customer receives and uses the benefits from consulting services simultaneously. This is determined based on the actual labour hours spent relative to the total expected labour hours for each project or contract. Estimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress toward completion are revised if circumstances change. Any resulting increases or decreases in estimated revenue or costs are reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the circumstances that give rise to the change become known by management. In the case of fixed-price contracts, the customer pays the fixed amount based on a payment schedule. If the services rendered by Vast exceed the payment, a contract asset is recognised. If the payments exceed the services rendered, a contract liability is recognised. Margin fees In relation to the facility mentioned above, Vast is charging a margin fee in the form of 10% administration and handling fee for the procurement of equipment, components, and materials on behalf of CSIRO. The Company recognises revenue from procurement service at a point in time when goods are acquired and are presented net of relevant gross receipts and gross payments. 4. Grant revenue Research and Development tax incentivesIn order to encourage the industry to invest more in R&D, the Australian government offers a tax incentive that reduces the Company’s R&D costs by offering tax offsets for eligible R&D expenditure. Under the R&D Tax Incentive, Vast is eligible to receive a refundable R&D tax offset in respect of its eligible R&D expenditure. R&D tax incentives Six Months Ended December 31, 2023 2022 (In thousands of US Dollars)Refundable R&D tax offset for the half-year$440$339R&D Tax credit recoveries recognised as grant income$440$339 5.

Income tax expense The standard rate of corporations’ tax applied to taxable profit is 25% for the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. As at December 31, 2023, Vast has unused tax losses of $6.2 million for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised for the unused tax losses as they are not likely to generate taxable income in the foreseeable future. Income tax expense is recognised based on management’s estimate of the weighted average effective annual income tax rate expected for the full financial year. As management has determined that the recognition criteria associated with Deferred Tax Assets, including Deferred Tax Assets arising from unused losses is not satisfied, whereby it must be probable that future taxable profits will arise, no income tax expense has been recorded and therefore there is no effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. During the half-year ended December 31, 2023, as part of the BCA, Vast entered into a Noteholder Support and Loan Termination Agreement whereby each of the convertible promissory notes held by AgCentral Energy were discharged and terminated in exchange for Vast shares, as repayment of all the principal outstanding and accrued interest immediately prior to the BCA. As such requirements of the Commercial Debt Forgiveness provisions of the income tax legislation applied, and a gain on forgiveness arose where the market value of the commercial debt amount released was greater than the market value of the shares issued. The net forgiven amount upon consummation of the BCA was $17.1 million. The gain on forgiveness was applied to reduce the tax losses brought forward as at June 30, 2023, certain expenditure amounts incurred in previous income years, and the cost base of certain Capital Gains Tax assets. 7.

The Inflation Reduction Act imposes a 1% excise tax on the fair market value of stock repurchases made by covered corporations after December 31, 2022. As at December 31, 2022, trade payables and accrued expenses were predominantly made of consulting, legal and consulting fees payable or accrued. 10. Warrants liability December 31,June 30, 20232023 (In thousands of US Dollars)Warrants liability2,767- 2,767- Vast Warrants exchanged in lieu of NETC Warrants consist of 27,529,987 potential ordinary shares, made of: (i) 13,799,987 Ordinary Shares that are issuable by us upon the exercise of 13,799,987 Public Warrants, and (ii) 13,730,000 Ordinary Shares that are issuable by us upon the exercise of 13,730,000 Private Warrants. Each Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Ordinary Shares at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, with substantially the same terms as those of the NETC Warrant Agreements. NETC Warrants Issuance date: November 16, 2021, transferred to Vast on December 18, 2023Maturity date: 5 years from the date of consummation of the BCAExercisable: at any time after 30 days from the date of consummation of the BCAPrivate Warrants may not be sold or transferred for 30 days from the date of consummation of the BCAPublic Warrants may be redeemed by the issuer at a nominal price if the stock price, when the Warrant is exercisable, reaches a threshold price for 20 out of 30 consecutive days as follows: Redemption price: $0.01Threshold price: $18.00 Effective upon consummation of the BCA, each Vast Warrant is exercisable solely for Vast Ordinary Shares;the number of Vast Ordinary Shares issued upon exercise of each Vast Warrant is equal to the number of shares of NETC Class A Common Stock issued upon exercise of the applicable NETC Warrant;the per share exercise price for the Vast Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of such Vast Warrant is equal to the per share exercise price for the shares of NETC Class A Common Stock subject to the applicable NETC Warrant, as in effect immediately prior to the consummation of the BCA. Both Public and Private Warrants are accounted for as liabilities under IFRS 9 following consummation of the BCA and valued at the Public Warrants trading price. Accordingly, they will be subject to ongoing mark-to-market adjustments through the statement of profit or loss. As at December 31, 2023, the fair value of Private and Public Warrants has been determined as the quoted price of $0.10. 11. Borrowings December 31,June 30, 20232023 CurrentNon-currentCurrentNon-current (In thousands of US Dollars)Convertible Notes – AgCentral--14,281-Senior Convertible Notes - AgCentral and Nabors Lux---7,134Shareholder Loan – AgCentral--5,531-Promissory Note – EDF-5,404-- -5,40419,8127,134 a) Promissory Note – EDF On December 19, 2023, Vast Intermediate HoldCo Pty Ltd (HoldCo) issued a Promissory Note to EDF Australia Pacific Pty Ltd (EDF). The key contractual terms of the Promissory Note have been summarised below: The Noteholder is EDF Australia Pacific Pty Ltd.The Promissory Note has a Face Value equivalent to EURO 10,000,000 converted into US $10,831,953 at the USD:EUR exchange rate on Bloomberg on the Closing Date.The Promissory Note will accrue interest at 3% per annum. Interest accrues daily on the daily balance of the Outstanding Principal Amount.The Promissory Note has a term of 5 years from the date of issuance; however the Maturity Date may be extended for a period of 2 years at HoldCo’s option by written notice to EDF. On written notice from HoldCo, EDF must extend.EDF has the right to exchange all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount and interest on the Promissory Note at an exchange rate of US $10.20 per share for a period of 5 years (7 years, if extended) following closing. Any partial exchange cannot be less than US$2,000,000. The exchange is conditional on satisfaction of an exchange condition being, EDF has invested at least US$20,000,000 in the project entity of a CSP Project. The project entity of a CSP Project pertains to the standalone entity incorporated for the purpose of developing the CSP project. EDF can elect an amount up to 75% of its equity contribution to the project entity. The remaining portion is Vast's contribution. A separate Joint Venture agreement will also be entered into for each approved CSP project. This is governed by the ‘Joint Development Agreement’ entered into between Vast Parent and EDF in connection with the ‘Note Purchase Agreement’. Please refer to note 17 - Contingent assets, liabilities & commitment for further discussion on the Joint Development Agreement.New investment clause: If Vast enters into an agreement with certain parties, pursuant to which these parties will pay or contribute funds to Vast, the terms of the agreement in respect to security or priority; duration; or interest rate should not be more favourable than that of the Promissory Note. If the terms are more favourable, then the terms to the agreement will be automatically amended to match such other parties’ terms.If Vast enters into an agreement to raise capital from third party strategic investors through a privately negotiated transaction and any such funds are used to repay the Nabors Backstop then the terms should be no less favourable than the terms of the Promissory Note. If so, the terms of the Promissory Note shall be automatically amended. As at December 31, 2023, management has evaluated that HoldCo remains in compliance with all covenants, financial (including a prohibition on the declaration or payment of dividends) and non-financial, with respect to the EDF Promissory Note such that non-current classification of the liability is appropriate on the Condensed Statement of Financial Position. As at December 31, 2023, Vast has evaluated its issuance of the note to determine if the components qualify as derivatives requiring separate recognition in its financial statements. The Company has determined the New investment clause, conversion and interest settlement features at the option of noteholder, to be an ‘embedded derivative’ requiring recognition separate from the borrowings. After the recognition of the embedded derivative, the Company recognises the promissory note at amortised cost, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis over the tenure of the note. The result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of the embedded derivative is revalued at each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability, and the change in fair value during the reporting period is recorded in other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. The current or non-current classification of derivative instruments is reassessed at the end of each reporting period. The embedded derivative as part of such contracts have been tabulated below: December 31,June 30,ComponentParticulars20232023 (In thousands of US Dollars)Embedded derivativePromissory Note – EDF950- 950- On issuance date, the Embedded derivative liability was recognised for $5.5 million. The Company’s closing share price on the first day of trading, i.e. $11.99 was used, being the closest observable market price to the valuation date. As at December 31, 2023 the valuation of the instrument was measured at $1.0 million, the reduction being predominantly driven by the significant decrease in the Company’s share price during the period since issuance ($5.19 as at December 31, 2023).

Each outstanding note can be converted into one ordinary share (‘conversion’).Coupon interest is payable at the rate of 8% per annum on the principal outstanding. Interest accrues daily and is payable every six months.Within the first 18 months of issuance, Vast has the option to settle interest payments in cash or by issuance of additional convertible notes. After the first 18 months, the Noteholder has the option to choose settlement of interest by payment in cash or by issuance of additional convertible notes (‘interest settlement’). As of June 30, 2023, there has been no conversion election from the Noteholder. Refer to note 13 – Issued capital for details on conversion of these notes upon consummation of the BCA.The latest modified maturity date of all convertible notes was October 31, 2021 prior to the extensions noted below. On June 25, 2021, Vast received an interest waiver from the noteholder, where interest was forgiven from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 on all convertible notes along with a revised maturity date of December 31, 2022. On May 24, 2022, Vast received another interest waiver, where interest was forgiven from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022 on all convertible notes, along with a revised maturity date of December 31, 2023. Further, on June 30, 2023, Vast received another interest waiver, where interest on Convertible notes 3, 4 and 5 was forgiven from January 1, 2023 to the earlier of the effective date of the BCA and December 31, 2023. Senior Convertible Notes issued by Vast were subjected to the following terms: The Noteholder of Tranche 2 is AgCentral Energy Pty Ltd, the parent entity of Vast. The Noteholder of Tranches 1 and 3 is Nabors Lux 2 S.a.r.l.The Senior Convertible Notes will accrue interest at 4% per annum, ceasing when the Senior Convertible Notes are either redeemed or converted into ordinary shares. Interest is payable six months in arrears. The Company may, at its discretion (but with notice to the Noteholders), pay interest in cash or capitalise interest to the principal amount outstanding for each Senior Convertible Note.If the Company undergoes a business combination, the Senior Convertible Notes will mandatorily be converted to ordinary shares in this instance, with the conversion price based on the market price of shares at a 25% discount.If the Company undergoes a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (“SPAC”) transaction, the Senior Convertible Notes will mandatorily be converted to ordinary shares in this instance, with the conversion price fixed at $10.20. Refer to note 13 – Issued capital for details on conversion of these notes upon consummation of the BCA.If the Company undergoes an event of default or change of control, the Noteholders may choose to either redeem the Senior Convertible Notes for cash or convert them into ordinary shares. In a conversion event, the conversion price will be based on the market price of shares at a 25% discount.The conversion of the notes is at the discretion of Vast (other than in a scenario where conversion is mandated), if they are held to maturity. Each Senior Convertible Note has a term of 18 months from the date of issuance. Up to the consummation of the BCA, Vast has evaluated its issuance of each convertible note, including Senior Convertible Notes, to determine if the components qualify as derivatives requiring separate recognition in its financial statements. The Company has determined the conversion and interest settlement features at the option of noteholder, to be an ‘embedded derivative’ requiring recognition separate from the borrowings. After the recognition of the embedded derivative, the Company recognises the convertible notes at amortised cost, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis over the tenure of convertible notes. The result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of the embedded derivative is revalued at each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability, and the change in fair value during the reporting period is recorded in other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. The current or non-current classification of derivative instruments is reassessed at the end of each reporting period. Refer to note 16 - Financial Instruments - Fair values and financial risk management for further details.

Vast acquired 50% of the shares in SiliconAurora on June 15, 2022 from 14D for consideration of $0.07 million as an initial payment and $1.58 million as deferred consideration. The deferred consideration of $0.62 million was paid in July 2022 from the short term loan obtained from Vast’s shareholder and the remainder of $0.96 million is expected to be paid by October 31, 2024, subject to the joint venture receiving a written offer/ notice to connect from the relevant network service provider. The Company intends to undertake fundraising activities. The funds raised from those activities are intended to be used to settle the acquisition of SiliconAurora by repaying the remaining component of deferred consideration and fund Vast's on-going operational expenditure. SiliconAurora Pty Ltd will be “the legal and beneficial owner” of all the existing assets comprising the project.

They have been recognised as an incremental share based payment upon consummation of the BCA under IFRS 2. Refer to note 19 – Capital reorganization (the “SPAC Merger”) for further details on the share based listing expense. The fair value of the Earnouts has been estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the pay-off based on contractual terms using the following key inputs: underlying asset value: a range of value between AUD $1 million to AUD $4 millionclosing stock price at valuation date: $11.99price volatility of the company’s shares, based on guideline companies adjusted for size and leverage: 25%discounted at the term-matched risk free rate: 3.90% Earnout for Legacy Vast shareholder issuable to AgCentral: In addition, upon the occurrence of Triggering Events I, II, and III discussed above, and of Triggering Event IV” meaning the date on which a notice to proceed is issued under a contract in respect of the procurement of a 30MW/288MWhr concentrated solar power project at Port Augusta in South Australia, 2,799,999 Ordinary Shares are issuable to AgCentral pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement. The quoted market price of Vast shares that was used to determine the cost of listing is presumed to include an adjustment for these earnout shares. As a consequence, the fair value of the earnout shares issuable to Legacy Vast shareholders is are already factored into the cost of listing and a separate adjustment was not considered necessary. MEP shares (equity settled): The purpose of the Management Equity Plan (“MEP”) was to provide medium to long term incentive to eligible employees and contractors of Vast by having a plan pool limit of 100 shares. 80 shares were issued during the year ended June 30, 2021 at a fair value of AUD $70 per share, with eligible employees and contractors paying cash of AUD $10 per share in addition to providing services to the Company in exchange for those shares. As the shares did not have any vesting conditions, the excess of the grant date fair value of the shares and the amount paid by the employees was therefore recognised as share-based payment expense in full at the time of the grant of the shares. The shares did not carry any voting rights nor rights to any dividends or other distributions. Following the occurrence of a liquidity event as defined in the MEP Deed or as otherwise defined by the Company’s Board of Directors (“Board”), the Board in its discretion could allow MEP shareholders an entitlement linked to the exit price in form of cash or conversion to ordinary shares from such an event. As per the MEP Deed, management’s share is 25% of exit proceeds where the sale price is AUD$10 million or less, or 33.33% where it is above AUD$10 million. Vast had historically accounted for the share-based payment as an equity-settled scheme, as Vast had determined that it did not have a present obligation to settle the share-based payment in cash. On February 14, 2023, Vast, AgCentral Energy and the participants to the MEP entered into a MEP De-SPAC Side Deed and Amendment to the MEP Deed to clarify a suitable mechanism for MEP participants to realise the economic benefit of their MEP Shares. The key modification terms of the MEP De-SPAC Side Deed and Amendment to the MEP Deed include the introduction of a vesting period and ‘Agreed Fixed Deductions’ to be used in allocation of profits on completion of the BCA. The modification of the terms and conditions of the MEP did not increase the total fair value of the share-based payment arrangement and was not beneficial to the MEP participants. As a result, there was no additional expense recognised. The MEP shares meet the definition of a share-based payment arrangement as eligible employees and contractors will receive equity instruments in exchange for services provided to the Company, with a partial cash subscription payment. Accordingly, MEP shares are recognised at their grant date fair values of AUD $70 per share, with the difference between cash proceeds received (AUD $10 per share) and the fair value of MEP shares recognised within the share-based payment reserve. In addition, immediately prior to the consummation of the BCA, 5 MEP shares were cancelled on December 18, 2023. Upon consummation of the BCA, the 75 MEP shares issued to eligible employees and contractors of Vast were converted into 2,036,900 Ordinary Shares, forming part of the Legacy Vast issued capital. The 75 MEP shares converted at a rate of 26,453 Vast Ordinary Shares per MEP, with 5 MEP shares receiving an additional 10,581 Vast Ordinary Shares per MEP share. The additional value allocated to these shares were recognised at fair value and expensed immediately through profit or loss within share based payment expense for USD 0.6 million (refer to note 5 – Expenses). Shares issued under the Employee share plan for the benefit of participants in Vast’s Equity Remuneration Schemes (equity settled): On December 18, 2023, 264,533 Ordinary Shares were granted to certain employees of Vast and issued to an employee share trust until such time they are vested, out of the previous MEP share pool, which had not been previously granted to any employees prior to the BCA. Vast consolidates the trust. These shares are treated as treasury shares with Nil carrying value as at December 31, 2023. Those shares were issued by Vast at the discretion of AgCentral. As such, Vast made a grant of share based payment to employees, including key management personnel. Refer to note 20 – Related Party transactions for further details. The employee shares have the following key terms and conditions attached to them: For the purposes the IFRS 2 charge the fair value at grant date was calculated using $11.99 per shareVesting Conditions: The shares will vest on expiry of the Disposal Restriction Period.Service Conditions: The employees have to still be employed on expiry of the Disposal Restriction Period.Disposal Restriction Period: The shares will be subject to a total restriction on disposal for a period of 12 months commencing on the issue of the shares.Shares will be held on trust by Vast Employee Share Holdings Pty Ltd as trustee for the Vast Employee Share Trust. These shares have vesting conditions attached to them and therefore a share based payment expense was recorded under IFRS 2 at fair value through profit or loss for USD 0.1 million (refer to note 5 – Expenses).

The gains arising as a result of the changes to the terms and conditions were therefore recognised directly in equity as a contribution in their capacity as owner.

The valuation of these instruments immediately prior to the close of the business combination arrangement have utilised a share price of $11.99 as the spot price, being Vast’s closing stock price on December 19, 2023. Derivative valuations have been determined by a Black-Scholes formula adjusted for dilution. Volatility of 40% has been applied as at December 18, 2023 against all tranches. Risk free rates of 5.63% (Convertible Notes 3, 4 and 5) and of 5.15% (Senior Convertible Notes) have been applied as at December 18, 2023. (b) Market risk (i) Foreign exchange riskForeign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not Vast’s functional currency i.e. AUD. Exposure Vast’s exposure to foreign currency risk at the end of the reporting period, expressed in EUR and USD are as follows: December 31,June 30, 20232023 (In thousands)Trade payables EUR8117USD2,29666 Amounts recognised in profit or loss and other comprehensive income:During the year, the following foreign exchange related amounts were recognised in profit or loss: Six Months Ended December 31, 2023 2022 (In thousands of US Dollars)Amounts recognised in profit or loss Unrealised Currency Gain/(Loss)58 - Realised Currency Gain/(Loss)(56)(8) 2 (8) Given the limited exposure, Vast manages its foreign exchange risk exposure by monitoring exchange rates at regular intervals before making an informed decision to transact in such currencies. (c) Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to Vast if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations arising principally from Vast’s receivables from customers. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents as well as credit exposures from customers, including outstanding receivables. The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. Trade receivablesVast’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer which are primarily government organisation and joint operator. Vast applies IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables. Management believes that Vast's overall exposure to credit risk from Trade receivables to be not material. Cash and cash equivalentsVast held cash and cash equivalents of $16.5 million and $2.1 million as of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively. The cash and cash equivalents are held with bank and financial institution counterparties, which are rated AA- based on Standard and Poor’s ratings. Management believes that Vast's overall exposure to credit risk from cash and cash equivalents to be not material. (d) Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that Vast will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. Vast’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to Vast’s reputation. Vast’s exposure to Liquidity risk primarily pertains to promissory notes issued to EDF. Coupon interest is payable at the rate of 3% per annum on the principal outstanding while interest accrues daily and is capitalised and payable at maturity (i.e. December 14, 2028). During the six months ended December 31, 2023, the Company entered into the Nabors Backstop Agreement (as amended by the amendment to the Nabors Backstop Agreement dated December 7, 2023) whereby Nabors Lux is to provide $10.0 million backstop to Vast to underwrite the potential investment by additional investors provided that the amount of the backstop be reduced dollar-for-dollar by (a) the balance of cash remaining in the Trust Account after giving effect to any redemptions of NETC Class A Common Stock by NETC public stockholders and (b) amounts invested by additional third parties (other than Nabors, AgCentral, CAG, EDF and their respective affiliates). During the six months ended December 31, 2023, as part of the BCA, Vast entered into a Noteholder Support and Loan Termination Agreement whereby each of the convertible notes held by AgCentral Energy were discharged and terminated in exchange for Vast shares, as repayment of all the principal outstanding and accrued interest immediately prior to the de-SPAC process.

If Vast is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations and reducing overhead expenses. 17. Contingent assets, liabilities & commitment 1) In 2021, the Company received contributions from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) in relation to funding a 30 MW concentrated solar thermal power reference plant variation contract (variation funding agreement). In relation to the funding agreement, the arrangement includes a clause on change of control, which indicated that if the Company failed to get funding to build the facility in Australia by May 31, 2024 but obtains finance for an offshore facility before that period, it would give rise to the requirement to repay a proportion of funding received from ARENA. At reporting date and upon entering into BCA, the Company did not identify such circumstances, as significant progress has been made on this facility in Australia. Furthermore, the funding agreement, and hence any contingent liability associated with it, was terminated on August 16, 2023. Refer to note 2 (b) – Going concern for further details regarding the Company’s funding requirements. 2) On December 7, 2023, the Company entered into a Joint Development Agreement (“JDA”) with EDF, pursuant to which : the Company and EDF will co-develop CSP Projects on an exclusive basis, subject to certain preexisting exceptions, in (i) Australia and, (ii) subject to certain conditions relating to expanding this exclusivity, other jurisdictions,EDF will be provided with a right to elect to invest equity in CSP Projects which become Approved Projects andthe Company will have the right to be the exclusive supplier of CSP Technology to all Potential Eligible Projects, Eligible Projects and Approved Projects. Pursuant to the EDF JDA, the parties have agreed to collaborate on certain development activities with respect to CSP Projects. The Company and EDF will establish a steering committee, composed of two appointees from each party, to oversee and govern the activities of the EDF JDA. Costs with respect to Eligible Projects developed under the EDF JDA will be borne by the parties equally. The EDF JDA also specifies that a joint venture agreement (“JVA”) will be entered into for each jointly developed project which reaches a certain stage of development. EDF has a right to invest in Approved Projects for an amount up to (1) 75% of the equity capital for an Approved Project, and (2) up to 75% of the equity capital of VS1, VS3 (a proposed 150 MW CSP facility with 12-18 hours of thermal storage located in Port Augusta, South Australia) and SM1 in the aggregate. Neither party will contribute any pre-existing background intellectual property used in the joint effort; however, intellectual property rights developed or derived by either party in connection with the EDF JDA will be jointly owned by both the Company and EDF, and each party grants the other party a royalty-free, non-exclusive license to other intellectual property used in connection with the EDF JDA. The EDF JDA will automatically terminate upon the later of (1) seven years from the closing date of the EDF Note Purchase Agreement and (2) the date the parties entered into a JVA with respect to an Approved Project with an expected nameplate capacity equal to or exceeding 200 megawatts, which may include a JVA for VS1, VS3 and SM1. The EDF JDA contains customary provisions regarding certain events of default and each party’s right to terminate its obligations thereunder. In the event a party contemplates a Change of Control of such party, the other party must first consent to such Change of Control but such consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed if (1) the transferor is the Company, it continues to own 100% of the CSP Technology and the Background IP (as defined therein) and (2) the transferee continues to have the technical and financial capability to perform its obligations under the EDF JDA.As at December 31, 2023, Vast is assessing EDF JDA under the scope of IFRS 11. No further developments have occurred under the JDA that would impact these condensed financial statements. 18. Subsequent Events 1) On January 10, 2024, Vast appointed Mr Peter Botten as Chairman and Mr Tom Quinn as non-executive director in addition to its recently expanded Board. Refer to note 1 – General information for detailed composition of the Board. 2) On January 12, 2024, Vast issued an additional 681,620 Ordinary Shares to Nabors Lux for a consideration of $7.0 million pursuant to the Nabors Backstop Agreement, as contemplated in the BCA. The Nabors Backstop Agreement contains a ""most favoured nation clause"" whereby if, prior to the six-month anniversary of the closing of the BCA, and to certain parties during the following three months, Vast completes a capital raise on more favourable terms than those in the Nabors Backstop Agreement, then the shares issued under the Nabors Backstop Agreement may be redeemable for debt or Vast may be required to issue additional equity instruments to Nabors such that the terms of the Nabors Backstop Agreement are equally as favourable. On the basis no issuance of shares has occurred as at December 31, 2023, no receivable was recorded on the Company’s statement of financial position as at December 31, 2023. 3) On February 5, 2024, Vast moved its registered office and principal place of business to the following address:Level 7, Suite 02, 124 Walker StreetNorth SydneyNSW 2060 4) On February 14, 2024, Vast announced, along with its consortium partner Mabanaft, that they have signed funding agreements for up to approximately AUD $40 million for SM1. As announced in January 2023, Vast will receive up to AUD $19.48 million from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and Mabanaft will receive up to EUR $12.4 million from Projektträger Jülich (PtJ) on behalf of the German government after the SM1 project was selected last year as a part of the German-Australian Hydrogen Innovation and Technology Incubator (known as HyGATE). 5) On February 15, 2024, Vast announced that on February 9, 2024, it received a notification (the “Notice”) from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) stating that the Company is not in compliance with the requirements to maintain a minimum Market Value of Publicly Held Shares (“MVPHS”) of $15,000,000, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(C) (the “MVPHS Requirement”). The Notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s ordinary shares (the “Ordinary Shares”), which continue to trade on Nasdaq under the symbol “VSTE.” The Notice provided that, in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5810(c)(3)(D), the Company has a period of 180 calendar days from the date of the Notice, or until August 7, 2024, to regain compliance with the MVPHS Requirement. During this period, the Ordinary Shares will continue to trade on Nasdaq. Nasdaq will deem the Company to have regained compliance with the MVPHS Requirement if at any time during this compliance period the Company’s MVPHS closes at $15,000,000 or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business days. In the event the Company does not regain compliance with the MVPHS Requirement by August 7, 2024, the Company will receive written notification from Nasdaq that the Company’s Ordinary Shares are subject to delisting. The Company is reviewing its options for regaining compliance with the MVPHS Requirement. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain compliance with the MVPHS Requirement in a timely fashion, in which case its securities may be delisted from Nasdaq. 19. Capital reorganization (the “SPAC Merger”) The SPAC Merger was accounted for as a capital reorganization by Vast. The merger was achieved by Vast issuing shares to NETC shareholders in exchange for the net liabilities of NETC as of the closing date. The SPAC Merger was not within the scope of IFRS 3 because NETC did not meet the definition of a business in accordance with IFRS 3. Rather, the SPAC Merger was accounted for as an asset acquisition, with the difference between the fair value of the purchase consideration of NETC over the fair value of NETC’s identifiable net liabilities acquired expensed as service for stock exchange listing under IFRS 2. Vast was determined to be the accounting acquirer based on the following: Vast’s previous majority shareholder has a majority voting interest;AgCentral, a Legacy Vast shareholder, has the ability to nominate the majority of the members of the board of directors;The existing senior management of Vast continues to be the senior management following the SPAC Merger;The business of Vast comprises the ongoing operations following the SPAC Merger; andVast was the larger entity, both in terms of substantive operations and number of employees. Share based listing expenses of $106.0 million represent non-cash IFRS 2 charges recorded in connection with the consummation of the SPAC merger. The transaction is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 with an expense reflected for the difference between the fair value of the Ordinary Shares issued to NETC shareholders as compared to the fair value of NETC’s net assets or liabilities, as relevant, contributed. The fair value of the Vast Ordinary Shares was determined based on a quoted market price of $11.99 per Ordinary share at closing as of December 19, 2023. The estimated fair value of the equity instruments issued to NETC shareholders considers the impact of Ordinary Shares issuable to Legacy Vast shareholders (i.e. AgCentral Energy Pty Ltd and certain employees of Vast), upon the occurrence of certain Triggering Events or earlier, upon a change of control in accordance with the earnout provisions. Refer to note 14 – Reserves for further details. The fair value of share consideration of $94.8 million and NETC’s net liabilities of $11.2 million result in an excess of the fair value of the shares issued over the value of the net monetary assets acquired of $106.0 million. The difference is reflected as a share based listing expense of $106.0 million for the services provided by NETC in connection with the listing. The fair value calculation of $94.8 million is based on the estimated fair value of Ordinary Shares issued to NETC shareholders in connection with the SPAC Merger, including an estimated fair value of the Earnout Shares for NETC of $22.6 million. These condensed financial statements for the half-year ended December 31, 2023 give effect to the SPAC Merger and related transactions summarized below: Ordinary Shares issued in exchange for the following (in thousands): NETC Class A Common Stock (b) 805Backstop Commitment Fee (f) 350NETC Class F Common Stock (b) 3,000Accelerated Earnback Shares (f) 1,500Ordinary Shares issued 5,655 Fair value of Vast shares issued in exchange for NETC shares valued at $11.99 per share$67,799Vast Warrants issued in exchange for NETC warrants (c) 4,129Shares issued as settlement of transaction expenses (e) 307Fair value of earnout for NETC Sponsor (g, h) 22,576Fair value of share consideration 94,811 Adjusted NETC’s net liabilities upon closing (a) 11,206Total 106,017 (a) the merger of NETC with and into Neptune Merger Sub Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Vast, with NETC surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vast.

CAG and Vast agreed that this commitment would be satisfied by CAG’s purchase of Class A common stock of NETC from existing NETC stockholders who previously elected to redeem their shares in connection with the SPAC Merger and whose redemption election would be reversed. The $7.0 million included in Cash has been reflected in Issued Capital of Vast upon consummation of the BCA; (e) the issuance of 171,569 Ordinary Shares to Guggenheim Securities as consideration for its services. A resulting loss of $0.3 million upon consummation of the BCA has been recorded within share based listing expenses; (f) the issuance of 1.5 million Ordinary Shares as Accelerated Earnback Shares pursuant to the Nabors Backstop Agreement and issuance of 350,000 Ordinary Shares as Incremental Funding Commitment Fee pursuant to the October Notes Subscription Agreement.(g) During the Earnout Period, Vast may issue up to an aggregate of 2.4 million additional Ordinary Shares to NETC Sponsor in three equal tranches and up to an aggregate of 1.3 million Ordinary Shares to Legacy Vast shareholders in three equal tranches, upon the occurrence of each Triggering Event. Refer to note 14 – Reserves for further details.(h) Additionally, Vast may also issue 1.5 million Ordinary Shares to Legacy Vast shareholders upon receiving a notice to proceed under a contract for the procurement of a concentrated solar power plant at Port Augusta, in South Australia. Refer to note 14 – Reserves for further information. Also included in the SPAC Merger, yet not forming part of the purchase consideration for the asset acquired are the following transactions: the entry into Equity Subscription Agreements and a Notes Subscription Agreement (including the October Notes Subscription Agreement) by Nabors Lux and AgCentral to purchase up to $15.0 million each ($30.0 million combined) of Ordinary Shares for $10.20 per share through the issuance of up to $5.0 million to AgCentral and $7.5 million to Nabors Lux ($12.5 million combined of Senior Convertible Notes from time to time beginning on the date of signing of the BCA and ending on the Closing date and $12.5 million to AgCentral and $10.0 million to Nabors Lux ($22.5 million combined) of committed subscriptions under the PIPE Financing funded on the Closing Date;the entry into the Nabors Backstop Agreement (as amended by the amendment to the Nabors Backstop Agreement dated December 7, 2023) by Nabors Lux to provide $10.0 million backstop to Vast to underwrite the potential investment by additional investors provided that the amount of the backstop be reduced dollar-for-dollar by (a) the balance of cash remaining in the Trust Account after giving effect to any redemptions of NETC Class A Common Stock by NETC public stockholders and (b) amounts invested by additional third parties (other than Nabors, AgCentral, CAG, EDF and their respective affiliates);the entry into the EDF Note Purchase Agreement to purchase a promissory note with an aggregate principal amount of EUR 10.0 million (equivalent to approximately $10.9 million on December 18, 2023); The following summarized the number of Ordinary Shares issued upon closing of the BCA: Shares outstanding upon closing of the BCA Ownership in shares% Legacy Vast shareholders20,499,99970.0%Other804,6162.7%NETC initial stockholders4,500,00015.4%Shares issued to Nabors Lux and AgCentral in connection with financing transactions3,315,70011.3%Shares issued as settlement of transaction expenses171,5690.6%Total shares issued upon closing29,291,884100.0% 20.

(“WISeKey” or “Company”) (SIX: WIHN, NASDAQ: WKEY), a global leader in cybersecurity, digital identity, and Internet of Things (IoT) innovations, operating as a holding company, today announced that it is significantly enhancing telecommunications security in the 5G era through its GSMA Root Certificate Issuer (“GSMA Root CI”) accreditation. This milestone marks a transformative advancement in telecom networks, accommodating billions of new devices and addressing the evolving threat landscape with unparalleled security measures.In an era where telecommunications networks form the critical infrastructure for digital transformation, the importance of robust security measures able to provide essential services across numerous sectors cannot be overstated. These networks, fundamental to trusted and secure communication, significantly influence societal operations. With the advent of quantum computing on the horizon, the telecommunication industry faces the dual challenge of leveraging the benefits of quantum technology for its immense potential while at the same time safeguarding against its potential misuse. Threats from malicious entities could compromise network integrity, putting customer data and devices at risk. In-depth analysis has been conducted to navigate both business risks and technological decisions, encompassing a wide range of scenarios such as physical and virtual SIM cards, device and firmware updates, authentication, transport security, cloud infrastructure, virtualized network functions, VPN services, IoT applications, lawful intercept, and privacy considerations. Adopting post-quantum cybersecurity standards is a complex and multi-year journey, necessitating industry-wide collaboration. Initiatives like the GSMA Post Quantum Telco Network task force are pivotal in this transition, underscoring the need for collective efforts to embrace future-ready security protocols. The emergence of 5G technology brings a transformative leap in telecom networks, introducing billions of new devices and significantly evolving the threat landscape. These networks are crucial for supporting critical applications across business, missions, and society. Consequently, they have become prime targets for threat actors seeking to exploit vulnerabilities. To counteract these emerging threats, the importance of safeguarding 5G networks has never been more pronounced. The increase in sensitive personal, business, and public service information stored in and shared between these networks due to ongoing digitization has led to expanded security and privacy regulations and a declining risk tolerance amidst a worsening cybersecurity environment. Regulators, recognizing the critical nature of 5G, are emphasizing the importance of data protection. On the other hand, the complexity of 5G's threat landscape is heightened by its integration with traditional IT systems, enabling IT threat actors to launch attacks on telecom networks similarly to their attacks on IT infrastructures. Moreover, the introduction of new functionalities like network slicing and the increased use of AI/ML for automation present both opportunities and challenges. While AI/ML promises enhanced security capabilities, it's essential to ensure their security and transparency. Additionally, edge computing introduces new security challenges by decentralizing cloud resources. In the context of WISeKey's Root of Trust for 5G, adapting these insights provides a strategic focus on enhancing cybersecurity measures through trusted technologies. WISeKey's approach, leveraging secure digital identity ecosystems and advanced cryptographic solutions, aligns with the need to protect 5G networks against the evolving threat landscape. By ensuring the integrity and security of devices and communications within 5G networks, WISeKey's Root of Trust serves as a foundational component in the broader strategy to mitigate risks and safeguard critical telecommunications infrastructure in the era of 5G.

ILCO's liquidity at the headquarters level was $878 million in financial liabilities and $975 million in liquid assets as of December 31, 2023. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results of Israel Corporation Ltd. reflect a notable decrease in net profit from continuing activities year-over-year, from $903 million in 2022 to $273 million in 2023. This significant drop might raise concerns among investors regarding the company's profitability and operational efficiency. The reduction in the company's share of ICL profit is a key factor in this decline.Additionally, the company's liquidity position appears stable with net cash totaling $70 million and investments in liquid assets outstripping financial liabilities. The initiation of a buyback program and the declaration of a dividend are signals that management is confident in the company's financial health and committed to delivering shareholder value. These actions often have the potential to positively influence the stock price by reflecting a bullish outlook from the company's board.However, it's important to monitor the company's future earnings and cash flow to ensure that these shareholder-friendly activities are sustainable in the long term, especially in light of the decreased profitability. Market Research Analyst Israel Corporation Ltd.'s strategic decisions, such as the share buyback program and the dividend distribution, are reflective of its capital allocation strategy and may influence investor sentiment. Share buybacks can be viewed as a method to increase earnings per share by reducing the number of shares outstanding, which can be attractive to investors looking for capital appreciation.The dividend payout aligns with the company's announced dividend policy and provides a direct return to shareholders. It could attract income-focused investors and support the stock price, especially if the company can maintain or grow its dividend over time. The market's response to these announcements will depend on broader market conditions and investor perception of the company's long-term growth prospects.Considering the company's assets, including significant holdings in ICL and AKVA Group, the portfolio diversification might provide a cushion against sector-specific risks. However, the reliance on investee results suggests that ILCO's financial performance is closely tied to the performance of these entities, which could be a double-edged sword depending on the investees' market conditions. 03/28/2024 - 02:59 AM TEL AVIV, Israel, March 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Israel Corporation Ltd.

Praxis granted underwriters an option for additional shares, with the closing expected soon. Positive Praxis raised $200 million through its public offering. The offering includes 3,318,585 shares of common stock and pre-funded warrants. Underwriters have an option to purchase additional shares. The offering is expected to close soon. Negative None. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the public offering by Praxis Precision Medicines represents a significant capital infusion, which is likely to bolster their research and development endeavors. The pricing of shares at $56.50 indicates investor confidence and a potentially strong market appetite for the company's stock. Pre-funded warrants are an interesting instrument, providing investors with a future equity stake at a slightly reduced cost, which could be appealing for those looking to invest large sums. The expected gross proceeds of $200 million, before expenses, suggest a robust funding round that could enhance the company's valuation and its ability to invest in long-term projects.However, such offerings can dilute existing shareholders' equity, potentially leading to a short-term dip in stock price as the market adjusts to the increased share count. The underwriters' option to purchase additional shares could further dilute current stockholders but also indicates a safeguard for additional capital if the market demand is high. The impact on the stock will need to be monitored closely following the closure of the offering. Market Research Analyst Examining the industry context, Praxis Precision Medicines is operating within the high-growth area of CNS disorder treatments, which is seeing increasing investment due to the unmet medical needs and the potential for breakthrough therapies. The capital raised could significantly accelerate Praxis' ability to compete in this space, particularly as they translate genetic insights into viable treatments. The success of this public offering could also reflect broader market trends, where investors are seeking to capitalize on innovative biotech firms with strong pipelines and clear strategies to address complex health issues.One must consider the competitive landscape and how this capital injection positions Praxis relative to its peers. With a successful infusion of funds, Praxis could advance its clinical trials more rapidly, potentially leading to faster FDA approvals and quicker time-to-market for its therapies. The long-term implications for stakeholders include not only the prospects of financial returns but also the potential societal impact of new CNS treatments. Biotech Industry Analyst Within the biotech sector, the balance of excitation and inhibition in neuronal activity is a critical area of research, directly linked to a range of CNS disorders such as epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. The capital raised by Praxis Precision Medicines through this public offering could be pivotal in advancing their proprietary therapies. Given the complexity and high costs associated with CNS drug development, the substantial amount of $200 million suggests that Praxis is well-positioned to navigate through the lengthy and rigorous clinical trial phases that are characteristic of the biotech industry.The strategic use of pre-funded warrants is noteworthy as it provides a mechanism for immediate capital increase while potentially offsetting some dilution effects. The funds are likely earmarked for clinical trials, which are the lifeblood of biotech firms' pipelines. The outcome of these trials will be critical in determining the future trajectory of the company and its ability to deliver on its promises to stakeholders and patients in need of novel therapies. 03/28/2024 - 12:20 AM BOSTON, March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Praxis Precision Medicines, Inc.

(TTWO) announces the acquisition of The Gearbox Entertainment Company for $460 million in newly issued shares. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of Take-Two's Fiscal Year 2025, expanding 2K's internal development team and acquiring Gearbox's popular franchises like Borderlands. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of Gearbox Entertainment by Take-Two Interactive represents a strategic consolidation within the interactive entertainment industry. Take-Two's move to integrate Gearbox's intellectual property portfolio, including the Borderlands and Tiny Tina's Wonderlands franchises, aligns with the industry trend of major players expanding their IP assets to bolster long-term growth. The deal, valued at $460 million, paid in Take-Two common stock, indicates confidence in the synergy between the two companies.From a market perspective, the transaction is likely to be accretive to Take-Two's earnings, given Gearbox's history of successful franchises. The investment community often looks favorably upon acquisitions that can enhance a company's creative capabilities and drive revenue growth through established and new IPs. The mention of six interactive entertainment projects, including five sequels and new IPs, suggests a robust pipeline that can potentially contribute to Take-Two's future revenue streams.However, the deal's success will largely depend on the seamless integration of Gearbox's operations and the effective management of the expanded IP portfolio. The market will be closely watching the execution of this strategy and its impact on Take-Two's financial performance in the subsequent quarters post-acquisition. Financial Analyst Take-Two's acquisition of Gearbox is an investment into their long-term operational structure and portfolio diversification. The all-stock nature of the deal suggests a strategic use of Take-Two's equity to finance the acquisition, which could be favorable for maintaining liquidity. The transaction's structure, with the share count based on a five-day trading average, is designed to mitigate immediate market volatility and provide a fair valuation.Investors will be interested in the deal's impact on Take-Two's balance sheet, particularly how the newly issued shares will affect earnings per share (EPS) and the company's overall market capitalization. The exclusion of certain non-core assets from the deal indicates a focused strategy on key revenue-generating IPs and may reassure investors about management's commitment to core business efficiency.Long-term benefits may include increased market share and revenue diversification, but it's important to monitor the integration costs and potential cultural clashes that can affect the anticipated financial benefits. The acquisition's timing, set for the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2025, allows investors to track progress and anticipate the strategic moves Take-Two will implement to leverage Gearbox's assets. Gaming Industry Analyst The interactive entertainment sector is highly competitive, with success often tied to the strength and appeal of a company's game franchises. Take-Two's acquisition of Gearbox signifies an aggressive move to secure proven IPs that resonate with gamers. Borderlands, in particular, is a franchise with a strong fan base and significant merchandising potential, which could lead to multiple revenue streams beyond game sales, such as merchandise and media adaptations.Moreover, the acquisition could provide Take-Two with a competitive edge in the first-person shooter (FPS) and role-playing game (RPG) genres, areas where Gearbox has demonstrated expertise. The integration of Gearbox's development teams could result in enhanced innovation and efficiency in game development processes. This is particularly relevant as the industry shifts towards next-generation gaming platforms that demand high-quality content with engaging narratives and cutting-edge graphics.It is important to note that the gaming industry is subject to trends and consumer preferences, which can shift rapidly. The success of the acquisition will depend not only on the continued popularity of Gearbox's existing franchises but also on the reception of new IPs and sequels currently in development. The ability of Take-Two to maintain Gearbox's creative culture while extracting operational synergies will be critical to realizing the full potential of this acquisition. 03/27/2024 - 11:40 PM Transaction valued at $460 million; expected to close in the first quarter of Take-Two’s Fiscal Year 2025 Expands 2K’s internal development team with proven industry-leading talent Gearbox and 2K in active development on next installment in Borderlands series NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.

Stoke Therapeutics Announces Pricing of Upsized $125 Million Public Offering,2024-03-28T03:40:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Stoke Therapeutics, Inc. announces the pricing of an upsized public offering, aiming to raise $125 million through the sale of common stock and pre-funded warrants.","Stoke Therapeutics Announces Pricing of Upsized $125 Million Public Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Stoke Therapeutics, Inc. announces the pricing of an upsized public offering, aiming to raise $125 million through the sale of common stock and pre-funded warrants. Positive Stoke Therapeutics, Inc. is conducting an upsized underwritten public offering of 5,555,557 shares of common stock. The offering includes pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 3,703,730 shares of common stock. The price per share for common stock is set at $13.50, while the price for pre-funded warrants is $13.4999. The gross proceeds from the offering are expected to reach $125 million. The offering is subject to underwriting discounts, commissions, and other expenses payable by Stoke. The closing of the offering is anticipated to occur soon. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent announcement by Stoke Therapeutics regarding their upsized underwritten public offering is a significant event for the company and its investors. The decision to increase the number of shares offered, along with the introduction of pre-funded warrants, suggests a strong demand for the company's stock, which can be viewed as a positive signal for investor confidence. The pricing of shares at $13.50 and warrants at a nearly identical price indicates a strategic approach to fundraising without significantly diluting current shareholder value.With the expected gross proceeds of $125 million, Stoke Therapeutics is likely to bolster its cash reserves, which is essential for the continuation of its research and development activities. The capital raised could accelerate the progress of their RNA-based medicines, which target severe diseases by upregulating protein expression. This is particularly relevant as the biotech sector is capital-intensive, with long development cycles and high regulatory hurdles. Investors will be keenly observing how efficiently Stoke allocates this capital towards advancing its clinical trials and whether it can maintain a favorable cash burn rate. Biotechnology Market Analyst Stoke Therapeutics is operating within the high-growth field of RNA-based therapeutics, which has become increasingly attractive to investors, especially following the success of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. This public offering reflects the company's intent to capitalize on the market's interest in genetic medicines. The use of pre-funded warrants is a notable strategy, as it provides a mechanism for investors to commit capital immediately while retaining the option to convert these warrants into common stock at a later date.The biotech industry is marked by its high volatility and risk, especially for companies like Stoke that are in the development phase without marketed products. The influx of $125 million in capital can be a significant buffer against this volatility, allowing the company to navigate the costly process of drug development with more financial stability. Stakeholders should monitor how this capital infusion affects the company's runway and its ability to reach key milestones, such as clinical trial results or potential partnerships, which can have a material impact on the stock's performance. 03/27/2024 - 11:40 PM BEDFORD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Stoke Therapeutics, Inc.

The gross proceeds from this offering are expected to be $125 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by Stoke.

About Stoke Therapeutics Stoke Therapeutics (Nasdaq: STOK), is a biotechnology company dedicated to addressing the underlying cause of severe diseases by upregulating protein expression with RNA-based medicines. Using Stoke’s proprietary TANGO (Targeted Augmentation of Nuclear Gene Output) approach, Stoke is developing antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to selectively restore protein levels. Stoke’s first compound, STK-001, is in clinical testing for the treatment of Dravet syndrome, a severe and progressive genetic epilepsy. Dravet syndrome is one of many diseases caused by a haploinsufficiency, in which a loss of ~50% of normal protein levels leads to disease. Stoke is pursuing the development of STK-002 for the treatment of autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA), the most common inherited optic nerve disorder. Stoke’s initial focus is haploinsufficiencies and diseases of the central nervous system and the eye, although proof of concept has been demonstrated in other organs, tissues, and systems, supporting its belief in the broad potential for its proprietary approach.

Management is in negotiations to refinance expected in the second half of 2024. 2023 and Subsequent Sales & Operational Highlights: Rubicon Organics has established high-quality partnerships for contract grow and co-manufacturing to complement our own premium production and to satisfy the increasing demand for our brands.The Company launched its first entry into the edibles category, through a co-manufacturing relationship, with 1964 Supply Co™ live rosin edibles in Ontario, BC and Alberta. These edibles were the first single-strain live rosin edibles in Canada and are vegan and gluten-free. Following up on the success of the initial two flavour launch in the second quarter, 1964 Supply Co™ has since rolled out five additional flavours.Wildflower™ launched its first edibles in October 2023. These edible products consist of four flavours and contain the minor cannabinoids CBN, CBG and CBD as well as full spectrum THC live rosin, and are vegan and gluten-free.Simply Bare™ Organic launched infused pre-rolls under the Simply Bare™ Organic brand, including the “Layer J” in BC and Ontario in October 2023. It contains two layers, one with flower and hash of one cultivar, and the other with flower and hash rosin of another cultivar. The two cultivars are BC Organic Cleopatra and BC Organic White Rainbow.Simply Bare™ Organic launched a new 2-gram hash, “New School Hash” available in BC, Ontario, Alberta and Quebec.With the continuing growth of the infused pre-roll category, 1964 Supply Co™ launched the 1 x 1-gram Comatose rosin roll that features a mix of flavourful Comatose flower and potent Comatose hash rosin. Comatose was the 1964 Supply Co™ “hero strain” and was voted indica of the year by Kind Magazine in December 2022.In September 2023, the Company’s brand 1964 Supply Co™ launched an infused pre-roll, the Super Lemon Haze “Heavy Hitter” rosin roll which is a 1 x 1 gram infused pre-rolls featuring Super Lemon Haze flower, and potent Super Lemon Haze hash rosin.Wildflower™ is leveraging its leading market share by launching new products to address consumer needs in the wellness space. The new products launched consist of Wildflower™ Extra Strength Relief Stick and Wildflower™ 1:1 CBD:THC Relief Stick.Brightfield released its own survey of Canadian Budtenders and in those results, Simply Bare™ Organic and 1964 Supply Co™ were identified as two of the top three most recommended brands by Canadian budtenders8.1964 Supply Co™ was voted as the #1 brand sampled at the KIND Summer Fair by budtenders. Of the budtenders surveyed, 96% are more likely to recommend a brand they sampled at the KIND Summer Fair.The Company added 5 new independent directors to its Board of Directors following its Annual General Meeting.The Company appointed Margaret Brodie as permanent Chief Executive Officer and Janis Risbin as Chief Financial Officer. 2024 Outlook Brand and Product Development Our strategy is founded on a strong premium branded portfolio, highly regarded by both budtenders and consumers alike. Guided by consumer research, we continually innovate our products to anticipate market trends. Our commitment to quality and excellence is evident throughout all areas of our business, seeking to deliver products and services that consistently meet the highest quality standards. Launch into Vape Category Rubicon is launching into the vape category with our 1964 Supply Co™ brand. The introduction of vapes strategically aligns with our market expansion strategy and offers substantial growth prospects. The vape market has demonstrated robust growth over recent years and trends in Canada and the US demonstrate indicating the vape category's increasing prominence, rivaling or surpassing traditional flower products. Our launch into the vape category takes advantage of additional biomass available from our contract grow strategy launched in 2023 of our own genetics grown outside of the Delta Facility. We have successfully listed our leading Comatose and Blue Dream Full Spectrum Extract (“FSE”) resin vapes in Ontario and the product is expected to be first available in May seeking to launch in other provinces soon after. In line with our approach to the live rosin edibles we launched under the brand in 2023, we are focused on delivering products that maintain a competitive edge through superior quality, right price to value ratio leveraging our established and reputable brands. We are confident that by capitalizing on this opportunity, over time we can achieve comparable financial success with our vape offerings as we have with our flower business. Wildflower™’s Leadership in Cannabis Wellness Wildflower™'s prominence in the cannabis wellness sector is characterized by its notable dominance in topical products and the Company has recently expanded the brand to other categories, including edibles and capsules designed to address specific wellness needs such as sleep, pain relief, and anxiety reduction. While we expect more competition to enter the topical and wellness category, we are expanding the brand into other categories and anticipate steady growth and momentum behind the daily wellness consumer. Launch of New Genetics Rubicon plans to continue to launch new and novel genetics into its Simply Bare™ Organic and 1964 Supply Co™ to continue leadership in the premium cannabis market. Planned launches in 2024 include BC Organic Zookies, BC Organic Power Mintz, and BC Organic Fruit Loopz under the Simply Bare™ Organic brand, and Blue Dream under the 1964 Supply Co™ brand. Growth from Solid Business Fundamentals Consistent quality and systematic delivery to our customers, including the provincial distributors and retailers, and consumers to meet their needs is imperative to be successful in the Canadian cannabis industry. In 2024 we are investing in an Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system which is necessary for our business to deliver more growth in future and allow less reliance on key people within our internal systems. Predominantly in the first half of 2024 we will incur additional costs associated with this project, and while a resource intensive process, this ERP implementation readies our business for growth in future. Financial We believe that our commitment to cannabis quality, strategic brand positioning, diverse product portfolio, and committed team will position us as one of the premier cannabis companies in Canada. We anticipate year over year growth in net revenue, supported by modest increases in our cost base, excluding the impact of the ERP implementation occurring mostly in the first half, thereby enhancing our operating leverage. While we expect growth in 2024, we also anticipate that much of the growth will come from our branded products that are produced using external capacity and thereby deliver lower gross margin than our current mix. Furthermore, we expect continued fierce competition in the distressed Canadian cannabis industry with price compression across all categories. Notwithstanding these pressures, we expect to deliver continued operating positive cash flow in the year ahead and plan to refinance our debt to a longer-term mortgage facility midway through the year.

Positive None. Negative None. 03/27/2024 - 10:01 PM 36% of Indonesians are concerned about fraudsters using their identity to open a financial account JAKARTA, Indonesia--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- (NYSE: FICO) Highlights Identity theft worries persist, with 36% of Indonesians fearing fraudsters opening accounts A noticeable gap exists, as almost 45% believe it unlikely they've been identity theft victims Real-time payment scams are on the rise, with 64% receiving scam communications Fraud protection is paramount, with ease of use and good fraud protection ranking as top considerations for selecting financial services providers FICO, a leading global analytics software firm, today unveiled its latest global consumer fraud research, spotlighting the enduring concern of Indonesians over identity theft amidst the escalating risks posed by real-time payments. The study reveals that identity theft (36%) remains the predominant worry among Indonesians, exposing individuals to various risks, including financial loss, compromised credit scores, and the arduous process of restoring financial integrity. In contrast, concern over authorized push payment scams is notably less pronounced in Indonesia compared to other ASEAN countries and India. According to the research, only 28% of Indonesian respondents expressed worry about authorized push payment scams, significantly lower than the Asia average of 33%. More information: https://www.fico.com/en/latest-thinking/ebook/consumer-survey-2023-digital-banking-customer-preferences-and-fraud-controls “This disparity can be attributed to Indonesia's recent introduction of real-time payment mechanisms in January 2022, limiting the exposure of Indonesian consumers to such scams, unlike their counterparts in other regions where real-time payments are more established,” said C K Leo, FICO's lead for fraud, security and financial crime in Asia Pacific. “However, as real-time payment adoption grows rapidly, there is a growing risk of authorized push payment fraud, underscoring the importance for financial institutions to implement robust fraud detection and prevention measures swiftly.” Perception vs. Reality Despite widespread concern about identity theft, there is a noticeable dissonance between perception and reality among Indonesians. About 45% believe it unlikely they've been a victim, while 21% see it as possible, and 16% are confident their identity remains untouched. Moreover, only 3% of Indonesian respondents reported their stolen identity being used to open a financial account, a decline from nearly 10% in 2022. However, given Indonesia's adult population, this 3% translates to over 6 million individuals. Interestingly, this rate was much higher in other countries surveyed, with 13% of Indians and 12% of Thais saying their identity had been stolen and used to open an account by a fraudster “While some may downplay the risk of identity theft in Indonesia, millions remain vulnerable,” added Leo. “This underscores the need for heightened awareness and proactive measures. By breaking down silos and integrating identity verification and fraud detection processes, we can streamline applications and bolster trust in legitimate customers.” Real-Time Payment Scams: A Growing Concern As the incidence of scams continues to rise, FICO’s research from last year uncovered a troubling trend concerning authorized push payment (APP) fraud and real-time payments in Indonesia. 64% of Indonesians have received unsolicited text messages, emails, phone calls, or other outreach that they believed to be part of a scam, while 49% of respondents stated that their friends or family members had been victims of a scam. Shockingly, 17% of respondents admitted to sending real-time payments for investments, goods, or services they never received. Additionally, 71% of those who made scam payments through real-time payments lost up to 5 million rupiah, while 4% experienced losses of up to 100 million rupiah. Despite these alarming figures, only 19% reported actual or suspected losses to their banks. ""Banks now face a crucial moment to invest in cutting-edge solutions to tackle the surge in scams, particularly with the swift uptake of real-time payments in the Asia-Pacific financial landscape,” said Leo. “The irrevocable nature of these transactions has led to new criminal threats. By integrating scam-specific analysis and scoring into transactions, along with robust decision-making capabilities across the customer journey, banks can preemptively detect and thwart scam payments, sparing customers from financial harm. Furthermore, while some consumers may ignore warnings, the majority will heed alerts and refrain from making real-time payments if alerted to potential scams."" Indonesians Prioritise Good Fraud Protection When asked about the most important considerations respondents have when they select a new provider for a financial account, ease of use and good fraud protection were the two most important. These were both considered significantly more important than good customer service, strong anti-money laundering policies, sound green/environmental policies, ethical use of customer data, behaving fairly, and good value for money. Even in Indonesia, where good fraud protection was less likely to be people’s number one concern, 63% of people had ranked it as a top three consideration. The survey was conducted in November 2023 by an independent research company adhering to research industry standards. 1,000 Indonesian adults were surveyed, along with approximately 12,000 other consumers in Canada, U.S, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, India, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, U.K. and Spain.

Net working capital decreased to $54.5 million at the end of 2023 from $88.4 million in 2022. The net loss in 2023 was mainly due to a non-cash $29.7 million loss associated with the remeasurement of Secured Note liabilities. Seabridge holds a 100% interest in multiple North American gold projects, including the KSM project in British Columbia. For detailed mineral reserves and resources breakdown, visit Seabridge's website at http://www.seabridgegold.com. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results released by Seabridge Gold indicate a significant net loss increase from $7.4 million to $29.3 million year-over-year. This sharp rise in losses can be attributed to a non-cash loss related to the remeasurement of Secured Note liabilities. Such a financial event is important for investors as it reflects both the company's current financial health and its risk management strategies. The increase in investment in mineral interests, from $55.1 million to $69.7 million, suggests an aggressive growth strategy, which could either lead to future revenue growth or further financial strain depending on the company's ability to capitalize on these investments.Moreover, the decline in net working capital from $88.4 million to $54.5 million is a critical indicator of the company's short-term financial stability and liquidity. This decrease may raise concerns about the company's ability to fund ongoing operations and meet its short-term obligations without resorting to additional financing or asset sales. Stakeholders should monitor how these financial metrics evolve in the context of market conditions and the company's operational performance. Market Research Analyst The mining sector, particularly gold mining, is subject to volatile commodity prices and market interest rates. Seabridge Gold's reported non-cash loss due to the remeasurement of Secured Note liabilities underscores the impact of these external factors on mining companies' financials. The fair value adjustments based on market interest rates and metal prices, while unrealized, can significantly affect the perceived value and stability of a company.Investors often look at the underlying assets and growth prospects of mining companies. Seabridge's holdings in the 'Golden Triangle' and other North American projects are noteworthy, as these regions are recognized for their rich mineral deposits. However, the company's ability to navigate the complexities of mining operations, including regulatory compliance, environmental concerns and indigenous rights, is equally important for long-term success. As Seabridge continues to invest heavily in its mineral interests, the actualization of these assets into profitable operations will be a key factor in assessing the company's future market position. Mining Industry Analyst When analyzing Seabridge Gold's financial results, it's important to consider the industry-specific context of the non-cash loss related to the remeasurement of Secured Note liabilities. In the mining industry, these instruments are often used to finance exploration and development activities. The fact that these liabilities are structured to convert into royalties could indicate a strategic approach to finance that aligns with the long-term production goals of the company's key projects.The 'Golden Triangle' in British Columbia, where Seabridge's principal assets are located, is known for its significant mineral endowment. The company's focus on expanding and developing its mineral reserves is indicative of a long-term strategy aimed at establishing substantial production capacity. However, the extended timelines and capital-intensive nature of bringing mining projects to commercial production mean that Seabridge's investments must be carefully monitored for project advancement and potential cost overruns. 03/27/2024 - 10:02 PM Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - March 27, 2024) - Seabridge Gold (TSX: SEA) (NYSE: SA) announced today that it has filed its Annual Information Form, Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis for the year ended December 31, 2023 on SEDAR (www.sedarplus.ca).

The once-daily oral HIF-PH inhibitor activates the physiologic response to manage anemia, aiming to become a new standard of care. The approval is based on efficacy data from the INNO2VATE program and post-marketing safety data from Japan. Positive None. Negative None. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The FDA approval of Akebia Therapeutics' Vafseo marks a significant milestone for the company and is likely to have a notable impact on its business trajectory. The approval unlocks a sizable market opportunity in the U.S., where approximately half a million dialysis patients suffer from anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This patient population represents a substantial commercial target for Akebia, especially considering the current standard of care involves less convenient injectable erythropoiesis-stimulating agents.From a market perspective, the introduction of a once-daily oral treatment could disrupt the prevailing treatment paradigm, offering a differentiated value proposition that may enhance patient adherence and quality of life. The strategic partnership with CSL Vifor could also amplify Akebia's market penetration efforts, leveraging CSL Vifor's established presence in the dialysis segment. The potential shift towards an oral standard of care is poised to drive demand, which could be reflected in Akebia's revenue growth and stock performance in the medium to long term. Healthcare Industry Economist Examining the economic implications, the approval of Vafseo could potentially reduce the overall healthcare costs associated with anemia in CKD patients. Injectable treatments require administration in a clinical setting, which adds to healthcare resource utilization and costs. An oral alternative could decrease the frequency of clinic visits, thus reducing the burden on healthcare systems and potentially improving cost-effectiveness.However, it is important to consider the pricing strategy that Akebia will adopt for Vafseo. A premium pricing model might offset the cost savings from reduced clinic visits, which could influence payer coverage decisions and patient access. Additionally, the BOXED WARNING associated with Vafseo regarding increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events may necessitate careful monitoring and could influence physician prescribing patterns, potentially affecting uptake rates. Clinical Research Analyst The clinical data supporting Vafseo's approval, derived from the INNO2VATE program and post-marketing data from Japan, provide a solid foundation for its efficacy and safety profile. However, the presence of a BOXED WARNING signals a need for vigilance in monitoring patients for cardiovascular events.Long-term post-marketing surveillance and real-world data collection will be essential to assess the full impact of Vafseo on patient outcomes. It is also critical to note that while the efficacy data are promising, adoption rates will depend on how well the treatment is received by the nephrology community, patients and payers. The clinical community's endorsement, as reflected in updated treatment guidelines and recommendations, will be a key determinant of Vafseo's market success. 03/27/2024 - 08:26 PM Once-Daily Oral HIF-PH Inhibitor Activates Physiologic Response to Manage Anemia Akebia's Launch Strategy Developed to Drive Toward a Potential New Oral Standard of Care Company to Host Conference Call on Thursday, March 28 at 8:00 AM ET CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Akebia Therapeutics®, Inc. (Nasdaq: AKBA), a biopharmaceutical company with the purpose to better the lives of people impacted by kidney disease, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Vafseo® (vadadustat) Tablets for the treatment of anemia due to chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults who have been receiving dialysis for at least three months. Vafseo is a once-daily oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase (HIF-PH) inhibitor that activates the physiologic response to hypoxia to stimulate endogenous production of erythropoietin to manage anemia. Vafseo is now approved in 37 countries. ""With the approval of Vafseo in the U.S., we're proud to deliver an alternative treatment option for the hundreds of thousands of Americans on dialysis who are diagnosed with anemia due to CKD,"" said John P. Butler, Chief Executive Officer of Akebia. ""At Akebia we are committed to kidney patients, a dedication that has driven our team to achieve this milestone. We believe this commitment uniquely positions the company to execute a successful launch designed to drive toward a potential new oral standard of care for dialysis patients."" The approval of Vafseo for the treatment of anemia due to CKD in adults who have been receiving dialysis for at least three months is based on efficacy and safety data from the INNO2VATE program and an assessment of post marketing safety data from Japan where VAFSEO was launched in August 2020. Results from the INNO2VATE program were published in the New England Journal of Medicine: (N Engl J Med 2021; 384:1601-1612); (N Engl J Med 2021; 384:1589-1600). See the Important Safety Information section below, including BOXED WARNING regarding increased risk of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, venous thromboembolism and thrombosis of vascular access. Approximately 500,000 adult patients in the U.S. on dialysis suffer from anemia due to CKD1, which may be associated with many adverse clinical outcomes. The burden of managing uncontrolled anemia in CKD patients can be substantial, both in terms of healthcare costs and the impact on patients, healthcare providers and caregivers. Today, most CKD patients are treated for anemia with injectable erythropoiesis-stimulating agents mostly administered at dialysis centers. ""Patients receiving maintenance dialysis would benefit from additional therapeutic options that can effectively increase and maintain hemoglobin concentrations within guideline-recommended target ranges,"" said Glenn M. Chertow, M.D., M.P.H., Professor of Medicine, Division of Nephrology at Stanford University and Co-Chair of the independent Executive Steering Committee for PRO2TECT and INNO2VATE, the global Phase 3 clinical development programs for Vafseo. Lori Hartwell, who has had kidney disease since she was a young child, is the Founder and President of the Renal Support Network. She expressed her support of this new therapy for adults with anemia due to chronic kidney disease on dialysis by stating, ""Anemia is a debilitating condition that significantly impacts our daily lives. It is promising to see the introduction of innovative treatment options for people fighting anemia."" Akebia intends to commercialize Vafseo in the U.S. with its established commercial team that has deep renal experience and by leveraging its relationship with CSL Vifor, an industry leader in bringing innovative therapies to U.S. dialysis organizations. In line with the approved label, Akebia will execute a launch strategy to drive Vafseo toward the goal of becoming a new oral standard of care for adult dialysis patients. Mr. Butler added, ""We are tremendously grateful for the patients, physicians, investigators, and site coordinators who participated in our clinical trials that led to this important approval. This milestone is the culmination of years of perseverance by Akebia employees and partners committed to bettering the lives of people impacted by kidney disease.""

About Anemia due to Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Anemia is a condition in which a person lacks enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to the body's tissues. It commonly occurs in people with CKD because their kidneys do not produce enough erythropoietin, a hormone that helps regulate production of red blood cells. Anemia due to CKD can have a profound impact on a person's quality of life2 as it can cause fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath and cognitive dysfunction. Left untreated, anemia leads to deterioration in health and is associated with increased mortality3 in people with CKD. About Vafseo® (vadadustat) Tablets Vafseo® (vadadustat) tablets is a once-daily oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor that activates the physiologic response to hypoxia to stimulate endogenous production of erythropoietin, increasing hemoglobin and red blood cell production to manage anemia. Vafseo is approved for use in 37 countries. INDICATION VAFSEO is indicated for the treatment of anemia due to chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults who have been receiving dialysis for at least three months. Limitations of Use VAFSEO has not been shown to improve quality of life, fatigue, or patient well-being.VAFSEO is not indicated for use:As a substitute for red blood cell transfusions in patients who require immediate correction of anemia.In patients with anemia due to CKD not on dialysis.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION about VAFSEO (vadadustat) tablets WARNING: INCREASED RISK OF DEATH, MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, STROKE, VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM, and THROMBOSIS OF VASCULAR ACCESS. See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. VAFSEO increases the risk of thrombotic vascular events, including major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Targeting a hemoglobin level greater than 11 g/dL is expected to further increase the risk of death and arterial and venous thrombotic events, as occurs with erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESAs), which also increase erythropoietin levels. No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, dose of VAFSEO, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks. Use the lowest dose of VAFSEO sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions. CONTRAINDICATIONS Known hypersensitivity to VAFSEO or any of its componentsUncontrolled hypertensionWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Increased Risk of Death, Myocardial Infarction, Stroke, Venous Thromboembolism, and Thrombosis of Vascular AccessA rise in hemoglobin (Hb) levels greater than 1 g/dL over 2 weeks can increase these risks. Avoid use in patients with a history of myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular event, or acute coronary syndrome within the 3 month prior to starting VAFSEO. Targeting a Hb level of greater than 11g/dL is expected to further increase the risk of death and arterial and venous thrombotic events, as occurs with ESAs, which also increase erythropoietin levels. No specific Hb target level, dose of VASFEO, or dosing strategy has been identified to avoid these risks. Use the lowest effective dose and adhere to dosing and Hb monitoring recommendations to avoid excessive erythropoiesis.Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs or symptoms of myocardial infarction, stroke, venous thromboembolism, or thrombosis of vascular access. Evaluate and manage promptly if these occur.HepatotoxicityHepatocellular injury attributed to VAFSEO was reported in less than 1% of patients, including one severe case with jaundice. All events were asymptomatic and resolved after discontinuation of VAFSEO. The time to onset was generally within the first 3 months of treatment. Elevated serum ALT, AST, and bilirubin levels were observed in 1.8%, 1.8%, and 0.3% of CKD patients treated with VAFSEO, respectively. Measure ALT, AST, and bilirubin before treatment and monthly for the first 6 months, then as clinically indicated. Discontinue VAFSEO if ALT or AST is persistently elevated or accompanied by elevated bilirubin. Not recommended in patients with cirrhosis or active, acute liver disease.HypertensionWorsening of hypertension was reported in 14% (9.4 per 100 person-years [PY]) of patients receiving VAFSEO and 17% (11.8 per 100 PY) of patients receiving darbepoetin alfa. Serious worsening of hypertension was reported in 2.7% (1.7 per 100 PY) of patients receiving VAFSEO and 3% (1.8 per 100 PY) of patients receiving darbepoetin alfa. Cases of hypertensive crisis including hypertensive encephalopathy and seizures have also been reported in patients receiving VAFSEO. Monitor blood pressure. Adjust anti-hypertensive therapy as needed.Seizures Seizures occurred in 1.6% (1.0 per 100 PY) of patients who received VAFSEO and 1.6% (1.0 per 100 PY) of patients who received darbepoetin alfa. Following initiation of VAFSEO, monitor patients closely for premonitory neurologic symptoms. Monitor for new-onset seizures, premonitory symptoms, or change in seizure frequency.Gastrointestinal Erosion Gastric or esophageal erosions occurred in 6.4% (4.0 per 100 PY) of patients receiving VAFSEO and 5.3% (3.3 per 100 PY) of darbepoetin alfa-treated patients. Serious gastrointestinal (GI) erosions, including GI bleeding and the need for red blood cell transfusions were reported in 3.4% (2.1 per 100 PY) and 3.3% (2.0 per 100 PY) of those receiving VAFSEO and darbepoetin alfa, respectively. Consider the risk of GI erosion in high-risk patients, including those with a history of GI erosion, peptic ulcer disease, and tobacco or alcohol use.Advise patients of the signs and symptoms of erosions and GI bleeding and urge them to seek prompt medical care if present.Serious Adverse Reactions in Patients with Anemia Due to Chronic Kidney Disease and Not on Dialysis The safety of VAFSEO has not been established for the treatment of anemia due to CKD in adults not on dialysis and its use is not recommended in this setting. In large clinical trials in adults with anemia of CKD who were not on dialysis, an increased risk of mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, serious acute kidney injury, serious hepatic injury, and serious GI erosions was observed in patients treated with VAFSEO compared to darbepoetin alfa.MalignancyVAFSEO has not been studied and is not recommended in patients with active malignancies. Malignancies were observed in 2.2% (1.3 per 100 PY) of patients treated with VAFSEO and 3.0% (1.8 per 100 PY) of patients treated with darbepoetin alfa. No evidence of increased carcinogenicity was observed in animal studies.ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (occurring at ≥ 10%) were hypertension and diarrhea.DRUG INTERACTIONS Iron supplements and iron-containing phosphate binders: Administer VAFSEO at least 1 hour before products containing iron.Non-iron-containing phosphate binders: Administer VAFSEO at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after non-iron-containing phosphate binders.BCRP substrates: Monitor for signs of substrate adverse reactions and consider dose reduction.Statins: Monitor for statin-related adverse reactions. Limit the daily dose of simvastatin (20 mg) and rosuvastatin (5 mg).USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: May cause fetal harm.Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended until two days after the final dose.Hepatic Impairment: Not recommended for use in patients with cirrhosis or active, acute liver disease.Please note that this information is not comprehensive.

The move aims to make Fisker EVs more affordable and competitive in the market, with additional options included in the discounted prices. The reductions will be effective from March 29, 2024, as Fisker focuses on sustainability and dealer partnerships. Positive None. Negative None. Automotive Industry Analyst The recent price reduction announced by Fisker Inc. for its 2023 Ocean models represents a significant strategic move within the electric vehicle (EV) market. This aggressive pricing strategy could potentially disrupt the current EV pricing landscape, as the Ocean Extreme's new price point undercuts many of its competitors in the mid-size SUV segment. The reduction not only makes the Ocean models more accessible to a broader consumer base but also reflects Fisker's commitment to sustainability, which could strengthen the brand's image and appeal.From an industry perspective, Fisker's decision to lower prices could trigger a competitive response from other EV manufacturers, potentially leading to a price war. This could result in increased market penetration for electric SUVs but may also squeeze profit margins across the industry. Investors should monitor how competitors react and whether this move will lead to increased market share and revenue growth for Fisker, or if it will put pressure on the company's financials in the short term. Sustainability Expert Fisker's emphasis on the sustainability of the Ocean Extreme, from its carbon-neutral production facility to the integration of recycled materials and solar panels, aligns with growing consumer and investor interest in environmentally responsible products. The company's claim of the lowest published carbon footprint for an electric SUV could strengthen its position in a market where sustainability is increasingly becoming a differentiator. However, it is essential to scrutinize the lifecycle analysis (LCA) data and the real-world impact of solar panels to validate these sustainability claims.For stakeholders, the long-term benefits of Fisker's approach may include brand loyalty and resilience against potential regulatory changes favoring sustainable practices. Yet, the financial viability of offering high-value features at reduced prices should be evaluated, as it may affect the company's ability to invest in future sustainability initiatives. Financial Analyst The substantial MSRP reductions announced by Fisker represent a bold move aimed at capturing a larger share of the EV market. While this could stimulate demand and potentially increase sales volume, it's important to consider the impact on the company's revenue and margins. The inclusion of $7,000 worth of additional options in the discounted price suggests a significant value proposition to consumers, but it also indicates that Fisker is willing to absorb a considerable cost to gain market traction.Investors should examine Fisker's cost structure and production efficiency to assess whether the company can sustain these lower price points without compromising profitability. Additionally, the impact of this pricing strategy on Fisker's cash flow and capital requirements should be a focal point for financial analysis, especially as the company continues to expand its dealer partnerships and invest in software updates and customer support. 03/27/2024 - 07:32 PM Fisker reduces US MSRP on the 2023 Ocean Extreme trim from $61,499 to $37,499.1 2023 Fisker Ocean Ultra trims reduced from $52,999 to $34,999 MSRP, and 2023 Sport trims from $38,999 to $24,999 MSRP.1 Fisker is strategically positioning Ocean to be a more affordable and compelling EV choice, competitively available to EV buyers.

Erasca Announces $45 Million Oversubscribed Private Placement Financing,2024-03-28T00:30:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Erasca, Inc. secures funding of $45 million through a private placement to extend cash runway until H2 2026, boosting its focus on precision oncology therapies for RAS/MAPK pathway-driven cancers.","Erasca Announces $45 Million Oversubscribed Private Placement Financing Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Erasca, Inc. secures funding of $45 million through a private placement to extend cash runway until H2 2026, boosting its focus on precision oncology therapies for RAS/MAPK pathway-driven cancers. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent private placement by Erasca, Inc. indicates a strategic move to secure long-term funding, which is a positive signal for investors looking for stability in the biotech sector. The procurement of approximately $45 million in capital, before expenses, at $2.06 per share, is a testament to investor confidence in Erasca's potential to capitalize on its niche in precision oncology. The involvement of institutional accredited investors suggests a level of due diligence and belief in the company's pipeline and management.From a financial perspective, extending the cash runway into the second half of 2026 provides Erasca with a cushion to advance its clinical trials without the immediate pressure of fundraising. This could lead to a more focused research and development effort on RAS/MAPK pathway-driven cancers, which are notoriously difficult to treat. The stock price at which the shares have been sold will be of interest to shareholders, as it reflects current market valuation and future growth expectations. Market Research Analyst The oversubscribed nature of the private placement highlights a robust demand for Erasca's shares, which might be indicative of the market's appetite for innovative oncology treatments. Given that the RAS/MAPK pathway is implicated in a significant portion of human cancers, advancements in this area could have substantial market implications. The capital raised could enable Erasca to accelerate its pipeline, potentially shortening the time to market for its therapies.It is also important to consider the broader market trends in precision oncology. As more companies enter this space, competition intensifies and investors will be watching closely how Erasca differentiates itself. The ability to maintain a competitive edge through unique intellectual property or superior clinical trial results could significantly influence Erasca's market share and stock performance in the long run. Biotech Industry Analyst The capital infusion for Erasca comes at a critical juncture in the biotech industry, where cash flow is king. Erasca's focus on the RAS/MAPK pathway—a central node in cell signaling that drives many cancers—positions it in a high-potential niche of the oncology market. The extension of the cash runway is a key factor in enabling sustained research efforts and may help in avoiding dilutive financing rounds in the near future, which can be reassuring for current shareholders concerned about share value erosion.However, the success of this strategy hinges on the company's ability to effectively utilize the funds to achieve clinical milestones. Investors should monitor the progress of Erasca's pipeline, specifically the advancement of its lead candidates through clinical trials, as these are critical value inflection points that could significantly impact the company's valuation and investor sentiment. 03/27/2024 - 08:30 PM Funding from new and existing investors extends anticipated cash runway into H2 2026SAN DIEGO, March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Erasca, Inc. (Nasdaq: ERAS) (“Erasca”), a clinical-stage precision oncology company singularly focused on discovering, developing, and commercializing therapies for patients with RAS/MAPK pathway-driven cancers, today announced that it has entered into a securities purchase agreement with a select group of institutional accredited investors to sell 21,844,660 shares of its common stock in an oversubscribed private placement at a price of $2.06 per share. Erasca anticipates the gross proceeds from the private placement will be approximately $45 million, before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses. The private placement is expected to close on or about April 2, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. The private placement was led by a high quality group of new and existing healthcare focused investors. BofA Securities is acting as sole placement agent to Erasca in connection with the private placement. “Erasca continues to make strong progress across our pipeline of potential first-in-class and best-in-class programs, highlighted by investor enthusiasm for our recent pooled analysis of data from the Phase 1b and Phase 2 trials for naporafenib plus trametinib demonstrating 13 to 14 months of median overall survival in patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma treated post-immunotherapy,” said Jonathan E. Lim, M.D., Erasca’s chairman, CEO, and co-founder. “This financing allows us to bring in additional high quality healthcare focused investors and extend runway from the first half of 2026 to the second half of 2026, setting us up nicely to provide a number of key clinical data readouts in 2024 and beyond.” Erasca intends to use the net proceeds from the proposed financing to fund the research and development of its product candidates and other development programs and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The proceeds from this financing, combined with Erasca’s existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, are expected to fund its current operations into the second half of 2026.

The study demonstrates a 39% overall response rate in synovial sarcoma, indicating potential life extension and reduced chemotherapy dependence. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The publication of Phase 2 data in a prestigious journal like The Lancet is a significant step for Adaptimmune Therapeutics and the field of oncology. It indicates a level of confidence in the data's validity and potential impact on treatment paradigms. Afami-cel's 39% overall response rate in synovial sarcoma patients is noteworthy, especially when considering the limited treatment options currently available for advanced sarcomas. These results may suggest a shift towards personalized cell therapies in oncology, which could improve patient outcomes and reduce reliance on traditional chemotherapy.However, it's important to interpret these results within the context of the trial's design and the broader landscape of cancer treatment. While the response rate is promising, the long-term benefits, potential side effects and overall survival rates need thorough examination in subsequent studies. Additionally, the cost-effectiveness of such treatments must be evaluated, as cell therapies can be expensive to produce and administer. Medical Research Analyst From a research perspective, the SPEARHEAD-1 trial results are pivotal in advancing the understanding of cell therapy in solid tumors. Engineered T-cell therapies like afami-cel represent a growing area of interest, with the potential to target tumors more precisely than conventional methods. The translational results published provide a foundation for further research and development in this space.It's important to note that the durability of responses and the quality of life improvements for patients are key factors in the success of new therapies. The ability of afami-cel to allow patients to go off chemotherapy, as reported, could represent a significant improvement in treatment experience. However, the scalability of manufacturing and the logistical challenges of delivering cell therapies to a broader patient population must be considered as these therapies advance towards commercialization. Financial Analyst The publication of positive trial results can have a substantial impact on a biotech company's stock performance and investor confidence. Adaptimmune's announcement underscores the potential market opportunity for afami-cel in treating advanced sarcomas, a space with high unmet medical needs.

The article, titled ""SPEARHEAD-1: a single-arm phase 2 trial of afamitresgene autoleucel (afami-cel) in advanced synovial sarcoma and myxoid/round cell liposarcoma,"" details clinical and translational results from afami-cel's SPEARHEAD-1 trial (NCT04044768). Dennis Williams, PharmD., Senior Vice President, Late-Stage Development, Adaptimmune: ""It is exciting to see the Lancet share the afami-cel SPEARHEAD-1 trial results in advanced sarcomas with the broader clinical and research communities. The study further demonstrates the ability of engineered T-cell therapies to effectively target solid tumors and we are eager to introduce the first engineered T-cell therapy, afami-cel, to more patients later this year.""Dr. Sandra D'Angelo, M.D., Sarcoma Medical Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, lead author of the publication: ""The reported findings are clinically impactful, considering the current standard of care and limited therapies available in advanced sarcomas. Treatment with afami-cel resulted in 39% overall response rate in synovial sarcoma with durable responses. These results suggest that a one-time treatment with afami-cel has the potential to extend life while allowing responders to go off chemotherapy. The publication of this data further validates the potential of afami-cel to offer a new tool to address the unmet needs of people diagnosed with these often-devastating diseases."" About Afami-cel (afamitresgene autoleucel): On January 31, 2024, Adaptimmune announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for priority review its Biologics License Application (BLA) for afami-cel, an investigational engineered T-cell therapy for advanced synovial sarcoma. The application has a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of August 4, 2024. In the SPEARHEAD-1 trial, 44 patients with advanced synovial sarcoma were treated with a single dose of afami-cel after undergoing lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. Safety findings were overall consistent with those previously observed in advanced cancer patients undergoing lymphodepleting chemotherapy and cell therapy. Haematologic toxicities were the most common adverse events. Low grade cytokine release syndrome occurred in most patients and was managed with standard treatments. About Synovial Sarcoma: There are more than 50 different types of soft tissue sarcomas which are categorised by tumors that appear in fat, muscle, nerves, fibrous tissues, blood vessels, or deep skin tissues.1 Synovial sarcoma accounts for approximately 5% to 10% of all soft tissue sarcomas (there are approximately 13,400 new soft tissue cases in the U.S. each year).2 One third of patients with synovial sarcoma will be diagnosed under the age of 30.2 The five-year survival rate for people with metastatic disease is just 20% and most people undergoing standard of care treatment for advanced disease experience recurrence and go through multiple lines of therapy, often exhausting all options.3https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/soft-tissue-sarcoma/about/soft-tissue-sarcoma.html.Synovial Sarcoma - NCI (cancer.gov).Aytekin MN, et al.

HUTCHMED Announces Savolitinib sNDA Accepted in China for Treatment-Naïve or Previously Treated Patients with Locally Advanced or Metastatic MET Exon 14 NSCLC,2024-03-28T00:00:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"HUTCHMED (HCM) announces Phase IIIb data for savolitinib in NSCLC, showing promising results with median PFS of 13.7 months and expanded indication for treatment-naïve patients in China.","HUTCHMED Announces Savolitinib sNDA Accepted in China for Treatment-Naïve or Previously Treated Patients with Locally Advanced or Metastatic MET Exon 14 NSCLC Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary HUTCHMED (HCM) announces Phase IIIb data for savolitinib in NSCLC, showing promising results with median PFS of 13.7 months and expanded indication for treatment-naïve patients in China. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The recent data on savolitinib for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with MET exon 14 skipping alterations is a significant development in targeted cancer therapy. The high objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) in treatment-naïve patients indicate a promising therapeutic option. It's important to note that the early time to response and the median duration of response (DoR) suggest that savolitinib could offer rapid and sustained benefits for patients. The median overall survival (OS) not being reached is particularly encouraging, suggesting potential long-term survival benefits.However, the safety profile, while reported as tolerable, shows notable incidences of hepatic function abnormalities and other Grade 3 or above adverse events. This highlights the need for careful patient monitoring and potential management strategies for side effects. As an oncologist, the balance between efficacy and tolerability is important for patient outcomes and savolitinib appears to be a valuable addition to the treatment landscape, pending a thorough review of the full data set by regulatory authorities. Market Research Analyst The acceptance of the supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for savolitinib by the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) could have a significant impact on HUTCHMED's market position, especially considering the size of the lung cancer patient population in China. With over a third of the world's lung cancer patients located in China, the expanded label indication could open up a substantial market opportunity for HUTCHMED and its partner, AstraZeneca.Given the competitive landscape of NSCLC treatments, the strong efficacy data presented could position savolitinib favorably among other MET inhibitors, potentially leading to increased market share and revenue growth for HUTCHMED. Additionally, the partnership with AstraZeneca could leverage their global presence for further commercialization efforts, should the treatment receive approval in other regions. Investors should monitor the review process closely, as approval could signal a strategic win for HUTCHMED and influence its stock valuation. Medical Research Analyst The Phase IIIb clinical trial data for savolitinib represents a significant advance in precision medicine for NSCLC. The MET exon 14 skipping alteration is a specific genetic aberration and targeted therapies like savolitinib are designed to exploit such molecular vulnerabilities. The robust clinical trial results, including the median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) data, provide strong evidence supporting the efficacy of savolitinib in a well-defined patient subgroup.From a research perspective, the conditional approval based on earlier trials and the potential full approval contingent on these results exemplify the accelerated pathway that targeted therapies can follow in oncology drug development. This approach can bring innovative treatments to market more quickly, benefiting patients with critical needs. The data also underlines the importance of biomarker-driven clinical trials in oncology, which can lead to more personalized and effective treatment strategies. 03/27/2024 - 08:00 PM — Oral presentation at the European Lung Cancer Congress 2024 of Phase IIIb data demonstrating median PFS of 13.7 months and median OS not reached in treatment-naïve patients — — If approved, would confirm 2021 conditional approval and expand indication to more patients — HONG KONG and SHANGHAI, China and FLORHAM PARK, N.J., March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HUTCHMED (China) Limited (“HUTCHMED”) (Nasdaq/AIM:​HCM; HKEX:​13) today announces that the supplemental New Drug Application (“sNDA”) for savolitinib, in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) with mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (“MET”) exon 14 skipping alteration, has been accepted for review by the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA). If approved, the new label indication for savolitinib will be expanded to include treatment-naïve patients in China. Savolitinib was previously granted conditional approval in China for the treatment of patients with NSCLC with MET exon 14 skipping alterations who have progressed following prior systemic therapy or are unable to receive chemotherapy. Savolitinib was launched and is marketed under the brand name ORPATHYS® by our partner, AstraZeneca for this patient population, representing the first selective MET inhibitor approved in China. More than a third of the world’s lung cancer patients are in China and, among those with NSCLC globally, approximately 2-3% have tumors with MET exon 14 skipping alterations. Preliminary efficacy and safety data from the first-line cohort of the confirmatory Phase IIIb clinical trial (NCT04923945) were presented during the IASLC World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC) in September 2023. Final data from the confirmatory Phase IIIb trial were presented at the European Lung Cancer Congress on March 20, 2024. The data from this study provide confirmatory evidence for savolitinib as a targeted treatment option for treatment-naïve or previously treated patients with MET exon 14 skipping alteration NSCLC. In treatment-naïve patients, objective response rate (“ORR”) was 62.1% (95% CI: 51.0% to 72.3%), disease control rate (“DCR”) was 92.0% (95% CI: 84.1% to 96.7%) and median duration of response (“DoR”) was 12.5 months (95% CI: 8.3 months to 15.2 months), as assessed by an independent review committee. Median progression free survival (“PFS”) was 13.7 months (95% CI: 8.5 months to 16.6 months) and median overall survival (“OS”) was not reached with median follow-up of 20.8 months. In previously treated patients, ORR was 39.2% (95% CI: 28.4% to 50.9%), DCR was 92.4% (95% CI: 84.2% to 97.2%) and median DoR was 11.1 months (95% CI: 6.6 months to not reached), as assessed by an independent review committee. Median PFS was 11.0 months (95% CI: 8.3 months to 16.6 months) and median OS was not mature with median follow-up of 12.5 months. Responses occurred early (time to response 1.4-1.6 months) in both treatment-naïve and previously treated patients. The safety profile was tolerable and no new safety signals were observed. The most common drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events of Grade 3 or above (5% or more of patients) were abnormal hepatic function (16.9%), increased alanine aminotransferase (14.5%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (12.0%), peripheral oedema (6.0%) and increased gamma-glutamyltransferase (6.0%). About NSCLC and MET aberrations Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among men and women, accounting for about one-fifth of all cancer deaths.1 Lung cancer is broadly split into NSCLC and small cell lung cancer, with 80-85% classified as NSCLC.2 The majority of NSCLC patients (approximately 75%) are diagnosed with advanced disease, and approximately 10-15% of NSCLC patients in the U.S. and Europe and 30-40% of patients in Asia have EGFRm NSCLC. 3,4,5,6 MET is a tyrosine kinase receptor that has an essential role in normal cell development.7 MET overexpression and/or amplification can lead to tumor growth and the metastatic progression of cancer cells, and is one of the mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs for metastatic EGFR-mutated NSCLC.7,8 Approximately 2-3% of NSCLC patients have tumors with MET exon 14 skipping alterations, a targetable mutation in the MET gene.9 Among patients who experience disease progression post-osimertinib treatment, approximately 15-50% present with MET aberration.10,11,12,13,14 The prevalence of MET depends on the sample type, detection method and assay cut-off used.15 About Savolitinib (ORPATHYS® in China) Savolitinib is an oral, potent and highly selective MET tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has demonstrated clinical activity in advanced solid tumors. It blocks atypical activation of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase pathway that occurs because of mutations (such as exon 14 skipping alterations or other point mutations), gene amplification or protein overexpression. Savolitinib is marketed in China under the brand name ORPATHYS® for the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer with MET exon 14 skipping alterations who have progressed following prior systemic therapy or are unable to receive chemotherapy. It is currently under clinical development for multiple tumor types, including lung, kidney and gastric cancers, as a single treatment and in combination with other medicines. Starting on March 1, 2023, ORPATHYS® was included in the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC adult patients with MET exon 14-skipping alterations who have progressed after or unable to tolerate platinum-based chemotherapy. In 2011, AstraZeneca and HUTCHMED entered a global licensing and collaboration agreement to jointly develop and commercialize savolitinib. Joint development of savolitinib in China is led by HUTCHMED, while AstraZeneca leads development outside of China. HUTCHMED is responsible for the marketing authorization, manufacturing and supply of savolitinib in China. AstraZeneca is responsible for the commercialization of savolitinib in China and worldwide. Sales of savolitinib are recognized by AstraZeneca. About HUTCHMED HUTCHMED (Nasdaq/AIM:​HCM; HKEX:​13) is an innovative, commercial-stage, biopharmaceutical company.

Financial Analyst The initial public offering (IPO) of Alta Global Group Limited is a significant event for the company and its investors. With the company pricing its shares at $5.00, resulting in gross proceeds of $6.5 million, it's essential to assess the valuation in relation to the company's growth prospects. The underwriters' option to purchase additional shares to cover over-allotments indicates confidence in investor demand. However, it's vital to consider the competitive landscape of the technology and sports industry and how Alta plans to differentiate itself and sustain growth.Investors should monitor the use of net proceeds, particularly the allocation towards marketing, sales and R&D, which could drive future revenue growth. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of these investments is not guaranteed and should be evaluated against industry benchmarks and the company's strategic execution. The stock's performance post-IPO will provide insights into market sentiment and the perceived potential of Alta's business model. Market Research Analyst The martial arts and combat sports industry presents a niche market with specific consumer behavior and monetization challenges. Alta's focus on increasing consumer participation and enhancing community offerings is promising but requires a deep understanding of market dynamics. The success of their strategy will hinge on their ability to identify and capitalize on untapped opportunities within the sector.It will be important to track consumer response to Alta's initiatives post-IPO. Any significant increase in user engagement or partnerships within the industry could signal a positive trajectory. Conversely, a lack of market traction could raise concerns about the company's ability to achieve its stated objectives and, by extension, its long-term financial health. 03/27/2024 - 07:55 PM MANLY, AUSTRALIA / ACCESSWIRE / March 27, 2024 / Alta Global Group Limited (""Alta"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE American:MMA), a technology company that is enabling the global martial arts and combat sports industry to maximize the monetization opportunities available to the sector by increasing consumer participation in the sport and building upon existing community offerings within the sector, today announced the pricing of its initial public offering (the ""Offering"") of 1,300,000 ordinary shares at a price to the public of $5.00 per share, for gross proceeds of $6,500,000, before deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses.

Negative None. Financial Analyst The filing of Brookfield Reinsurance's 2023 annual report is a significant disclosure for investors and market analysts alike. The audited financial statements contained within provide a comprehensive overview of the company's financial health and performance over the past year. Specifically, the balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement will reveal key metrics such as liquidity ratios, profitability and operational efficiency.Investors should scrutinize the report for any material changes in revenue streams or expense categories, which could indicate shifts in the company's business strategy or operational challenges. For instance, a substantial increase in claims expenses could suggest volatility in underwriting performance, while a rise in investment income might reflect a strategic reallocation of assets.Furthermore, the report’s notes can offer insights into management's future expectations and any potential risks on the horizon. It's essential to compare these metrics against industry benchmarks to gauge Brookfield Reinsurance's competitive standing. Any deviations from industry norms could be indicative of either strategic advantages or areas of concern. Market Research Analyst The release of Brookfield Reinsurance's annual report also carries implications for market sentiment and stock valuation. The market's reaction to the report can be immediate and significant, depending on the disclosed financials and future outlook. If the company has outperformed market expectations, we might see a positive response in the form of a stock price increase. Conversely, if the report highlights underperformance or increased risk exposure, the stock could suffer.It's also important to consider the broader economic context when analyzing the report. For example, in a low-interest-rate environment, reinsurance companies may struggle to generate significant returns on their investment portfolios, which could impact their overall profitability. On the other hand, if interest rates are rising, the opposite may be true.Additionally, analysts should look for commentary on market trends, such as the impact of climate change on policy claims, which could affect long-term strategic planning. Understanding these nuances will help investors make informed decisions about the company's growth prospects and risk profile. 03/27/2024 - 07:51 PM BROOKFIELD, NEWS, March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Brookfield Reinsurance (NYSE, TSX: BNRE, BNRE.A) announced today the filing of its 2023 annual report, including audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, on Form 20-F with the SEC on EDGAR as well as with Canadian securities regulatory authorities on SEDAR.

Bringing together complementary technology portfolios, leading process design expertise and an established project delivery platform, the partnership will leverage ACC's commercial carbon capture product offering and SLB's new technology developments and industrialization capability. It will create a vehicle for accelerating the introduction of early-stage technologies into the global market on a commercial, proven platform. Following the transaction, SLB will own 80% of the combined business and ACC will own 20%. The International Energy Agency (IEA) sees carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration (CCUS) playing a critical role in the net-zero transition - estimating that over one gigaton of CO2 per year will need to be captured by 2030, scaling up to over six gigatons by 2050. ""The decision to combine ACC and SLB's carbon capture business is underpinned by a strategic vision that reflects our commitment to accelerate the industrial adoption of carbon capture,"" said Egil Fagerland, chief executive officer, ACC. ""By partnering with SLB, we will become a diversified, global carbon capture player. Our combined suite of technologies and global reach will make a platform positioned to profitably scale faster, to the benefit of customers, employees and shareholders."" The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to close by end of the second quarter, 2024. Transaction details At closing, SLB will pay NOK 4.12 billion in cash to ACC for the purchase of 80% of the shares in Aker Carbon Capture Holding AS (ACCH), which holds the business of ACC. In addition, ACC will retain NOK 0.40 billion in cash. The sum of the purchase price for ACCH and retained cash corresponds to a value per ACC share of NOK 9.19. In addition, ACC will be entitled to a performance-based payment of up to NOK 1.36 billion. The performance-based payments will be subject to the achievement of certain milestones, order intake and margin targets. The payments will be due when certain targets are met in the period 2025 to 2027, weighted towards the end of the period upon finalization of the financial statements for 2027. The performance-based payments will carry a market-based interest rate from the date of closing until the date of payment. ACCH will pay USD 50 million to purchase SLB's carbon capture business. The cooperation between ACC and SLB as shareholders of the combined business, will be governed by a shareholders' agreement. This will, inter alia, provide for board representation and certain other governance and minority protection rights for ACC, for SLB to finance the realization of the business plan by shareholder loans and for the possibility for ACC to sell its 20% stake in the combined business in the future. After a lock-up period of three years, ACC will be entitled to sell its stake in ACCH to SLB during a period of six months (put option). The put option price will be based on the fair market value of the combined business with a floor equal to the purchase price agreed for ACCH as set out above (on a per share basis, and not including any performance-based payments) corresponding to approximately NOK 1.03 billion for the retained 20% stake, and a ceiling at 2.0x this price. Conversely, SLB will after expiry of the put option have a right to purchase ACC's 20% stake in the combined business during the following six months (call option). The call option price will be based on the fair market value of the combined business with a higher floor than the put option floor and a ceiling at 2.5x. The shareholders' agreement also has customary buy-out rights for both shareholders in the event of a change of control in the other shareholder.

Kingstone provided guidance for FY2024, expecting growth in direct premiums written, a lower combined ratio, and improved earnings per share. The CEO expressed confidence in sustaining positive momentum and delivering value to stakeholders. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Kingstone Companies, Inc.'s return to profitability and a substantial improvement in its combined ratio from 113.9% to 89.5% suggests a significant recovery in operational efficiency. The combined ratio, a key performance indicator in the insurance industry, reflects the percentage of premiums paid out in claims and expenses. A ratio below 100% indicates an underwriting profit, which Kingstone has achieved this quarter, signaling a favorable shift in its core operations. Furthermore, the company's guidance for 2024, with an anticipated combined ratio of 88.0% to 92.0% and a return on equity of 15.0% to 22.0%, projects confidence in maintaining profitability and shareholder returns. The direct premiums written growth in the core business of 12.0% to 16.0% is ambitious, indicating aggressive business expansion plans in its primary market of New York. Investors should monitor the company's ability to manage this growth without compromising underwriting quality or encountering unexpected losses. Insurance Industry Analyst Kingstone's strategic decision to cease writing new business outside of New York and focus on its core business has led to a decrease in policies-in-force but has also resulted in a healthier net loss ratio, especially in the non-core segments. This strategic shift is reflected in the improved financials and may resonate well with investors looking for companies with a clear focus on profitable segments. The reduction in catastrophe loss ratio, from 13.7% to 3.0%, also highlights a period of lower claims, contributing to the improved net income. The insurance industry often faces volatility due to unpredictable catastrophic events and Kingstone's experience in the fourth quarter may not be indicative of a longer-term trend. Stakeholders should consider the potential for increased catastrophe losses in future periods, which could reverse the gains seen in this quarter. Market Research Analyst Kingstone's performance in the fourth quarter of 2023 can be seen as a positive indicator within the regional insurance market, suggesting that the company's restructuring efforts and strategic initiatives are yielding results. The growth in the core business direct premiums written in New York is particularly noteworthy, as it illustrates the company's competitive strength in its main market despite a general reduction in policy count. However, the insurance market is highly competitive and Kingstone's growth strategy must be sustainable to ensure long-term success. Investors should consider the broader market dynamics, including regulatory changes, technological advancements and competitive pressures, which could all impact Kingstone's future performance. 03/27/2024 - 04:15 PM Returns to Profitability and Achieves Combined Ratio of 89.5% in 4Q23;Issues Initial Guidance for FY2024KINGSTON, NY / ACCESSWIRE / March 27, 2024 / Kingstone Companies, Inc.

Direct premiums written and net premiums written are provided as supplemental information, not as a substitute for net premiums earned, and do not reflect the Company's net premiums earned.Adjusted EBITDA is net income (loss) exclusive of interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, net gains (losses) on investments, and stock- based compensation. Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most closely comparable to adjusted EBITDA.Management uses adjusted EBITDA along with other measures to gauge the Company's performance and evaluate results, which can be skewed when including interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, net gains (losses) on investments, and stock-based compensation, and may vary significantly between periods. Adjusted EBITDA is provided as supplemental information, not as a substitute for net income (loss) and does not reflect the Company's overall profitability.Operating income (loss) and diluted operating income (loss) per share is net income (loss) and diluted income (loss) per share exclusive of net gains (losses) on investments, net of tax. Net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share is the GAAP measure most closely comparable to operating income (loss) and diluted operating income (loss) per share.Management uses operating income (loss) and diluted operating income (loss) per share along with other measures to gauge the Company's performance and evaluate results, which can be skewed when including net gains (losses) on investments, and may vary significantly between periods. Operating income (loss) and diluted operating income (loss) per share is provided as supplemental information, not as a substitute for net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share and does not reflect the Company's overall profitability.Operating return on equity is operating income (loss) divided by average equity. Return on equity is the GAAP measure most closely comparable to operating return on equity.Management uses operating return on equity, along with other measures, to gauge the Company's performance and evaluate results, which can be skewed when including net gains (losses) on investments, which may vary significantly between periods. Operating return on equity is provided as supplemental information, is not a substitute for return on equity and does not reflect the Company's overall return on average common equity.Net loss ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes is a non-GAAP ratio, which is computed as the difference between GAAP net loss ratio and the effect of catastrophes on the net loss ratio.Management believes that this ratio is useful to investors and it is used by management to reveal the trends in the Company's business that may be obscured by catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses cause the Company's loss ratios to vary significantly between periods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude, and can have a significant impact on the net loss ratio. Management believes that this measure is useful for investors to evaluate this component separately when reviewing the Company's underwriting performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is the net loss ratio. The net loss ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes should not be considered a substitute for the net loss ratio and does not reflect the Company's net loss ratio.The table below reconciles direct premiums written and net premiums written to net premiums earned for the periods presented: For the Three Months Ended For the Years Ended December 31, December 31, 2023 2022 % Change 2023 2022 % Change (000's except percentages) Direct and Net Premiums Written Reconciliation:Direct premiums written $52,938 $53,901 (1.8%) $200,175 $201,255 (0.5%) Ceded premiums written1 (15,554) (12,928) 20.3% (106,564) (94,241) 13.1% Net premiums written1 37,384 40,973 (8.8%) 93,611 107,014 (12.5%) Change in unearned premiums1 (8,701) (10,525) (17.3%) 20,774 7,371 181.8% Net premiums earned $28,683 $30,448 (5.8%) $114,384 $114,385 (0.0%) (Components may not sum due to rounding) 1Ceded premiums written balances, net premiums written balances and change in unearned premiums balances from prior year periods were reclassified to conform with current year presentation.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures We prepare financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We also disclose and discuss other non-U.S. GAAP financial measures such as EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. Our management believes that these measures are relevant and provide useful supplemental information to investors by providing a baseline for evaluating and comparing our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry. Our management believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA reflect our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of non-cash charges, such as amortization and depreciation, and other items, such as interest, income taxes, equity compensation, acquisition and transaction costs, restructuring costs, systems establishment and costs associated with strategic initiatives which are incurred outside the ordinary course of our business, provides information about our cost structure and helps us to track our operating progress. We encourage investors and potential investors to carefully review our U.S. GAAP financial measures and compare them with our EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. The non-U.S. GAAP financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies and in the future, we may disclose different non-U.S. GAAP financial measures in order to help our investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our results of operations to our previously reported results of operations or to those of other companies in our industry. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA We define EBITDA as net income (loss) plus interest (income) expense, income tax expense (benefit), extinguishment of debt, impairment losses, and depreciation and amortization. We view adjusted EBITDA as an operating performance measure and as such, we believe that the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure is net loss. In calculating adjusted EBITDA, we exclude from net loss certain items that we believe are not reflective of our ongoing business as the exclusion of these items allows us to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the day-to-day operation of our business. We have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions: Acquisition, financing and transaction costs generally represent earn-out payments, rating agency fees and letter of credit and revolving facility fees, as well as professional service fees and direct expenses related to acquisitions and public offerings, as well as cost associated with reviewing potential alternative sources for cash or financing related to our debt maturities. Because we do not acquire businesses or effect financings on a regular or predictable cycle, we do not consider the amount of these costs to be a representative component of the day-to-day operating performance of our business. Stock compensation and other primarily represent portions of compensation paid to our employees and executives through stock-based instruments. Determining the fair value of the stock-based instruments involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and the expenses recorded may not align with the actual value realized upon the future exercise or termination of the related stock-based awards. Additionally, stock compensation is a non-cash expense. Therefore, we believe it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation to better understand the long-term performance of our core business. Change in fair value of Private Warrants relates to changes in the fair market value of the Private Warrants issued in conjunction with the Business Combination. We do not consider the amount to be representative of a component of the day-to-day operating performance of our business. Restructuring costs generally represent non-ordinary course costs incurred in connection with a change in a contract or a change in the makeup of our personnel often related to an acquisition, such as severance payments, recruiting fees and retention charges. We do not consider the amount of restructuring costs to be a representative component of the day-to-day operating performance of our business. Systems establishment costs relate to non-ordinary course expenses incurred to develop our IT infrastructure, including system automation and enterprise resource planning system implementation. We do not consider the amount to be representative of a component of the day-to-day operating performance of our business.

Financial results show expected cash runway into 2026. The company reports full year 2023 financial data and fourth quarter business update. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results released by Orchestra BioMed Holdings, Inc. indicate a significant increase in net loss from $33.6 million in 2022 to $49.1 million in 2023, with a loss per share of ($1.48) compared to ($2.24) the previous year. This widening loss is attributed to higher research and development costs, particularly due to the BACKBEAT study for AVIM therapy and increased operational expenses as a result of transitioning to a public company. The reported decrease in partnership revenue from Terumo also contributed to the reduced income. However, the company's cash runway extension into the second half of 2026 suggests a stable financial position in the near term, which may ease investor concerns about immediate liquidity risks.From an investment perspective, the focus on the BACKBEAT study and the unique selling proposition of Virtue SAB could potentially offer long-term growth opportunities. The company's strategic collaborations with industry leaders like Medtronic and Terumo could leverage their commercialization capabilities. Nevertheless, investors should be mindful of the inherent risks in the biotech sector, including regulatory hurdles and market adoption challenges. Medical Research Analyst Orchestra BioMed's emphasis on the BACKBEAT pivotal study for AVIM therapy in hypertensive pacemaker patients reflects a strategic focus on addressing high unmet medical needs. The therapy's potential applicability in Japan, pending approval based on the global study, could open up significant market opportunities in Asia. The company's innovative approach with Virtue SAB, which provides protected focal delivery of extended-release sirolimus, targets a niche yet substantial market in coronary in-stent restenosis treatment.Given the global shift towards drug-coated balloons for artery disease treatment, Virtue SAB's non-coated balloon system could be a game-changer, offering potential advantages over existing solutions. It's important to monitor the progress of clinical trials and regulatory approvals as they will be key drivers for the company's future revenue streams and market positioning. The medical community and potential patients could benefit from a successful outcome, which would also validate Orchestra BioMed's partnership-enabled business model. Market Research Analyst The biotech industry is highly competitive and Orchestra BioMed's partnerships with Medtronic and Terumo could provide a strategic advantage in the cardiovascular space. The company's focus on innovative therapies like AVIM and Virtue SAB aligns with the industry trend of seeking differentiated products that address unmet medical needs. The estimated $4 billion annual target market for Virtue SAB is indicative of the significant commercial potential and the company's ability to capitalize on this will be important for its growth trajectory.Market adoption of new medical technologies is often a function of clinical efficacy, cost-effectiveness and reimbursement policies. Orchestra BioMed's long-term success will depend on their ability to demonstrate these factors in their clinical studies and subsequent marketing efforts. Investors should pay close attention to the company's progress in these areas, as they will be critical determinants of future financial performance and stock market valuation. 03/27/2024 - 04:17 PM Initiated enrollment of the BACKBEAT global pivotal study evaluating AVIM therapy (also known as BackBeat Cardiac Neuromodulation Therapy) in hypertensive pacemaker patients in collaboration with Medtronic, plc (NYSE: MDT) in December 2023 Orchestra BioMed and Terumo remain actively engaged to update operational plans and financial arrangements for Virtue® Sirolimus AngioInfusionTM Balloon (“SAB”) development and commercialization for treatment of coronary and peripheral artery diseaseExpected runway of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, including certain potential future proceeds sufficient into 2H 2026, beyond anticipated BACKBEAT top-line results readout NEW HOPE, Pa., March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Orchestra BioMed Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: OBIO, “Orchestra BioMed” or the “Company”), a biomedical company accelerating high-impact technologies to patients through risk-reward sharing partnerships, today reported its full year 2023 financial results and provided a fourth quarter business update. “2023 was a year of strong momentum for Orchestra BioMed as we made significant progress on our cardiovascular pipeline with the achievement of key regulatory milestones and completion of our successful Nasdaq listing,” commented David Hochman, chairman, chief executive officer and founder of Orchestra BioMed. “In December, we initiated the BACKBEAT global pivotal study evaluating our lead program, AVIM therapy, in hypertensive pacemaker patients working alongside our strategic partner Medtronic, the global market leader in cardiac pacing therapies. We see a substantial market opportunity for AVIM therapy in this patient population, as well as in other high-risk hypertension populations.” Mr. Hochman continued, “We remain actively engaged with our other strategic partner, Terumo, to update our operational and financial plans to advance Virtue SAB for the treatment of patients with coronary in-stent restenosis, a breakthrough indication for which we have conditional Investigational Device Exemption approval from the FDA, as well as other breakthrough coronary and peripheral indications. Globally, the treatment of coronary in-stent restenosis and other challenging artery disease indications is rapidly shifting toward drug-coated balloons. We continue to believe Virtue SAB, the only non-coated balloon angioplasty system that provides protected focal delivery of extended-release sirolimus, has the potential to offer a best-in-class solution with important advantages for patients and physicians in an established target global market we estimate at over $4 billion annually. Overall, we look forward to continuing 2023’s momentum in the year ahead with a focus on strong execution, the best validation of our partnership-enabled business model.” Fourth Quarter 2023 and Recent Highlights Advancing AVIM Therapy in High Unmet Need Hypertension Populations Initiated enrollment of the BACKBEAT pivotal study evaluating the efficacy and safety of atrioventricular interval modulation (“AVIM”) therapy in hypertensive pacemaker patients in December 2023, with a target for completion of enrollment in mid-2025.Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (“PMDA”) indicated that the existing BACKBEAT global pivotal study, if sufficient to support FDA approval of BackBeat CNT would likely be sufficient to support a regulatory approval of AVIM therapy in Japan.Continued to explore future opportunities to utilize AVIM therapy and other forms of Cardiac Neuromodulation Therapy (“CNT”) for high-risk populations with hypertension and heart failure. Maximizing the Opportunity for Highly Differentiated Virtue SAB Initiation of Virtue ISR-US pivotal study of Virtue SAB for the treatment of coronary in-stent restenosis (“ISR”), as well as submissions to Japanese PMDA in coronary ISR and small vessel disease are pending ongoing operational and financial plan calibration with Terumo, strategic partner for development and commercialization of Virtue SAB for coronary and peripheral artery disease treatment. Financial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $87.6 million as of December 31, 2023. Expected runway extended into the second half of 2026 based on internally prepared forecast reflecting updated operating priorities and certain potential future proceeds.Net cash used in operating activities and for the purchase of fixed assets was $46.2 million during 2023, compared with $29.9 million for 2022, with the primary drivers of increased spending being costs associated with preparation for the initiation of the BACKBEAT pivotal study as well as expenses associated with being a public company.Revenue for 2023 was $2.8 million, compared with $3.5 million for 2022. The decrease was primarily due to decreased recognition of partnership revenues earned under the agreement with Terumo.Research and development expenses for 2023 were $33.8 million, compared with $21.9 million for 2022. The increase was primarily due to additional costs associated with preparation for the initiation of the BACKBEAT pivotal study.Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2023 were $20.3 million, compared with $14.0 million for 2022. The increase was primarily due to additional personnel costs, legal, insurance and finance costs, and additional costs related to being a public company.Net loss for 2023 was $49.1 million, or ($1.48) per share, compared with a net loss of $33.6 million, or ($2.24) per share, for 2022. Net loss for the year-ended 2023 included non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $7.6 million, compared with $3.4 million for the same period in 2022.

About AVIM Therapy (BackBeat CNTTM) AVIM therapy, also known as BackBeat CNT™, is an investigational therapy compatible with standard dual-chamber pacemakers designed to substantially and persistently lower blood pressure. It has been evaluated in pilot studies in patients with hypertension who are also indicated for a pacemaker. MODERATO II, a double-blind, randomized, pilot study, showed that patients treated with AVIM therapy experienced net reductions of 8.1 mmHg in 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure (aSBP) and 12.3 mmHg in office systolic blood pressure (oSBP) at six months when compared to control patients. The global IDE BACKBEAT (BradycArdia paCemaKer with atrioventricular interval modulation for Blood prEssure treAtmenT) pivotal study will further evaluate the safety and efficacy of AVIM therapy in lowering blood pressure in a similar target population of patients who have been indicated for, and recently implanted with, a dual-chamber cardiac pacemaker. About Virtue SAB Virtue SAB is a patented drug/device combination product candidate in development for the treatment of certain forms of artery disease that is designed to deliver a proprietary, investigational, extended-release formulation of sirolimus, SirolimusEFR™, to the vessel wall during balloon angioplasty without any coating on the balloon surface or the need to leave a stent or other permanent implant in the artery. Virtue SAB demonstrated positive three-year clinical data in coronary ISR in the SABRE study, a multi-center prospective, independent core lab-adjudicated clinical study of 50 patients conducted in Europe. Virtue SAB has been granted Breakthrough Device designation by the FDA for specific indications relating to coronary ISR, coronary small vessel disease and peripheral artery disease below-the-knee. The FDA granted IDE approval to initiate the Virtue ISR-US study to evaluate this novel treatment in coronary ISR patients. Orchestra BioMed has a strategic partnership with Terumo (Terumo, TSE: 4543), a global leader in medical technology headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, as well as Terumo Medical Corporation, its U.S. subsidiary, to collaborate on the global development and commercialization of Virtue SAB in coronary and peripheral vascular indications.

Tawil, CEO, extends up to USD 1,500,000 to CentaurusCalgary, Alberta--(Newsfile Corp. - March 27, 2024) - Centaurus Energy Inc. (TSXV: CTA) (OTC Pink: CTARF) (""Centaurus"" or the ""Company"") and its board of directors are pleased to announce the Company’s new capital allocation strategy, focused on the Ether cryptocurrency (ETH), the native asset of the Ethereum blockchain. Related to this strategy, David D. Tawil, CEO of Centaurus has entered into an agreement to extend up to USD 1,500,000 to Centaurus.Ether as Primary Treasury Reserve AssetA commodity-focused enterprise since inception, Centaurus has a 25-year history of mining, valuing, and trading physical commodities. Now, the Company will broaden its scope to digital commodities, specifically, Ether.David D. Tawil, CEO of Centaurus, said, “Centaurus Energy is announcing a capital allocation strategy that reflects a new direction in its commitment to capital stewardship. Centaurus will benefit from its passive royalty interest in the Coiron Amargo Sur Este petroleum block, located in the Province of Neuquén, Argentina, over the next 15 years, which will largely result in excess cash. We have reduced our expense base to a minimum. And we are confident that we can manage our day-to-day business with a modest amount of operating cash. Accordingly, we believe it is appropriate to invest in assets with potentially higher returns than holding cash.”In addition to having served as Centaurus’ CEO since 2020, Mr. Tawil has been the President and Co-Founder of ProChain Capital, a multi-strategy cryptoassets hedge fund, since 2017.Centaurus began purchasing Ether on March 26.Capital InvestmentIn connection with its new strategy, David D. Tawil, CEO of Centaurus, has entered into a loan agreement with the Company, providing up to USD 1,500,000 of capital, at the greater of:(i) 7% per annum or (ii) 65% of the profits on the corresponding Ether purchased by the Company (the “Tawil Loan”).“Our investment in Ether is part of our new capital allocation strategy, which seeks to maximize long-term value for our shareholders in Canada and in the United States,” said David D. Tawil, CEO of Centaurus Energy. “This investment reflects our belief that Ether, as the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency of a public blockchain powering “smart contracts” and DApps (Decentralized Applications), serving as the epicenter for DeFi (Decentralized Finance), NFTs (Non-fungible Tokens), and securities tokenization efforts by some of the largest asset management firms globally, is an attractive investment asset with more long-term appreciation potential than holding cash. Since its launch in 2015, Ethereum has emerged as a significant addition to the global financial system, with characteristics that are potentially useful to both individuals and institutions, and could revolutionize property ownership recording and transfers, including, real-property, personal property, contractual rights and financial products, banking and value-transfer, and creative works. Centaurus has recognized Ether as a legitimate investment asset that can be superior to cash and accordingly has made Ether the principal holding in its treasury reserve strategy.”Inclusive of its investment in Ether, Centaurus will consider opportunities to earn yield on the Ether that it owns, including the depositing of Ether into staking pools or liquidity pools.In considering various commodities for potential investment, Centaurus observed distinctive properties of Ether that led it to believe investing in the cryptocurrency would provide the prospect of earning a higher return than other investments. Mr. Tawil articulated the opinion, “We find the global acceptance, energy-efficiency, self-deflationary monetary policy, and consistent upgrade of network software of Ether to be persuasive evidence of its superiority as a commodity for those seeking meaningful long-term returns.”Related Party TransactionAs David D. Tawil is CEO of the Company, he is considered a “related party” for the purposes of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 - Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (“MI 61-101”). Accordingly, the Tawil Loan is a “related party transaction”. The Tawil Loan was obtained by Centaurus on reasonable commercial terms that are not less advantageous to Centaurus than if the Tawil Loan were obtained from a person dealing at arm’s length with Centaurus and the Tawil Loan has no equity or voting component. The Tawil Loan is not subject to minority approval or formal valuation.Continuous Disclosure ObligationThe Company’s new capital allocation strategy is a material change for purposes of National Instrument 51-102 – Continuous Disclosure Obligations (“NI 51-102”).About Centaurus EnergyThe Company is an independent Canadian company that has been focused on Argentine upstream oil and gas with operations until January 2023.

Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results for Inhibikase Therapeutics, Inc. indicate a net loss of $19.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which is a slight increase from the previous year's $18.1 million. This uptick in net loss is a concern, as it suggests that the company's expenses are outpacing its ability to generate revenue. The rise in research and development (R&D) expenses, particularly the $1.5 million increase in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) expenditures, reflects the company's investment in its drug pipeline. However, investors should monitor whether these investments will yield successful drug approvals and commercialization.Additionally, the company's cash position, with $13.3 million in reserves, is projected to sustain operations into the first quarter of 2025. This runway gives Inhibikase some leeway to progress its clinical trials without immediate funding concerns. However, if the trials do not meet their endpoints or if regulatory hurdles arise, the company could face financial strain, necessitating further capital raises which might dilute current shareholders' equity. Medical Research Analyst From a medical research perspective, the recent developments in Inhibikase's pipeline are significant. The completion of the Pre-NDA meeting with the FDA for IkT-001Pro is a pivotal step towards potential market approval. The FDA's confirmation that the 505(b)(2) pathway is appropriate for IkT-001Pro suggests a potentially expedited approval process, leveraging previous research data. However, the removal of the formal use-related risk assessment could imply a higher burden of proof on the company to ensure medication safety.Moreover, the ongoing Phase 2 trial of Risvodetinib in Parkinson's disease is notable for its novel approach to targeting alpha-synuclein aggregates, a key pathological feature in Parkinson's. The trial's blinding prevents current assessment of the drug's efficacy, but reported mild to moderate adverse events will be important data points for evaluating the drug's safety profile. The ability of Risvodetinib to cross the blood-brain barrier, as indicated by CSF concentrations, is promising for its therapeutic potential. Market Research Analyst Assessing the market potential for Inhibikase's therapeutic candidates is essential. IkT-001Pro's targeting of blood and stomach cancer indications could position it within a competitive oncology market where differentiation is key. The company's strategy to manufacture dosage forms distinct from imatinib mesylate could avoid direct competition and provide a marketing advantage. The market potential for non-oncology indications also represents an area for growth, as it could cater to unmet medical needs beyond cancer.For Risvodetinib, the Parkinson's disease market is crowded with symptomatic treatments, but lacks disease-modifying therapies. If Risvodetinib demonstrates efficacy in modifying disease progression, it could capture a significant market share. However, the company's ability to capitalize on these opportunities will depend on successful clinical outcomes and strategic partnerships or marketing capabilities to effectively compete with established pharmaceutical players. 03/27/2024 - 04:15 PM Company to host conference call on Thursday, March 28, 2024 at 8:00 a.m. ETBOSTON and ATLANTA, March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Inhibikase Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: IKT) (Inhibikase or Company), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing protein kinase inhibitor therapeutics to modify the course of Parkinson’s disease (“PD”), Parkinson’s-related disorders and other diseases of the Abelson Tyrosine Kinases, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023 and highlighted recent developments. “2023 was a year of clinical execution across our pipeline, culminating in the recent pre-NDA meeting with the FDA for IkT-001Pro and robust enrollment of untreated Parkinson’s patients in our 201 Trial evaluating Risvodetinib (“Risvo”),” said Dr. Milton H. Werner, President and Chief Executive Officer of Inhibikase. “As we look ahead, we believe that FDA feedback from our pre-NDA meeting was constructive as we work on the requirements for NDA submission for IkT-001Pro. In addition, enrollment of patients into the 201 Trial supports our belief that topline data from the three-month, double-blind phase of the study may be available in the second half of this year. Our recent publication of Phase 1 safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic clinical data for Risvo in the Journal of Parkinson’s Disease reinforces our belief that Risvo is well tolerated and reaches therapeutic exposures in patients with Parkinson’s disease and related disorders. We look forward to taking advantage of the recent momentum we have experienced as we continue to build value for our shareholders and bring new medicines to patients in need.” Recent Developments and Upcoming Milestones: Completed Pre-NDA Meeting with the FDA for IkT-001Pro: On January 19, 2024, Inhibikase met with the FDA Review Team (“Review Team”) from the Division of Hematologic Malignancies to discuss requirements for a 505(b)(2) NDA submission for IkT-001Pro in up to 11 blood and stomach cancer indications. Final Meeting Minutes were provided by the FDA on February 12, 2024. The Meeting Minutes confirmed that the 505(b)(2) pathway appears to be appropriate for approval of IkT-001Pro. The Review Team removed the requirement to perform a formal use-related risk assessment but expects the NDA package to justify how medication errors will be avoided for physicians, pharmacists and patients who are prescribed IkT-001Pro. The Company plans to manufacture dosage forms at 150 mg and 300 mg to discriminate IkT-001Pro from the 100 mg and 400 mg dosage forms of imatinib mesylate. These alternative dosage forms do not require any manufacturing process development. In terms of bioequivalence, clinical studies completed to date indicate that imatinib delivered by 600 mg and 800 mg IkT-001Pro provide similar exposures to imatinib delivered by 400 mg and 600 mg imatinib mesylate, respectively. Imatinib mesylate is approved for use between 300 mg and 800 mg once daily for 11 blood or stomach cancers. To cover the range of approved doses of imatinib mesylate, the Company plans to study the 1200 mg dose of IkT-001Pro that is expected to lead to exposures equivalent to 800 mg imatinib. The Review Team also suggested the Company analyze how IkT-001Pro and imatinib mesylate behave with respect to certain gut transporters that regulate absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Inhibikase is in alignment with the FDA on this point and is initiating the necessary pre-clinical test to compare IkT-001Pro and imatinib mesylate. The Review Team and Company also agreed on the size of drug substance and drug product batches needed to meet the quality control requirements for approval. The Company will request milestone-based meetings as it completes the manufacturing and quality control processes to ensure the Company and the Review Team remain aligned throughout the process. The Company also continues to evaluate the market potential of IkT-001Pro in non-oncology indications to which imatinib has already been shown to have clinical benefit.Actively enrolling patients in the Phase 2 201 Trial of Risvodetinib (IkT-148009) in untreated Parkinson’s disease: As of March 22, 2024, 73 participants have been enrolled, 20 prospective participants are in medical screening and 48 potential participants are being evaluated for suitability to initiate medical screening. Additionally, 34 participants have completed the 12-week dosing period. 15 mild and 2 moderate adverse events that may have been related to Risvo have been reported thus far in the trial. As the trial remains blinded, it is unknown whether any or how many of these mild or moderate adverse events are actually related to Risvo itself. Depending on the enrollment of the last participant, the Company may report topline results from the 201 Trial in the second half of 2024, including measurement of novel biomarker data as it relates to alpha-synuclein aggregates.Published Phase 1 Results of Risvodetinib in the Journal of Parkinson’s Disease: In January 2024, Inhibikase published the results of its Phase 1 clinical studies with Risvo entitled “A Phase I, Randomized, SAD, MAD, and PK Study of Risvodetinib in Older Adults and Parkinson’s Disease,” online in the peer reviewed Journal of Parkinson’s Disease. The publication highlighted data demonstrating that Risvo was well tolerated up to 7 days of daily dosing with no clinically meaningful events in healthy volunteers or worsening of symptoms in participants taking anti-PD medications. Of note, voluntary lumbar puncture was used to measure the concentration of Risvo in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in six participants with or without PD. Measures of the CSF concentration of Risvo indicate that it crossed the blood-brain barrier and was persistently present in the central nervous system. Full Year 2023 Financial Results Net Loss: Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $19.0 million, or $3.57 per share, compared to a net loss of $18.1 million, or $4.28 per share for the year ended December 31, 2022. R&D Expenses: Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $13.6 million compared to $12.0 million for the full year 2022. The $1.6 million increase was primarily due to a $1.5 million increase in CML expenditures, a decrease of $0.6 million in PD expenses and a net increase of $0.7 million in all other research and development activities. SG&A Expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $6.7 million compared to $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The $0.5 million increase was primarily the result of an increase in investor relations costs of $1.0 million and an increase in employee costs of $0.3 million that were partly offset by a decrease in D&O insurance of $0.6 million, a decrease in legal and consulting fees of $0.4 million and a net increase of $0.2 million in all other selling, general and administrative expenses. Cash Position: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $13.3 million as of December 31, 2023. The Company expects that existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund operations into the first quarter of 2025.

The underwriters will not receive compensation for the shares repurchased by the Company. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The announcement of a secondary public offering by TD SYNNEX Corporation represents a strategic move by the selling stockholders, managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management, to liquidate a portion of their holdings. This activity often indicates a shift in the ownership structure, which can lead to changes in the market's perception of the company's stock. The offering's size, 9 million shares with an option for underwriters to purchase an additional 1.35 million, is substantial and could potentially affect the stock's liquidity and price volatility in the short term.The Concurrent Share Repurchase, capped at $60 million, is a counterbalance to the dilutive effect of the secondary offering, signaling confidence by the company in its stock's value. This buy-back is a common practice used to return value to shareholders, as it can increase earnings per share and improve shareholder equity. Investors will likely monitor how these transactions impact the company's cash reserves, as well as the stock's supply and demand dynamics. Financial Analyst TD SYNNEX's decision not to sell any new shares and not to receive proceeds from the secondary offering suggests a neutral financial impact on the company's balance sheet from the offering itself. However, the repurchase of shares indicates a use of existing cash, which investors should consider in the context of the company's overall liquidity and investment strategy. The repurchase plan's alignment with existing share repurchase programs may be viewed positively, as it reflects a continued commitment to capital return strategies.Investors should also scrutinize the terms of the offering, including the pricing of the shares and the timing, which can provide insights into current market conditions and the perceived value of TD SYNNEX's stock. The involvement of major financial institutions as underwriters and bookrunners adds a layer of credibility to the offering and can facilitate a smoother transaction process. 03/27/2024 - 04:18 PM FREMONT, Calif. & CLEARWATER, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- TD SYNNEX Corporation (NYSE: SNX) (“TD SYNNEX” or the “Company”) today announced a proposed secondary public offering of 9,000,000 shares of its common stock currently held by certain entities managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management, Inc.

Dorad's revenues were approximately NIS 2,722.4 million with an operating profit of around NIS 438.9 million. The financial statements highlight the impact of the war in Israel on Dorad's operations. Positive None. Negative The financial results included in the press release may not be indicative of future full-year results or comparable to past results due to various reasons, including the impact of the war in Israel. The war in Israel, which commenced on October 7, 2023, had adverse effects on economic and business activity, causing disruptions in the supply chain, transportation, personnel shortages, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Energy Sector Financial Analyst The disclosed financial results of Dorad Energy Ltd., in which Ellomay Capital Ltd. has an indirect stake, reflect substantial operating profit and revenue figures, indicative of a robust performance within the energy sector. The seasonal fluctuations in electricity demand, as detailed, are typical for the industry, with heightened consumption in extreme weather conditions. The impact of such seasonality on energy companies is an important factor for investors, as it can significantly affect quarterly earnings and stock performance.Furthermore, the TAOZ tariff system, which adjusts electricity prices based on demand, plays a important role in revenue generation for power companies like Dorad. Higher tariffs during peak seasons can lead to increased profitability, assuming stable operational costs. However, changes in the Israeli CPI and its effect on interest payments highlight the importance of monitoring inflationary trends, as they can erode profit margins.Lastly, the note regarding the 'Iron Swards' war's impact on operations, despite being non-material, demonstrates resilience in Dorad's infrastructure and operational continuity. Nonetheless, the potential long-term effects of such geopolitical tensions on the energy sector should not be underestimated, as they can lead to unpredictable fluctuations in energy supply and costs, thereby affecting future financial performance. Risk Management Specialist The geopolitical risk assessment is critical for investors in the energy sector, particularly in volatile regions. The note on the 'Iron Swards' war provides insight into Dorad's risk exposure and mitigation strategies. The fact that the conflict did not materially affect Dorad's operations suggests a well-implemented risk management framework, capable of handling crises without significant operational disruptions.However, the company's inability to predict the war's medium to long-term impact on its business underscores the inherent uncertainties associated with geopolitical risks. Investors must consider such unpredictability when evaluating the stability and resilience of their energy sector investments. The potential for future conflicts to disrupt supply chains, labor availability and asset values is a concern that requires ongoing monitoring and proactive risk management.Additionally, the currency exchange rate volatility, as a consequence of the conflict, can affect the financial performance of companies like Dorad, which may have international dealings or debt obligations in foreign currencies. This adds another layer of financial risk that companies operating in politically sensitive areas must navigate. Market Research Analyst Analyzing the energy market dynamics in Israel, the reported financials of Dorad, a key player, offer insights into broader market trends. The seasonality of electricity demand, with spikes during extreme weather conditions, is a well-known pattern that energy companies plan for. This directly influences the operational strategy and capacity planning for energy producers.The TAOZ tariff system mentioned aligns with global practices where variable pricing models are used to manage demand and optimize revenue. Understanding the impact of such pricing structures on consumer behavior and overall market demand is essential for forecasting industry trends and company performance.Moreover, the mention of the 'Iron Swards' war, albeit with minimal direct damage, could have broader market implications. Such events can lead to increased regulatory scrutiny, shifts in energy policies, or accelerated investment in energy independence and infrastructure resilience, all of which could reshape the competitive landscape in which Dorad operates. 03/27/2024 - 04:15 PM TEL-AVIV, Israel, March 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Ellomay Capital Ltd. (NYSE American: ELLO) (TASE: ELLO) (""Ellomay"" or the ""Company""), a renewable energy and power generator and developer of renewable energy and power projects in Europe, Israel and the US, today reported the publication in Israel of financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 of Dorad Energy Ltd. (""Dorad""), in which Ellomay currently indirectly holds approximately 9.4% through its indirect 50% ownership of Ellomay Luzon Energy Infrastructures Ltd. (formerly U. Dori Energy Infrastructures Ltd.) (""Ellomay Luzon Energy""). On March 27, 2024, Amos Luzon Entrepreneurship and Energy Group Ltd. (the ""Luzon Group""), an Israeli public company that currently holds the remaining 50% of Ellomay Luzon Energy, which, in turn, holds 18.75% of Dorad, published its annual report in Israel based on the requirements of the Israeli Securities Law, 1968. Based on applicable regulatory requirements, the annual report of the Luzon Group includes the financial statements of Dorad for the same period. The financial statements of Dorad for the year ended December 31, 2023 were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. Ellomay will include its indirect share of these results (through its holdings in Ellomay Luzon Energy) in its financial results and financial statements for this period. In an effort to provide Ellomay's shareholders with access to Dorad's financial results (which were published in Hebrew), Ellomay hereby provides an English version of Dorad's financial results. Dorad Financial Highlights Dorad's revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 – approximately NIS 2,722.4 million.Dorad's operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2023 – approximately NIS 438.9 million.Based on the information provided by Dorad, the demand for electricity by Dorad's customers is seasonal and is affected by, inter alia, the climate prevailing in that season. Since January 1, 2023, the months of the year are split into three seasons as follows: the summer season – the months of June, July, August and September; the winter season - the months of December, January and February; and intermediate seasons – (spring and autumn), the months from March to May and from October to November. There is a higher demand for electricity during the winter and summer seasons, and the average electricity consumption is higher in these seasons than in the intermediate seasons and is even characterized by peak demands due to extreme climate conditions of heat or cold. In addition, Dorad's revenues are affected by the change in load and time tariffs - TAOZ (an electricity tariff that varies across seasons and across the day in accordance with demand hour clusters), as, on average, TAOZ tariffs are higher in the summer season than in the intermediate and winter seasons. Due to various reasons, including the effects of the increase in the Israeli CPI impacting interest payments by Dorad on its credit facility, the results included herein may not be indicative of full year results in the future or comparable to full year results in the past. The financial statements of Dorad include a note concerning the impact of the war in Israel, which commenced on October 7, 2023, on Dorad's operations. The note states that the ""Iron Swards"" war commenced on October 7, 2023, by a surprise attack by the Hamas terror organization against the State of Israel, following which a substantial recruitment of reserves was made and the State of Israel declared a war situation. During the days of fighting, thousands of rockets were launched towards the State of Israel, and shrapnel landed several times in the area of the Dorad power plant and caused immaterial damage to property and equipment, but did not impact the ongoing operation of the power plant. The security situation resulted in a decrease in the scope of economic and business activity in Israel and caused, among other things, a disruption in the supply and production chain, a decrease in the scope of national transportation, a shortage of personnel, a decrease in the value of financial assets and an increase in the exchange rate of foreign currencies relative to the NIS. Due to the war and in accordance with notifications provided by the Israeli Ministry of Energy to the operator of the ""Tamar"" natural gas field, the natural gas extraction from the reservoir was temporarily halted and thereafter renewed. This did not have a material impact on Dorad's operations, which continued operating the power plant based on natural gas purchased from Energean Israel Ltd. Dorad estimated, based on the information it had as of February 29, 2024 (the date of approval of Dorad's financial statements as of December 31, 2023), that the current events and the security escalation in Israel have an impact on its results but that the impact on its short-term business results will be immaterial. Dorad further notes that as this event is not under the control of Dorad, and factors such as the continuation of the war and hostilities or their cessation may affect Dorad's assessments, as of the date of the financial statements, Dorad had no ability to assess the extent of the impact of the war on its business activity and its medium and long-term results. Dorad continues to regularly monitor the developments and examine the effects on its operations and the value of its assets. An English version of the financial results for Dorad as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and for each of the three years ended December 31, 2023 is included at the end of this press release. Ellomay does not undertake to separately report Dorad's financial results in a press release in the future. Neither Ellomay nor its independent public accountants have reviewed or consulted with the Luzon Group, Ellomay Luzon Energy or Dorad with respect to the financial results included in this press release.

The Construction business faced challenges with deferred projects and a charge-off related to excess materials billings.

Investment gain (loss) from the non-operating investment portfolio increased slightly compared to the previous year. 03/27/2024 - 04:15 PM ST. LOUIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Marketing Alliance, Inc. (OTC: MAAL) (“TMA” or the “Company”), announced its financial results today for its fiscal 2024 third quarter ended December 31, 2023. Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Financial Key Items (all comparisons to the prior year period) Operating income from continuing operations of $615,317 compared to $849,467, as operating income was adversely affected by less general activity in the Construction business and a $143,629 charge-off due to a reconciliation at the end of a job lasting multiple years. Revenues were $4,738,004 compared to $4,757,329, where an increase in Insurance distribution revenue was offset by a comparable decline in Construction revenues. Net income was $766,105, or $0.09 per share compared to $1,000,743, or $0.12 per share. Management Comments Timothy M. Klusas, TMA’s Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Our third quarter fiscal year 2024 results were largely the result of three factors which drove our performance. First, our Insurance distribution business had a quarter marked by increased revenues and top-line growth. Our Insurance distribution business also benefited again this quarter from more reversals of the adverse timing of fee revenues that were mentioned earlier this year. As we progress through the year, we feel the year-to-date results have become more comparable to the prior year. Although our Business processing and distributor costs were up this quarter due to the introduction and implementation of new projects, our operating expenses (Total general and administrative expenses) were down company–wide due to successful cost savings initiatives, which was the second factor that drove our performance. Also, although not included in operating income, the Company also benefited from a reversal in a prior period holdback, which is listed as Other income.” Mr. Klusas added, “Our Construction business had a good start to the year, but anticipated planned projects did not materialize in this quarter and some projects were deferred to next year. Finally, as we completed a large project that was started last year and finished this year, we found excess materials billings that totaled $143,629 and upon realization, promptly reversed the charge. It seemed that the error was made moving materials between seasons (fiscal years) and why we, again, always stress looking at the business over an extended period such as the combination of the previous year and this year taking this adjustment into account. The reduction in construction activity and related charge-off this quarter combined to be the third factor that dominated our quarterly performance.” Fiscal Third Quarter 2024 Financial Review Revenues were $4,738,004 compared to $4,757,329, with an increase in Insurance Distribution revenues offset by less Construction revenues, including the charge-off of materials billings discussed above. Net operating revenue (gross profit) for the quarter was $1,295,497, compared to net operating revenue of $1,711,262 in the prior-year fiscal period. The decline in net operating revenue was due primarily to factors mentioned above, but before including the benefit of a company-wide reduction in general and administrative costs. Operating expenses decreased to $680,180, compared to $861,795 for the prior year period, as a result of cost savings initiatives executed by the Company. The Company reported operating income from continuing operations of $615,317 compared to $849,467 in the prior year period, with differences due to factors discussed above. Operating EBITDA (excluding investment portfolio income) decreased to $694,540 this quarter from $914,611 in the prior year period. A note reconciling operating EBITDA to operating income can be found at the end of this release. Investment gain (loss), net (from non-operating investment portfolio) for the quarter was $314,271, as compared with $267,422 during the same period the previous year. Net income was $766,105 or $0.09 per share compared to $1,000,743 or $0.12 per share. Balance Sheet Information TMA’s balance sheet on December 31, 2023, reflected cash and cash equivalents of $2.2 million; working capital of $6.6 million; and shareholders’ equity of $6.7 million; compared to cash and cash equivalents of $2.5 million, working capital of $7.0 million, and shareholders’ equity of $7.0 million as of March 31, 2023.

The Company uses Operating EBITDA as a measure of operating performance. However, Operating EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and when analyzing its operating performance, investors should use Operating EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, income as determined in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, its presentation of Operating EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies and is therefore limited as a comparative measure. Furthermore, as an analytical tool, Operating EBITDA has additional limitations, including that (a) it is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax payments; (b) it does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, its working capital needs; and (c) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future, and Operating EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. To compensate for these limitations, the Company evaluates its profitability by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with its analysis of cash flows from operations and through the use of other financial measures. The Company believes Operating EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating its operating performance because it is widely used to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to certain non-cash or unrealized expenses (such as depreciation and amortization) and expenses that are not reflective of its core operating results over time. The Company believes Operating EBITDA presents a meaningful measure of corporate performance exclusive of its capital structure, the method by which assets were acquired and non-cash charges and provides additional useful information to measure performance on a consistent basis, particularly with respect to changes in performance from period to period.

Reports 2023 Full Year and Fourth Quarter Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Drilling Tools International Corp. (NASDAQ: DTI) reported its 2023 full year results and provided a promising 2024 full year outlook. The company's revenue reached $152 million, with net income at $14.7 million and adjusted EBITDA of $51 million. DTI aims to more than double its adjusted free cash flow in 2024, supported by strategic acquisitions and a strong rental model. Positive DTI's 2023 full year results showcased revenue of $152 million, net income of $14.7 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $51 million. The company plans to significantly increase its adjusted free cash flow in 2024, building on successful strategic acquisitions and a robust rental model. DTI's acquisitions of Superior Drilling Products, Inc. and Deep Casing Tools, along with strengthening its balance sheet, position the company for growth and shareholder value enhancement. With over 65,000 rental tools in its fleet, DTI aims to support customers' drilling and producing activities efficiently, backed by a strong market presence in North America and the Gulf of Mexico. The company's M&A framework and pipeline indicate a strategic consolidation in the oilfield service rental tool industry, focusing on expansion in Europe and the Middle East to drive innovation and market growth. Negative DTI's adjusted free cash flow decreased in 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher capital expenditures, impacting shareholder returns. Operating expenses rose in 2023, driven by costs related to going public and increased administrative expenses. The industry's second half rig count and market activity declines in 2023 affected DTI's financial performance, leading to a decrease in adjusted free cash flow. DTI's 2023 operating income and adjusted free cash flow were lower than the previous year, primarily due to increased capital expenditure to meet customer demand and future growth. Financial Analyst The full year outlook provided by Drilling Tools International Corp. (DTI) suggests a significant increase in adjusted free cash flow, which is a key indicator of financial health. This projection may indicate that DTI is expecting operational efficiency improvements or a reduction in capital expenditures relative to its cash earnings. Investors often look at free cash flow as it represents the cash a company can generate after accounting for capital expenditures needed to maintain or expand its asset base, which is important for paying dividends, repurchasing shares, or investing in new projects.Additionally, the expansion of the ABL Credit Facility and the new term loan with PNC Bank could signal a strategic move to leverage debt financing to fuel growth without diluting shareholder equity. However, it's essential to monitor the cost of capital and the company's ability to service this debt, especially in an industry subject to volatile commodity prices. The increased borrowing capacity and improved interest rates, along with the removal of certain financial covenants, provide DTI with greater financial flexibility to pursue its growth strategy and M&A activities. Market Research Analyst DTI's focus on a rental model for downhole tools in the oilfield services sector is a strategic choice that may provide resilience during periods of market volatility. By maintaining a fleet of rental tools rather than selling capital-intensive equipment, DTI can quickly adapt to changing market demands and potentially reduce fixed costs. This agility is particularly advantageous in the oil and gas industry, where drilling activities fluctuate with commodity prices.The company's recent acquisitions and its emphasis on expanding its presence in Europe and the Middle East suggest a targeted approach to growth. By broadening its geographic footprint and enhancing its product offerings, DTI is working to diversify its revenue streams and mitigate the risks associated with dependence on a single market. The success of these initiatives will likely hinge on the company's ability to integrate acquisitions effectively and capitalize on synergies. Energy Sector Analyst DTI's performance and strategy must be analyzed within the context of the broader energy sector, particularly the oilfield services market. The company's robust results, despite a declining rig count in the second half of 2023, suggest that it has managed to maintain its market share and possibly benefit from increased drilling efficiency. The oilfield services industry is notoriously cyclical and DTI's ability to scale operations and deploy rental tools across multiple locations could provide a buffer against these cycles.However, the sector is also facing a long-term transition towards renewable energy sources and companies within this space will need to navigate this shift. DTI's focus on innovative solutions through acquisitions could be part of a strategy to remain competitive in a changing landscape. Investors should consider the potential long-term implications of energy transition policies on the demand for oilfield services when evaluating DTI's future prospects. 03/27/2024 - 04:15 PM Company Provides 2024 Full Year Outlook Estimated adjusted free cash flow to more than double in 2024 HOUSTON, March 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Drilling Tools International Corp., (NASDAQ: DTI) (""DTI"" or the ""Company""), a global oilfield services company that manufactures and provides a differentiated, rental-focused offering of tools for use in onshore and offshore horizontal and directional drilling operations, today reported its 2023 full year results and provided its 2024 full year outlook. 2023 Full Year Highlights Revenue $152 million Net Income $14.7 million Adjusted EBITDA(1) $51 million Adjusted EBITDA Margin(1) 33.6 % Adjusted Free Cash Flow(1)(2) $7.3 million Wayne Prejean, CEO of DTI, stated, ""We are pleased to report that after only eight months as a public company, we are successfully implementing the strategic plans we outlined during our public offering. On top of reporting robust results for 2023, we have been extremely active since year end by: 1) entering into a definitive agreement to acquire Superior Drilling Products, Inc. (NYSE American: SDPI) (""SDP""); 2) closing the acquisition of Deep Casing Tools; and 3) improving liquidity and strengthening our balance sheet by amending and extending our ABL Credit Facility. This provides for a revolving line of credit in a principal amount of up to $80 million and a single draw term loan in a principal amount of $25 million, both maturing in March 2029, to further support our growth strategy. ""As a market leader in providing downhole tool rentals for both North American land and Gulf of Mexico deepwater drilling operations, DTI's extensive rental model, broad distribution capabilities and diverse customer base across multiple basins provides us with a significant competitive advantage and through-cycle outperformance, especially during volatile commodity price cycles. In contrast to larger capital-intensive equipment companies in the oilfield services sector, our rental tools are easily deployable to various locations to serve our clients' needs. We believe the ability to scale our operations as needed across our extensive footprint allows us to better support customers in the field, and, with over 65,000 rental tools in our fleet, we are well positioned to support our customers' complex drilling and producing activities."" Prejean continued, ""Additionally, we have established an M&A framework and robust M&A pipeline that will allow us to selectively and strategically consolidate the oilfield service rental tool industry. Our recent acquisition of Deep Casing Tools and our pending acquisition of SDP are outstanding examples of how we are expanding DTI's growth opportunities, both domestically and internationally, with a particular focus on our presence in Europe and the Middle East. We are confident that these and future acquisitions will drive innovation, expand our footprint and addressable market, enhance our product offerings, and, as a result, increase shareholder value."" Selected 2023 Financial and Operating Results DTI generated total consolidated revenue of $152 million in 2023, an increase of 17.4% compared to 2022. 2023 Tool Rental net revenue was $119.2 million, an increase of 20.4% compared to 2022 due to a strong first half performance and maintaining a solid market share despite a declining rig count in the second half of 2023. 2023 Product Sales net revenue totaled $32.8 million, an increase of 7.4% compared to 2022. The increase was driven by a strong first half as well as ongoing tool recovery revenue which occurs as part of the rental tool lifecycle. 2023 operating expenses were $124.1 million compared to $104.3 million in 2022, resulting from the added costs of going public as well as additional administrative and compliance expenses. 2023 operating income was $27.9 million, compared to $25.3 million in 2022. 2023 Adjusted EBITDA(1) was $51.0 million, compared to $41.2 million in 2022. 2023 Adjusted free cash flow(1)(2) was $7.3 million, compared to $16.5 million in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to approximately $19 million more capital expenditure dollars spent in 2023 compared to 2022. This increased investment was needed to meet customer demand for new products and future growth. 2023 fourth quarter results reflected the industry's continued second half rig count and market activity declines. DTI was able to scale back on capital expenditures in order to meet its adjusted free cash flow target of $6 to $8 million, defined as Adjusted EBITDA less Gross Capital Expenditures, which is a unique lever at its disposal to generate returns in lieu of growth. Management views this metric as a good measure of the overall performance of its business. At December 31, 2023, DTI had $6 million of cash and cash equivalents and no debt. Subsequent to year end, on March 18, 2024, DTI announced that it completed an amendment to its existing Amended and Restated Senior Secured Asset‑Based Revolving Credit, Security and Guaranty Agreement, with PNC Business Credit, a division of PNC Bank. This ABL Amendment, among other provisions, increased the borrowing capacity from $60 million to $80 million, improved its interest rate and removed certain restrictive financial covenants. The maturity date of the ABL Credit Facility was extended to March 2029. Additionally, DTI entered into a new $25 million term loan with PNC to further support its growth strategy. The Term Loan also matures in March 2029. 2024 Outlook ""Looking forward, we are excited about our market opportunities and expect to more than double our adjusted free cash flow in 2024 as we prepare for increased market-driven demand for our rental tools and services for the remainder of the decade,"" added Prejean. ""Additionally, while our growth has historically been tied to rig count, we have aligned our business to be positively impacted by the trend of longer laterals being drilled in multi-well pads. Our customers benefit from efficiencies and lower drilling costs when using our proprietary and technologically advanced rental tools. ""Our full-year 2024 outlook below includes the recent Deep Casing Tools acquisition's estimated impact on 2024 results, but does not include any contribution from the pending acquisition of Superior Drilling Products. We will update 2024 guidance to include SDP once we close the transaction,"" concluded Prejean. Full Year 2024 Revenue $170 million - $185 million Net Income $15 million - $21 million Adjusted EBITDA(1) $50 million - $58.5 million Adjusted EBITDA Margin(1) 29 % - 32 % Adjusted Free Cash Flow(1)(2) $20 million - $25.5 million (1) Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and Adjusted Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures.

Each of the metrics are ""non-GAAP financial measures"" as defined in Regulation G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of net earnings or cash flows as determined by GAAP. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted for (i) goodwill and/or long-lived asset impairment charges, (ii) stock-based compensation expense, (iii) restructuring charges, (iv) transaction and integration costs related to acquisitions and (v) other expenses or charges to exclude certain items that we believe are not reflective of ongoing performance of our business. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows us to supplement the GAAP measures in order to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We exclude the items listed above in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP, or as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDA. Our computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure, and we define Adjusted Free Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA less Gross Capital Expenditures. We use Adjusted Free Cash Flow as a financial performance measure used for planning, forecasting, and evaluating our performance. We believe that Adjusted Free Cash Flow is useful to enable investors and others to perform comparisons of current and historical performance of the Company. As a performance measure, rather than a liquidity measure, the most closely comparable GAAP measure is net income (loss). The following tables present a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the periods indicated: Drilling Tools International Corp.

LENDINGTREE ANNOUNCES $175 MILLION FINANCING FROM APOLLO FUNDS,2024-03-27T20:15:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,LendingTree secures $175 million financing from Apollo Funds to strengthen its financial position and support growth.,"LENDINGTREE ANNOUNCES $175 MILLION FINANCING FROM APOLLO FUNDS Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary LendingTree secures $175 million financing from Apollo Funds to strengthen its financial position and support growth. Positive LendingTree secures up to $175 million in financing from Apollo affiliates. The financing is in the form of a first lien term loan facility. LendingTree intends to draw $125 million initially, with the remainder available as a delayed draw. Funds will be used for general corporate purposes, including debt repayment. The CFO sees this financing as a critical step in the growth trajectory of the business. Apollo Funds' support aims to enhance LendingTree's financial flexibility in the current market environment. Negative None. Financial Analyst LendingTree's announcement of securing a significant term loan facility indicates a strategic move to strengthen its financial standing. The infusion of capital through debt financing is a common practice, especially for businesses aiming to leverage opportunities without diluting shareholder equity. The immediate drawdown of $125 million suggests immediate liquidity needs or strategic financial obligations, such as debt repayment or investment in growth initiatives. The availability of additional funds with a delayed draw option provides a cushion for unforeseen expenditures or investment opportunities that may arise.However, securing debt also implies an increase in the company's leverage. Stakeholders should monitor the company's debt-to-equity ratio and interest coverage ratios post-funding to assess the impact on financial health. Moreover, the terms of the loan, including interest rates and covenants, are important in evaluating the cost of capital and the company's flexibility in managing its finances. If the loan terms are favorable, it could signal confidence from the lender in LendingTree's business model and future prospects. Market Research Analyst The partnership with Apollo Funds is a testament to LendingTree's potential in the online financial services marketplace. The company's focus on streamlining operations and innovating for customers and partners is pivotal in maintaining a competitive edge. The financial flexibility gained from this loan could enable LendingTree to invest in technology, expand service offerings, or enter new markets, which could drive user growth and enhance revenue streams.However, it's important to consider the broader market context. The financial services sector is subject to regulatory changes, economic cycles and competitive pressures. LendingTree's ability to navigate these factors, along with effectively deploying the secured funds, will be critical in determining the long-term impact of this financial move on its market position and stock performance. Economist In the current economic climate, where interest rates and market conditions are volatile, LendingTree's decision to secure financing could be seen as a preemptive measure to mitigate risks associated with a tightening credit market. The company's proactive approach to fortify its balance sheet may provide a buffer against potential downturns or credit squeezes. Additionally, the move can be interpreted as a signal of LendingTree's expectations for economic conditions and its confidence in its business model.Access to capital at this juncture allows for strategic flexibility and could be beneficial if the economy faces headwinds, as it ensures that LendingTree can maintain operations and seize growth opportunities without the pressure of immediate financial constraints. This could be particularly advantageous if competitors are less prepared for a challenging economic environment. 03/27/2024 - 04:15 PM CHARLOTTE, N.C., March 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- LendingTree, Inc.

(JEF) reported Q1 financial highlights with net earnings of $150 million, or $0.66 per diluted common share. Adjusted for a pre-tax loss of $55 million, net earnings from continuing operations were $196 million. Investment Banking net revenues were $740 million, Capital Markets net revenues were $712 million, and Asset Management net revenues were $288 million. The company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share. Positive Solid Q1 performance with net earnings of $150 million for Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (JEF). Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations were $196 million after a $55 million pre-tax loss. Investment Banking net revenues reached $740 million, Capital Markets net revenues were $712 million, and Asset Management net revenues were $288 million. Annualized return on adjusted tangible total equity from continuing operations was 12.0%. Jefferies declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share. Investment Banking net revenues increased by 28.2% from the prior quarter and 31.4% from the same quarter last year. Capital Markets net revenues rose by 47.9% from the prior quarter and 8.8% versus the same quarter last year. Asset Management net revenues were $30 million lower due to the Weiss loss. Book value per common share was $46.13 and tangible book value per fully diluted share was $30.89 at February 29, 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported net earnings of $150 million, or $0.66 per diluted common share, by Jefferies Financial Group Inc. indicates a solid fiscal performance, particularly when considering the adjusted net earnings from continuing operations of $196 million, or $0.87 per diluted common share, which excludes the pre-tax loss from the Weiss investment. This adjusted figure is a more accurate reflection of the company's core operational efficiency and profitability.Moreover, the increase in Investment Banking net revenues by 28.2% from the previous quarter and 31.4% from the same quarter last year is significant. It suggests that Jefferies is not only capitalizing on current market conditions but also effectively gaining market share. The robust pipeline in Investment Banking and the positive outlook for future quarters could signal continued growth for the company, potentially influencing investor sentiment.However, the impact of the Weiss loss on Asset Management net revenues, which decreased by $30 million, should be monitored as it reflects the risks associated with investment activities. While the company has managed the situation with Weiss orderly, investors should consider the potential for similar occurrences and the associated risk management practices of Jefferies. Market Research Analyst Jefferies' third-best Capital Markets quarter ever, with net revenues of $712 million, showcases the company's strength in this segment. The 47.9% increase from the prior quarter and 8.8% from the same quarter last year highlight a consistent performance that is likely to inspire confidence among stakeholders. This strong showing, coupled with the company's strategic alliance with SMBC, could enhance Jefferies' competitive positioning and lead to further expansion and diversification of services.It is also worth noting the substantial increase in Asset Management net revenues, which rose by 299% compared to the same period last year. This remarkable growth, driven by improved performance across investment strategies and funds, indicates a successful diversification of Jefferies' asset management portfolio. However, the concentration of losses from Weiss raises questions about the volatility and risk exposure of the asset management segment. Economist The reported annualized return on adjusted tangible total equity from continuing operations of 9.8% and 12.0% when adjusted for the Weiss loss, is a critical indicator of Jefferies' capital efficiency. While these returns are in line with industry norms, it is essential to consider the broader economic context, such as interest rate trends and inflationary pressures, which could impact the company's cost of capital and investment returns. The effective tax rate of 25.4% is also an important factor as it affects net income and available cash for reinvestment or distribution to shareholders.Furthermore, the repurchase of 1.1 million common shares at an average price of $40.63 per share reflects the company's confidence in its intrinsic value. This buyback activity could be a positive signal to the market, suggesting that management believes the shares are undervalued. However, investors should weigh the opportunity cost of these buybacks against potential investments in growth opportunities. 03/27/2024 - 04:15 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE: JEF) Q1 Financial Highlights Net earnings attributable to common shareholders of $150 million, or $0.66 per diluted common share, and net earnings attributable to common shareholders from continuing operations of $157 million, or $0.69 per diluted common share. Adjusting our results this quarter for a pre-tax loss of $55 million associated with our investment in Weiss Multi-Strategy Advisers, which recently announced it is closing down, our net earnings attributable to common shareholders from continuing operations was $196 million16, or $0.8716 per diluted common share. Of the pre-tax loss to us of $55 million, $30 million reduced our Asset Management net revenues and $25 million increased our non-compensation expenses. Annualized return on adjusted tangible total equity from continuing operations1 of 9.8%. Adjusting for the impact of the loss on Weiss, our annualized return on adjusted tangible total equity from continuing operations was 12.0%1 Net revenues of $1.74 billion Investment Banking net revenues of $740 million Capital Markets net revenues of $712 million, our third best Capital Markets quarter ever Asset Management net revenues (before allocated net interest4) of $288 million, which was $30 million lower due to the Weiss loss At February 29, 2024, we had 212.0 million common shares outstanding and 253.5 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis2. Our book value per common share was $46.13 and tangible book value per fully diluted share3 was $30.89 at February 29, 2024 “Our Q1 results reflect solid performance across our businesses and our Investment Banking pipeline continues to strengthen, which leads us to believe a more robust market is developing. Our strong results in Capital Markets has continued into the current quarter. We are pleased that, adjusting for the impact of the net loss on Weiss, we generated an annualized return on adjusted tangible equity from continuing operations of 12.0% and net earnings from continuing operations of $0.87 per diluted common share. This bodes well for the balance of 2024, especially as we expect our recent significant hires to increasingly contribute to our results. “Investment Banking net revenues for the quarter were $740 million, up 28.2% from the prior quarter and 31.4% from the same quarter last year, primarily due to improved mergers and acquisitions and equity underwriting activity reflecting our market share gains against modest improvement in the market. Capital Markets continued its strong performance, with net revenues of $712 million, up 47.9% from the prior quarter and 8.8% versus the same quarter last year. We expect our Investment Banking momentum to continue, and the market share gains we have achieved compared to the prior quarter and prior year quarter across Advisory, Equity underwriting and Leveraged finance to continue, as the investments we have made in our business further mature. Furthermore, we are extremely pleased with our alliance with SMBC, which continues to gain traction and is additive to our business model and prospects. We believe we will further expand our cooperation to additional regions and further areas of mutual opportunity. “Asset Management also performed well, as we are seeing improved performance from our diversified platform of offerings. We are disappointed in the outcome at Weiss Multi-Strategy, but we are pleased that the shutdown was orderly and investors protected. Our loss is a result of support we provided the platform that was incremental to our separately managed account."" Richard Handler, CEO, and Brian Friedman, President Quarterly Cash Dividend The Jefferies Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend equal to $0.30 per Jefferies common share, payable on May 30, 2024 to record holders of Jefferies common shares on May 20, 2024.

We had 212.0 million common shares outstanding and 253.5 million common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis2 at February 29, 2024. Our book value per common share was $46.13 and tangible book value per fully diluted share3 was $30.89 at February 29, 2024. Effective tax rate of 25.4% Investment Banking and Capital Markets Investment Banking net revenues of $740 million were higher than the prior year comparable period driven by improved performance across advisory, and equity and debt underwriting. Advisory net revenues were higher than the same quarter last year, attributable to increased mergers and acquisitions volume and continued market share gains. Underwriting net revenues of $338 million increased from the same quarter last year, as equity underwriting experienced periods of increased activity, as equity markets remained robust, as well as our expanded capabilities and enhanced market position. Debt underwriting activity improved as interest rates and inflationary concerns have stabilized. Capital Markets net revenues of $712 million were higher compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to stronger performance in Equities attributable to increased volumes and more favorable trading opportunities, while Fixed Income net revenues remained consistent from the comparable prior year. Asset Management Asset Management net revenues of $273 million were substantially higher than the prior year period as Investment return net revenues improved due to strong performance across multiple investment strategies and funds. In addition, Other investments15 net revenues for the quarter were meaningfully higher than the prior year largely due to the consolidation of Stratos and Tessellis (which resulted in increased revenues offset by an increase in expenses). * * * * Amounts herein pertaining to February 29, 2024 represent a preliminary estimate as of the date of this earnings release and may be revised upon filing our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

Allocated net interest represents an allocation to Asset Management of certain of our long-term debt interest expense, net of interest income on our Cash and cash equivalents and other sources of liquidity. Allocated net interest has been disaggregated to increase transparency and to present direct Asset Management revenues. We believe that aggregating Allocated net interest would obscure the revenue results by including an amount that is unique to our credit spreads, debt maturity profile, capital structure, liquidity risks and allocation methods. Allocated net interest is not separately disaggregated for Investment Banking and Capital Markets. This presentation is aligned to our Investment Banking and Capital Markets internal performance measurement. Asset management fees and revenues include management and performance fees from funds and accounts managed by us as well as our share of fees received by affiliated asset management companies with which we have revenue and profit share arrangements, as well as earnings on our ownership interest in affiliated asset managers. Number of trading loss days is calculated based on trading activities in our Investment Banking and Capital Markets and Asset Management business segments, excluding certain Other investments. VaR estimates the potential loss in value of trading positions due to adverse market movements over a one-day time horizon with a 95% confidence level. For a further discussion of the calculation of VaR, see ""Value-at-Risk"" in Part II, Item 7A ""Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk"" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2023. Amounts pertaining to February 29, 2024 represent a preliminary estimate as of the date of this earnings release and may be revised in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended February 29, 2024. Level 3 financial instruments represent those financial instruments classified as such under Accounting Standards Codification 820, accounted for at fair value and included within Financial instruments owned. Tangible shareholders' equity (a non-GAAP financial measure) is defined as shareholders' equity less Intangible assets and goodwill. We believe that tangible shareholders' equity is meaningful for valuation purposes, as financial companies are often measured as a multiple of tangible shareholders' equity, making these ratios meaningful for investors. Leverage ratio equals total assets divided by total equity. Tangible gross leverage ratio (a non-GAAP financial measure) equals total assets less goodwill and intangible assets divided by tangible shareholders' equity. The tangible gross leverage ratio is used by rating agencies in assessing our leverage ratio. During the third quarter of 2023, we refined our allocated net interest methodology to better reflect net interest expense across our business units based on use of capital. As a result, the presentation of Net revenues and Net revenues by source has been recast to conform with the revised methodology. Beginning in fiscal 2024, we now refer to ""Merchant banking"" as “Other investments” in our Asset Management reportable segment. Represents a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to schedule on page 10 for a reconciliation to U.S. GAAP amounts. Non-GAAP Reconciliations The following tables reconcile our non-GAAP financial measures to their respective U.S. GAAP financial measures. Management believes such non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors as they allow them to view our results through the eyes of management, while facilitating a comparison across historical periods. These measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

(""Nexa Resources"" or ""Nexa"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE Symbol:NEXA) announces its 2023 Year-End Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources (""MRMR"") relating to its operations and projects located in Peru and Brazil.Commenting on the MRMR update, Ignacio Rosado, CEO of Nexa Resources, said ""Our mineral exploration program in 2023 was focused on identifying new mineralized zones in our operating mines including Aripuanã, where significant results from the Babaçu infill drilling program defined new Mineral Reserves, and increased Mineral Resources.As a major polymetallic mine operator and the 5th largest zinc producer worldwide, Nexa has a unique portfolio of operating mines with excellent exploration potential and a pipeline of greenfield exploration projects. In 2024, our mineral exploration program will remain focused on the replacement of Mineral Reserves and upgrading Mineral Resources through infill drilling campaigns.""2023 Year-End Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources HighlightsMineral Reserves Note: ""Addition"" refers to new tonnages from brownfield and infill drilling and ""Revision"" refers to changes in Mineral Reserves due to changes in mine design, changes in economic parameters, leading to a model review and update. Reserve numbers refer to zinc mines and projects.As of December 31, 2023, Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves estimates amounted to 110.4 million tonnes containing 4,031kt of zinc (at higher average zinc grade) compared with 100.6 million tonnes containing 3,540kt of zinc as of December 31, 2022. The increase was mainly driven by infill and brownfield drilling at Aripuanã, partially offset by mining production depletion. Nexa's 2023 Year-End Mineral Reserves estimate also reflects changes in continuous refining of its geological modelling. Another addition to Mineral Reserves is the re-inclusion of the Atacocha Mineral Reserves from the underground and open pit mines, which were not included in 2022. Positive results from the Cerro Pasco Integration Project economic study carried out during 2023 support the declaration of Mineral Reserves. The Pasco Integration Project is designed to further integrate the Atacocha and El Porvenir mines to increase production and extend mine life by eliminating the main bottlenecks in each operation, increasing mill capacity, and opening up additional exploration potential including at the integration mineralized body.The net revision of -34kt of zinc was primarily due to the increase in cut-off at Aripuanã (-140kt) balanced by stope layout and cut-off revisions at Cerro Lindo, and El Porvenir (106kt).The Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves at the Cerro Lindo Mine were estimated to total 41.15Mt at 1.49% Zn, 0.22% Pb, 0.55% Cu and 22.6 g/t Ag as of December 31, 2023, a 0.7% decrease from 41.43Mt at 1.57% Zn, 0.22% Pb, 0.59% Cu and 22.5 g/t Ag as of December 31, 2022. The decrease was the result of mining production depletion during 2023, balanced by infill drilling in mine extensions (+23kt of zinc), and stope layout and cut-off revisions (+28kt of zinc). Mineral Reserve depletion during 2023 accounted for -5.98Mt containing 90kt of zinc.The Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves at the Vazante Mine were estimated to total 11.33Mt at 9.62% Zn, 0.21% Pb, and 13.8 g/t Ag as of December 31, 2023, down 16% from 13.50Mt at 9.64% Zn, 0.27% Pb and 15.2 g/t Ag as of December 31, 2022. The decrease was the result of mining production depletion during 2023, and geotechnical revision at Lumiadeira area (-28kt of contained zinc). Mineral Reserve depletion during 2023 accounted for -1.70Mt containing 184kt of zinc. In 2023, Nexa added 2.11Mt of Probable Mineral Reserves with 87kt of contained zinc from the Aroeira tailings deposit after a hydrogeological and environmental study.The Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves at the El Porvenir Mine were estimated to total 14.65Mt at 4.11% Zn, 1.20% Pb, 0.23% Cu and 72.9 g/t Ag as of December 31, 2023, a 5.5% decrease from 15.50Mt at 3.60% Zn, 1.07% Pb, 0.19% Cu and 66.0 g/t Ag as of December 31, 2022. The decrease is the balance result from mining depletion, and the addition of 106kt of contained zinc from stope layout and model revision. Mineral Reserve depletion during 2023 accounted for -2.20Mt containing 62kt of zinc.The Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves at the Atacocha (Underground) Mine were estimated to total 5.66Mt at 4.33% Zn, 1.34% Pb, 0.40% Cu, 79.8 g/t Ag, and 0.07g/t Au as of December 31, 2023. The Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves at the Atacocha (Open Pit) Mine were estimated to total 4.38Mt at 0.99% Zn, 1.15% Pb, 34.9 g/t Ag, and 0.27g/t Au as of December 31, 2023.The Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves at the Aripuanã Mine were estimated to total 31.07Mt at 4.35% Zn, 1.66% Pb, 0.15% Cu, 40.6 g/t Ag and 0.22 g/t Au as of December 31, 2023, a 3.2% increase from 30.12Mt at 3.42% Zn, 1.25% Pb, 0.17% Cu, 32.1 g/t Ag and 0.23 g/t Au as of December 31, 2022. The Babaçu infill drilling program carried out during 2023 provided new Probable Mineral Reserves of 9.10Mt at 5.56% Zn, 2.19% Pb, 0.11% Cu, 49.6 g/t Ag, and 0.14g/t Au as of December 31, 2023, totaling an increase of 506kt of contained zinc in the reserves. We reported a loss of -140kt of contained zinc due to an increase in cut-off impacting mostly low-grade ores. Mineral Reserve depletion during 2023 accounted for -1.56Mt containing 44kt of zinc.Mineral Resources Note: ""Addition"" refers to new tonnages from brownfield and greenfield drilling and ""Revision"" refers to changes in Mineral Resources due to changes in reclassification, mine design, changes in economic parameters, leading to a model review and update. Mineral Resource numbers refer to zinc mines and projects.As of December 31, 2023, Nexa estimated Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources (exclusive of Mineral Reserves) were 3,259kt of contained zinc compared with 3,432kt as of December 31, 2022. The Addition and Revision accounted for a net decrease of -173kt of contained zinc mostly due to conversion of Mineral Resources to Mineral Reserves at Aripuanã after the Babaçu infill drilling, and at the Atacocha (Underground) and Atacocha (Open Pit) Mines following the Pasco Integration Project study.At Vazante Aroeira tailings, a hydrogeologic and environmental study resulted in conversion of 108kt of contained zinc from Indicated Mineral Resources to Mineral Reserves. At the Atacocha (Underground) and Atacocha (Open Pit) Mines, the Pasco Integration Project accounted for a -175kt and -44kt reduction in contained zinc, respectively, after conversion to Mineral Reserves.As of December 31, 2023, Nexa estimated Inferred Mineral Resources of 6,897kt of contained zinc, compared with the total of 6,626kt at the end of 2022. The addition of 543kt of contained zinc was mostly incorporated through the Babaçu drilling at Aripuanã. The net revision reduction of -271kt of contained zinc is mostly due to model revisions and reclassification at Vazante and conversion of Inferred Mineral Resources to Mineral Reserves at Babaçu.Exploration OutlookOur exploration strategy for 2024 is aimed at focusing on Mineral Resource expansion through brownfield and infill drilling near operating mines and extension drilling on advanced projects.A total of 66,050 meters of drilling is planned for 2024, including 42,100 meters in Peru (63%) and 23,950 meters in Brazil (37%). At Cerro Lindo, we plan to drill a total of 23,100 meters including exploratory drilling at Patahuasi Millay, Pucasalla and its extensions, located in the northern side of the Cerro Lindo Mine and extension drilling at Orebodies 8B, 9, 5 and 6A, located southeast of the mine.At the Cerro Pasco Complex (El Porvenir and Atacocha), we plan to drill 8,500 meters divided between Pasco Integration Project targets to extend the mineralized hydrothermal breccia to upper levels of the deposit and at Don Lucho, VAM and Porvenir 9 targets. At the Hilarión and Florida Canyon Zinc projects, our focus will be to advance geological mapping and integration of geological data to define the exploration strategy for the years ahead.At Aripuanã, the strategy will be to drill 9,000 meters to identify the mineralization in the Massaranduba target to validate the continuation of the deposit in the southeast side of the Aripuanã Mine. At Vazante, we plan to carry out 12,350 meters of brownfield drilling, 7,050 to extend known orebodies such as Sucuri and Sucuri North and 5,300 meters of infill drilling at the BDMG Orebody to convert Inferred Mineral Resources into Indicated Mineral Resources.In Namibia, we plan to drill 3,000 meters of exploratory drilling to continue investigating copper mineralization in the Tsumeb trend.We expect to continue advancing our drilling campaigns and developing our pipeline of projects in regional areas with additional 13,100 meters of diamond drilling, prioritizing belts for exploratory drilling and Mineral Resource expansion to consolidate our Zinc and Copper portfolio with optimized investments between them.Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources TablesMINERAL RESERVESThe following table shows our estimates of Mineral Reserves prepared with an effective date of December 31, 2023 (except as indicated below).Table 1.

Accordingly, such information may not be comparable to similar information prepared in accordance with Subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K (""S-K 1300""). For a discussion of the differences between the requirements under S-K 1300 and NI 43-101, please see our annual report on Form 20-F.Mineral Reserve: is an estimate of tonnage and grade or quality of indicated and measured mineral resources that, in the opinion of the qualified person, can be the basis of an economically viable project. More specifically, it is the economically mineable part of a measured or indicated mineral resource, which includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material is mined or extracted.Probable Mineral Reserve: is the economically mineable part of an indicated and, in some cases, a measured mineral resource.Proven Mineral Reserve: is the economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource and can only result from conversion of a measured mineral resource.Mineral Resource: is a concentration or occurrence of material of economic interest in or on the Earth's crust in such form, grade or quality, and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. A mineral resource is a reasonable estimate of mineralization, taking into account relevant factors such as cut-off grade, likely mining dimensions, location or continuity, that, with the assumed and justifiable technical and economic conditions, is likely to, in whole or in part, become economically extractable.Inferred Mineral Resource: is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. The level of geological uncertainty associated with an inferred mineral resource is too high to apply relevant technical and economic factors likely to influence the prospects of economic extraction in a manner useful for evaluation of economic viability.Indicated Mineral Resource: is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of adequate geological evidence and sampling. The level of geological certainty associated with an indicated mineral resource is sufficient to allow a qualified person to apply modifying factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit.Measured Mineral Resource: is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of conclusive geological evidence and sampling. The level of geological certainty associated with a measured mineral resource is sufficient to allow a qualified person to apply modifying factors, as defined in this section, in sufficient detail to support detailed mine planning and final evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit.Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking StatementsThis news release contains certain forward-looking information and forward-looking statements as defined in applicable securities laws (collectively referred to in this news release as ""forward-looking statements"").

Fourth Quarter 2023 Highlights Real Estate Portfolio Same-store office portfolio(2) was 84.0% leased. Executed 38,280 square feet of leases with terms longer than 12 months. Financial Results Net loss attributable to common stockholders of $16.3 million, or $0.72 per diluted share. Funds from operations attributable to common stockholders (“FFO”)(3)1 was $(9.9) million, or $(0.44) per diluted share. Core FFO attributable to common stockholders(4)1 was $(8.4) million, or $(0.37) per diluted share. Management Commentary “We made additional strides in early 2024 improving our multifamily occupancy,” said David Thompson, Chief Executive Officer of Creative Media & Community Trust Corporation. “We believe there is a significant opportunity to improve our multifamily net operating income after we acquired two premier Class A multifamily residences in 2023 that are still in their lease-up phase following completion of construction.” “We continue to make progress on our value-add and development pipeline,” said Shaul Kuba, Chief Investment Officer of Creative Media & Community Trust Corporation. “Our partial office to multifamily conversion at 4750 Wilshire Boulevard is expected to be complete later this year adding 68 luxury residences, and we recently commenced construction on a 36-unit residence in Echo Park, Los Angeles that is slated for completion in 2025.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Results Real Estate Portfolio As of December 31, 2023, our real estate portfolio consisted of 27 assets, all of which were fee-simple properties and five of which we own through investments in unconsolidated joint ventures (the “Unconsolidated Joint Ventures”). The Unconsolidated Joint Ventures own two office properties (one of which is being partially converted into multifamily units), one multifamily site currently under development, one multifamily property and one commercial development site. The portfolio includes 13 office properties, totaling approximately 1.3 million rentable square feet, three multifamily properties totaling 696 units, nine development sites (three of which are being used as parking lots) and one 503-room hotel with an ancillary parking garage. Financial Results Net loss attributable to common stockholders was $16.3 million, or $0.72 per diluted share of common stock, for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $8.9 million, or $0.39 per diluted share of common stock, for the same period in 2022. The increase in net loss attributable to common stockholders was driven by the $6.3 million decrease in FFO discussed below as well as an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $1.2 million. FFO attributable to common stockholders(3)1 was $(9.9) million, or $(0.44) per diluted share of common stock, for the three months ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $6.3 million compared to $(3.7) million, or $(0.16) per diluted share of common stock, for the same period in 2022. The decrease in FFO1 was primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense not allocated to our operating segments of $6.8 million and an increase in redeemable preferred stock dividends of $5.6 million. These were partially offset by a decrease in the consolidated statement of operations impact of redeemable preferred stock redemptions of $7.6 million (due to the $7.9 million recognized in the prior comparable period in connection with the redemption of Series L Preferred stock during the three months ended December 31, 2022). Core FFO attributable to common stockholders(4)2 was $(8.4) million, or $(0.37) per diluted share of common stock, for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $4.4 million, or $0.11 per diluted share of common stock, for the same period in 2022. The decrease in Core FFO2 is attributable to the aforementioned changes in FFO2, while not impacted by the decrease in redeemable preferred stock redemptions as these are excluded from our Core FFO2 calculation. Segment Information Our reportable segments during the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 consisted of three types of commercial real estate properties, namely, office, hotel and multifamily, as well as a segment for our lending business. Total segment net operating income (“NOI”)(5) was $10.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $11.7 million for the same period in 2022. Office Same-Store Same-store(2) office segment NOI(5) decreased to $5.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $6.9 million in the same period in 2022, while same-store(1) office Cash NOI(6)2 decreased to $6.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $7.1 million in the same period in 2022. The decrease in same-store(2) office Cash NOI(6)2 was primarily attributable to a loss from an unconsolidated office entity in Los Angeles, California due to an increase in interest expense and a decline in value of the entity’s investments in real estate, partially offset by an increase in rental revenue at an office property in Beverly Hills, California due to increased occupancy and rental rates and an increase in rental revenue at an office property in Los Angeles, California due to increased occupancy. The decrease in same-store(2) office segment NOI(5) was primarily due to the aforementioned loss from an unconsolidated office entity as well as a decrease in rental revenues at an office property in Oakland, California due to the impact of an early lease termination, partially offset by the aforementioned increase in rental revenues at an office property in Beverly Hills, California. At December 31, 2023, the Company’s same-store(2) office portfolio was 83.4% occupied, an increase of 210 basis points year-over-year on a same-store(2) basis, and 84.0% leased, a decrease of 20 basis points year-over-year on a same-store(2) basis. The annualized rent per occupied square foot(7) on a same-store(2) basis was $57.28 at December 31, 2023 compared to $54.83 at December 31, 2022. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company executed 38,280 square feet of leases with terms longer than 12 months at our same-store(2) office portfolio. Total Office Segment NOI(5) decreased to $5.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, from $6.9 million for the same period in 2022. The decrease is due to the increase in same-store(2) office segment NOI(5) discussed above, partially offset by an increase in non-same-store(2) office Segment NOI(5) of $354,000, which was driven by income from an unconsolidated office entity in Los Angeles, California during the three months ended December 31, 2023. Hotel Hotel Segment NOI(5) decreased to $2.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, from $3.1 million for the same period in 2022, primarily due to an increase in operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in room revenues. Additionally, hotel occupancy decreased slightly while average daily rate increased. Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Occupancy 69.9 % 71.5 % Average daily rate(a) $ 195.04 $ 178.72 Revenue per available room(b) $ 136.27 $ 127.84 (a) Calculated as trailing 3-month room revenue divided by the number of rooms occupied. (b) Calculated as trailing 3-month room revenue divided by the number of available rooms. Multifamily Our Multifamily Segment consists of two multifamily buildings located in Oakland, California as well as an investment in a multifamily building in the Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, California through one of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, all of which were acquired during the first quarter of 2023. Our Multifamily Segment NOI(5) was $1.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, our Multifamily Segment was 79.3% occupied and the monthly rent per occupied unit(8) was $2,805. Lending Our lending segment primarily consists of our SBA 7(a) lending platform, which is a national lender that primarily originates loans to small businesses in the hospitality industry. Lending Segment NOI(5) was $1.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $1.8 million for the same period in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in interest expense related to the issuance of new SBA 7(a) loan-backed notes in connection with the securitization that closed in March 2023, partially offset by an increase in revenues driven by an increase in interest income as a result of the continuing higher interest rate environment and an increase in premium income. ____________________ 1 Non-GAAP financial measure.

Debt and Equity During the three months ended December 31, 2023, we issued 1,184,884 shares of Series A1 Preferred Stock for aggregate net proceeds of $26.8 million. Net proceeds represent gross proceeds offset by costs specifically identifiable to the offering, such as commissions, dealer manager fees and other offering fees and expenses. Additionally, during the three months ended December 31, 2023, we had net incremental paydowns of $20.0 million on our revolving credit facility and refinanced a mortgage loan at a multifamily property in Oakland, California, making a repayment of $13.0 million and converting it to a fixed rate of 6.25% per annum. Dividends On December 20, 2023, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.0850 per share of our common stock, which was paid on January 2, 2024. On January 2, 2024, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.34375 per share of our Series A Preferred Stock for the first quarter of 2024. The dividend will be payable monthly as follows: $0.114583 per share to be paid on February 15, 2024 to Series A Preferred Stockholders of record on February 5, 2024; $0.114583 per share to be paid on March 15, 2024 to Series A Preferred Stockholders of record on March 5, 2024; and $0.114583 per share to be paid on April 15, 2024 to Series A Preferred Stockholders of record on April 5, 2024. On January 2, 2024, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.489375 per share of our Series A1 Preferred Stock for the first quarter of 2024. The quarterly cash dividend of $0.489375 per share represents an annualized dividend rate of 7.83% (2.5% plus the federal funds rate of 5.33% on the applicable determination date). The dividend will be payable monthly as follows: $0.163125 per share to be paid on February 15, 2024 to Series A1 Preferred Stockholders of record on February 5, 2024; $0.163125 per share to be paid on March 15, 2024 to Series A1 Preferred Stockholders of record on March 5, 2024; and $0.163125 per share to be paid on April 15, 2024 to Series A1 Preferred Stockholders of record on April 5, 2024. For shares of Series A1 Preferred Stock issued in the first quarter of 2024, the dividend will be prorated from the date of issuance, and the monthly dividend payments will reflect such proration. On January 2, 2024, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.353125 per share of our Series D Preferred Stock for the first quarter of 2024.

(3) We sold 80% of our interest in 4750 Wilshire Boulevard (excluding a vacant land parcel which was not included in the sale) to third-party co-investors with whom we formed an Unconsolidated Joint Venture. The remaining 20% interest represents our interest in the newly formed Unconsolidated Joint Venture. (4) 1015 N Mansfield Avenue is an office building with a 44,141 square foot site area and a parking garage. The site is being evaluated for different creative office development options. About the Data Descriptions of certain performance measures, including Segment NOI, Cash NOI, FFO attributable to common stockholders, and Core FFO attributable to common stockholders are provided below. Certain of these performance measures—Cash NOI, FFO attributable to common stockholders and Core FFO attributable to common stockholders—are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to the subsequent tables for reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. (1) Stabilized office portfolio: represents office properties where occupancy was not impacted by a redevelopment or repositioning during the period. (2) Same-store properties: are properties that we have owned and operated in a consistent manner and reported in our consolidated results during the entire span of the periods being reported. We excluded from our same-store property set this quarter any properties (i) acquired on or after October 1, 2022; (ii) sold or otherwise removed from our consolidated financial statements on or before December 31, 2023; or (iii) that underwent a major repositioning project we believed significantly affected its results at any point during the period commencing on October 1, 2022 and ending on December 31, 2023. When determining our same-store properties as of December 31, 2023, one property was excluded pursuant to (i) and (iii) above and no properties were excluded pursuant to (ii) above. (3) FFO attributable to common stockholders (“FFO”): represents net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, computed in accordance with GAAP, which reflects the deduction of redeemable preferred stock dividends accumulated, excluding gain (or loss) from sales of real estate, impairment of real estate, and real estate depreciation and amortization. We calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (the “NAREIT”). See ‘Core FFO’ definition below for discussion of the benefits and limitations of FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance. (4) Core FFO attributable to common stockholders (“Core FFO”): represents FFO attributable to common stockholders (computed as described above), excluding gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt, redeemable preferred stock deemed dividends, redeemable preferred stock redemptions, gain (loss) on termination of interest rate swaps, and transaction costs. We believe that FFO is a widely recognized and appropriate measure of the performance of a REIT and that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results. In addition, we believe that Core FFO is a useful metric for securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of our Company as it excludes from FFO the effect of certain amounts that we believe are non-recurring, are non-operating in nature as they relate to the manner in which we finance our operations, or transactions outside of the ordinary course of business. Like any metric, FFO and Core FFO should not be used as the only measure of our performance because it excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our real estate properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, and Core FFO excludes amounts incurred in connection with non-recurring special projects, prepaying or defeasing our debt, repurchasing our preferred stock, and adjusting the carrying value of our preferred stock classified in temporary equity to its redemption value, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our operating results. Other REITs may not calculate FFO and Core FFO in the same manner as we do, or at all; accordingly, our FFO and Core FFO may not be comparable to the FFOs and Core FFOs of other REITs. Therefore, FFO and Core FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income (loss) as a measure of our performance and should not be used as a supplement to or substitute measure for cash flows from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP. FFO and Core FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends. FFO and Core FFO per share for the year-to-date period may differ from the sum of quarterly FFO and Core FFO per share amounts due to the required method for computing per share amounts for the respective periods. In addition, FFO and Core FFO per share is calculated independently for each component and may not be additive due to rounding. (5) Segment NOI: for our real estate segments represents rental and other property income and expense reimbursements less property related expenses and excludes non-property income and expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, corporate related general and administrative expenses, gain (loss) on sale of real estate, gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt, impairment of real estate, transaction costs, and benefit (provision) for income taxes. For our lending segment, Segment NOI represents interest income net of interest expense and general overhead expenses. See ‘Cash NOI’ definition below for discussion of the benefits and limitations of Segment NOI as a supplemental measure of operating performance. (6) Cash NOI: for our real estate segments, represents Segment NOI adjusted to exclude the effect of the straight lining of rents, acquired above/below market lease amortization and other adjustments required by generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). For our lending segment, there is no distinction between Cash NOI and Segment NOI. We also evaluate the operating performance and financial results of our operating segments using cash basis NOI excluding lease termination income, or “Cash NOI excluding lease termination income”. Segment NOI and Cash NOI are not measures of operating results or cash flows from operating activities as measured by GAAP and should not be considered alternatives to income from continuing operations, or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity, or as an indication of our performance or of our ability to pay dividends. Companies may not calculate Segment NOI or Cash NOI in the same manner. We consider Segment NOI and Cash NOI to be useful performance measures to investors and management because, when compared across periods, they reflect the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating our properties and the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs, providing a perspective not immediately apparent from income from continuing operations. Additionally, we believe that Cash NOI is helpful to investors because it eliminates straight line rent and other non-cash adjustments to revenue and expenses. (7) Annualized rent per occupied square foot: represents gross monthly base rent under leases commenced as of the specified periods, multiplied by twelve. This amount reflects total cash rent before abatements. Where applicable, annualized rent has been grossed up by adding annualized expense reimbursements to base rent. Annualized rent for certain office properties includes rent attributable to retail. (8) Monthly rent per occupied unit: Represents gross monthly base rent under leases commenced as of the specified period, divided by occupied units. This amount reflects total cash rent before concessions.

Such forward-looking statements also include, among others, statements about CMCT’s plans and objectives relating to future growth and outlook. Such forward-looking statements are based on particular assumptions that management of CMCT has made in light of its experience, as well as its perception of expected future developments and other factors that it believes are appropriate under the circumstances. Forward-looking statements are necessarily estimates reflecting the judgment of CMCT’s management and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include those associated with (i) the timing, form, and operational effects of CMCT’s development activities, (ii) the ability of CMCT to raise in place rents to existing market rents and to maintain or increase occupancy levels, (iii) fluctuations in market rents, (iv) the effects of inflation and continuing higher interest rates on the operations and profitability of CMCT and (v) general economic, market and other conditions.

The forward-looking statements included herein are based on current expectations and there can be no assurance that these expectations will be attained. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond CMCT’s control. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements expressed or implied will prove to be accurate.

FFO represents net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""), which reflects the deduction of redeemable preferred stock dividends accumulated, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate, impairment of real estate, and real estate depreciation and amortization. We calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (the ""NAREIT""). Like any metric, FFO should not be used as the only measure of our performance because it excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our real estate properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our operating results. Other REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by the NAREIT; accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to the FFO of other REITs. Therefore, FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income (loss) as a measure of our performance and should not be used as a supplement to or substitute measure for cash flows from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders to FFO attributable to common stockholders for the three months and the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

CREATIVE MEDIA & COMMUNITY TRUST CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Core Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders (Unaudited and in thousands, except per share amounts) In addition to calculating FFO in accordance with the standards established by NAREIT, we also calculate a supplemental FFO metric we call Core FFO attributable to common stockholders. Core FFO attributable to common stockholders represents FFO attributable to common stockholders, computed in accordance with NAREIT's standards, excluding losses (or gains) on early extinguishment of debt, redeemable preferred stock redemptions, gains (or losses) on termination of interest rate swaps, and transaction costs. We believe that Core FFO is a useful metric for securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of our Company as it excludes from FFO the effect of certain amounts that we believe are non-recurring, are non-operating in nature as they relate to the manner in which we finance our operations, or transactions outside of the ordinary course of business. Like any metric, Core FFO should not be used as the only measure of our performance because, in addition to excluding those items prescribed by NAREIT when calculating FFO, it excludes amounts incurred in connection with non-recurring special projects, prepaying or defeasing our debt and repurchasing our preferred stock, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our operating results. Other REITs may not calculate Core FFO in the same manner as we do, or at all; accordingly, our Core FFO may not be comparable to the Core FFO of other REITs who calculate such a metric. Therefore, Core FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income (loss) as a measure of our performance and should not be used as a supplement to or substitute measure for cash flows from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP. Core FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders to Core FFO attributable to common stockholders for the three months and the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

CREATIVE MEDIA & COMMUNITY TRUST CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Reconciliation of Net Operating Income (Unaudited and in thousands) We internally evaluate the operating performance and financial results of our real estate segments based on segment NOI, which is defined as rental and other property income and expense reimbursements less property related expenses and excludes non-property income and expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, corporate related general and administrative expenses, gain (loss) on sale of real estate, gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt, impairment of real estate, transaction costs, and provision for income taxes. For our lending segment, we define segment NOI as interest income net of interest expense and general overhead expenses. We also evaluate the operating performance and financial results of our operating segments using cash basis NOI, or ""cash NOI"". For our real estate segments, we define cash NOI as segment NOI adjusted to exclude the effect of the straight lining of rents, acquired above/below market lease amortization and other adjustments required by GAAP. Cash NOI is not a measure of operating results or cash flows from operating activities as measured by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to income from continuing operations, or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity, or as an indication of our performance or of our ability to pay dividends. Companies may not calculate cash NOI in the same manner. We consider cash NOI to be a useful performance measure to investors and management because, when compared across periods, it reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating our properties and the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs, providing a perspective not immediately apparent from income from continuing operations. Additionally, we believe that cash NOI is helpful to investors because it eliminates straight line rent and other non-cash adjustments to revenue and expenses.

The offering is rated 'BBB' by Egan-Jones Ratings Company and includes an option for underwriters to purchase additional shares. The Company plans to list the Preferred Stock on the NYSE under the symbol 'EICC'. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Eagle Point Income Company Inc.'s recent pricing of its Series C Term Preferred Stock is a strategic move to raise capital. The offering size and the fixed 8.00% dividend rate are competitive, especially considering the current interest rate environment. The 'BBB' rating by Egan-Jones suggests a moderate level of creditworthiness, which could appeal to risk-averse investors seeking stable returns. However, the market's reception will hinge on the company's performance, sector outlook and prevailing economic conditions.The potential for an additional 183,000 shares through the underwriters' option could indicate confidence in the offering's success, but it also introduces the possibility of dilution. The net proceeds of approximately $29.3 million will likely be used to finance the company's operations or pay down existing debt, which could improve its financial stability and potentially enhance shareholder value in the long term. Market Research Analyst The decision to list the Preferred Stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol 'EICC' within 30 days of the issue date is a significant step towards increasing liquidity and visibility in the market. This move could attract a broader investor base and potentially improve trading volumes. The involvement of established financial institutions as joint bookrunners and lead managers, including Ladenburg Thalmann and Piper Sandler, lends credibility to the offering and may boost investor confidence.Investors should be aware that Preferred Stock typically ranks higher than common stock in terms of claims on assets and earnings, which provides an additional layer of security in the event of liquidation. However, the fixed dividend rate also means that investors will not benefit from any potential increase in the company's profitability beyond the predetermined dividend yield. Securities Law Expert The offering's compliance with SEC regulations and the filing of the preliminary prospectus supplement are important for transparency and investor protection. The investment community should review the prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus to understand the risks and charges associated with this investment. The legal framework ensures that all material information is disclosed, allowing investors to make informed decisions.It's also important to note that the rating by an independent agency does not guarantee the investment's performance, but it does provide a benchmark for assessing risk. The legal implications of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares should be clear in the terms and conditions to avoid any future disputes or misunderstandings. 03/27/2024 - 07:10 PM GREENWICH, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Eagle Point Income Company Inc.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The filing of Nexa Resources' annual report on Form 20-F is a disclosure that investors closely monitor, as it provides a comprehensive overview of the company's financial performance over the past fiscal year. The availability of audited financial statements is a regulatory requirement that ensures transparency and helps maintain investor confidence. The financial statements within the 20-F form would typically include income statements, balance sheets and cash flow statements, which analysts scrutinize for profitability, liquidity and solvency indicators.Moreover, the update on Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources estimates is a critical piece of information for stakeholders. The figures reported can influence the company's stock, as they directly relate to the potential revenue streams from mining operations. The Canadian National Instrument 43-101 sets a standard for public disclosure by mineral companies, aiming to ensure that the information provided is reliable and follows specific guidelines. This update may lead to a reassessment of Nexa's assets and hence, its intrinsic value. Mining Industry Analyst The Technical Report summary for the Cerro Pasco Complex Integration prepared under Subpart of Regulation S-K 1300 offers insights into the project's viability and future production expectations. Regulation S-K 1300 is part of the U.S. SEC's rules that require registrants to provide detailed disclosures about mineral properties that are material to the company. This information is particularly important for investors as it sheds light on the project's potential impact on Nexa's production capabilities and, consequently, its revenue and profitability.Analysts in the mining sector would evaluate such reports to assess the quality and quantity of the mineral deposits and the feasibility of their extraction. Factors such as ore grade, recovery rates and market prices for the minerals are key to understanding the economic potential of the Cerro Pasco Complex. These factors can significantly affect Nexa's market valuation and should be considered when forecasting the company's future growth trajectory. 03/27/2024 - 06:30 PM LUXEMBOURG / ACCESSWIRE / March 27, 2024 / Nexa Resources S.A.

For a discussion of the differences between the requirements under S-K 1300 and NI 43-101, please see our annual report on Form 20-F.Mineral Reserve: is an estimate of tonnage and grade or quality of indicated and measured mineral resources that, in the opinion of the qualified person, can be the basis of an economically viable project. More specifically, it is the economically mineable part of a measured or indicated mineral resource, which includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material is mined or extracted.Probable Mineral Reserve: is the economically mineable part of an indicated and, in some cases, a measured mineral resource.Proven Mineral Reserve: is the economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource and can only result from conversion of a measured mineral resource.Mineral Resource: is a concentration or occurrence of material of economic interest in or on the Earth's crust in such form, grade or quality, and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. A mineral resource is a reasonable estimate of mineralization, taking into account relevant factors such as cut-off grade, likely mining dimensions, location or continuity, that, with the assumed and justifiable technical and economic conditions, is likely to, in whole or in part, become economically extractable.Inferred Mineral Resource: is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. The level of geological uncertainty associated with an inferred mineral resource is too high to apply relevant technical and economic factors likely to influence the prospects of economic extraction in a manner useful for evaluation of economic viability.Indicated Mineral Resource: is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of adequate geological evidence and sampling. The level of geological certainty associated with an indicated mineral resource is sufficient to allow a qualified person to apply modifying factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit.Measured Mineral Resource: is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of conclusive geological evidence and sampling. The level of geological certainty associated with a measured mineral resource is sufficient to allow a qualified person to apply modifying factors, as defined in this section, in sufficient detail to support detailed mine planning and final evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit.Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking StatementsThis news release contains certain forward-looking information and forward-looking statements as defined in applicable securities laws (collectively referred to in this news release as ""forward-looking statements"").

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Boundless Bio's initial public offering (IPO) at $16.00 per share, with an expectation to raise $100 million, is a significant event for investors and the market. This IPO represents a strategic move to fund the company's research and development activities, particularly in the challenging field of oncogenically amplified cancers. The company's focus on extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) highlights its commitment to novel cancer therapies, which could disrupt the oncology market if successful.Investors should note the potential for volatility in biotech IPOs, as market sentiment can swing based on clinical trial outcomes and regulatory news. The underwriters' pedigree, including Goldman Sachs and Leerink Partners, suggests a vote of confidence in Boundless Bio's prospects. However, the long-term return will heavily depend on the company's ability to successfully navigate clinical trials and bring products to market. Medical Research Analyst Boundless Bio's work on extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is a pioneering approach in oncology. ecDNA are circular units of DNA outside chromosomes that can drive high levels of gene amplification, leading to aggressive cancer growth. Targeting ecDNA could offer a new therapeutic pathway for treating cancers that are resistant to current treatments. The successful translation of this research into viable treatments could make a substantial impact on the oncology sector and position Boundless Bio as a leader in precision medicine.It's important for stakeholders to understand the inherent risks associated with clinical-stage biotech firms. The path from research to market is fraught with scientific, regulatory and financial hurdles. The IPO funds will likely support ongoing and future clinical trials, which are pivotal in determining the company's future. The outcome of these trials will be a key driver of the company's stock performance. Market Research Analyst The biotechnology sector is known for its high growth potential and Boundless Bio's entry into the market via an IPO is a testament to the industry's dynamism. With the IPO, the company is not only seeking capital but also public validation and visibility. The pricing of the IPO at $16.00 per share will set a benchmark for the company's valuation and the market's reception of the stock will serve as an indicator of investor confidence in biotech innovation.While the IPO provides an immediate influx of capital, it's important to consider the competitive landscape. Boundless Bio will be vying for market share against established pharmaceutical companies and other biotech startups. The ability to differentiate through unique ecDNA-targeted therapies could be a game-changer, but the company must also navigate market dynamics, such as pricing pressures and reimbursement challenges. 03/27/2024 - 06:55 PM SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Boundless Bio, Inc.

JBG SMITH Releases Statement on Potomac Yard Entertainment District Proposal,2024-03-27T22:15:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"JBG SMITH (JBGS) announced the termination of discussions for the Potomac Yard Entertainment District due to political influences and special interests, hindering the development of a world-class arena and entertainment hub.","JBG SMITH Releases Statement on Potomac Yard Entertainment District Proposal Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary JBG SMITH (JBGS) announced the termination of discussions for the Potomac Yard Entertainment District due to political influences and special interests, hindering the development of a world-class arena and entertainment hub. Positive None. Negative Termination of discussions impacting the development of the entertainment district Influence of special interests and partisan politics affecting the project Lost opportunity to create a dense, mixed-use neighborhood at Potomac Yard Real Estate Development Analyst The termination of the Potomac Yard Entertainment District project has immediate ramifications for JBG SMITH, a real estate investment trust specializing in urban, mixed-use properties. The project's cessation, influenced by political and special interest factors, suggests a potential volatility in the company's future development pipeline. This could affect investor confidence, as large-scale projects like these often contribute significantly to a company's growth trajectory and revenue generation.Furthermore, the loss of such a development could impact the broader economic ecosystem of the area, including construction jobs, future retail opportunities and increased property values. Stakeholders might now be watchful for JBG SMITH's strategic response, such as seeking alternative projects or reassessing current land use to mitigate the economic impact of this stalled development. Political Analyst The reference to 'partisan politics' and 'pay-to-play influences' within the Virginia legislature underscores the complex relationship between business development and political dynamics. For investors, this highlights the non-market risks associated with real estate development. Such political entanglements can abruptly alter the investment landscape and companies heavily reliant on large-scale developments may be particularly susceptible to these shifts.Investors may now scrutinize the company's ability to navigate political hurdles and reassess the risk profile of their investments in regions where political unpredictability is high. This incident could prompt a closer examination of JBG SMITH's governmental relations strategies and their contingency planning for political interference. Urban Planner The envisioned transformation of Potomac Yard into a dense, mixed-use neighborhood aligns with contemporary urban development trends that favor walkability and multi-functional spaces. The cancellation of this project represents a missed opportunity for urban revitalization and sustainable development. It also raises questions about the future of urban planning initiatives in politically contentious environments.For stakeholders, this development—or lack thereof—could signal a need to reassess the viability of similar projects in the pipeline. It also suggests a potential shift in focus towards less politically sensitive projects or regions where the urban planning vision aligns more closely with political and public sentiment. 03/27/2024 - 06:15 PM BETHESDA, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- JBG SMITH (NYSE: JBGS) today issued a statement on the Potomac Yard Entertainment District. Statement from Matt Kelly, CEO, JBG SMITH to stakeholders: Dear JBG SMITH Stakeholders: In December, we announced plans to develop an entertainment district in Potomac Yard, anchored by the Washington Capitals, Washington Wizards and the Monumental Sports & Entertainment corporate headquarters. Today it was announced that discussions between Monumental, Alexandria and the Commonwealth of Virginia have been terminated. While we had made great strides in advancing the project’s transportation plan, overall design and financing structure, the opportunity was derailed largely due to partisan politics and, most troubling, the influence of special interests and potential pay-to-play influences within the Virginia legislature. This was a once-in-a-generation opportunity to build a world-class arena and entertainment district at Potomac Yard and to realize the vision of that community as a dense, mixed-use neighborhood. We are thankful to those who made the opportunity possible in the first place, especially Monumental Sports. We are also thankful to our local partners, specifically the City of Alexandria and its City Council, Alexandria Economic Development Partnership, and the Governor’s office, and the many public supporters along the way who engaged in thoughtful dialogue about how to move this important opportunity forward. Despite our best efforts, this project was unable to get a fair hearing on its merits with the Virginia Senate. It is now clear that our efforts may have been complicated and ultimately blocked, in part, by special interests seeking to move the Monumental arena to Tysons Corner and to combine it with a casino. The Washington Post and other outlets have reported on this scheme and the hundreds of thousands of dollars, enormous sums in Virginia politics, of political contributions associated with it – a large portion of which were directed to key senate leaders. When one follows the money, the implications are deeply troubling for Virginia and for the future of transparency in economic development pursuits, especially those that seek certainty through the now damaged MEI legislative process. Beyond the arena, state and local governments will lose needed tax revenue, economic development credibility, and what could have been Virginia’s last best chance to land a professional sports franchise for at least a generation. Economic development and growth thrive on transparency and predictability. The scheming and special interests that plagued this opportunity in the Virginia legislature will no doubt cause future employers and the next Monumental to question whether their opportunity will get a fair hearing. This opportunity also brought with it the potential to add tens of thousands of jobs and needed housing units, including 1,000 units of affordable housing preservation in Alexandria which we had pledged as part of the arena proposal. Traffic and transportation investments, including possible Metro funding, are also likely gone. Instead, the existing surface-parked, single story shopping center on the site will remain through the remaining 20-year term of the Target lease and development on the remaining land will likely be far less dense. To say we are disappointed is an understatement; we are disgusted with the back-room-dealing and opaque scheming that took place as this played out. With this chapter now closed, we will continue to pursue alternate uses and amenities to further develop our sites adjacent to the Virginia Tech Innovation Campus. We will also continue to work tirelessly to attract business and customers to the Commonwealth of Virginia and the local communities in which we invest, and most importantly we will always conduct ourselves in a manner in which we and our stakeholders can be proud. We thank you for your continued trust and confidence.

(CWCO) reported impressive financial and operational highlights for the full year ended December 31, 2023. Total revenue surged by 92% to $180.2 million, with net income from continuing operations reaching $30.7 million. The company showcased robust growth in various revenue streams, including retail, bulk, services, and manufacturing. Operational achievements included significant revenue recognition from a water treatment plant construction project, increased retail water sales, and the commencement of new desalination plant projects in Grand Cayman and Hawaii. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The report by Consolidated Water Co. Ltd. indicates a remarkable year-over-year growth, with total revenue surging by 92%. This surge is driven by substantial increases across different revenue streams, particularly the Services segment, which soared by 240%. The growth in Manufacturing revenue by 177% also reflects a robust expansion. Such figures suggest that the company is effectively diversifying its income sources and scaling its operations.Net income growth to $30.7 million, a significant leap from the previous year's $8.2 million, reflects operational efficiency and possibly improved profit margins. Investors should note the earnings per share increase to $1.93, which could make the stock more attractive. The healthy cash and cash equivalents position, coupled with solid working capital, suggests financial stability and the potential for future investments or shareholder returns. Water Industry Analyst The operational highlights underscore the company's strategic moves, particularly the acquisition of the remaining interest in PERC Water Corporation. This full ownership in a subsidiary that specializes in water infrastructure in the Southwestern U.S. could provide a competitive edge and streamline operations. The completion of the water treatment plant in Goodyear and the initiation of the Red Gate desalination plant in Grand Cayman are indicative of the company's growth trajectory and its ability to secure large-scale projects.Additionally, the increased volume of retail water sold, tied to the resurgence of tourism, aligns with global economic recovery trends. The company's pivot towards desalination, including the new project in Hawaii, positions it well within a niche but increasingly vital market as water scarcity concerns rise globally. The diversification into desalination technology is a strategic move that could offer long-term sustainability and growth potential. Environmental and Regulatory Compliance Expert Consolidated Water Co. Ltd.'s expansion into new desalination projects, such as the one in Hawaii, is not just a business growth strategy but also a response to the increasing global need for sustainable water solutions. Desalination, while resource-intensive, provides a critical alternative water source in water-scarce regions. The company's progress in piloting, design and permitting indicates a proactive approach to environmental compliance and regulatory navigation, which is essential in the water supply industry.Investors should consider the long-term benefits of investing in a company that is not only expanding its footprint but also doing so in a manner that is environmentally conscious and compliant with regulatory standards. This approach mitigates risks associated with environmental regulations and positions the company as a responsible player in the industry. 03/27/2024 - 05:50 PM GEORGE TOWN, Cayman Islands, March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Consolidated Water Co.

The project was certified substantially complete in January 2024 and the remaining work on the plant will be completed by June 2024.Volume of retail water sold increased 15%, primarily due to the greater return of tourist activity in Grand Cayman.Began construction of a new 2.6 million gallon per day Red Gate desalination plant in Grand Cayman, and recognized total design and construction revenue of $8.2 million in 2023.Began piloting, design and permitting for a $204 million project to design, construct, operate and maintain a seawater desalination plant in Hawaii announced in June 2023.Acquired remaining 39% interest of PERC to become the 100% owner of the company’s subsidiary that designs, constructs, operates and manages water infrastructure facilities in the Southwestern U.S.Acquired Ramey Environmental Compliance (REC) in the fourth quarter, creating a new channel for PERC to expand its presence in water-stressed regions in Colorado. Dividend Increase In August 2023, the company increased its quarterly dividend by 11.8% to $0.095 per share beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023. Management Commentary “In 2023, our strong revenue and earnings growth made it the best-performing year ever for Consolidated Water,” stated company CEO, Rick McTaggart. “This is a fitting achievement in the year that we celebrated our 50th year in business. “In fact, revenue was up across all four of our business segments, with total gross profit doubling to $61.9 million and gross margin up 211 basis points to 34.4%. We believe this margin expansion was primarily the result of our focus on quality projects and cost control. “Over the past year, we have seen tourism recover and water use increase for our Cayman Islands retail and bulk water segments. We also recognized revenue from the design and construction of the 2.6 million gallon per day Red Gate seawater desalination plant we are building for the Water Authority of the Cayman Islands. This contributed significantly to the year-over-year increase in our services segment. “Our operating results in 2023 benefited from an extraordinary level of design and construction revenue from the Arizona and Cayman projects, both of which are winding down this quarter. Other segments in our business, however, also generated increased revenues, which we expect to continue through 2024. Based on our schedule for the Hawaii project, we expect to complete piloting, design and permitting, and commence construction of that plant in the third quarter of 2025, at which time we will begin to recognize the majority of the $150 million in design-build revenue from that important project over the two-year construction period. “The sustained robust operational performance and revenue expansion of our PERC subsidiary has continued to bolster our top and bottom lines. Given its strong operational footprint in the Southwestern U.S., a region grappling with critical water scarcity exacerbated by unprecedented drought conditions, PERC is poised for further expansion and advancement in this fundamental segment of our business. “In our U.S. desalination business, we commenced work in the fourth quarter on site investigations, engineering, permitting and public outreach for our contract to design, construct, operate and maintain a 1.7 MGD seawater desalination plant in Oahu, Hawaii. This project includes a two-year development phase, two-year construction phase and 20-year operating phase, with two potential 5-year operating phase extensions at the client’s option. “We see opportunities to grow our US-based O&M business as well as our design-build business by building upon our successes this past year. Bidding activity for O&M contracts and design-build projects— particularly in California where PERC’s presence is strong—has been robust and we hope to obtain some of this new work. “Our strong 2023 results certainly set the bar higher in terms of our future growth outlook. However, we remain optimistic about our growth prospects. Our exceptional operational performance over the past several years has reaffirmed our belief that our highly efficient and aesthetically pleasing treatment plant designs, world-class operating and maintenance capabilities, and our innovative project delivery models are superior to our competitors.” 2023 Financial Summary Revenue totaled $180.2 million, up 92% compared to $94.1 million in 2022. The increase was primarily driven by increases of $4.2 million in the retail segment, $1.6 million in the bulk segment, $69.1 million in the services segment and $11.2 million in the manufacturing segment. Retail revenue increased primarily due to a 15% increase in the volume of water sold. The volume of water sold in the Cayman Water license area increased by 14% and the remaining 1% increase in the volume of water sold was due to sales by Cayman Water directly to the Water Authority Cayman in the first quarter of 2023. Retail revenue also increased as the result of higher energy costs that increased the energy pass-through component of the company’s retail water rates. The increase in bulk segment revenue was due to an increase of 6% in the volume of water sold by CW-Bahamas and higher energy costs, which increased the energy pass-through component of the company’s bulk water rates. The increase in services segment revenue was primarily due to plant construction revenue increasing 566% to $77.3 million. The company recognized approximately $64.0 million in revenue for the construction of the water treatment plant in Goodyear, Arizona, and recognized $8.2 million in revenue for the design and construction of the Red Gate plant in Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands. Revenue generated under operations and maintenance contracts totaled $19.4 million in the full year of 2023, up 37% from $14.2 million in 2022. The increase in manufacturing segment revenue was due to higher project activity. Gross profit for the full year of 2023 was $61.9 million or 34.4% of total revenue, up 104% from $30.4 million or 32.3% of total revenue in 2022. Net income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders for the full year of 2023 was $30.7 million or $1.93 per diluted share, compared to net income of $8.2 million or $0.54 per diluted share in 2022. Net income attributable to Consolidated Water stockholders for the full year of 2023, which includes the results of discontinued operations, was $29.6 million or $1.86 per diluted share, up from net income of $5.9 million or $0.38 per diluted share in 2022. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $42.6 million as of December 31, 2023, with working capital of $88.8 million, debt of $0.4 million, and stockholders’ equity totaling $186.8 million.

Announces Unaudited Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2023 Financial Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary BEST Inc. announces unaudited financial results for Q4 and fiscal year 2023 with revenue growth and improved gross margins. Despite increased revenue, the company reports net losses and negative EBITDA. Positive Revenue for Q4 2023 was RMB2,236.3 million, up from RMB1,981.4 million in Q4 2022. Net loss from continuing operations in Q4 2023 was RMB283.5 million, compared to RMB365.8 million in Q4 2022. Gross profit margin improved to 5.3% in Q4 2023, compared to a gross loss margin of 3.0% in Q4 2022. For the fiscal year 2023, revenue increased to RMB8,315.8 million from RMB7,744.1 million in 2022. Net loss from continuing operations in 2023 was RMB908.6 million, down from RMB1,464.8 million in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to negative 6.4% in Q4 2023 from negative 15.0% in Q4 2022. Negative Net cash used in continuing operating activities increased to RMB554.7 million in 2023 from RMB1,051.7 million in 2022. The company reported negative EBITDA in both Q4 2023 and the fiscal year 2023. Share-based compensation expenses decreased in Q4 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. Financial Analyst Revenue growth and gross profit margin improvements suggest a positive trajectory for BEST Inc.'s operational efficiency. Despite the net loss, the year-over-year reduction indicates a potential turnaround. The increase in freight and global service revenues reflects strong demand and effective pricing strategies. However, the ongoing net losses and negative EBITDA raise concerns about the company's ability to achieve profitability in the near term. The cash position has decreased, which could impact future investments or debt repayment capacity. The repurchase of convertible notes and termination of the share repurchase program may signal a strategic shift in capital allocation. Market Research Analyst The logistics sector in China and Southeast Asia is highly competitive and BEST's focus on operational efficiency and digital capabilities is essential for maintaining its market position. The impressive revenue growth in SEA markets, especially Vietnam and Malaysia, indicates a successful expansion strategy and resilience post-COVID. However, the decline in cash reserves and the share repurchase program's termination could be perceived as a lack of confidence in the company's short-term growth prospects, potentially affecting investor sentiment. Supply Chain Management Expert The reported improvements in gross margins for BEST's Freight and Supply Chain Management segments demonstrate effective cost control measures and process optimizations. The shift in customer mix towards more profitable accounts and the reduction in operating expenses are indicative of a strategic pivot to enhance profitability. However, the increase in cost of revenue for the Global segment, particularly in Thailand, suggests challenges in international operations that need to be addressed to sustain growth. 03/27/2024 - 06:00 PM HANGZHOU, China, March 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- BEST Inc.

Announces Closing of Underwritten Public Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Akanda Corp. (AKAN) enters into an underwriting agreement with Univest Securities, for a public offering of Common Shares and Pre-Funded Warrants, raising $5,000,000. The net proceeds will be used for various purposes including capital expenditures, working capital, and acquisitions. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent public offering by Akanda Corp. reflects a strategic move to bolster its capital structure and liquidity. The issuance of common shares and pre-funded warrants at a discounted price suggests an aggressive approach to attract investment, albeit potentially diluting current shareholders' equity. The gross proceeds of $5 million, earmarked for capital expenditures and debt management, indicate a proactive stance in fortifying the company's balance sheet and funding growth initiatives. However, investors should be mindful of the impact on share value due to dilution and scrutinize the company's allocation of the raised capital towards its declared purposes. Market Research Analyst Within the context of the medical cannabis industry, Akanda Corp.'s offering can be seen as a response to the sector's capital-intensive nature. The earmarking of funds for acquisitions suggests an expansionary strategy, possibly aiming to consolidate market share or diversify product offerings. Given the competitive landscape, the success of this strategy hinges on the company's ability to identify and integrate complementary products or technologies effectively. Market observers should track the deployment of these funds and subsequent performance metrics to assess the long-term viability of these investments. Legal Expert The legal stipulations of the underwriting agreement, including customary representations and indemnification clauses, are standard practice in public offerings. The emphasis on compliance with the Securities Act of 1933 underscores the regulatory framework governing such transactions. Potential investors should note that the indemnification provisions serve as a risk mitigation tool for underwriters, which can influence the underwriting discount and, consequently, the net proceeds for the company. It is imperative to understand these legal nuances as they directly affect the transaction's structure and the company's financial outcomes. 03/27/2024 - 05:30 PM London, United Kingdom--(Newsfile Corp. - March 27, 2024) - On March 24, 2024, Akanda Corp.

Despite challenges, the company saw growth in various segments. Net Sales for Q4 were $1.4 billion, up 2% YoY, with a Net Loss of $18 million. Full year 2023 Net Sales were $6.0 billion, down 11% YoY, with a Net Loss of $238 million. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 was $176 million and $1.0 billion for the full year. Positive Chemours Company reported a 2% increase in Net Sales for Q4 2023 compared to the prior year. The company's Adjusted Net Income for Q4 was $46 million, compared to $480 thousand in the prior-year quarter. Full year 2023 saw a Net Loss of $238 million for Chemours, with Adjusted Net Income of $425 million. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 2023 improved by 47% YoY to $176 million, primarily driven by favorable demand in the Thermal & Specialized Solutions segment. For the full year 2023, Adjusted EBITDA was $1.0 billion, down 25% from the previous year, mainly due to weaker results in Titanium Technologies and Advanced Performance Materials. Negative Full year 2023 Net Sales decreased by 11% compared to 2022, reflecting challenges in certain key end markets. The company reported a Net Loss of $238 million for the year, indicating financial struggles. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2023 decreased by 25% from the previous year, impacting overall financial performance. Market Research Analyst The financial results of Chemours for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 present mixed signals, which are critical for market participants to dissect. The modest 2% year-over-year increase in Q4 net sales juxtaposed against a full-year 11% decline indicates a complex operating environment. While the company cites 'prolonged destocking in certain key end markets' as a contributing factor, it's essential to understand the broader industrial chemical sector's cyclical nature. The Titanium Technologies (TT) segment's performance, with a significant 21% annual sales drop, reflects this cyclicality, influenced by global economic conditions and demand fluctuations in end markets such as paints and coatings.Despite the net loss, the reported growth in the Thermal & Specialized Solutions (TSS) segment is noteworthy, as it signifies a shift towards sustainable products like low global warming potential refrigerants. This trend aligns with broader environmental regulatory changes and consumer preferences, which could position Chemours favorably in the long term. However, the Advanced Performance Materials (APM) segment's downturn, particularly in economically sensitive markets, raises concerns about Chemours' exposure to economic downturns and its ability to diversify its portfolio to mitigate such risks.The company's liquidity position, with a net leverage ratio of approximately 2.8x, remains within manageable levels, but the $600 million expected decrease in unrestricted cash in the first half of 2024 could pressure financial flexibility. Investors should monitor how Chemours navigates these cash flow dynamics, especially in light of the recent PFAS-related litigation settlements which have significantly impacted the financials. Financial Analyst The financial performance of Chemours, particularly the significant net loss of $238 million for the full year, is a red flag for investors. The Adjusted EBITDA of $1.0 billion, down 25% from 2022, further underscores the operational challenges faced. However, the improvement in Q4 Adjusted EBITDA by 47% year-over-year suggests some recovery, potentially driven by cost savings from the Titanium Technologies Transformation Plan and favorable demand in the TSS segment. These factors may offer a cushion against the overall negative performance.From an investment perspective, the litigation settlement charges of $639 million ($764 million pre-tax) are a substantial one-time expense that skews the year-over-year comparison. Excluding these charges, the Adjusted Net Income paints a more stable picture. Yet, the underlying business challenges, such as the decline in TT and APM segments, cannot be ignored. Investors should consider the potential for rebound in these segments, given the cyclical nature of the industry. The stock buyback of $69 million indicates a level of confidence by management in the company's intrinsic value, which may be a positive signal to the market.It's important to note the seasonality in Chemours' cash flow, with a historical pattern of working capital use in the first half of the year. The expected decrease in cash balance in the first half of 2024 should be weighed against the potential for recovery in the latter half. The finalization of the PFAS litigation settlement will also remove a significant uncertainty, potentially leading to a more favorable view of the company's financial health. Legal Expert The impact of litigation settlements on Chemours' financials cannot be overstated, with a notable $592 million allocated for PFAS-related drinking water claims. This settlement, while a substantial financial burden, may ultimately serve to mitigate long-term legal risks and associated costs. The court approval received on February 26, 2024, for the settlement points to a resolution of these legacy issues, which could restore investor confidence in the company's governance and risk management.The legal proceedings have led to significant accounting implications, with the company maintaining $603 million in restricted cash related to the settlement. Upon final judgment, expected in 2024, the derecognition of the restricted cash and associated accrued liabilities will clarify the balance sheet. Investors should appreciate the importance of this legal resolution, as it not only affects liquidity but also investor sentiment towards the company's future obligations and potential for similar risks. 03/27/2024 - 05:25 PM WILMINGTON, Del.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Chemours Company (“Chemours” or “the Company”) (NYSE: CC), a global chemistry company with leading market positions in Titanium Technologies (“TT”), Thermal & Specialized Solutions (“TSS”), and Advanced Performance Materials (“APM”), today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. Key Fourth Quarter 2023 Results Net Sales of $1.4 billion, up 2% year-over-year Net Loss attributable to Chemours of $18 million, or a loss of $0.12 per diluted share Adjusted Net Income1, which primarily excludes $62 million ($89 million pre-tax) in litigation settlement charges, was $46 million, compared to $480 thousand in the corresponding prior-year quarter Adjusted Net Income per diluted share of $0.31, compared to $0.00 per diluted share in the corresponding prior-year quarter Adjusted EBITDA1,2, which primarily excludes litigation settlement charges of $89 million, was $176 million, compared to $120 million in the corresponding prior-year quarter Operating Cash Flow of $482 million and capital expenditures of $135 million Key Full Year 2023 Results Net Sales of $6.0 billion, down 11% year-over-year Net Loss attributable to Chemours of $238 million, or a loss of $1.60 per share Adjusted Net Income1, which primarily excludes $639 million ($764 million pre-tax) in litigation settlement charges, was $425 million, compared to $738 million in the prior year Adjusted Net Income per diluted share of $2.82, compared to $4.66 per diluted share in the prior year Adjusted EBITDA1,2, which primarily excludes litigation settlement charges of $764 million, was $1.0 billion, compared to $1.4 billion in the prior year Operating Cash Flow of $556 million and capital expenditures of $370 million “Chemours navigated a challenging year in 2023 that included prolonged destocking in certain key end markets, and these headwinds impacted our overall financial performance,” said Chemours CEO Denise Dignam. “Our fourth quarter performance reflected continued growth for our low global warming potential refrigerants in our Thermal & Specialized Solutions segment, double-digit growth in the Performance Solutions portfolio of our Advanced Performance Materials segment, and improved demand for titanium dioxide across most regions in the Titanium Technologies segment. Over the course of the year, we realized meaningful cost savings from our Titanium Technologies Transformation Plan, continued our investments in growth markets in Thermal & Specialized Solutions and Advanced Performance Materials, and made significant progress resolving certain legacy issues.” Fourth quarter 2023 Net Sales of $1.4 billion were 2% higher than the prior-year quarter, with volumes increasing 3%, offset by a 1% decrease in price. Net Sales increased primarily due to a 7% increase in TT and a 17% increase in TSS, mostly offset by a 15% decline in APM. ___________________________________________ 1 Non-GAAP measures, including Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA, referred to throughout, principally exclude the impact of recent litigation settlements for legacy environmental matters and associated fees, in addition to other unallocated items – please refer to the attached ""Reconciliation of GAAP Financial Measures to Non-GAAP Financial Measures (Unaudited)”. 2 Adjusted EBITDA excludes net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization, and all remaining provision for income taxes from Adjusted Net Income.

TT segment fourth quarter 2023 Net Sales were $651 million, up 7% compared to the fourth quarter 2022. The increase in Net Sales was due to a 12% increase in volume and a 1% currency tailwind, partly offset by a 6% decrease in price. Volume increased due to stronger demand in all regions, excluding North America. Price declines in market-exposed channels were partially offset by contractual price increases. Versus the prior-year quarter, Adjusted EBITDA increased by 52% to $64 million, with Adjusted EBITDA Margin up 300 basis points to 10%, driven by the aforementioned increase in sales volume and the cost savings realized from the Titanium Technologies Transformation Plan, which were in-line with previous expectations. TT segment full year 2023 Net Sales were $2.7 billion, down 21% vs. the prior year. The decrease in Net Sales was primarily attributable to decreases in volume of 20% and price of 1%. Volume decreased due to the continuation of a cyclical downturn that started in 2022, with volume declines slowing on a year-over-year basis as the year progressed, as evidenced by the fourth quarter 2023 segment results described above. Price decreased in comparison with the prior year as contractual price increases were more than offset by decreases in the market-exposed customer portfolio. Currency impact was flat when compared to the prior year. Versus the prior year, 2023 Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 52% to $290 million, with Adjusted EBITDA Margin down 700 basis points to 11%, driven by the aforementioned decreases in sales volume and price, the effects of inflation on costs, and lower fixed cost absorption due to lower production volume, partially offset by the cost savings realized from the Titanium Technologies Transformation Plan.

Versus the prior-year quarter, Adjusted EBITDA was $40 million, down 34% year-over-year, with Adjusted EBITDA Margin down 400 basis points to 12%, driven by the aforementioned decrease in sales volume driving lower fixed cost absorption, and an extended outage for maintenance and improvements at one of the Company’s manufacturing sites, partially offset by lower raw material costs. APM segment full year 2023 Net Sales were $1.4 billion, down 11% vs. the prior year. The decrease in Net Sales was driven by a decrease in volume of 16%, partially offset by an increase in price of 6%. Volume decreased primarily due to demand softening in the Advanced Materials portfolio, which serves more economically sensitive end-markets. Price increased due to expanded sales in high-value end-markets in the Performance Solutions portfolio, including advanced electronics and clean energy, as well as pricing actions taken to offset higher raw material costs in the Advanced Materials portfolio. Unfavorable currency movements added a 1% headwind. Performance Solutions portfolio’s full year 2023 Net Sales were $546 million, up 11% vs. the prior year. Advanced Materials portfolio’s full year 2023 Net Sales were $897 million, down 20% vs. the prior year. Versus the prior year, 2023 Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 26% to $273 million, with Adjusted EBITDA Margin down 400 basis points to 19%, driven by the aforementioned decrease in sales volume driving lower fixed cost absorption, the impact of higher raw material costs due to the continued effects of inflation, and an extended plant outage for maintenance and improvement activities at one of the Company’s manufacturing sites. Other Segment The Performance Chemicals and Intermediates business in the Company’s Other Segment had Net Sales and Adjusted EBITDA for fourth quarter 2023 of $11 million and breakeven, respectively, and $85 million and $18 million, respectively, for full year 2023. Corporate Expenses4 Corporate Expenses were $49 million in fourth quarter 2023, up $11 million vs. the prior-year quarter, an increase primarily driven by higher legacy environmental and legal costs. Corporate Expenses were $212 million in full year 2023, flat vs. the prior year. ___________________________________________ 4 Previously reported as Corporate and Other and excludes unallocated items. Liquidity As of December 31, 2023, consolidated gross debt was $4.1 billion. Debt, net of $1.2 billion in cash, was $2.9 billion, resulting in a net leverage ratio of approximately 2.8x times on a trailing twelve-month Adjusted EBITDA basis. Total liquidity was $2.1 billion, comprised of $1.2 billion in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, and $0.9 billion of revolving credit facility capacity, net of outstanding letters of credit. In addition, Chemours maintained $604 million in restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents, primarily held in the Water District Settlement Fund per the terms of the U.S. public water system settlement agreement discussed above. Cash provided by operating activities was $556 million in full year 2023, down from $755 million in the prior year, driven primarily by lower earnings and PFAS-related litigation settlements of $66 million, partially offset by the working capital actions outlined in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (“Form 10-K”) that has been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Capital expenditures were $370 million, lower than originally projected due to project timing. During the year, the Company repurchased $69 million of common stock. The Company also amended and extended its EUR and USD term loans, increasing aggregate borrowing by $400 million, as previously reported. Cash provided by operating activities for the fourth quarter of 2023, which includes certain PFAS-related litigation settlements of $29 million, was $482 million, up $321 million from the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by improved earnings and the net working capital actions discussed in the Form 10-K. Capital expenditures for fourth quarter 2023 were $135 million vs. $67 million in the prior-year quarter. While the Company has historically generated operating cash flows through various past industry and economic cycles, the Company sees a historical pattern of seasonality, comprising a working capital use of cash in the first half of the year, primarily driven by seasonal accounts receivable timing. During the second half of 2024, the Company expects a working capital source of cash as it sells product from inventory and collects receivables from customers. Based on these seasonal trends and the impact of the net working capital actions, the Company currently expects its unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance to decrease by approximately $600 million in the first half of 2024, with a majority of the decrease occurring in the first quarter of 2024. On February 26, 2024, the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina entered a final order and judgment for the comprehensive settlement of PFAS-related drinking water claims for a defined class of U.S. public water systems. On September 6, 2023, Chemours deposited its 50% share in the Water District Settlement Fund. DuPont and Corteva jointly contributed the remaining 50%. The settlement remains subject to the condition that this approval reach final judgment in accordance with the settlement agreement. Upon final judgment, which the Company expects to occur in 2024, Chemours will no longer maintain its reversionary interest in the underlying restricted funds within the Water District Settlement Fund and, as such, the restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents and the associated accrued liabilities will be derecognized. Outlook The Company expects an approximate 10% sequential decline in TT Net Sales for first quarter 2024 due to weaker demand for TiO2 driven by some regional seasonality and a discrete, now resolved production challenge, resulting in an expected decline in TT Adjusted EBITDA of approximately 15% vs. the fourth quarter of 2023. As we exit the first quarter, we are seeing positive trends in our order book from existing levels. TSS is expected to grow approximately 20% sequentially in both Net Sales and Adjusted EBITDA in first quarter 2024, driven by seasonality and demand for Opteon™ Blend products, attributable to the regulatory transition and continued growth in low global warming potential solutions. This is expected to be partially offset by higher input costs from non-Corpus Christi sourced materials as well as investment in next generation refrigerants and immersion cooling. The Company anticipates continued growth in our TSS business. For APM, the Company projects a sequential decline of approximately 10% in Net Sales for first quarter 2024, driven by softness in economically-sensitive end markets and the tail impact of an extended outage at a manufacturing site that is now resolved. Adjusted EBITDA for first quarter 2024 is anticipated to be approximately 20% lower sequentially. Absent manufacturing issues, APM would have been relatively flat sequentially. APM is nearing typical cycle lows, and, given where the Advanced Materials portfolio sits in the value chain, the Company expects the business to lag overall market recovery by about six to nine months. The Performance Solutions portfolio remains the growth engine for APM. However, in the near-term, Performance Solutions’ growth path is facing two temporary headwinds – capacity constraints driven by pending permit approvals and slower than expected development of the hydrogen market. Corporate expenses impacting Adjusted EBITDA for first quarter 2024 are expected to be higher by approximately $30 million sequentially. We expect first quarter 2024 Operating Cash Flow to be an outflow of approximately $400 million, attributable to working capital dynamics that include seasonal accounts receivable timing and the unwind of year-end net working capital timing actions. We anticipate first quarter capital expenditures to be approximately $100 million. For the first quarter 2024, we expect consolidated Net Sales to be flat to slightly down sequentially, with consolidated Adjusted EBITDA down approximately 10% compared with fourth quarter 2023 results.

Adjusted Net Income is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Chemours, adjusted for items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, except interest expense, depreciation, amortization, and certain provision for (benefit from) income tax amounts. Net Leverage Ratio is defined as our total debt principal, net, or our total debt principal outstanding less unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, divided by Adjusted EBITDA. The Company revised its September 30, 2023 non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA calculation to (1) remove previous adjustments related to the write-off of certain raw materials and stores inventories and (2) correct the understatement of accrued liabilities for steam supplier contract litigation stemming from the decommissioning of the Kuan Yin, Taiwan manufacturing facility.

In 2022, includes asset charges and write-offs resulting from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and our decision to suspend our business with Russian entities. (2) Refer to “Note 8 – Other Income (Expense), Net” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 for further details. (3) Includes $7 million of costs associated with the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities entered into during 2023, which is discussed in further detail in ""Note 20 – Debt"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, and $9 million of third-party costs related to the Titanium Technologies Transformation Plan. (4) Qualified spend recovery represents costs and expenses that were previously excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, reimbursable by DuPont and/or Corteva as part of our cost-sharing agreement under the terms of the MOU which is discussed in further detail in ""Note 22 – Commitments and Contingent Liabilities"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. (5) Litigation-related charges pertains to litigation settlements, PFOA drinking water treatment accruals, and other related legal fees. For the year ended December 31, 2023, litigation-related charges includes the $592 million accrual related to the United States Public Water System Class Action Suit Settlement plus $24 million of third-party legal fees directly related to the settlement, $55 million of charges related to the Company's portion of Chemours, DuPont, Corteva, EID and the State of Ohio's agreement entered into in November 2023, $13 million related to the Company's portion of the supplemental payment to the State of Delaware, $76 million for other PFAS litigation matters, and $4 million of other litigation matters. For the year ended December 31, 2022, litigation-related charges primarily include proceeds from a settlement in a patent infringement matter relating to certain copolymer patents associated with the Company’s Advanced Performance Materials segment and $20 million associated with the Company's portion of the potential loss in the single matter not included in the Leach settlement. See “Note 22 – Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for further details. (6) Environmental charges pertains to management’s assessment of estimated liabilities associated with certain environmental remediation expenses at various sites. In 2022, environmental charges include $196 million related to on-site and off-site remediation costs at Fayetteville. See “Note 22 – Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for further details. (7) Includes the removal of certain discrete income tax impacts within our provision for income taxes, such as shortfalls and windfalls on our share-based payments, certain return-to-accrual adjustments, valuation allowance adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on foreign exchange rate changes, and other discrete income tax items. (8) The income tax impacts included in this caption are determined using the applicable rates in the taxing jurisdictions in which income or expense occurred for each of the reconciling items and represent both current and deferred income tax expense or benefit based on the nature of the non-GAAP financial measure. (9) Net Leverage Ratio calculated using GAAP measures is defined as our total debt principal, net, or our total debt principal outstanding less unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, divided by (loss) income before income taxes. Net Leverage Ratio calculated using non-GAAP measures is defined as our total debt principal, net, or our total debt principal outstanding less unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, divided by Adjusted EBITDA. (10) In periods where the Company incurs a net loss, the impact of potentially dilutive securities is excluded from the calculation of EPS under U.S. GAAP, as their inclusion would have an anti-dilutive effect. As such, with respect to the U.S. GAAP measure of diluted EPS, the impact of potentially dilutive securities is excluded from our calculation for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and year ended December 31, 2023. With respect to the non-GAAP measure of adjusted diluted EPS, the impact of potentially dilutive securities is included in our calculation for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and the year ended December 31, 2023, as Adjusted Net Income was in a net income position. (11) Figures may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated based on unrounded numbers. Reconciliation of GAAP Financial Measures to Non-GAAP Financial Measures (Unaudited) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) GAAP Earnings per Share to Adjusted Earnings per Share Reconciliation Adjusted earnings per share (“Adjusted EPS”) is calculated by dividing Adjusted Net Income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted Adjusted EPS accounts for the dilutive impact of stock-based compensation awards, which includes unvested restricted shares. Diluted Adjusted EPS considers the impact of potentially-dilutive securities, except in periods in which there is a loss because the inclusion of the potentially-dilutive securities would have an anti-dilutive effect.

The company is implementing a remediation plan to address these issues. Positive None. Negative Material weaknesses identified in internal controls over financial reporting Delayed payments and accelerated collections impacting financial statements Lack of transparency with the Company's Board of Directors by former senior management members Financial Analyst The disclosure by Chemours regarding material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting is a significant concern for investors and stakeholders. From a financial perspective, the identification of material weaknesses suggests potential risks in the accuracy and reliability of financial statements. Although the company asserts that no material misstatements occurred, the need for immaterial revisions indicates lapses in financial oversight. Investors should consider the implications of these findings on the company's financial integrity and the effectiveness of its management team.Moreover, the delayed payments and accelerated collection of receivables could affect liquidity ratios and working capital management, which are key indicators of a company's short-term financial health. The fact that these activities were not transparently communicated to the Board raises questions about corporate governance practices. The long-term impact will depend on the company's ability to effectively implement remediation plans and restore confidence among investors and regulators. Corporate Governance Expert Chemours' announcement touches upon core issues of corporate governance and transparency. The lack of communication with the Board by former senior management members could be indicative of broader oversight issues within the company. Actions taken by the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee to withhold cash and equity compensation from these individuals serve as a corrective measure and signal to stakeholders that the Board is addressing the governance lapses.Investors should be attentive to the forthcoming proxy statement for further details on these actions. The effectiveness of the Board's oversight functions, particularly the Audit Committee, will be under scrutiny as the company moves forward with its remediation plan. The proactive disclosure of these issues, while unsettling, also provides an opportunity for the company to demonstrate its commitment to strengthening its governance mechanisms and internal controls. Risk Management Analyst The identification of material weaknesses by Chemours is a clear signal to risk management professionals to reassess the company's risk profile. While the weaknesses did not result in material misstatements, they expose the company to increased scrutiny from regulators and investors alike. The acceleration of receivables and delayed vendor payments could be interpreted as aggressive accounting practices, potentially designed to enhance financial results.Investors should monitor the company's progress in implementing its remediation plan, as success in this area could mitigate some of the risks posed by these weaknesses. However, failure to address these issues promptly and effectively could lead to reputational damage, regulatory penalties and a loss of investor confidence. The company's future financial disclosures will likely be viewed with increased skepticism until it can demonstrate a strengthened control environment. 03/27/2024 - 05:30 PM Discloses Material Weaknesses and Remediation Plan WILMINGTON, Del.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Chemours Company (“Chemours” or “the Company”) (NYSE: CC), a global chemistry company with leading market positions in Titanium Technologies (“TT”), Thermal & Specialized Solutions (“TSS”), and Advanced Performance Materials (“APM”), today announced that, as disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed today, March 27, 2024, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has completed its planned procedures with respect to the internal review that the Company had previously disclosed on February 29, 2024, with an update provided on March 7, 2024. The Audit Committee’s internal review of working capital actions determined that payments of up to approximately $100 million were delayed until the first quarter of 2024, primarily to certain vendors that were originally due to be paid in the fourth quarter of 2023; and collection of up to approximately $260 million of receivables that were originally not due to be received until the first quarter of 2024 were accelerated into the fourth quarter of 2023. The Audit Committee’s review determined that similar actions, though to a lesser extent, were taken in the fourth quarter of 2022, resulting in a delay of up to approximately $40 million of payments to vendors that were originally due to be paid in the fourth quarter of 2022 until the first quarter of 2023; and the acceleration of the collection of up to approximately $175 million of receivables into the fourth quarter of 2022 that were originally not due to be received until the first quarter of 2023. The Audit Committee’s internal review determined that there was a lack of transparency with the Company's Board of Directors by three former members of senior management. The Compensation and Leadership Development Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors took the results of the Audit Committee’s internal review into account and exercised full negative discretion in making cash and equity compensation determinations with regard to these former members of senior management. Additional details regarding these Compensation and Leadership Development Committee actions will be included in the Company’s Compensation Discussion and Analysis in its proxy statement for its 2024 Annual Meeting, when filed. Material Weaknesses and Remediation Plan In connection with the Audit Committee’s internal review, management completed an evaluation of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 and identified four material weaknesses, the details of which can be found in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed today, March 27, 2024. The material weaknesses did not result in any material misstatements of the Company’s financial statements or disclosures but did result in immaterial revisions to the Company’s March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023 financial statements and a revision to the Company’s Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022 and the Company’s Statement of Cash Flows for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Potash, Phosphates, and Mosaic Fertilizantes all showed varying sales volumes and revenues compared to the previous year. The company provided guidance for the first quarter, expecting sales volumes and prices to remain within specified ranges. However, the Riverview phosphate fertilizer production facility experienced damage from a recent brushfire, potentially impacting production for up to six weeks. Positive None. Negative The Mosaic Company reported a decrease in sales volumes and revenues for Potash, Phosphates, and Mosaic Fertilizantes compared to the same period in the previous year. The company also mentioned the impact of low-margin product purchases to offset turnaround schedules, potentially affecting profitability. The damage to the Riverview facility from the brushfire could lead to production delays, impacting the company's operations and revenue stream. Market Research Analyst The report from The Mosaic Company provides a snapshot of the company's performance in the fertilizer sector, particularly focusing on sales volumes and revenue across its key business segments. A notable observation is the decline in sales revenue despite an increase in sales volume for potash when comparing year-over-year figures. This suggests that the company may be facing pricing pressure or increased competition. In the case of phosphates and Mosaic Fertilizantes, the sales volumes show a mixed trend with a decrease for Mosaic Fertilizantes and a slight increase for phosphates, but both segments experienced a reduction in revenue.Investors should consider the implications of these trends on the company's profitability and market share. The guidance ranges provided for the first quarter suggest management's expectations for stabilizing prices. However, the reliance on third-party low margin products to offset the impact of scheduled turnarounds could potentially dilute profit margins in the short term. Additionally, the damage to the Riverview facility, although described as limited, may introduce temporary operational challenges and could affect export capabilities to key markets like Brazil, potentially impacting future revenue streams. Financial Analyst When dissecting The Mosaic Company's financials, the divergence between sales volumes and revenues is a critical point of analysis. The drop in revenue for potash and Mosaic Fertilizantes, despite higher sales volumes for potash, indicates that the average selling price may have significantly decreased. This could reflect broader market dynamics such as oversupply or softening demand, which are vital factors for investors to monitor, considering their effect on the company's revenue trajectory.The provided guidance for potash sales volumes and prices indicates a level of pricing stability that management aims to achieve. However, the anticipated impact from the brushfire at the Riverview facility, albeit short-term, could introduce volatility into earnings estimates. The incident's timing and the production focus on exports to Brazil, a major market for fertilizers, underscore the importance of evaluating operational risks and their potential to disrupt supply chains and affect the company's performance. Agricultural Commodity Analyst From an agricultural commodities perspective, The Mosaic Company's performance reflects underlying trends in the global fertilizer market. The fluctuation in sales revenues despite varying sales volumes across their product lines points to the complex interplay of global supply, demand and pricing for potash and phosphate fertilizers. Factors such as crop prices, farming economics and geopolitical events can significantly influence these dynamics.Investors should note that the agricultural sector is cyclical and sensitive to external factors, which can lead to unpredictable swings in demand for fertilizers. The guidance provided for product prices is a useful indicator of the company's market expectations. However, the temporary production setback due to the Riverview facility incident could affect the company's ability to meet export demand, particularly in the Brazilian market, which may have broader implications for global fertilizer pricing and availability. 03/27/2024 - 05:22 PM TAMPA, FL / ACCESSWIRE / March 27, 2024 / The Mosaic Company (NYSE: MOS) announced its combined January and February 2024 sales volumes and revenue by business unit.Potash Jan/Feb 2024 Jan/Feb 2023 Sales volumes (000 tonnes(1)) 1,417 1,100 Sales revenues (million USD) $418 $542 Phosphates Jan/Feb 2024 Jan/Feb 2023 Sales volumes (000 tonnes(1)) 1,087 1,066 Sales revenues (million USD) $760 $827 Mosaic Fertilizantes Jan/Feb 2024 Jan/Feb 2023 Sales Volumes (000 tonnes(1)) 1,238 1,462 Sales Revenues (million USD) $650 $971 (1)Tonnes = finished product tonnesFor the first quarter, potash sales volumes and MOP prices at the mine are expected to be within the previous guidance range of 2.0-2.2 million tonnes, and $225-$250 per tonne, respectively.In Phosphates, first quarter sales volumes are expected to be within the previous guidance range of 1.6-1.8 million tonnes.

The price is final and non-provisional, signaling a significant improvement in commercial terms and consolidating Sigma Lithium's position as a leading global lithium producer. The product's superior quality, including high-purity and coarse particles, has garnered strong market interest and favorable commercial terms. The company's focus on maximizing value capture through closed private bidding and strategic marketing strategies with Glencore highlights its dedication to building a sustainable lithium supply chain for electric vehicles. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The recent announcement by Sigma Lithium regarding the increased premium price for their 8th shipment of lithium concentrate is a positive signal for the company's financial performance and market positioning. The 13% increase in the premium price, to US$ 1,333 per tonne, is a substantial uptick from previous shipments and reflects the company's ability to leverage its product quality and commercial strategy to negotiate better terms. This is particularly noteworthy given the current demand dynamics in the lithium market, which are driven by the burgeoning electric vehicle industry.The inclusion of a cash prepayment clause with 85% of the shipment's value collected upon loading also enhances Sigma Lithium's cash flow and reduces credit risk. As a Market Research Analyst, I observe that such terms are not common in the industry and suggest a strong buyer confidence in Sigma Lithium's product. This could set a precedent for future negotiations, not only for Sigma but potentially influencing industry standards for payment terms.The company's emphasis on carbon-neutral and sustainable practices aligns with the growing trend of environmental consciousness among consumers and investors. While the company does not currently receive a 'green premium', the focus on sustainability could provide a competitive edge and potentially attract ESG-focused investors, which is an increasingly influential segment in the stock market. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, Sigma Lithium's ability to secure a higher fixed price for its lithium concentrate directly impacts its revenue and margin outlook. The price being non-provisional suggests certainty in revenue recognition, which is favorable for financial planning and forecasting. The reported price is significantly above the industry average, which typically hovers around a percentage of the LME Lithium Hydroxide CIF/Fastmarkets CJK price. The premium price achieved by Sigma Lithium, equivalent to 8.75% of the LME Lithium Hydroxide CIF price, showcases the company's strong market position and the high perceived value of its product.It's important to note the strategic partnership with Glencore, a major player in the commodities market. This relationship could provide Sigma Lithium with additional market insights and negotiation power, possibly explaining the favorable terms achieved. For investors, this development suggests that Sigma Lithium has the potential to sustain or even improve its profitability, which could lead to a positive impact on its stock valuation in the short to medium term. However, it is also essential for investors to monitor the volatility of lithium prices and the potential impact of new supply entering the market. Sustainability Analyst As a Sustainability Analyst, I find Sigma Lithium's positioning as a producer of Quintuple Zero Green Chemical Grade Coarse Lithium particularly compelling. The company's focus on sustainability is not just a marketing point but a strategic differentiator that enhances its product offering. The fact that Sigma Lithium is able to command a premium price without explicitly charging for its green credentials indicates that customers value the environmental aspect of the product. This could imply a shift in the market where sustainability factors are becoming embedded in the product value rather than being considered an add-on.Furthermore, the company's emphasis on high-purity and coarse particle size, which contributes to the efficiency of lithium refining processes, speaks to a broader industry trend towards improving supply chain efficiencies. In the long term, Sigma Lithium's approach could encourage other market players to adopt similar sustainable practices, potentially leading to industry-wide benefits such as reduced environmental impact and improved social governance. 03/27/2024 - 05:23 PM Sigma Lithium achieved an increased premium fixed price of US$ 1,333/t (13% VAT included), equivalent to US$ 1,160/t (net of VAT) for its 8th shipment of 22,000 tonnes for delivery within 2 weeks.Price discovery was driven through closed private bidding, aiming to maximize the value of its commercial shipment strategy with Glencore.This price is final and non-provisional and represents a meaningful increase over the previous premium prices achieved. As a reference, the final price net of VAT is equivalent to 8.75% of the LME Lithium Hydroxide CIF SÃO PAULO, March 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Sigma Lithium Corporation (""Sigma Lithium"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: SGML, BVMF: S2GM34, TSXV: SGML), a leading global lithium producer dedicated to powering the next generation of electric vehicles with carbon neutral and sustainable, chemical grade lithium concentrate with granulated-particles (""Quintuple Zero Green Chemical Grade Coarse Lithium"" or ""Product""), is pleased to announce it achieved an increased premium final price of US$ 1,333/t (13% VAT included), equivalent to US$ 1,160/t (net of VAT) for its 8th shipment of 22,000 tonnes currently being delivered to its EXW warehouse at the Port of Vitoria in Brazil. This price is final and non-provisional and represents a meaningful increase over the previous premium prices achieved by the Company. As a reference, the final price net of VAT is equivalent to 8.75% of the LME Lithium Hydroxide CIF/Fastmarkets CJK price.Price discovery was driven through closed private bidding, aiming to maximize the value of its commercial shipment strategy. Sigma Lithium will continue to adapt its marketing strategy to maximize value capture.Included in the agreement is a cash prepayment clause, with 85% of the shipment's value collected by loading. The shipment is part of a commercial distribution and marketing agreement with Glencore that aims to build a low carbon, environmentally and socially sustainable global lithium supply chain for electric vehicles.This milestone achievement represents a significant improvement in commercial terms for Sigma Lithium, consolidating our leadership in the industry as a large-scale producer of Quintuple Zero Green Chemical Grade Coarse Lithium. The premium achieved demonstrates the product's superior quality (chemically and physically quantifiable), as follows: High-purity: low alkalines and low iron oxide enable improved performance of refineries during transformation of the material into high-purity battery grade chemicals certified by leading battery producers.Coarse particles over 5.5mm: improve efficiency and performance for refiners during calcination.Sigma Lithium Commercial Director, Catarina Noci, notes: ""The Company continues to field inbound interest at a feverish pace for our next shipments. We were on the ground in China over the last month with Glencore where it became clear to us that our Quintuple Zero Green Chemical Grade Coarse Lithium concentrate gained significant market share, delivering measurable savings to our customers' refineries as a result of our Products' superior physical and chemical properties. Our Product becomes increasingly valuable to our customers when markets are soft, where non-integrated refiners and tollers alike are experiencing tighter operating margins. Sigma Lithium views the warm welcome, incredible demand and favorable commercial terms extended to us, as a reflection of the customers having experienced, over the last 7 months, the remarkable performance and cost savings that Sigma Lithium's Product brings to their refineries. Therefore, we were able to monetize these tangible costs savings provided to our customers by the Product into a ""high quality premium"". Company CEO, Ana Cabral-Gardner notes, ""The Company is now fully established as a leading producer, as a result of consistently delivering large scale shipments of a high-quality Quintuple Zero Green Chemical Grade Coarse Lithium over the last 9 months. Therefore, we entered negotiation rounds for our 8th shipment with significant commercial leverage. The increased premiumization is attributable to the superior performance of our Product for our refining clients who were able to ascertain its efficiency gains and cost savings. Additionally, as a ""free bonus"" we deliver the only Quintuple Zero Green Lithium in the industry, without receiving a green premium.

The company signed new orders and strengthened its core business by extending leases at Gamma Knife sites. AMS also made progress in international markets, completing equipment upgrades in Ecuador and planning to open a new center in Puebla, Mexico. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in total revenue and proton therapy revenue by American Shared Hospital Services is a positive indicator of the company's growth, particularly in the proton therapy segment which saw a substantial 36.0% increase in revenue. This suggests a successful expansion in services or market share in this area. However, the decrease in Gamma Knife revenue by 5.3% is concerning, as it points to potential challenges in this service line, possibly due to competition or technological advancements that are making Gamma Knife less attractive. The gross margin improvement is also notable, indicating better cost management or pricing power.From a financial perspective, the increase in Adjusted EBITDA is a key metric for investors as it suggests improved operational efficiency. The company's ability to generate more earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for non-recurring items, is important for servicing any debt and funding expansion. Furthermore, the increase in cash reserves provides the company with more liquidity, potentially for further investments or to weather any market downturns. Market Research Analyst The expansion news, such as the acquisition of radiation therapy centers in Rhode Island and the international equipment upgrades, indicates a strategic move to solidify and expand the company's footprint in the oncology services market. The launch of a new center in Mexico could tap into an underserved market and contribute to future revenue growth. These developments could make the company more competitive and diversified geographically.However, the Gamma Knife segment seems to be underperforming, which may reflect shifts in industry preferences or technology. It's essential to monitor if this trend is isolated or indicative of a broader move away from Gamma Knife technology in favor of other treatment modalities. This could have long-term implications for the company's equipment investment strategy and market positioning. Healthcare Industry Analyst The oncology healthcare sector is rapidly evolving with technological advancements and increased demand for non-invasive treatment options. American Shared Hospital Services' investment in state-of-the-art equipment, like the Gamma Knife ICON, is essential to maintain a competitive edge. However, the decrease in Gamma Knife procedures raises questions about the technology's lifecycle and the company's strategy to address this downturn. It is important to evaluate whether this is due to temporary factors, such as the downtime for equipment upgrades, or if it signals a more permanent decline in demand for Gamma Knife treatments.Furthermore, the company's focus on international growth, particularly in regions like Ecuador and Mexico, suggests a strategic emphasis on emerging markets. These regions may offer higher growth potential due to less saturation and increasing healthcare expenditure. The company's success in these markets could be a key driver of future performance, assuming they can navigate the regulatory and operational challenges inherent in international expansion. 03/27/2024 - 05:12 PM - Acquisition of 3 Rhode Island Radiation Therapy Cancer Centers progressing toward closing- - International Cancer Center equipment upgrade completed in Ecuador, Opening new Puebla, Mexico Center in Q2- - Lease extensions signed at 4 of 10 Gamma Knife customer sites – -Sales Pipeline continues to advance- -Conference Call Thursday, March 28th at 12:00 pm ET / 9:00 am PT - SAN FRANCISCO, March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- American Shared Hospital Services (NYSE American: AMS) (the ""Company""), a leading provider of turnkey technology solutions for stereotactic radiosurgery and advanced radiation therapy cancer treatment systems and services, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023. Fourth Quarter 2023 Highlights Total revenue in the fourth quarter was $5,698,000, an increase of 13.1% from the comparable period in 2022. Total proton therapy revenue increased 36.0% period-over-period; fractions increased 30.0%. Gamma Knife revenue decreased 5.3% period-over-period; procedures decreased 15.8% due to the expiration of two customer agreements and downtime at two sites for the installation of upgraded equipment.Gross margin was $2,816,000, a period-over-period increase of 24.1%. The gross margin percentage was 49.4% of revenue.Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $407,000 compared to operating income of $590,000 in the fourth quarter of 2022. The 2023 period includes an increase in reserves for impaired assets and removal costs of $362,000 in the current period compared to zero in the prior year period.Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $2,679,000 for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $2,161,000 for the fourth quarter of 2022.Cash at December 31, 2023 was $13,808,000 compared to $12,453,000 at December 31, 2022.Signed one new order with an existing domestic Gamma Knife customer for a reload of new cobalt sources and software, and a second in January 2024 for an Esprit upgrade and Cobalt-60 reload. Ray Stachowiak, Executive Chairman of American Shared Hospital Services, commented, “2023 was a good year for AMS with continual improvement each quarter. The new sales team jelled as the year progressed and we ended with the strongest sales pipeline in many years. We also strengthened our core business with the signing of four lease extensions from our base of ten Gamma Knife sites and there are others in discussion. Internationally, we completed the equipment upgrade in Ecuador in the fourth quarter, and patient volumes are already growing strongly with the new state-of-the-art Gamma Knife ICON now in place, the only Gamma Knife in Ecuador for non-invasive radiosurgery. We’re especially excited about the opening of our newest international center in Puebla, Mexico, where we now expect to begin treating patients in the second quarter after slight ground delays. “During the year we invested $919,000 in three unique business opportunities and were excited to announce the first during the fourth quarter. This was the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire a 60% majority interest in three Radiation Therapy Cancer Centers in Rhode Island, which will be the Company’s first direct patient services, or retail, centers in the U.S. We’re progressing towards closing and we plan to disclose more details of these new revenue streams at that time. “The fourth quarter was the strongest of the year, with revenue growth of 13% to $5.7 million, and gross margin of $2.8 million, a 24% increase from the comparable period, reflecting continued efficiencies and operating leverage from the sales increase. The gross margin percentage reached 49.4%, the highest since 2019. For the fourth quarter we earned $0.06 per share despite the headwinds of $350,000 in Rhode Island costs and $362,000 of additional reserves on impaired assets. For the full year, we earned $0.10 per share despite Rhode Island expenses of $919,000 and additional reserves for impaired assets and removal costs of $940,000. We expect these headwinds to significantly decrease in 2024. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we ended the year with cash and equivalents of $13.8 million, or approximately $2.19 per share.” Peter Gaccione, Chief Executive Officer of AMS, added, “In addition to building a stronger sales team, we expanded our product portfolio and increased our capacity for creative financial solutions, which together has resulted in significantly increasing the breadth of opportunities for our consideration. Although the sales cycle for this sophisticated equipment is long, our sales pipeline is advancing and we look forward to announcing additional projects at the appropriate time. We’re proud that many of our Gamma Knife customer base has signed lease extension agreements with us this year, which we believe is a testament to our partnership business model and financial flexibility. Our in-house customer advocate, a recent new position, has been an important asset in these discussions at our Gamma Knife sites. “With our newest international centers now having the most advanced radiotherapy cancer treatment systems in their regions, the Rhode Island opportunity advancing, our core business strong, and supported by our strong balance sheet and consistent cash flow, we believe that American Shared Hospital Services is well positioned for future growth,” concluded Mr. Gaccione. Financial Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 For the three months ended December 31, 2023, revenue increased 13.1% to $5,698,000 compared to $5,037,000 in the year-ago period. Rental revenue from the Company’s medical equipment leasing (“leasing”) segment was $4,785,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $4,273,000 for the same period in the prior year, an increase of 12.0%. Revenue from the Company’s direct patient services (“retail”) segment was $913,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $764,000 for the same period in the prior year, an increase of 19.5%. Fourth quarter revenue for the Company's proton therapy system installed at Orlando Health in Florida increased 35.9% to $3,055,000 compared to revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022 of $2,247,000 primarily due to continued increases in average reimbursement as well as the increase in fractions. Total proton therapy fractions in the fourth quarter were 1,275 compared to 981 proton therapy fractions in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of 30.0% or 294 fractions, which is within the typical quarterly fluctuation range. Total revenue for the Company's Gamma Knife operations decreased 5.3% to $2,643,000 for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $2,790,000 for the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease in overall Gamma Knife revenue was primarily due to a decrease in procedures from two expired contracts as well as downtime at two sites for the installation of upgraded equipment. Total Gamma Knife procedures decreased by 15.8% to 277 for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to 329 in the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting the two expired contracts and downtime for upgrades. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2023 increased 24.1% to $2,816,000, or 49.4% of revenue, compared to gross margin of $2,270,000, or 45.1% of revenue, for the fourth quarter of 2022. Selling and administrative costs increased by 23.9% to $1,760,000 for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $1,420,000 for the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher sales, marketing and related fees associated with new business opportunities. Net interest expense was $175,000 in the 2023 period compared to $192,000 in the comparable period of last year. The decrease is due to an increase in the interest rate on the Company’s variable rate debt offset by increases in interest income on the Company’s growing cash balance. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $407,000 compared to operating income of $590,000 in the fourth quarter of 2022, which reflects higher selling and administrative expense as well as an increase in reserves for impaired assets and removal costs of $362,000 in the current period. Income tax expense was $338,000 for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to income tax expense of $333,000 for the same period in the prior year. The modest increase in income tax expense for the current period was primarily due to higher taxable income offset by permanent domestic tax differences recorded in the prior year. Net income attributable to American Shared Hospital Services in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $415,000, or $0.06 per diluted share, compared to net income of $246,000, or $0.04 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2022. The period-over-period decrease was primarily due to higher interest expense, higher selling and administrative expenses in support of the Company’s pursuit of new business opportunities and the increase in reserves for impaired assets and removal costs. Fully diluted weighted average common shares outstanding were 6,552,000 and 6,284,000 for the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $2,679,000 for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $2,161,000 for the fourth quarter of 2022. Financial Results for the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, revenue increased 8.0% to $21,325,000 compared to revenue of $19,746,000 for the twelve months of 2022.

Gamma Knife revenue increased 1.8% to $10,992,000 for the twelve months of 2023 compared to $10,794,000 for the twelve months of 2022.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure Adjusted EBITDA, the non-GAAP measure presented in this press release and supplementary information, is not a measure of performance under the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""GAAP""). This non-GAAP financial measure has limitations as an analytical tool, including that it does not have a standardized meaning. When assessing our operating performance, this non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered a substitute for, and investors should also consider, income before income taxes, income from operations, net income attributable to the Company, earnings per share and other measures of performance as defined by GAAP as indicators of the Company's performance or profitability. EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure representing our earnings before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation, and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, interest income, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense, loss on write down of impaired assets and associated removal costs, and stock-based compensation expense. We use this non-GAAP financial measure as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain expenses and charges that may not be indicative of the operating results of our recurring core business, such as stock-based compensation expense. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to this non-GAAP financial measure in assessing our performance.

Market diversification boosted sales, with 4th quarter orders up 2%. 2024 revenue is expected to range from $145 million to $155 million, including the recent acquisition of Alfamation. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results show a mixed picture for inTEST Corporation. While the annual revenue growth of 6% and net income increase of 10% are positive indicators, the decline in fourth quarter revenue by 14% year-over-year raises concerns. The growth in defense/aerospace and industrial markets is a positive sign of diversification, which can help stabilize the company against the volatility of the semiconductor market. However, the contraction in gross margin and the decrease in operating income suggest potential challenges in cost management or pricing pressures.The acquisition of Alfamation could be seen as a strategic move to enhance test and automation capabilities and expand market presence. Investors should monitor how this acquisition integrates with inTEST's operations and whether it contributes to revenue growth and margin improvement as anticipated. The cash flow generation is robust and the solid balance sheet with a significant cash increase and debt reduction provides financial flexibility. This could be beneficial for pursuing further growth initiatives or weathering potential market downturns. Market Research Analyst The industrial and defense/aerospace sectors have shown resilience and growth for inTEST Corporation, which is a testament to the company's market diversification strategy. The semiconductor sector's reported weakness is a known industry trend and inTEST's ability to offset this with strength in other markets is noteworthy. The acquisition of Alfamation and the establishment of a new Center of Excellence in Malaysia indicate a proactive approach to capturing market opportunities and expanding global reach.Looking ahead, the projected revenue range for 2024 suggests cautious optimism, factoring in the Alfamation acquisition. The company's focus on innovation and talent attraction is likely aimed at maintaining competitive advantage and driving organic growth. Investors should consider the potential of these strategic moves to contribute to long-term value creation. Economist inTEST Corporation's financial performance reflects broader economic trends, such as the cyclical nature of the semiconductor market and the impact of global supply chain challenges. The company's strong operational cash flow and increased cash reserves indicate a healthy liquidity position, which is important in navigating economic uncertainties. The debt reduction also suggests prudent financial management.The company's guidance for the first quarter of 2024, including the Alfamation acquisition, shows expected stability in gross margin and a slight increase in operating expenses. This guidance, along with the effective tax rate and share count, will be key factors for investors to consider when evaluating the company's near-term financial health and earnings potential. 03/27/2024 - 05:07 PM 2023 revenue increased 6% year-over-year while net income grew 10% Demonstrated strong operational cash flow: generated $4.7 million in cash from operations in the fourth quarter and a record $16.2 million for the year Market diversification provided strength in sales for the year supported by growth in defense/aerospace, industrial, security and life sciences markets Fourth quarter orders improved 2% over the prior quarter driven by defense/aerospace and industrial markets Expects 2024 revenue to range from $145 million to $155 million including the acquisition of Alfamation MT. LAUREL, NJ--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- inTEST Corporation (NYSE American: INTT), a global supplier of innovative test and process technology solutions for use in manufacturing and testing in key target markets which include automotive/EV, defense/aerospace, industrial, life sciences, security, and semiconductor (“semi”), today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. “The effective execution of our 5-Point Strategy continues to drive strong results as we delivered a second consecutive year of record revenue while also achieving net income of $9.3 million, the highest level in more than a decade,” commented Nick Grant, President and CEO. “inTEST’s strategy drives innovation, deeper penetration into target markets, geographic expansion and attracts top talent. In 2023, we made good progress at key accounts and strengthened channel relationships throughout the U.S., Europe, Latin America and the Asia Pacific region. We also announced a new Center of Excellence in Malaysia for applications engineering, product development and localized manufacturing that will support all divisions and better serve customers in Southeast Asia. This increasing diversification proved fundamental to the strength of our 2023 results as growing demand from industrial and defense/aerospace markets helped to offset the widely reported weakness in the semiconductor market. Our efforts are resulting in a larger, more diverse customer base positioning inTEST well for further growth.” Mr. Grant added, “The recent acquisition of Alfamation, which we announced on March 12, 2024, is further proof of the progress we are making on our 5-Point Strategy. The acquisition adds significant test and automation capabilities, broadens geographic and key market presence while also providing measurable scale to the Electronic Test division. The team will continue to drive organic growth initiatives while pursuing highly complementary acquisitions such as Alfamation.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Review (see revenue by market and by segments in accompanying tables) Three Months Ended ($ in 000s) Change Change 12/31/2023 12/31/2022 $ % 9/30/2023 $ % Revenue $27,884 $32,405 $(4,521) -14.0% $30,941 $(3,057) -9.9% Gross profit $12,449 $14,981 $(2,532) -16.9% $14,447 $(1,998) -13.8% Gross margin 44.6% 46.2% 46.7% Operating expenses (incl. intangible amort.) $11,340 $10,949 $391 3.6% $11,979 $(639) -5.3% Operating income $1,109 $4,032 $(2,923) -72.5% $2,468 $(1,359) -55.1% Operating margin 4.0% 12.4% 8.0% Net earnings $1,455 $3,244 $(1,789) -55.1% $2,277 $(822) -36.1% Net margin 5.2% 10.0% 7.4% Earnings per diluted share (“EPS”) $0.12 $0.30 $(0.18) -60.0% $0.19 $(0.07) -36.8% Adjusted net earnings (Non-GAAP) (1) $1,910 $3,707 $(1,797) -48.5% $2,707 $(797) -29.4% Adjusted EPS (Non-GAAP) (1) $0.16 $0.34 $(0.18) -52.9% $0.22 $(0.06) -27.3% Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) (1) $2,418 $5,256 $(2,838) -54.0% $3,768 $(1,350) -35.8% Adjusted EBITDA margin (Non-GAAP) (1) 8.7% 16.2% 12.2% (1) Adjusted net earnings, adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures.

Compared with the prior-year period, fourth quarter revenue was down primarily due to $8.7 million in lower sales to the semi market. This was partially offset by a 171%, or $3.7 million, increase in sales to the industrial market, a 42%, or $1.2 million, increase in sales to the auto/EV market and an 11%, or $0.2 million, increase in the defense/aerospace market. Sequentially, industrial revenue was up 141% and auto/EV sales were up 124%. Gross margin was 44.6% in the fourth quarter, a 160-basis point contraction compared with the prior-year period primarily due to lower volume and product mix. Operating expenses increased primarily because of $0.4 million of incremental corporate development expenses, which were somewhat offset by lower selling costs and expense management. With the benefit of other income in the quarter of $0.6 million, net earnings were $1.5 million, or $0.12 per diluted share. 2023 Summary Full year revenue was a record $123.3 million, up 6%, or $6.5 million, over the prior year. Growth was driven primarily by $5.5 million higher sales to the defense/aerospace market, as well as a $4.3 million increase in sales to the industrial market. Gross profit for the year increased 7% to $57.0 million reflecting the impact of higher volume, favorable mix as well as ongoing cost and pricing actions. Gross margin expanded 50 basis points to 46.2%. Operating income was down 3% to $10.4 million and net earnings increased 10% to $9.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) was down 1% to $15.8 million. Net earnings benefitted from higher cash balances and interest rates resulting in other income of $1.3 million. On a per diluted share basis, net earnings were up 1% to $0.79 compared with $0.78 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per diluted share (Non-GAAP)1 were $0.94 compared with $0.99 in 2022. Significant Financial Flexibility with Strong Cash Flow and a Solid Balance Sheet The Company generated $4.7 million in cash from operations in the fourth quarter and $16.2 million in 2023. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $0.3 million, unchanged from the prior-year period and were $1.3 million in 2023, down from $1.4 million in 2022. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2023 were $45.3 million, an increase of $31.8 million from the end of 2022, which included $19.2 million in net proceeds from the Company’s at-the-market equity offering program that was initiated and completed in second quarter 2023. The Company paid down $1.0 million in debt in the fourth quarter and $4.1 million during the year. Total debt was $12.0 million at year end. Fourth Quarter 2023 Orders and Backlog (see orders by market in accompanying tables) Three Months Ended ($ in 000s) Change Change 12/31/2023 12/31/2022 $ % 9/30/2023 $ % Orders $27,523 $31,315 $(3,792) -12.1% $26,854 $669 2.5% Backlog (at quarter end) $40,130 $46,800 $(6,670) -14.3% $40,491 $(361) -0.9% Fourth quarter orders of $27.5 million were down 12% versus the prior-year period but up 2% sequentially. Defense/aerospace orders were very strong year-over-year, up 53% to $5.2 million, and were strong as well sequentially, increasing 70%. Higher demand drove fourth quarter industrial orders up 30%, or $0.8 million, compared with last year’s fourth quarter. Sequentially, industrial orders more than doubled to $3.4 million. Semi front-end orders were resilient in the fourth quarter, primarily supporting epitaxy applications. Back-end orders declined further year-over-year and sequentially but began to show stabilization. Combined semi orders, while down 10% year-over-year, improved sequentially by 3% to $13.3 million. Backlog at December 31, 2023, was $40.1 million, down 14% versus the prior year on lower demand from the semi market as well as customers returning to shorter lead times as global supply chain challenges have dissipated. Approximately 45% of backlog is expected to ship beyond the first quarter of 2024. Orders and backlog are key performance metrics that management uses to analyze and measure the Company’s financial performance and results of operations. Please see “Key Performance Indicators” for a further explanation of the use and how these metrics are calculated. First Quarter and Full Year 2024 Guidance First quarter guidance now includes just over two weeks of financial results from the Alfamation acquisition. Revenue for the first quarter of 2024 is expected to be approximately $29 million with gross margin of approximately 45% to 46%. First quarter 2024 operating expenses, including amortization, corporate development expenses and additional professional fees, are now expected to be approximately $13 million. Intangible asset amortization is estimated to be approximately $0.6 million pre-tax, or approximately $0.5 million after tax, or $0.04 per share. The effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 16% to 17% and weighted average shares are expected to be about 12.2 million in the first quarter. First quarter 2024 estimated EPS is now expected to be approximately $0.06, while first quarter estimated adjusted EPS (Non-GAAP) is now expected to be approximately $0.10.2 1Adjusted earnings per diluted share is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices in the United States (“GAAP”), we also disclose non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures consist of adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per diluted share (adjusted EPS), adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin. Definition of Non-GAAP Measures The Company defines these non-GAAP measures as follows: Adjusted net earnings is derived by adding acquired intangible amortization, adjusted for the related income tax expense (benefit), to net earnings. Adjusted earnings per diluted share (adjusted EPS) is derived by dividing adjusted net earnings by diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Adjusted EBITDA is derived by adding acquired intangible amortization, net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation, and stock-based compensation expense to net earnings. Adjusted EBITDA margin is derived by dividing adjusted EBITDA by revenue. These results are provided as a complement to the results provided in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per diluted share (adjusted EPS) are non-GAAP financial measures presented to provide investors with meaningful, supplemental information regarding our baseline performance before acquired intangible amortization charges as management believes this expense may not be indicative of our underlying operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures presented primarily as a measure of liquidity as they exclude non-cash charges for acquired intangible amortization, depreciation and stock-based compensation. In addition, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin also exclude the impact of interest income or expense and income tax expense or benefit, as management believes these expenses may not be indicative of our underlying operating performance. Management’s Use of Non-GAAP Measures The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release are used by management to make operational decisions, to forecast future operational results, and for comparison with our business plan, historical operating results and the operating results of our peers. Reconciliations from net earnings and earnings per diluted share (EPS) to adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per diluted share (adjusted EPS) and from net earnings and net margin to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, are contained in the tables below. Limitations of adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per diluted share (adjusted EPS), adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin Each of our non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools. They should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures of earnings or cash flows. Limitations may include the cash portion of interest expense, income tax (benefit) provision, charges related to intangible asset amortization and stock-based compensation expense. These items could significantly affect our financial results. Management believes these Non-GAAP financial measures are important in evaluating our performance, results of operations, and financial position. We use non-GAAP financial measures to supplement our GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business. Adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per diluted share (adjusted EPS), adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin are not alternatives to net earnings, earnings per diluted share or margin as calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. As such, they should not be considered or relied upon as substitutes or alternatives for any such GAAP financial measure. We strongly urge you to review the reconciliations of adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per diluted share (adjusted EPS), adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin along with our financial statements included elsewhere in this press release. We also strongly urge you not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. In addition, because adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per diluted share (adjusted EPS), adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and are susceptible to varying calculations, the adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per diluted share (adjusted EPS), adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin measures as presented in this press release may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures This release includes certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, including estimated adjusted earnings per diluted share (estimated adjusted EPS). We have provided these non-GAAP measures for future guidance for the same reasons that were outlined above for historical non-GAAP measures. We have reconciled non-GAAP forward-looking estimated adjusted EPS to its most directly comparable GAAP measure. The reconciliation from estimated net earnings per diluted share (EPS) to estimated adjusted EPS is contained in the table below. Key Performance Indicators In addition to the foregoing non-GAAP measures, management uses orders and backlog as key performance metrics to analyze and measure the Company’s financial performance and results of operations. Management uses orders and backlog as measures of current and future business and financial performance, and these may not be comparable with measures provided by other companies. Orders represent written communications received from customers requesting the Company to provide products and/or services. Backlog is calculated based on firm purchase orders we receive for which revenue has not yet been recognized. Management believes tracking orders and backlog are useful as it often is a leading indicator of future performance. In accordance with industry practice, contracts may include provisions for cancellation, termination, or suspension at the discretion of the customer. Given that each of orders and backlog are operational measures and that the Company's methodology for calculating orders and backlog does not meet the definition of a non-GAAP measure, as that term is defined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, a quantitative reconciliation for each is not required or provided.

Investments include U.S. treasury securities and marketable equity securities, with notable acquisitions in broadband services. Cash inflow from operations improved significantly, reaching $16.06 million in 2023. Positive Boston Omaha (BOC) released its fiscal year 2023 financial results. Total revenue for 2023 was $96.25 million, reflecting growth from the previous year. The company reported a net loss of $7.00 million in 2023. Total assets increased to $768.21 million, while total equity rose to $600.81 million. Investments include U.S. treasury securities and marketable equity securities. Cash inflow from operations improved to $16.06 million in 2023. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results from Boston Omaha Corporation reveal a mixed picture for investors, with total revenues seeing an appreciable year-over-year increase, driven by growth in billboard rentals and broadband services. This suggests a solid expansion in core business areas, which is a positive indicator of the company's operational performance. However, the reported net loss for the fiscal year 2023, in contrast to the net income in 2022, warrants a closer examination of the underlying factors contributing to this shift.Particularly noteworthy is the net loss from operations which has widened compared to the previous year. This could be indicative of rising operational costs or inefficiencies that the company may need to address. The depreciation and amortization expense has also increased, which could be attributed to recent acquisitions and investments in long-term assets. Investors might be concerned about the immediate impact on profitability but should also consider the potential for these investments to generate future income.Another aspect to consider is the 'Net Other (Loss) Income', which includes significant losses related to equity method investments, particularly in Sky Harbour. This highlights the volatility and risks associated with such investments. The company's decision to hold public securities for the long term, despite unrealized market price changes impacting reported earnings, suggests a strategic approach that may not align with short-term market movements.The increase in book value per share, albeit marginal, is a positive sign of the company's intrinsic value growth over time. However, investors should also assess the liquidity position, as the unrestricted cash and investments have increased only slightly, which may not provide a substantial buffer for future uncertainties or investment opportunities. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the performance of Boston Omaha Corporation in sectors such as billboard rentals and broadband services is indicative of broader industry trends. The growth in billboard rentals aligns with the recovery in outdoor advertising as businesses ramp up marketing efforts post-pandemic. The expansion in broadband services is reflective of the ongoing demand for high-speed internet, which has been a critical growth area for many telecommunications companies.It's also important to consider the competitive landscape and how Boston Omaha's strategic acquisitions, such as InfoWest and Go Fiber, position the company against its peers. These acquisitions could provide a competitive edge in the broadband market, allowing for greater market penetration and potential economies of scale.However, the company's diversification into different revenue streams, including insurance and investments, introduces complexity into the analysis. The mixed performance in these areas, particularly the fluctuating insurance commissions and investment income, point to the challenges of managing a varied portfolio in different economic climates. Stakeholders should be cognizant of the company's ability to manage these segments effectively, as they can have a significant impact on overall financial health. Insurance Industry Analyst Examining the insurance-related financials, there is a modest increase in premiums earned, which suggests growth in the insurance segment. However, insurance commissions have seen a slight decrease. This could be attributed to a variety of factors, including changes in policyholder behavior, competitive pressures, or shifts in the insurance products mix offered by the company.Investors should consider the implications of the company's insurance operations within the broader context of the insurance market, which has been facing challenges such as increased claims due to natural disasters and regulatory changes. It's also worth noting the company's investment strategy within its insurance entities, as the minimal increase in unrestricted cash and investments held by these entities could imply a conservative approach to liquidity management or potential capital commitments elsewhere.The nuanced understanding of these insurance operations is important for evaluating the company's resilience to potential future risks and its ability to capitalize on market opportunities within the insurance sector. 03/27/2024 - 05:04 PM OMAHA, Neb.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Boston Omaha Corporation (NYSE: BOC) (the “Company”, “we”, or “our”) announced its financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, in connection with filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The offer expires on April 24, 2024, with the purchase price set at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Summit Midstream Partners' decision to commence a cash tender offer for a portion of their Senior Secured Second Lien Notes is a strategic move aimed at debt management. By repurchasing these notes, the company is leveraging its Excess Cash Flow to reduce debt obligations, which can potentially lead to a lower cost of capital in the long run. This maneuver signals to the market that the company is generating sufficient cash flow to meet its debt covenants, a positive sign for creditworthiness.However, investors should consider the implications of such a buyback on the company's liquidity position. While reducing debt is generally favorable, using a significant portion of cash reserves could impact the company's ability to invest in growth opportunities or weather unforeseen financial challenges. The pro rata basis of the repurchase also suggests that not all interested holders may be able to sell back their notes, which could affect investor sentiment. Debt Market Analyst The Excess Cash Flow Offer for the Senior Secured Second Lien Notes reflects Summit Midstream Partners' adherence to the covenants outlined in the indenture. It's a compliance measure that also provides an opportunity for debt investors to exit their positions, potentially at a premium to the market price, given the fixed purchase price of 100% of the principal plus accrued interest. For the debt market, this offer might tighten the trading spread on the remaining notes and could influence the secondary market pricing.Debt repurchase offers can also be a precursor to future refinancing activities, as companies often clean up their capital structure before approaching new debt issuance. Stakeholders should monitor whether this buyback is a standalone event or part of a broader strategic financial restructuring. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the announcement of a cash tender offer by Summit Midstream Partners may be interpreted as a sign of operational strength, given that it's predicated on having Excess Cash Flow. This could be an indicator of the company's efficiency and profitability, which are key factors for investors. The energy sector, particularly midstream operations, is capital intensive with a focus on stable cash flows and Summit's ability to generate excess cash flow is noteworthy.However, the specific impact on the stock market will depend on how investors view the trade-off between debt reduction and the use of cash reserves. If the market perceives this move as enhancing the company's financial stability, it could lead to a positive revaluation of Summit's equity. Conversely, if the market interprets this as a lack of viable investment opportunities for the excess cash, the reaction could be muted or even negative. 03/27/2024 - 05:00 PM HOUSTON, March 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Summit Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE: SMLP) (""Summit,"" ""SMLP"" or the ""Partnership"") today announced that Summit Midstream Holdings, LLC (""Holdings"") and Summit Midstream Finance Corp.

The company reported a 311% increase in revenues, with SG&A expenses up by 2.8%. Cash used in operating activities improved to $7.7 million. The company maintains strong liquidity with approximately $172 million in cash and investments. Noteworthy events include ground leases at San Jose and Orlando airports, construction delays in Denver, Phoenix, and Dallas, and high occupancy rates at Houston, Nashville, and Miami campuses. Positive Revenue for 2023 increased by 311% compared to 2022, showcasing significant growth for the company. SG&A expenses rose by 2.8% in 2023 compared to the previous year, indicating increased operational costs. Cash used in operating activities improved to $7.7 million in 2023 from $27.5 million in 2022, reflecting better financial management. The company holds strong liquidity with approximately $172 million in cash, restricted cash, and US Treasury investments as of December 31, 2023. New ground leases at San Jose and Orlando airports signify the company's expansion plans and strategic growth initiatives. Construction delays in Denver, Phoenix, and Dallas, along with remediation costs of $26 - $28 million, pose challenges for the company's timeline and budget. High occupancy rates at Houston, Nashville, and Miami campuses indicate strong demand for the company's services and facilities. Negative Construction delays in Denver, Phoenix, and Dallas, along with significant remediation costs, could impact the company's financial performance and operational efficiency. The replacement of the Stand-by Stock Purchase Agreement with an at-the-market program may introduce uncertainties regarding future stock sales and capital raising strategies. While the company reported strong liquidity, the need for a $27 million cash infusion into the PABs Series 2021 Obligated Group suggests potential funding gaps or financial challenges. The delay in construction completion dates for key projects may affect revenue generation and overall project timelines. Market Research Analyst The recent financial results and strategic updates from Sky Harbour Group Corporation indicate a significant growth in revenue, a modest increase in SG&A expenses and an improvement in net cash used in operating activities. The 311% revenue increase year-over-year is a substantial figure that reflects the company's expanding operations and may be indicative of successful market penetration and scalability of their business model. This figure far outpaces average industry growth rates for the aviation infrastructure sector, which could suggest that Sky Harbour is capturing market share from competitors or benefiting from a surge in demand for business aviation infrastructure.Furthermore, the new ground leases at San Jose and Orlando, coupled with the near-full occupancy at existing campuses, suggest a strategic expansion that is aligned with market demand. The pre-leasing at San Jose campus stands out, as it indicates a strong initial demand in a high-rent market, which could lead to higher revenue per square foot. However, the remediation costs for the design flaws in Denver and Phoenix, estimated between $26 and $28 million, are significant one-time expenses that will impact short-term profitability but are necessary for long-term operational integrity and risk mitigation. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the equity cash infusion of $27 million into the Series 2021 PABs Obligated Group construction fund is a notable development. This move demonstrates the company's commitment to addressing the remediation costs without excessively leveraging its balance sheet. The strong liquidity position, with approximately $172 million in cash and investments, provides financial stability and the ability to absorb unforeseen costs such as these remediation expenses. The replacement of the Stand-by Stock Purchase Agreement with an at-the-market (ATM) program may offer more flexibility and potentially reduce dilution to existing shareholders, which could be viewed favorably by the market.Investors should note that the forward-looking statements regarding the expected ground lease executions and construction commencement dates are subject to risks and uncertainties. Delays in construction or changes in market conditions could impact these projections. Nonetheless, the company's proactive approach to registering prior PIPE shares and replacing the stock sale program with an ATM indicates a strategic approach to capital management and investor relations. Legal Expert The registration of securities, such as the Form S-3 for PIPE shares and warrants, is a compliance measure that aligns with SEC regulations. It is an essential step for ensuring that securities can be legally traded in the market and provides transparency to investors. The legal implications of such filings are important for the company's governance and investor confidence. It is also indicative of Sky Harbour's adherence to regulatory requirements and its preparation for potential future capital raises.Moreover, the execution of ground leases and the negotiation process for additional leases involve complex legal agreements that are pivotal for the company's expansion strategy. These leases often come with long-term commitments and terms that can have significant financial implications, such as the 50-year lease at Orlando Executive Airport.

Net cash used in operating activities during 2023 improved to $7.7 million from $27.5 million during 2022. Please see the link below for the Q4 2023 quarterly report as filed by Sky Harbour Capital LLC (“SH Capital” or the “Obligated Group”) in MSRB/EMMA: https://emma.msrb.org/P21785011-P21370409-P21809128.pdf The Company continues to maintain strong liquidity and capital resources. As of December 31, 2023, cash, restricted cash, and US Treasury investments amounted to approximately $172 million, of which $99 million resided at SH Capital. Recent noteworthy events include: New ground lease at SJC, encompassing an existing hangar facility to be made operational over the coming several weeks, and land for additional future development. New ground lease at ORL, with expected construction commencement in Q2 2025. Construction of Phases 1 in Denver, Phoenix, and Dallas delayed by 3-4 months, with an estimated $26 - $28 million non-recurring remediation cost. Revised expected completion dates are December 2024, February 2025, and March 2025, respectively. Houston, Nashville, and Miami campuses are stabilized at 95% leased, with potential full occupancy expected at over 100%. The San Jose facility is 58% pre-leased, with an expected operations start date of April 1, 2024. Site Acquisition Update The Company and the City of San Jose, California executed a 7-acre ground lease at SJC (lease #10) which includes approximately 60,000 square feet of existing hangar and office space, over 100,000 square feet of aviation ramp, and 120 land-side automobile parking stalls. The initial term of the lease is twenty years, and future development is expected to increase hangar square footage by approximately 75%. San José Mineta International Airport serves the south San Francisco Bay Area, including Silicon Valley. The Company and the Greater Orlando Airport Authority executed a ground lease at Orlando Executive Airport (ORL) (lease #11). The 50-year ground lease encompasses twenty acres, accommodating more than 200,000 square feet of hangar, with Phase 1 construction expected to begin in summer 2025. The Orlando Executive Airport is the premier general aviation airport in Central Florida and is located approximately three miles east of downtown Orlando. The Greater Orlando area is the second-fastest growing metro center in the country by GDP. Exclusive ground-lease negotiations are underway at five new target airports. Formal ground lease proposals have been submitted or are pending at an additional eight new target airports. The Company expects to have executed ground leases at three additional airports by the end of 2024 and an additional six airports by end of year 2025 representing an additional aggregate rentable square footage of more than 2 million square feet, primarily in markets with higher per-square-foot tenant rents than those in the first Obligated Group’s six airports. Construction Update As previously announced, in December 2023 the Company discovered a flaw in the prototype design employed in the construction of Phases I at Phoenix Deer Valley Airport (“DVT”) and Denver Centennial Airport (“APA”), and that was planned to be employed in Phase I at Dallas Addison Airport (“ADS”). Having completed a comprehensive review and prototype-redesign process with a leading national structural engineering firm, the Company is executing a remediation plan, including: Retrofitting significant elements of the DVT and APA structures currently under construction, Modifying the design of ADS structures in pre-construction to conform with Sky Harbour prototype requirements, and Applying the amended SH34 and SH16C prototype design to future projects with the intention of: Delivering best-in-class 100-year structures of the highest quality and Standardizing and streamlining procurement, manufacturing and construction in pursuit of shorter development time frames and lower development costs. Expected remediation costs are between $26 and $28 million, including approximately $16 million at DVT, approximately $8.5 million at APA, and approximately $2.5 million at ADS. Expected delivery dates of these projects are now November 2024 (APA), and February 2025 (ADS) and March 2025 (DVT). Leasing Update Sky Harbour’s first three campus phases (SGR, BNA and OPF 1) are approximately 95% occupied. Total potential economic occupancy is expected to exceed 100% due to successes in semi-private leasing. SJC is expected to commence operations on April 1, 2024, and is approximately 58% preleased. SJC tenant rents are reflective of Sky Harbour’s tier-1 target markets, with expected revenues from certain initial tenants exceeding $80 per rentable square foot. Registration of prior PIPE Shares, Replacement of Stand-By Share Sale Program and New “Shelf” Registration As required under the registration rights agreement with the PIPE common stock investors which closed in November 2023, we have filed a registration statement on Form S-3 registering the Class A common shares, the associated PIPE warrants, and the Class A common shares underlying those warrants. Similarly, the Company has terminated its 10 million share Stock Purchase Agreement, originally dated August 18, 2022, and replaced it with a Stock Selling Agreement (“at the market” or “ATM”) with an affiliate of the same broker-dealer of slightly smaller size. The Company did not sell any shares under the original agreement and only intends to sell shares under the new ATM if attractive market opportunities arise. Equity Cash Infusion into PABs Series 2021 Obligated Group On March 27, 2024, the Company contributed an additional $27 million of cash equity into its wholly-owned subsidiary Sky Harbour Capital LLC (the Obligated Group) to address the anticipated net funding gap associated with the one-time remediation costs at DVT, APA and ADS. CEO Remarks Tal Keinan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on 2023 Full year results and other recent events: “Sky Harbour’s efforts to ramp up site acquisition in 2023 are bearing fruit today and should accelerate throughout 2024 and 2025. Having established our baseline unit economics, the Site Acquisition team’s focus is shifting to the country’s tier-1 metro markets, where excess demand for business aviation hangar space most acutely manifests in higher hangar rents. With prototype design weaknesses addressed rigorously and rectified, we are structuring and growing the Sky Harbour Development Team to accommodate the anticipated scale-up in manufacturing and construction. The Airfield Operations team continues to focus on delivering the most efficient and personalized service suite in business aviation. Sky Harbour took good strides in 2023 in pursuit of its ambition to provide Sky Harbour Residents with the best service at the best facilities on the best airfields in business aviation.

With a set price of $5.00 per share, the total gross proceeds of $10 million suggest a modest valuation for the company, which could indicate either a conservative approach by the underwriters or a reflection of the company's current financial standing. Investors will be interested in the company's use of the proceeds, as this can affect future profitability and growth prospects.The firm commitment basis of the offering ensures that the underwriter, EF Hutton, has confidence in the company's potential, as they have agreed to buy the shares even if they cannot sell them to the public. The additional option for EF Hutton to purchase up to 300,000 Ordinary Shares to cover over-allotments is a common practice, providing a cushion for excess demand and potentially stabilizing the stock price post-IPO. However, investors should be mindful of the dilutive effect of this over-allotment on existing shares.Given that the shares will be listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, a platform for emerging companies, it aligns with U-BX Technology Ltd.'s profile as an AI-driven firm. The success of the IPO and subsequent stock performance will largely depend on investor perception of the AI sector's growth potential and U-BX's competitive positioning within the industry. Market Research Analyst The AI sector has been experiencing significant growth, driven by advancements in technology and an increased demand for automation and data analysis across various industries. U-BX Technology Ltd.'s focus on providing AI-driven services to insurance carriers places it in a niche market with substantial growth potential. The use of AI can help insurance companies improve risk assessment, personalize customer experiences and streamline claims processing, among other benefits.However, the competitive landscape is intense with numerous players, ranging from startups to established technology giants. U-BX's entry into the public market may provide it with the financial resources to invest in innovation and marketing, which are critical for gaining market share. Potential investors should evaluate the company's strategic plan to understand how it intends to differentiate itself and capture value within the AI and insurance ecosystem.Long-term success will depend on the company's ability to continuously innovate and adapt to the evolving needs of the insurance industry. It is also important to consider regulatory challenges that could impact the deployment of AI in insurance, as this could pose risks to the company's growth trajectory. Legal Expert The regulatory environment for AI and data privacy is an important consideration for companies like U-BX Technology Ltd. Operating in the insurance sector, the company must navigate complex regulations regarding the use of personal data and AI-driven decision-making. Investors should be aware of the legal risks associated with potential breaches of data protection laws or biased AI algorithms, which could result in significant fines and reputational damage.The company's listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market will also subject it to stringent reporting requirements and corporate governance standards. This increased transparency can be beneficial for investors, but it also means that U-BX must maintain strict compliance with securities regulations. Any failure to comply could lead to legal challenges and impact investor confidence.As the company grows and potentially expands internationally, it will also face a diverse range of legal systems and regulations, which could affect its operations and profitability. Investors should consider the strength of the company's legal and compliance teams in assessing its long-term viability. 03/27/2024 - 05:00 PM BEIJING, March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- U-BX Technology Ltd.

(Nasdaq: VAXX) reports financial results for Q4 and full year 2023, focusing on neurodegeneration programs and vaccine candidates. Positive developments include promising biomarker data for UB-312 in Parkinson's disease, encouraging results from VXX-401 in hypercholesterolemia, and progress with UB-612 COVID-19 booster. CEO Mei Mei Hu highlights the company's advancements and upcoming milestones. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent update from Vaxxinity, Inc. underscores the company's strategic pivot towards neurodegeneration programs, with a particular emphasis on Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. The financial community will be keenly interested in the progress of UB-312, as its successful development could open a significant market opportunity given the lack of disease-modifying treatments for Parkinson's. The correlation between UB-312-induced antibodies and clinical efficacy is a promising development, potentially impacting Vaxxinity's valuation. The mention of resumed dialogue with regulatory authorities for the Alzheimer's candidate UB-311 suggests a proactive approach to overcoming any previous regulatory hurdles, which could lead to a reassessment of the company's risk profile.Moreover, the anticipated Phase 1 data for VXX-401 in hypercholesterolemia and the potential marketing authorization for UB-612 as a COVID-19 booster are important catalysts. The former could position Vaxxinity in the competitive landscape of cardiovascular disease management, while the latter could provide a near-term revenue stream, albeit in a crowded market. Investors should monitor these developments closely, as they could have material implications for the company's financial health and stock performance. Medical Research Analyst The biomarker data presented for UB-312 in Parkinson's is a significant milestone in neurodegenerative disease research. The ability to demonstrate target engagement of toxic alpha-synuclein in the central nervous system (CNS) and its potential correlation with clinical efficacy could be transformative. This is because biomarkers are critical for tracking disease progression and the effectiveness of treatments in neurodegenerative diseases, which historically have been challenging to measure. The reported improvement in the MDS-UPDRS II activities of daily living scale is a tangible outcome that could resonate well with both the medical community and patients.Similarly, the progress of VXX-401, targeting PCSK9 to reduce LDL cholesterol, aligns with current therapeutic trends aiming to manage hypercholesterolemia more effectively. If the Phase 1 data reflects the preclinical success, it could signify a breakthrough in a market dominated by monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors. The multitope approach of UB-612 for COVID-19 could offer a differentiated mechanism of action compared to existing vaccines, potentially providing a competitive edge if the clinical data supports its efficacy and safety. Biotech Industry Analyst The strategic focus on neurodegeneration by Vaxxinity represents a calculated risk, given the high unmet medical need and the substantial financial rewards for successful therapies in this space. The clinical pipeline developments, particularly the exploratory biomarker data from UB-312, suggest that Vaxxinity is advancing a potentially disruptive technology platform. The company's approach to targeting aberrant protein targets in the CNS could set a new precedent in treating neurodegenerative disorders if successful.Additionally, the Phase 1 trial readout for VXX-401 in hypercholesterolemia will be closely watched by industry stakeholders. The success of PCSK9 inhibitors by other companies has validated the target and a vaccine-based approach could offer a novel and possibly more cost-effective treatment paradigm. The potential marketing authorization of UB-612 for COVID-19, while less novel, could nevertheless provide a steady revenue stream and bolster the company's financial position to fund its more innovative programs. 03/27/2024 - 04:41 PM CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vaxxinity, Inc. (Nasdaq: VAXX), a U.S. company pioneering the development of a new class of immunotherapeutic vaccines, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023, and provided a corporate update. “2024 will prove to be a critical year for Vaxxinity as we refocus our efforts on our neurodegeneration programs and move closer to obtaining our company’s first approval,” said Mei Mei Hu, CEO of Vaxxinity. “Just this month, we presented exploratory biomarker data from our Phase 1 trial of UB-312 in Parkinson’s patients: a first of its kind demonstrating target engagement of toxic alpha-synuclein in the CNS and a potential correlation with clinical efficacy. This represents a major step for our platform in neurodegeneration where the safe engagement of aberrant protein targets in the CNS remains critical, and new hope for the Parkinson’s community. We also seek to advance UB-311, our anti-Aβ Alzheimer’s candidate, as we resume dialogue with regulatory authorities and partners. Finally, we’re looking forward to the readout from the Phase 1 trial of VXX-401, our vaccine candidate for hypercholesterolemia, as well as the potential marketing authorization of UB-612, our heterologous booster vaccine candidate for COVID-19.” 2023 and Recent Clinical Pipeline Developments UB-312 in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies UB-312 targets toxic forms of aggregated α-synuclein (aSyn).Two exploratory CSF biomarkers show promise as measures of disease progression: aggregated aSyn, as measured by an aSyn Seed Amplification Assay developed in collaboration with Mayo Clinic, UTHealth Houston, and Amprion, with funding from The Michael J. Fox Foundation.phosphorylated aSyn (pS129-aSyn). PD patients with UB-312-induced antibodies in CSF had significantly less aSyn aggregation (p = 0.0183) and pS129-aSyn (p = 0.0351) as compared to placebo.PD patients with UB-312-induced antibodies in CSF showed significant improvement in the clinical MDS-UPDRS II activities of daily living scale as compared to placebo (p = 0.0062).Anti-aSyn antibody titer levels in CSF correlate with reduction in aggregated aSyn, which correlated with improvement in MDS-UPDRS II.In March 2024, JC Dodart, Chief Scientific Officer, presented these exploratory analyses at AD/PD 2024 in Lisbon, Portugal. VXX-401 in hypercholesterolemia VXX-401 targets proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) to reduce LDL cholesterol.All six cohorts of the Phase 1 trial of VXX-401 are fully enrolled.In February 2024, results from multiple preclinical studies of VXX-401 in non-human primates, demonstrating robust, sustained reduction in LDL-C, were published in the Journal of Lipid Research.The company anticipates topline Phase 1 data by mid-2024. UB-612 COVID-19 booster UB-612 employs a “multitope” approach to neutralizing the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variants.In November 2023, Vaxxinity presented data from its head-to-head Phase 3 trial of UB-612 at Vaccines Summit in Boston, MA, and published a peer-reviewed article about UB-612 in Vaccine reporting antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 in cynomolgus macaques. 2023 and Recent Corporate Updates Academic Collaborations & State of Florida Grant. In January 2024 Vaxxinity announced a collaboration with the University of Central Florida to conduct research funded by the state of Florida to further the development of our active immunotherapies against myostatin and activin A to prevent and mitigate muscle and bone wasting, well-known health challenges related to long-term spaceflight. These targets share biological mechanisms implicated in obesity, diabetes, and highly prevalent age-related diseases. In the same month, Vaxxinity announced a collaboration with the University of Florida’s Center for Translational Research in Neurodegenerative Disease (CTRND) to support our development of vaccines for neurodegenerative diseases. Fourth Quarter and Year End 2023 Financial Results As of December 31, 2023, Vaxxinity had $30.4 million of highly liquid assets, including $4.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and $25.5 million of short-term investments, compared to $86.8 million as of December 31, 2022.

Led by Harry Lundin and Rick Rule, the debentures bear interest at SOFR plus 4.0% per annum, with a floor of 3.0%. Proceeds will fund the Kabanga Nickel Project and general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The closing of Lifezone Metals Limited's US$50 million non-brokered private placement of unsecured convertible debentures indicates a significant capital infusion for the company. The involvement of well-known investors such as Harry Lundin and Rick Rule suggests a strong vote of confidence in Lifezone's prospects, particularly in relation to the Kabanga Nickel Project. The structure of the debentures, with an interest rate pegged to SOFR plus a premium, reflects current market conditions where investors seek higher returns to offset inflationary risks.The early redemption clause at 105% plus interest gives Lifezone flexibility in capital management, while the mandatory conversion feature could potentially dilute existing shareholders if the company's share price performs strongly. The conversion price of US$8.00 per share will be a key figure to watch as it will determine the extent of dilution. The use of proceeds for the Kabanga Nickel Project and general purposes suggests a strategic focus on growth and operational efficiency. Market Research Analyst Lifezone Metals' move to secure financing through convertible debentures reflects broader trends in the mining sector where companies often rely on such instruments to fund capital-intensive projects without immediately diluting equity. The terms of the debentures, including interest paid partly in shares, indicates the company's desire to conserve cash while also aligning investor returns with the company's equity performance.The Kabanga Nickel Project is at the center of Lifezone's growth strategy and nickel is a critical component in the burgeoning electric vehicle (EV) battery market. As demand for EVs is expected to grow, nickel's strategic importance may enhance Lifezone's market position, making this financing important for the company's future. However, investors should be mindful of commodity price volatility and geopolitical risks that could impact the project's viability. Legal Expert The notice that the debentures will not be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933 nor with any state securities regulatory authority indicates that Lifezone is utilizing an exemption for private placements. This strategy is often employed to expedite the fundraising process, avoiding the more stringent regulatory requirements of public offerings. It is essential for investors to understand the implications of such unregistered securities, which may include restrictions on their resale and limited liquidity.Investors should also consider the legal frameworks governing the Kabanga Nickel Project, including environmental, licensing and export regulations. These factors can have significant implications for project timelines and profitability. The legal landscape of mining operations is complex and subject to change, which could affect Lifezone's operational outlook and, by extension, the value of the debentures. 03/27/2024 - 04:50 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Lifezone Metals Limited (NYSE: LZM) is pleased to announce the closing in escrow of the previously disclosed US$50 million non-brokered private placement of unsecured convertible debentures.

(EFC) reported an estimated book value per share of $13.66 as of February 29, 2024, including a monthly dividend of $0.15 per share. The dividend is payable on March 25, 2024, to holders of record on February 29, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The estimated book value per share (BVPS) of $13.66 for Ellington Financial Inc. as of February 29, 2024, provides a snapshot of the company's financial health from an equity perspective. BVPS is a key metric that represents the value of the company's equity divided by the number of outstanding shares and it is often used by investors to gauge whether a stock is under or overvalued relative to its net assets. In this case, the figure is particularly relevant for shareholders and potential investors as it reflects the intrinsic value that would be theoretically available to shareholders if the company were to liquidate its assets.The inclusion of the dividend payment in this estimate is a reminder of the company's commitment to returning value to shareholders. A consistent dividend payout can be a signal of financial stability and may attract income-focused investors. However, it is important to assess the sustainability of such dividends by analyzing the company's earnings and cash flow. If dividends are not supported by the company's performance, they could be reduced or eliminated in the future, impacting the stock's attractiveness.For stakeholders, the short-term implications include adjustments in investment strategies based on the disclosed BVPS and dividend information. In the long term, the company's ability to maintain or grow its book value while providing dividends will be important for sustained investor confidence and stock performance. Market Research Analyst Ellington Financial's announcement of its estimated book value is an indicator of its market position. It is essential to compare this figure with industry averages and competitors to fully understand its significance. If Ellington's BVPS is higher than its peers, it may suggest better capital management or asset quality. Conversely, a lower BVPS might indicate potential undervaluation or underlying issues within the company's asset portfolio.Moreover, the timing of the announcement could affect investor sentiment. Releasing BVPS estimates just before the dividend record date might be a strategic move to bolster investor confidence and support the stock price leading up to the ex-dividend date. Investors often look for such timing cues as they realign their portfolios.It's also worth noting the broader economic context in which this announcement occurs. Macroeconomic factors such as interest rates, housing market trends and regulatory changes can all influence the performance of financial firms like Ellington. Investors would do well to consider these external factors when interpreting the company's book value and dividend prospects. 03/27/2024 - 05:57 PM OLD GREENWICH, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ellington Financial Inc.

The change in the ADS Ratio is expected to become effective on or about April 16, 2024 (the ""Effective Date""). For the Company's ADS holders, the change in the ADS Ratio has the same effect as a one-for-twenty-five reverse ADS split and will have no impact on an ADS holder’s proportional equity interest in the Company. The change in the ADS Ratio is intended to further support the liquidity in the Company’s ADSs and to enable the Company to regain compliance with the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement. On the Effective Date, registered holders of the Company’s ADSs held in certificated form will be required on a mandatory basis to surrender their certificated ADSs to Citibank, N.A., the depositary bank (the “Depositary”), for cancellation and will receive one (1) new ADS in exchange for every twenty-five (25) existing ADSs surrendered. Holders of uncertificated ADSs in the Direct Registration System (DRS) and The Depository Trust Company (DTC) will have their ADSs automatically exchanged and need not take any action. The exchange of every twenty-five (25) then-held (existing) ADSs for one (1) new ADS will occur automatically at the Effective Date, with the then-held ADSs being cancelled and new ADSs being issued by the Depositary. The Company’s ADSs will continue to be traded on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “NCNA.” No fractional new ADSs will be issued in connection with the change in the ADS Ratio. Instead, fractional entitlements to new ADSs will be aggregated and sold by the Depositary, and the net cash proceeds from the sale of the fractional ADS entitlements (after deduction of fees, taxes, and expenses) will be distributed to the applicable ADS holders by the Depositary. As a result of the change in the ADS Ratio, the ADS trading price is expected to increase proportionally, although the Company can give no assurance that the ADS trading price after the change in the ADS Ratio will be proportionally equal to or greater than the previous ADS trading price prior to the change or that the change in the ADS Ratio will have any effect on the liquidity in the Company’s ADSs. About NuCana NuCana is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on significantly improving treatment outcomes for patients with cancer by applying our ProTide technology to transform some of the most widely prescribed chemotherapy agents, nucleoside analogs, into more effective and safer medicines. While these conventional agents remain part of the standard of care for the treatment of many solid and hematological tumors, they have significant shortcomings that limit their efficacy and they are often poorly tolerated. Utilizing our proprietary technology, we are developing new medicines, ProTides, designed to overcome the key limitations of nucleoside analogs and generate much higher concentrations of anti-cancer metabolites in cancer cells. NuCana’s pipeline includes NUC-3373 and NUC-7738. NUC-3373 is a new chemical entity derived from the nucleoside analog 5-fluorouracil, a widely used chemotherapy agent. NUC-3373 is currently being evaluated in three ongoing clinical studies: a Phase 1b/2 study (NuTide:302) in combination with leucovorin, irinotecan or oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer; a randomized Phase 2 study (NuTide:323) in combination with leucovorin, irinotecan, and bevacizumab for the second-line treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer; and a Phase 1b/2 modular study (NuTide:303) of NUC-3373 in combination with the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab for patients with advanced solid tumors and in combination with docetaxel for patients with lung cancer. NUC-7738 is a transformation of 3’-deoxyadenosine, a novel anti-cancer nucleoside analog. NUC-7738 is in the Phase 2 part of a Phase 1/2 study in patients with advanced solid tumors which is evaluating NUC-7738 as a monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab.

Financial Analyst The reported increase in revenues by 21% for Allied Gaming & Entertainment, Inc. in 2023 compared to the previous year indicates an upward trajectory in the company's financial performance. This growth is particularly notable given the renewal of a naming rights agreement and the strategic investment in Z-Tech, which contributed to two months of revenue. From a financial perspective, the company's ability to reduce costs and expenses by 21% while growing revenue is a positive sign, showcasing efficient cost management and potentially increased operational leverage.However, the net loss of $3.6 million, despite being an improvement from the previous year's $10.8 million, still raises concerns about the company's path to profitability. Investors should consider the sustainability of the revenue streams and whether the cost reductions are a result of one-time benefits, like the Employee Retention Credit, or indicative of a longer-term trend. The Adjusted EBITDA loss reduction from $8.6 million to $4.6 million is encouraging, but it's essential to analyze the quality of EBITDA improvements and the underlying drivers.The cash and short-term investments position decreased from $86.8 million to $78.6 million year-over-year, which could be a point of focus for investors. The working capital position also saw a decrease, which might impact the company's financial flexibility. The share repurchase under the 2022 Stock Repurchase Plan indicates confidence by management in the company's valuation and prospects. Market Research Analyst The esports and entertainment sectors have been experiencing significant growth and Allied Gaming & Entertainment's strategic initiatives seem to align with this trend. The integration of Z-Tech and the expansion in Asia through Allied Experiential Entertainment signal a focus on diversifying and tapping into new markets. The strategic investment by Elite Fun Entertainment Co. Ltd. and the formation of Skyline Music Entertainment joint venture could provide the company with a stronger foothold in the Asian entertainment market, which is known for its rapid expansion and high consumer engagement.It's important to assess the competitive landscape and consumer trends in the esports and mobile gaming industries to understand the potential for AGAE's growth. The increase in proprietary and third-party events produced in the fourth quarter suggests robust demand for the company's offerings, but it's important to evaluate the long-term sustainability of event-driven revenue, especially in a market that is becoming increasingly crowded with competitors.Investors should also consider the implications of the company's strategic investments and partnerships for future revenue streams. Expansion into new markets comes with risks, such as cultural differences and regulatory challenges, which could affect the company's performance. The strategic investments and partnerships could be pivotal in driving growth, but they also require careful monitoring to ensure they deliver the expected synergies and returns. Legal Expert The increase in legal and professional fees by $0.4 million due to normal business matters and strategic investments, including the investment in Z-Tech, suggests that AGAE is actively engaging in complex transactions that may involve cross-border legal considerations. Investors should be aware of the potential legal complexities associated with international expansion, such as compliance with foreign laws, intellectual property rights and potential litigation risks.Additionally, the company's involvement in forming joint ventures and strategic investments could lead to complex contractual arrangements that might have implications for future earnings and liabilities. It's essential for investors to understand the legal framework under which these ventures operate, as well as the terms of these investments to gauge potential exposure to legal risks.The stock repurchase plan indicates a potential strategy to increase shareholder value, but it also needs to be evaluated in the context of the company's overall capital allocation strategy. Share repurchases can signal management's confidence in the company but should be balanced against the need for capital to fund growth initiatives and maintain a healthy balance sheet. 03/27/2024 - 04:30 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Allied Gaming & Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ: AGAE) (the “Company” or “AGAE”), a global experiential entertainment company, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. “We made substantial progress during fiscal year 2023 and have entered fiscal year 2024 in a position of strength. Allied Esports International ('AEI'), Allied Mobile Entertainment ('AME'), and Allied Experiential Entertainment ('AEE') are all poised for growth as we execute on our strategic objectives this year,” said Yinghua Chen, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. “With Beijing Lianzhong Zhihe Technology Co. ('Z-Tech') now integrated into our business, AEE finalizing events and expanding its presence in Asia and the continued demand we have for our AEI properties and content, we are extremely excited for the year ahead and very confident in our path forward.” Full Year 2023 Financial Results Revenues: Total revenues of $7.7 million increased 21% in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase in revenue year-over-year was primarily driven by an increase in sponsorship revenue relating to the renewal of our naming rights agreement for our flagship esports facility, HyperX Arena Las Vegas, Season Two of Elevated and two months of revenue from our recent October 2023 strategic investment in Z-Tech. Costs and expenses: Total costs and expenses were $14.3 million in 2023, a decrease of 21% compared to 2022. The net decrease in costs and expenses of $3.9 million is primarily due to a $3.2 million, or 30% reduction in general and administrative expenses, consisting principally of a $1.5 million Employee Retention Credit recognized in 2023, stock-based compensation of $0.9 million, payroll and payroll-related costs of $0.8 million, and insurance and rent expenses of $0.2 million each. These decreases were partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in legal and professional fees related to normal business matters as well as the strategic investment in Z-Tech and other strategic investment opportunities. Net loss (including the amount attributable to non-controlling interests) was $3.6 million in 2023 compared to a net loss of $10.8 million in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA loss was $4.6 million for 2023 compared to a loss of $8.6 million in 2022. A reconciliation of the GAAP-basis net loss to adjusted EBITDA is provided in the table at the end of this press release. Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Revenues: Total revenues of $2.1 million increased 70% for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase from the fourth quarter of 2022 was driven by an increase in HyperX sponsorship revenues and two months of Z-Tech operations. Costs and expenses: Total costs and expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $4.0 million, a slight increase of 2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Net loss (including the amount attributable to non-controlling interests) was $1.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to a net loss of $1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA loss was $1.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to a loss of $1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. A reconciliation of the GAAP-basis net loss to adjusted EBITDA is provided in the table at the end of this press release. Balance Sheet As of December 31, 2023, the Company had a cash and short-term investments position of $78.6 million, including $5.0 million of restricted cash. This compared to $86.8 million in cash and short-term investments on December 31, 2022, which also included $5.0 million of restricted cash. At December 31, 2023, the Company had a working capital position of $66.4 million compared to $79.1 million at December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had 36.8 million shares of outstanding common stock, including 2.3 million shares repurchased under the Company’s 2022 Stock Repurchase Plan. Operational Update Allied Esports produced 64 events in the fourth quarter of 2023, with 30 proprietary events and 34 third-party events. Third-party events were highlighted by Omen Showcase Party; World Esports Day – TwitchCon Afterparty; EA Sports F1 23 Las Vegas Showrun; and All MLB Team Awards Show. Corporate Developments In November, AGAE closed on its strategic investment in Z-Tech, a prominent developer and operator of casual mobile games. As of October 31, 2023, AGAE has assumed a controlling interest in the Board for purpose of financial statement consolidation and became the largest shareholder of Z-Tech. In December, Elite Fun Entertainment Co. Ltd., a premier player in the Greater Bay Area cultural and entertainment industry, agreed to a strategic investment in AGAE. The partnership marks the beginning of a dynamic collocation aimed at maximizing mutual benefits for expanding in the burgeoning market of live entertainment in Asia. Also in December, AGAE announced the formation of Skyline Music Entertainment, a joint venture based in Macau that is poised to capitalize on the entertainment industry in the Asia market. AGAE’s wholly owned subsidiary, Allied Experiential Entertainment, Inc., owns 51% of Skyline Music Entertainment.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures As a supplement to our financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), the Company presents certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as more important than, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the items associated with the company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are not an alternative to the Company’s GAAP financial results and may not be calculated in the same manner as similar measures presented by other companies. The Company provides net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the Company provides EBITDA (defined as GAAP net income (loss) from continuing operations before interest (income) expense, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization). The Company defines “Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA excluding certain non-cash and non-recurring charges, such as stock-based compensation, business acquisition transaction costs and impairment expense. In the future, the Company may also consider whether other items should also be excluded in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with additional useful information to measure the Company’s financial and operating performance. In particular, these measures facilitate comparison of our operating performance between periods and help investors to better understand the operating results of the Company by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the Company’s core business, operating results, or future outlook. Additionally, we consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Internally, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures, along with others, in assessing the Company’s operating results, measuring compliance with any applicable requirements of the Company’s debt financing agreements in place at such time, as well as in planning and forecasting. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles, and our non-GAAP definitions of the “EBITDA” and “Adjusted EBITDA” do not have a standardized meaning. Therefore, other companies may use the same or similarly named measures, but include or exclude different items, which may not provide investors a comparable view of the Company’s performance in relation to other companies. Management compensates for the limitations resulting from the exclusion of these items by considering the impact of the items separately and by considering the Company’s GAAP, as well as non-GAAP, financial results and outlook, and by presenting the most comparable GAAP measures directly ahead of non-GAAP measures, and by providing a reconciliation that indicates and describes the adjustments made.

AGAE’s management believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful because they allow external users of its financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, to more effectively evaluate its operating performance, compare the results of its operations from period to period and against AGAE’s peers without regard to AGAE’s financing methods, hedging positions or capital structure and because it highlights trends in AGAE’s business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP measures. AGAE presents EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because it believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are important supplemental measures of its performance that are frequently used by others in evaluating companies in its industry. Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income (loss) and may vary among companies, the EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA AGAE presents may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. AGAE defines EBITDA as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization of intangibles. AGAE defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding stock-based compensation, business acquisition costs and impairment expense. The following table presents a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA from net loss, AGAE’s most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.

Despite a decrease in NAV per share, the company declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share and entered into a loan portfolio acquisition agreement. The company remains optimistic about future investment opportunities and market dynamics. Positive None. Negative NAV per share decreased from $14.06 to $13.77, primarily due to dividend payments. Total net assets decreased from $87.4 million to $85.6 million from September 30, 2023, to December 31, 2023. Financial Analyst Silver Spike Investment Corp's financial results indicate a stable performance with a total investment income of $3.6 million and a net investment income of $1.7 million. This is a key metric for investors as it reflects the profitability and efficiency of the company's operations. The declaration of a $0.25 cash dividend per share is noteworthy, as it demonstrates the company's ability to return value to shareholders despite the challenging market conditions for cannabis-related investments.However, the decrease in net asset value (NAV) per share from $14.06 to $13.77 signals a slight decline in the intrinsic value of the company's shares, which could be a concern for long-term investors. This decline is attributed primarily to dividend payments rather than operational losses, which could be seen as a positive sign of the company's commitment to shareholder returns.The acquisition of the CALP Loan Portfolio through issuance of new shares could dilute existing shareholders but also indicates a strategic move to expand the company's asset base. This could potentially enhance future earnings if the acquired portfolio performs well. Investors should monitor the portfolio's integration and subsequent performance closely. Market Research Analyst The cannabis industry, where Silver Spike operates, continues to face regulatory and market challenges. Despite these conditions, the company's management remains optimistic about improved market dynamics and the potential for more attractive debt-related investment opportunities. This optimism suggests an expectation of favorable conditions for the company's growth and profitability.Investors should note the company's disciplined approach to portfolio investment, as no new investments were made in the last quarter of 2023. This could indicate a conservative strategy aimed at preserving capital and focusing on the quality of investments rather than quantity. The full repayment of one secured loan investment within the quarter is a positive sign of the portfolio's health and credit quality.The absence of loans on non-accrual status is another positive indicator, suggesting that the company's loan portfolio is performing well and not experiencing significant defaults. This is important for maintaining steady income streams from interest payments. Economist From an economic perspective, Silver Spike's liquidity position, with $32.6 million in cash equivalents, is robust, providing the company with a cushion against short-term market fluctuations. This level of liquidity also affords the company flexibility in capital allocation decisions and the ability to capitalize on investment opportunities that may arise.The dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) is an important feature for investors, as it allows for automatic reinvestment of dividends, which can lead to compounding growth over time. However, investors seeking immediate cash flow may opt out, highlighting the need for individual investment strategies to align with personal financial goals.It's also important to consider broader economic factors that could impact the cannabis industry and, by extension, Silver Spike's performance. Changes in interest rates, regulatory reforms and shifts in consumer behavior can all affect the company's operations and should be taken into account when evaluating the company's prospects. 03/27/2024 - 04:30 PM NEW YORK, March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Silver Spike Investment Corp.

The study focuses on senescent 'zombie' cells in Alzheimer's disease and potential therapeutic interventions. Positive None. Negative None. 03/27/2024 - 04:14 PM SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- NanoString Technologies, Inc. (OTC: NSTGQ), a leading provider of life science tools for discovery and translational research, today announced that research using the company’s CosMx™ Spatial Molecular Imager (SMI) has been featured for a third time in National Geographic Magazine. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240327487526/en/Senescent cells, or zombie cells, dwell in regions crucial for memory, such as the hippocampus, says Miranda Orr, who researches brain aging at Wake Forest University School of Medicine, and her team. These cells are damaged but they linger, hurting healthy cells and causing inflammation. Orr's team is studying whether drugs can kill zombie cells and restore memory. The close-up image below shows the effects of Alzheimer's disease. Yellow shows tau tangles, the snarls of tau proteins that degenerative brain diseases create. Blue marks molecules that indicate stress, magenta is a sign of damage beyond repair, and green shows inflammation. When blue, magenta, and green all appear in a cell, especially a large cell, that's evidence it is a zombie cell. (Graphic: NanoString) A special-interest magazine from National Geographic called Anti-Inflammation, available on newsstands this week, spotlights the role of inflammation on health and disease. The article, “How to Slow Down the March of Time,” features research on senescent “zombie” cells from the lab of Dr. Miranda Orr, associate professor of Gerontology and Geriatric Medicine at Wake Forest University School of Medicine and a research scientist at the W.G. Hefner VA Medical Center in Salisbury, NC. “Our work focuses on understanding how and why the risk of neurodegenerative diseases increases with advanced age. We discovered that senescent cells, which accumulate with aging, contribute to brain diseases including Alzheimer’s. In clinical trials, we are examining potential therapeutic interventions that clear these toxic cells in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. The visualizations and data achieved with the CosMx SMI instrument provide unprecedented subcellular information across brain regions impacted by Alzheimer’s disease. The technology allows us to characterize these cells and search for new therapeutic targets to clear them, a vital aspect of our progress,” said Dr. Orr. Senescent cells are those cells that have stopped dividing but remain active and can release substances believed to cause inflammation and damage to nearby healthy cells. Previous research by Orr’s lab identified that the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease have more senescent cells than healthy people. “Imagery is an integral part of storytelling at National Geographic. By using these amazing images to help explain the science behind inflammation, we hope to generate more awareness of the promising research on how inflammation affects brain health, a major global health concern,” said Lori Cuthbert, senior editor at National Geographic Magazine. “It’s tremendously motivating to all of us at NanoString to see CosMx SMI images contribute to the public’s understanding of inflammation and its role in disease. Few publications offer the expansive access to science that National Geographic offers its readers, and we are pleased to see this groundbreaking research with CosMx SMI highlighted in the magazine,” added Brad Gray, President and CEO of NanoString.

A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplemental to, and should not be considered as alternative to, net income, operating income, and cash flow from operating activities, liquidity, or any other financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures may not be indicative of the historical operating results of the Company, nor are they intended to be predictive of potential future financial results. Investors should not consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as substitutes for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes stockholders benefit from referring to the Adjusted EBITDA in planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure in evaluating its financial and operational decision making and as a means of evaluating period to period comparison. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss from operations adjusted for non-cash charges from depreciation and amortization, stock compensation, and goodwill impairment. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of our operating performance because it allows management, investor, and analysts to evaluate and assess our core operating results from period to period after removing the impact of significant non-cash charges that effect comparability between reporting periods. Our management recognizes that Adjusted EBITDA has inherent limitations because of the excluded items. We have included a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measure to loss from operations as calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that providing the non-GAAP financial measure, together with the reconciliation to GAAP, helps investors make comparisons between the Company and other companies. In making any comparisons to other companies, investors need to be aware that companies use different non-GAAP measures to evaluate their financial performance. Investors should pay close attention to specific definition being used and to the reconciliation between such measures and the corresponding GAAP measure provided by each company under applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Positive Record revenues achieved in the fourth quarter and full year 2023. Sale of Minehut business and reorganization lead to reduced operating expenses. Enhanced market positioning as a leader in immersive marketing and commerce. Strong demand from brands and advertisers with over 100 top brands served. Webinar hosted by CEO Ann Hand and CFO Clayton Haynes to discuss financial results. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported 34% year-over-year revenue increase for the fourth quarter and 27% increase for the full year by Super League indicates a robust growth trajectory, which is commendable in the content creation and media solutions industry. This performance can be attributed to a mix of strategic initiatives, including the signing of the company's largest contract to date. The divestiture of the Minehut business appears to be a strategic move to streamline operations and reduce expenses, which could potentially enhance profitability margins.Investors should note the company's focus on immersive marketing channels, which is a growing trend given the rise of virtual and augmented reality technologies. This positioning could provide Super League with a competitive edge in attracting advertising revenue. However, it is important to assess the sustainability of this growth, considering the fast-paced nature of the industry and potential shifts in advertising budgets. Market Research Analyst The emphasis on serving over 100 top brands reflects Super League's strong market penetration and brand trust. The company's ability to secure large contracts and its claim of being a go-to partner for brands suggests a deep understanding of the immersive marketing space. The sale of Minehut and the recent reorganization could indicate a more focused strategy, which is often well-received in the market.However, as the industry evolves, there will be a need for continuous innovation to maintain relevance. The long-term success will depend on Super League's ability to adapt to emerging technologies and consumer preferences within the immersive experiences sector. Stakeholders should watch for the company's R&D investments and any strategic partnerships that may arise as indicators of future performance. Economist The financial results of Super League provide an optimistic view of the company's economic health and its potential impact on the broader market. The record revenues signify not only corporate success but also reflect a potentially growing demand for immersive marketing solutions. This growth could have positive implications for employment within the tech and creative sectors, as well as for ancillary industries.However, one must consider the economic cycle and consumer spending patterns, which can influence advertising budgets and, consequently, Super League's revenue. The company's leaner cost structure post-reorganization may offer some resilience against economic downturns. It's important for investors to consider macroeconomic indicators alongside company performance when evaluating potential risks and opportunities. 03/27/2024 - 04:35 PM ~ Fourth Quarter Revenues Increase 34% Year-over-Year to a Company Record $9.5 Million ~ ~ Full Year Revenues Increase 27% Year-over-Year to a Company Record $25.1 Million ~ SANTA MONICA, Calif., March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Super League (Nasdaq: SLE) (the “Company”), a leading creator and publisher of content experiences and media solutions across the world’s largest immersive platforms, has released its fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results in the form of a shareholder letter.

The port's strategic location and state-of-the-art amenities have attracted over 400 companies, leading to efficient cargo handling and distribution. Collaborations with Norfolk Southern and significant investments in infrastructure ensure a promising future for the port, benefiting the Huntsville community and Tennessee Valley region. Positive None. Negative None. Transport Economist The 24% increase in rail lifts at the Port of Huntsville signifies a robust expansion in intermodal freight activity, which serves as an indicator of economic growth within the region. This growth can potentially lead to increased business activity, as efficient transport hubs are critical for supply chain optimization. The investments in rail and air cargo infrastructure, amounting to over $300 million, reflect a long-term commitment to enhancing the port's capacity and services.From an economic standpoint, the expansion of the Port of Huntsville is likely to attract further investments into the area, bolstering job creation and supporting the local economy. Additionally, the presence of U.S. Customs and Border Protection onsite, along with the Foreign Trade Zone, could incentivize international trade by reducing bureaucratic delays and costs, making the port an even more attractive logistics hub for businesses.However, continued growth could also necessitate further infrastructure investments to prevent bottlenecks and maintain service quality. The port's success may drive regional infrastructure developments, potentially impacting the state's budget and resource allocation priorities. Supply Chain Analyst The reported increase in rail lifts at the Port of Huntsville is a clear sign of its growing importance as a logistics hub. The strategic location alongside I-565 and the connection to the Norfolk Southern Railroad mainline provide a competitive advantage by reducing transit times and facilitating access to East and West coast ports. This accessibility is essential for businesses that rely on just-in-time delivery models.For companies operating in the aerospace and automotive sectors, which are prevalent in North Alabama, the port's enhanced capabilities may lead to improved inventory management and reduced logistics costs. The state-of-the-art amenities, including cold storage facilities, are particularly beneficial for industries requiring specialized handling, such as pharmaceuticals or perishable goods.It's important to monitor how the port's growth aligns with industry trends towards sustainability and reduced carbon footprints. The shift towards rail, a more environmentally friendly mode of transport compared to trucking, could be seen as a positive move by environmentally conscious stakeholders. Logistics Infrastructure Expert The significant investment in the Port of Huntsville's intermodal infrastructure positions it as a key player in the logistics sector. The dual runway system capable of supporting simultaneous flight operations and the large air cargo ramp for Boeing 747s underscore the port's readiness to handle substantial air freight volumes. This is particularly relevant given the 21st continental U.S. ranking for international air cargo volume at Huntsville International Airport.While the port's enhancements are poised to meet current demand, it is essential to consider the scalability of these improvements to accommodate future growth without compromising service quality. The logistics industry is rapidly evolving with technological advancements such as automation and real-time tracking systems. The port's ability to integrate such technologies will be important for maintaining its competitive edge.Moreover, the impact on local traffic patterns and community development must be addressed, ensuring that the infrastructure keeps pace with the port's expansion to mitigate any potential negative effects on the surrounding areas. 03/27/2024 - 04:36 PM HUNTSVILLE, Ala., March 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The International Intermodal Center at the Port of Huntsville announces another year of exceptional growth in 2023.

(NASDAQ: ALTI) secures an initial investment of $115 million from Constellation Wealth Capital for strategic growth, with potential total investment of $450 million, aiming to fuel mergers, acquisitions, and organic growth activities.","AlTi Tiedemann Global Closes Previously Announced Constellation Wealth Capital Investment Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary AlTi Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALTI) secures an initial investment of $115 million from Constellation Wealth Capital for strategic growth, with potential total investment of $450 million, aiming to fuel mergers, acquisitions, and organic growth activities. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The investment of $115 million by Constellation Wealth Capital into AlTi Global, Inc. represents a strategic move with significant implications for both AlTi and its stakeholders. This injection of capital is earmarked for accelerating AlTi's growth through mergers and acquisitions, indicating an aggressive expansion strategy. The issuance of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and warrants for Class A common stock suggests a mutually beneficial arrangement, providing CWC with potential upside in AlTi's equity while offering AlTi the necessary funds to execute its growth plans.From a financial perspective, the transaction could signal confidence in AlTi's management and future prospects. The capital increase may lead to a positive reassessment of AlTi's valuation by the market, potentially impacting its stock price. However, investors should closely monitor the company's ability to effectively deploy this capital to generate returns that exceed the cost of capital, which would be a critical determinant of value creation. Market Research Analyst AlTi's decision to focus on mergers and acquisitions as a growth strategy is reflective of current trends in the wealth and alternatives management industry. Consolidation is often pursued by firms seeking to gain economies of scale, broaden their customer base and enhance their product offerings. The involvement of Allianz X and CWC, both reputable investors, could be interpreted as a strong market signal regarding AlTi's potential to become a more dominant player in the industry.However, it's essential to consider the integration risks associated with mergers and acquisitions. AlTi's ability to integrate new acquisitions smoothly will be a key factor in realizing the expected synergies and maintaining client trust. Market observers should also watch for any regulatory hurdles that could affect the timing and success of AlTi's planned investments. Legal Expert The transaction's structure, involving convertible preferred stock and warrants, is designed to provide AlTi with immediate capital while offering CWC a strategic stake in the company. Convertible preferred stock typically offers investors a degree of protection with preferential rights, which might include a fixed dividend and priority over common stockholders in a liquidation event. The warrants component introduces a future equity interest, contingent on AlTi's performance.Investors and stakeholders should review the terms detailed in the Form 8-K filing with the SEC to understand the specific rights and obligations attached to these securities. The agreement's stipulations, such as the capital demand notice and the additional investment opportunity for CWC, reflect a structured, phased investment approach, which could provide AlTi with a more predictable capital inflow while affording CWC staged exposure to AlTi's equity. 03/27/2024 - 04:38 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AlTi Global, Inc.

(OTCQB: KLNG) (“Koil Energy” or the “Company”), a specialist in deepwater production and distribution equipment and services, today reported results for the year ended December 31, 2023. Koil Energy at a Glance: Share Price†:$0.55Cash*:$2.0M52-Week Range†:$0.42 - $0.70Book Value*:$5.6MShares Out.†:11.9MPrice / Book Value:1.2xMarket Cap†:$6.5MTTM Revenue:$15.3M*As of 12/31/23; †As of 03/26/24 Charles Njuguna, Koil Energy’s CEO, commented, “We are encouraged by the notable increase in revenues for the year. Compared to the previous year, revenues increased by 18 percent, propelled by the expanding of product-oriented, fixed-price contracts and sustained growth in service projects. However, we continued to experience the effects of price pressures we faced during the recent downturn. These past pressures led us to strategically price some projects at lower than ideal margins, which is reflected in our bottom-line results for 2023. ""We maintain confidence in the underlying dynamics of the offshore oil and gas markets, which bode well for our business. The enduring strength of the current growth cycle in the oil and gas industry is prompting operators to persist in investing in offshore developments, resulting in recent contract awards for the design, engineering, and manufacturing of hose and steel tube flying leads, along with electrical and hydraulic distribution manifolds for various locations in the Gulf of Mexico. ""While acknowledging that there is more work ahead, we are resolute in our commitment to leverage this momentum and implement strategies to facilitate the continued growth of our business. Our internal focus remains steadfast on cash flow management, liquidity preservation, and honoring our commitments to our valued customers. We are confident that our streamlined operations and continued emphasis on our core strengths will enhance productivity and profitability."" Operating Results Koil Energy’s revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2023 (“Q4 2023”) increased 11 percent to $4.0 million compared to $3.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 (“Q4 2022”). Our full-year 2023 revenues increased 18 percent to $15.3 million, compared to $13.0 million for full-year 2022, primarily due to an increase in product-oriented, fixed price contracts and a modest increase in project activity utilizing our support services and rental solutions. Gross profit for Q4 2023 was $0.7 million, or 17 percent of revenues, compared to Q4 2022 gross profit of $1.5 million, or 42 percent of revenues. Our full-year 2023 gross profit was $4.9 million, or 32 percent of revenues, compared to full-year 2022 gross profit of $4.7 million, or 36 percent of revenues. The comparative decline in 2023 gross margins reflects higher materials costs related to certain projects that were strategically priced at lower margins. Operating expenses were $1.6 million, or 39 percent of revenues, in Q4 2023 compared to $2.8 million, or 77 percent of revenues, in Q4 2022. Our full-year 2023 operating expenses were $6.5 million, or 42 percent of revenues, compared to full-year 2022 operating expenses of $7.7 million, or 59 percent of revenues. Operating expenses in 2022 were impacted by recording a right-of-use operating lease asset impairment charge of $0.8 million related to vacating our former operating facility in Q4 2022. Additionally, in 2022 we incurred approximately $0.5 million of costs related to the relocation to our new facility and $0.2 million related to rebranding the Company from Deep Down Inc. to Koil Energy Solutions, Inc. Due to the factors discussed above, Koil Energy reported a Q4 2023 net loss of $0.9 million, or a $0.07 loss per diluted share, compared to a Q4 2022 net loss of $1.3 million, or an $0.11 loss per diluted share. Our full-year 2023 net loss was $1.6 million, or a $0.13 loss per diluted share, compared to our full-year 2022 net loss of $2.9 million, or a $0.24 loss per diluted share. Per share results for Q4 2023, Q4 2022, and full-year 2023 are based on 11.89 million weighted average shares outstanding, and full-year 2022 is based on 11.98 million weighted average shares outstanding. Koil Energy reported a modified EBITDA of negative $0.7 million in Q4 2023 compared to a modified EBITDA of negative $0.1 million in Q4 2022. Our full-year 2023 modified EBITDA was negative $0.9 million compared to modified EBITDA of negative $1.0 million for full-year 2022. The comparative increase in modified EBITDA for full-year 2023 was primarily driven by revenue and gross profit growth stemming from an uptick in both fixed-price and service projects in 2023 as compared to 2022. Share Repurchases No shares of common stock were repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased in privately negotiated transactions an aggregate of 500,663 shares of common stock for $0.15 million in cash and in exchange for several long-lived assets valued at $0.08 million. Financial Position At December 31, 2023, working capital totaled $2.6 million, which includes cash of $2.0 million and net receivables of $4.2 million. This is compared to $3.6 million of working capital at December 31, 2022, which includes cash of $2.4 million and receivables of $2.9 million. Shareholders’ equity totaled $5.6 million, or approximately $0.47 per common share, at December 31, 2023, compared to $7.1 million, or approximately $0.59 per common share, at the beginning of the year. The Company maintains access to a factoring arrangement with Amegy Bank Business Credit, and the Company had no outstanding sales of accounts receivable with the bank at December 31, 2023.

The company anticipates an initial liquidating dividend of $14.68 to $15.30 per share. Positive Merrimack receives a $225 million payment from Ipsen, S.A. for FDA approval of ONIVYDE. Board of Directors concludes it is unlikely to receive additional milestone payments from Ipsen or Elevation Oncology. Special meeting of stockholders scheduled for May 10, 2024, to approve a Plan of Dissolution. Anticipated initial liquidating dividend range of $14.68 to $15.30 per share. Establishment of a liquidating trust for potential future milestone payments from Ipsen or Elevation Technology. Negative None. Financial Analyst The receipt of a $225 million payment from Ipsen S.A. by Merrimack Pharmaceuticals is a significant liquidity event, which directly impacts Merrimack's financial position. This inflow is tied to the FDA's approval of ONIVYDE for the treatment of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, highlighting the drug's potential market impact. However, the Board's assessment that no further milestone payments are expected suggests a cap on future revenue from these agreements.The announcement of a Plan of Dissolution and a subsequent liquidating dividend indicates a strategic shift for Merrimack, essentially transitioning from a going concern to a wind-down phase. The anticipated dividend payout, between $14.68 and $15.30 per share, provides a tangible return to shareholders but also signals the end of Merrimack's operations. The establishment of a liquidating trust is a prudent step to manage any unexpected future payments, ensuring shareholders may still benefit if such events occur.For investors, this news is a mixed bag. The immediate capital return is positive, but the lack of future growth prospects from Merrimack's pipeline limits long-term investment appeal. Shareholders must weigh the immediate cash return against the opportunity cost of investing in a company with ongoing operations and potential for growth. Market Research Analyst The approval of ONIVYDE by the FDA has broader implications for the market of pancreatic cancer treatments. The drug's positioning as a first-line treatment indicates a competitive edge in a market that is characterized by high unmet medical needs. However, Merrimack's decision to dissolve and not pursue further development or commercialization efforts means that the market will likely see a shift in dynamics as other players may step in to fill the void left by Merrimack.Regarding the stock market, Merrimack's dissolution plan could lead to short-term volatility in its stock price as investors react to the news. The proposed liquidating dividend is likely to be a key focus for current investors, potentially driving up the stock price in the short term as investors look to capitalize on the payout. However, in the long term, the stock's value will be tied to the liquidation process and final disbursements, which could lead to a decrease in trading volume and interest as the company winds down. Legal Expert The legal procedures involved in the Plan of Dissolution, including the filing of a definitive proxy statement with the SEC, are critical for ensuring that Merrimack's dissolution is conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements and shareholder interests. Shareholders' approval is not only a legal necessity but also serves as a check on the Board's decision to dissolve the company.The establishment of a liquidating trust is a legal mechanism designed to manage and distribute assets post-dissolution, which provides a structured and transparent process for handling potential future payments. This is especially relevant given the unlikely but possible scenario of receiving additional milestone payments.Investors should be aware that the proxy statement and subsequent filings will contain important information regarding the dissolution process and should be reviewed carefully to understand the legal and financial implications of the liquidation. 03/27/2024 - 04:30 PM Special Meeting of Stockholders to Approve Plan of Dissolution Scheduled for Friday, May 10, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: MACK) (“Merrimack” or the “Company”) today announced that it has received a $225 million payment which was due from Ipsen, S.A. as a result of its receipt of approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, to market ONIVYDE as a first-line treatment of metastatic adenocarcinoma on the pancreas. Merrimack’s Board of Directors has evaluated the likelihood of receiving additional milestone payments under the Ipsen Agreement and from the 2019 Agreement with Elevation Oncology and has concluded that it is unlikely that any additional milestone payments from either agreement will become payable.

Cash balance on December 31, 2023, was $3,093,612. The Company received a notification from Nasdaq regarding noncompliance with listing rules, potentially leading to delisting. Financial Analyst The recent financial results from Draganfly Inc. indicate a mixed performance, with a notable decrease in total revenue year-over-year but an impressive increase in gross profit margin, from 10.4% to 31.5%. Despite the growth in gross profit, the company experienced a comprehensive loss, albeit an improvement from the previous year. The reduction in cash used in operating activities is a positive sign, reflecting potentially improved operational efficiency.Investors should consider the implications of the revenue decline, which could signal market challenges or the impact of the strategic shift towards new product lines. The increase in gross margin suggests improved cost management or a move towards higher-margin products, which could be favorable if sustained. However, the comprehensive loss underscores the importance of monitoring Draganfly's path to profitability, especially in light of the capital raised through an underwritten offering intended for corporate purposes.The company's non-compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement raises concerns about investor confidence and market perception, which could affect the stock's liquidity and the company's ability to raise further capital. The request for a hearing with the Nasdaq Panel to regain compliance is a critical juncture for Draganfly and the outcome will be closely watched by stakeholders. Market Research Analyst Draganfly's shift in production capacity and the commercialization of its new drone platforms, Commander 3XL and Heavy Lift Drone, reflect strategic moves to capture emerging market opportunities in specialized drone applications. The enhanced production capabilities aim to meet the demands of advanced delivery, industrial and defense applications, areas with significant growth potential.The company's involvement in events like Modern Warfare Week and its engagement with the United Nations on emerging technologies for disaster risk reduction demonstrate efforts to position itself at the forefront of technological innovation in its field. These initiatives could improve brand recognition and open new business avenues, particularly in specialized sectors like defense and disaster management where technological advancements are critical.However, the transition to new product lines and customer integration requirements that led to decreased sales in the short term must be carefully managed to ensure long-term market position and financial stability. The company's ability to successfully market and deliver its new products will be a key factor in determining its future revenue growth and market share. Legal Expert The regulatory compliance aspect, particularly the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) related to minimum bid price, is a significant concern for Draganfly. The failure to maintain a minimum bid price and the subsequent noncompliance with the $5 million minimum stockholders’ equity requirement could lead to delisting, which would have serious implications for the company's ability to access capital markets and maintain shareholder confidence.The upcoming hearing with the Nasdaq Panel is a pivotal event for the company, as it will determine whether Draganfly can maintain its listing on the exchange. The company's plan to regain compliance will need to be robust and convincing to the Panel. The outcome of this hearing will be a key determinant of Draganfly's ability to continue as a publicly traded entity on a major exchange and it may have a material impact on the company's operational and strategic decisions going forward. 03/27/2024 - 04:45 PM Saskatoon, SK., March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Draganfly Inc. (NASDAQ: DPRO) (CSE: DPRO) (FSE: 3U8) (“Draganfly” or the “Company”), an award-winning, industry-leading drone solutions and systems developer, is pleased to announce its fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 financial results.

Key Financial and Operational Highlights for Q4 2023 and Early 2024: Revenue for Q4 2023 was $916,299 compared to $1,314,162 for Q4 2022 largely due to a decrease in Q4 product sales relating to product line transition and new customer category integration requirements along with slightly lower services sales.Gross Profit was $258,879 for Q4 2023 compared to -$1,665,971 in Q4 2022 representing an increase of $1,924,850 year over year. Gross profit for Q4 2023 would have been $382,303 if it wasn’t for a one time non-cash write down of inventory of $123,424 while Q4 2022 would have been $310,543 not including a one-time non-cash write down of inventory for $1,976,514. Hence, gross profit on an adjusted basis was up 23.1% year over year. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for Q4 2023 was 28.3% but on an adjusted basis was 41.7%.The Company recorded a comprehensive loss including non-cash items for Q4 2023 of $4,191,796 compared to a comprehensive loss of $16,660,602 for the same period in 2022.

The Company was allowed an initial 180-day grace period, or until March 20, 2024, (the “Compliance Period”), to regain compliance with the Rule. To regain compliance with the Rule the closing bid price of the Company’s common shares needed to be at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during the Compliance Period. On March 21, 2024, the Company received notification that it had failed to regain compliance with the Rule and is not eligible for a second 180 day compliance period because of its failure to comply with the $5 million minimum stockholders’ equity initial listing requirement for the period ended September 30, 2023. Unless the Company timely requests a hearing before an independent Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”), the Company’s securities will be subject to delisting. Accordingly, the Company will request a hearing before the Panel. The hearing request will automatically stay any suspension or delisting action pending the hearing and the expiration of any additional extension period granted by the Panel following the hearing. In that regard, pursuant to the Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Panel has the discretion to grant an additional extension period that can expire as late as September 17, 2024. At the hearing, the Company will be asked to provide a plan to regain compliance to the Panel. The Company intends to present a plan to regain compliance with the Rule and request the continued listing of its common shares on Nasdaq pending such compliance. However, there can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company’s request or that the Company will ultimately regain compliance with all applicable requirements for continued listing on Nasdaq.

Compass Minerals Announces Amendment to Credit Agreement,2024-03-27T20:34:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Compass Minerals (CMP) announces completion of amendment to credit agreement, providing financial covenant relief and greater flexibility.

The amendment aims to address challenges from mild deicing season and plant nutrition earnings. CFO Lorin Crenshaw highlights the adjustments as a step towards deleveraging and strengthening the balance sheet. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The amendment to Compass Minerals' credit agreement signals a strategic move to improve financial flexibility during a period of reduced earnings. The unanimous support from the bank group underscores the lenders' confidence in the company's management and its plan to navigate through current challenges. The mention of 'trough-level plant nutrition earnings' suggests that the company is experiencing a low point in its earnings cycle for that segment, which could be due to cyclical factors or competitive pressures.Investors should note that while financial covenant relief may provide necessary breathing room, it also indicates that the company is facing cash flow or profitability issues. The focus on deleveraging is a positive sign for long-term financial health, but it may also imply that the company's leverage is currently higher than desired. This strategy, if successful, could lead to an improved credit profile and potentially lower borrowing costs in the future.However, stakeholders should monitor the company's fixed cost reductions and capital intensity. While these measures can improve profitability, they might also limit the company's ability to invest in growth opportunities. The balance between cost control and investment in strategic areas will be key to the company's future performance. Credit Risk Analyst From a credit risk perspective, the amendment to the credit agreement may be indicative of Compass Minerals' need to adjust to less favorable market conditions. The reference to an 'exceptionally mild deicing season' points to the impact of weather variability on revenue streams, which is a risk factor for businesses dependent on seasonal factors.The company's proactive approach to seeking covenant relief is a prudent step to mitigate default risk. However, it is also a signal to credit risk assessors to closely watch the company's forthcoming financial statements for signs of stress or improvement. The ability to adhere to the revised covenants will be critical in maintaining lender confidence and access to capital.Additionally, stakeholders should consider the impact of these changes on the company's long-term credit ratings. While temporary relief is beneficial, sustained financial improvement is necessary to maintain or improve credit ratings, which in turn affect the cost of capital and the company's competitive position in the market. Market Research Analyst Understanding the broader market implications of Compass Minerals' credit agreement amendment requires assessing industry trends and market conditions. The company operates in a market sensitive to both environmental factors and global commodity prices. The mention of a 'recalibrated strategic focus' suggests an alignment with industry practices of optimizing capital allocation to ensure resilience in volatile markets.Market analysts would look at the demand forecasts for deicing products and plant nutrition, as these are key revenue drivers for Compass Minerals. The mild deicing season could be a one-off event, but if it is part of a longer-term trend, it could have significant implications for the industry. Similarly, the performance of the plant nutrition segment must be contextualized within the global agricultural commodity market.Investors may find opportunities in the company's shift towards higher returns on capital if it translates into operational efficiency and competitive advantage. However, the success of this strategy hinges on the company's execution and the market's response to these strategic changes. 03/27/2024 - 04:34 PM OVERLAND PARK, Kan.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Compass Minerals (NYSE: CMP), a leading global provider of essential minerals, today announced that it had completed an amendment to its existing credit agreement. The amendment provides financial covenant relief in the near term and greater flexibility over time across a broad range of operating scenarios. “We appreciate the unanimous support of our bank group and their recognition of the need for temporary covenant relief given the combination of an exceptionally mild deicing season and trough-level plant nutrition earnings. Today’s amendment adjusts our financial covenants in a manner that we believe provides sufficient headroom both in the near term and along our path to deleveraging over the coming years,” said Lorin Crenshaw, chief financial officer. “It occurs amid a recalibrated strategic focus aimed at strengthening our balance sheet and driving higher returns on capital through significant fixed cost reductions and lower capital intensity.” Additional details regarding the amendment are provided in the Form 8-K filed today.

This contraction can be attributed to a decrease in the average selling price of Corrugating Medium Paper (CMP), which is a significant product for IT Tech Packaging. Despite the increase in sales volume, the reduction in price points indicates a potential oversupply or competitive pricing pressures in the market.The gross margin contraction to 1.19% in Q4 and 1.16% for the full year, compared to the previous year, is alarming as it suggests a reduced profitability per unit of product sold. This could be due to increased production costs or inefficiencies that were not offset by sales, despite the reported decrease in material costs of CMP. The significant increase in Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses by 122.80% in Q4 is another red flag, as it may reflect heightened operational costs that are not scaling with revenue.However, it is worth noting the company's strategic focus on acquiring new customers and implementing flexible pricing and inventory management. These initiatives could potentially mitigate some of the risks associated with fluctuating market demands and improve cash flow in the long term. Additionally, the emphasis on environmentally friendly production could resonate with the growing consumer and regulatory demand for sustainable practices. Market Research Analyst The paper packaging industry is experiencing a shift due to environmental concerns and the implementation of plastic-restriction-orders, which IT Tech Packaging expects to increase domestic demand for their products. This external factor could provide a beneficial tailwind for the company. However, the company's operational loss margin skyrocketing to 18.13% in Q4 and 11.06% for the full year indicates significant challenges in managing operational efficiency.It's important to understand the competitive landscape in which IT Tech Packaging operates. The decrease in ASP for their products could be a result of competitive pressures or a shift in customer preferences. The paper packaging market is highly competitive, with many players vying for market share, which often leads to price wars. To maintain profitability, IT Tech Packaging will need to differentiate itself through product innovation, cost leadership, or superior customer service.The increase in tissue paper product sales stands out as a potential area of growth. The company's ability to capitalize on this increase could be a strategic focus moving forward, especially as consumer habits shift towards more sustainable options. Economic Analyst IT Tech Packaging's financial results reflect broader economic trends, such as commodity price fluctuations and the impact of global trade dynamics. The decreased EBITDA by 97.08% in Q4 and 48.81% for the full year is indicative of a challenging economic environment that has impacted the company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. This metric is important as it provides insights into the company's operational performance without the distortion of non-operational factors.Their net loss improvement in Q4 and the full year suggests that while the company is still losing money, the situation may be stabilizing. The company's long-term debt position has also slightly increased, which may raise concerns about the company's leverage and ability to service its debt in a tightening credit market.Looking ahead, IT Tech Packaging's ability to navigate the current economic landscape will depend on their agility in adjusting to market conditions and their success in executing strategic initiatives aimed at cost reduction and efficiency improvements. The company's focus on safe and environmentally friendly production aligns with global sustainability trends, which may offer competitive advantages as consumer preferences continue to evolve in favor of green products. 03/27/2024 - 04:30 PM BAODING, China, March 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- IT Tech Packaging, Inc.

Adjusted EBITDA improved by 8.9% to RMB2.04 billion in 2023. The company focuses on high-quality deliveries, AI-driven solutions, and strategic investments to drive sustainable value creation. Positive Strong execution of dual-core strategy in 2023 amid economic recovery. 8,321 self-built cabinets delivered meeting 2023 target. Net revenues for Q4 reached RMB1.90 billion, with adjusted EBITDA up by 3.8% year-over-year to RMB440.2 million. For full year 2023, net revenues increased by 4.9% to RMB7.41 billion, and adjusted EBITDA improved by 8.9% to RMB2.04 billion. Total cabinets under management increased to 93,597 by the end of Q4 2023. Forecast for 2024 includes total net revenues between RMB7,800 million to RMB8,000 million and adjusted EBITDA in the range of RMB2,220 million to RMB2,280 million. Non-GAAP measures like adjusted cash gross profit and adjusted EBITDA are used for evaluating business performance. Conference call scheduled for March 27, 2024, to discuss earnings results. Negative Gross profit decreased in Q4 2023 due to higher depreciation and amortization expenses. Operating expenses increased significantly in Q4 2023 primarily due to impairment charges. Net loss attributable to VNET Group, Inc. was RMB2.44 billion in Q4 2023 and RMB2.64 billion for the full year 2023. Impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill impacted the financial results negatively. Gross profit in the full year of 2023 decreased by 4.8% compared to 2022. Net cash generated from operating activities decreased in the full year of 2023 compared to 2022. Financial Analyst The financial results disclosed by VNET Group, Inc. highlight several key performance indicators that are essential for evaluating the company's financial health and potential investment quality. Notably, the increase in net revenues by 4.9% year-over-year and the improvement in adjusted EBITDA by 8.9% indicate a positive trajectory in the company's core business operations. However, these are partially offset by significant net losses due to impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill, which suggest potential overvaluation of assets in prior periods or a strategic shift that has caused certain assets to become less valuable.One must consider the company's operational highlights, such as the growth in the number of cabinets under management and the increased overall utilization rate of cabinets, which reflect an expanding infrastructure and customer base. The refinancing projects and strategic investments, like the one from SDHG, indicate a proactive approach to managing the company's capital structure and liquidity. Furthermore, the forecast for 2024 implies confidence in continued growth, which could be seen as a positive signal to investors.However, the large net loss driven by impairments raises questions about the company's valuation methods and the sustainability of its growth. While the impairments are non-cash charges and do not affect the company's cash flow directly, they can impact investor perception and the company's ability to raise capital in the future. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, VNET's focus on leveraging advanced technology and IDC resources to develop solutions for AI applications suggests alignment with the growing demand for data processing and storage driven by the AI industry. The company's strategic positioning to facilitate digital transformation across various verticals is indicative of a broader industry trend where data center services are increasingly critical to support the burgeoning data economy.The retail IDC Monthly Recurring Revenues (MRR) per cabinet, while showing a slight decrease quarter-over-quarter, has increased year-over-year. This metric is important as it demonstrates the company's ability to monetize its assets and maintain revenue streams. The slight decrease could be due to market competition or pricing strategies that need to be monitored for future trends.It is also worth noting the company's geographical context. Operating in China, VNET is subject to the country's regulatory environment and economic conditions, which can influence its operational capabilities and market opportunities. The mention of a steady economic recovery suggests an improving macroeconomic climate, which could benefit the company's operations. Economist Examining the broader economic implications, the reported financial results and operational metrics of VNET Group, Inc. must be contextualized within the current economic environment. The company's performance, particularly the increase in net revenues and adjusted EBITDA, suggests resilience in the face of economic uncertainty and reflects a potential recovery trend in the tech sector, especially in data center operations which are pivotal for supporting digital economies.The strategic investment and refinancing initiatives undertaken by the company are indicative of a favorable capital market environment, allowing VNET to restructure its debt and secure investment despite reporting substantial impairments. This environment may also provide a cushion against potential liquidity issues arising from the reported net losses.However, the economic outlook is not without risks. The impairments suggest that there may be underlying inefficiencies or market shifts that could affect future profitability. The reliance on continued growth in AI and digital transformation initiatives as revenue drivers may expose the company to sector-specific risks, particularly if there is a slowdown in technology adoption or shifts in regulatory policies within China. 03/27/2024 - 04:30 PM BEIJING, March 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- VNET Group, Inc.

Gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 15.3%, compared with 17.5% in the same period of 2022.

ATS Announces C$163 Million Secondary Offering of Common Shares,2024-03-27T20:11:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"ATS  (TSX: ATS) (NYSE: ATS) announces a bought deal offering of 3,500,000 common shares at C$46.55 per share, generating gross proceeds of approximately C$163 million.","ATS Announces C$163 Million Secondary Offering of Common Shares Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary ATS (TSX: ATS) (NYSE: ATS) announces a bought deal offering of 3,500,000 common shares at C$46.55 per share, generating gross proceeds of approximately C$163 million. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Examining the recent transaction involving ATS Corporation's common shares, it's evident that the sale orchestrated by Mason Capital Management and facilitated by Scotiabank signifies a substantial liquidity event for the selling shareholder. The deal, comprising 3.5 million shares at C$46.55 each, injects roughly C$163 million into Mason Capital's coffers. This is a sizeable transaction within the context of the market, especially for a single institutional investor.From a market dynamics perspective, the 'bought deal' structure indicates confidence on the part of Scotiabank in ATS's stock, as they commit to purchasing the entire lot before the public offering. This often suggests an anticipation of strong demand or a perceived undervaluation. Investors should monitor the stock's performance post-deal for potential volatility as the new shares become absorbed by the market. It's also noteworthy to consider the implications of such a deal on the company's share price and ownership structure, as large transactions can sometimes lead to price fluctuations or shifts in shareholder influence. Financial Analyst Focusing on the financial implications of ATS's share offering, the immediate liquidity benefit to Mason Capital Management is clear. However, for ATS, the transaction's impact is more nuanced. The offering does not directly benefit ATS's balance sheet since the proceeds go to the selling shareholder. Instead, the company might experience indirect effects, such as changes in its investor base and potential shifts in the market's perception of the company's value.Investors should consider the Offering's timing and pricing. At C$46.55 per share, the price must be weighed against recent trading history and the company's fundamental valuation to assess whether it reflects a premium or discount. Such a transaction could signal confidence in ATS's long-term prospects if the price is at or above the current market valuation. Conversely, if the price represents a discount, it might raise questions about the selling shareholder's outlook on the company's future performance. Legal Expert In terms of regulatory and compliance considerations, this transaction between ATS Corporation, Mason Capital Management and Scotiabank must adhere to strict securities laws and regulations. The involvement of a 'Sole Bookrunner' like Scotiabank ensures that the transaction is executed efficiently and in accordance with market standards. Investors should be aware of the legal framework governing such deals, as it aims to maintain transparency and fairness in the market.It is also important for stakeholders to review the terms of the agreement, any disclosures made by ATS regarding the transaction and the potential impact on the company's corporate governance. Changes in significant share ownership can alter the balance of power within a company, potentially leading to shifts in strategic direction or management decisions. Understanding these legal and governance implications can provide investors with a deeper insight into the company's future trajectory. 03/27/2024 - 04:11 PM CAMBRIDGE, Ontario, March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ATS Corporation (TSX: ATS) (NYSE: ATS) (“ATS” or the “Company”) has announced today that it has entered into an agreement with a fund managed by Mason Capital Management LLC (the “Selling Shareholder”) and Scotiabank (the “Underwriter”), acting as Sole Bookrunner, pursuant to which the Underwriter has agreed to purchase, on a bought deal basis, 3,500,000 common shares of ATS (the “Shares”) from the Selling Shareholder, at a price of C$46.55 per Share for gross proceeds to the Selling Shareholder of approximately C$163 million (the “Offering”).

Announces a $500 Million Share Repurchase Authorization and Stockholder Approval of Amended Stockholders Agreement with Hill Path Capital LP Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags buyback Rhea-AI Summary United Parks & Resorts Inc. (NYSE: PRKS) announced the approval of a $500.0 million share repurchase program by its stockholders. The company also amended its stockholders agreement with Hill Path Capital LP. The approval received over 97% support from stockholders, indicating strong alignment on capital allocation priorities. Positive None. Negative None. Market Analyst The authorization of a $500 million share buyback program by United Parks & Resorts Inc. is a strategic financial maneuver that can potentially increase shareholder value. By reducing the number of shares outstanding, the company's earnings per share (EPS) could see an uptick, assuming net income remains constant or grows. This is a common tactic employed by firms looking to utilize excess cash in a way that might benefit investors, especially when organic growth opportunities are not immediately evident or when the management believes the stock is undervalued.Moreover, the limitation on repurchasing shares to avoid Hill Path's ownership exceeding 50% is a safeguard to prevent any single entity from gaining a controlling interest inadvertently through the buyback. This indicates a balance between returning capital to shareholders and maintaining corporate governance structures. The market's reaction to such news typically depends on the perceived commitment of a company to creating shareholder value and the current market conditions. The lack of a time limit on the repurchase program provides flexibility, allowing the company to adapt to changing market conditions and to buy back shares opportunistically. Corporate Governance Expert The overwhelming approval of both the amendment to the stockholders agreement and the share repurchase program reflects a strong alignment between the board, management and shareholders. It demonstrates shareholder confidence in the company's governance and strategic direction. The amendment with Hill Path Capital LP ensures that no single shareholder gains disproportionate influence, which is a positive sign for minority investors concerned about equitable treatment.It's important to note that the governance dynamics of share buybacks can be complex. While they can be seen as a positive signal, they also reduce the capital available for future investments, which could be a concern if the company needs to pivot or seize new growth opportunities. The governance aspect of the buyback program, including the authorization process and the checks and balances in place, is essential for ensuring that such financial decisions are made with the long-term health of the company in mind. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the implementation of a share repurchase program should be considered alongside the company's current financial health and liquidity. The decision to allocate $500 million to buy back shares suggests that United Parks & Resorts Inc. has sufficient liquidity and possibly a strong balance sheet. Investors should assess the impact of this buyback on the company's debt levels, interest coverage ratios and overall financial flexibility.Additionally, the timing and execution of the buyback will be important to its effectiveness. If executed when shares are perceived to be undervalued, buybacks can be more accretive to EPS. Conversely, if shares are bought back at a high valuation, the benefit to shareholders might not be as significant. The company's mention of alternative investment opportunities as a factor in the buyback decision suggests a strategic approach to capital allocation, balancing buybacks with other potential uses of cash that could generate returns. 03/27/2024 - 04:30 PM ORLANDO, Fla., March 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- United Parks & Resorts Inc. (NYSE: PRKS), a leading theme park and entertainment company, today reported that on Monday, March 25, 2024, its stockholders overwhelmingly approved a $500.0 million buyback authorization and the amendment of the stockholders agreement with Hill Path Capital LP (""Hill Path"").

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The submission of Navigator Holdings Ltd.'s Annual Report on Form 20-F to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is a regulatory requirement for foreign companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the company's financial health, operational performance and strategic direction, making it a valuable resource for investors and analysts alike.From a financial perspective, the report's key figures, such as revenue, net income and earnings per share, offer insights into the company's profitability and growth potential. It is also essential to evaluate the company's balance sheet strength, particularly its liquidity ratios and debt levels, which can significantly influence its ability to weather economic downturns or capitalize on growth opportunities.Furthermore, the management discussion and analysis (MD&A) section sheds light on the company's competitive position within the liquefied gas carrier industry, potential risks and future outlook. Given the energy sector's volatility, particularly with the ongoing global shifts towards greener energy sources, Navigator Gas's strategies for adapting to these changes will be critical for long-term sustainability. Energy Sector Analyst Navigator Gas operates within the niche market of handysize liquefied gas carriers, a segment that plays a important role in the global transportation of liquefied gases. The annual report can provide insights into the supply and demand dynamics of the liquefied gas market, including the impact of international trade flows and regulatory changes on the company's operations.For instance, the company's fleet utilization rates and charter rates are indicators of the market's health and Navigator Gas's operational efficiency. It's also important to consider the company's environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives, as these factors are increasingly important to investors. The shipping industry is under pressure to reduce emissions and Navigator Gas's approach to sustainability can affect its reputation and ability to secure charters.Lastly, examining the company's investment in new technologies or fleet expansion can signal its readiness to meet future demand and compliance with stricter environmental regulations. Such strategic moves can have long-term implications for the company's market share and profitability. 03/27/2024 - 04:47 PM LONDON, March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Navigator Holdings Ltd.

(Nasdaq: MDAI) (“Spectral AI” or the “Company”), an artificial intelligence (AI) company focused on medical diagnostics for faster and more accurate treatment decisions in wound care, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter (“Q4 2023”) and full year (“FY 2023”) ended December 31, 2023 and provided an update on its ongoing business activities. “Spectral AI achieved much in 2023, and our progress along multiple fronts has continued into 2024,” said Peter M. Carlson, Chief Executive Officer. “The team’s achievements to date, and those on the horizon, are the result of a 10-year record of success in delivering on a promise to develop and commercialize our proprietary AI-Driven DeepView™ System wound healing assessment platform, a technology that we believe can help change the standard of care while delivering value across the healthcare ecosystem. We expect to realize our first commercial product revenue in the second half of this year. Given the pace of our product development and clinical activities in the US and internationally, we believe that we are on the proper path to generate commercial revenue across four separate DeepView™ System platforms covering burn and diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) within the next three years. “We have a well-defined business focus for 2024 based on the evolution of our DeepView™ System from clinical stage to commercialization. We will continue to advance our research and development work under current US Government contracts for our DeepView™ System burn indication and plan to submit regulatory filings for the approval of this indication in the US in the first half of 2025. We are pursuing the commercialization of our DeepView™ System for the assessment of DFU in the US and the UK, and expect to submit regulatory filings for the approval of this indication in the US and UK in 2024. Our recent financing agreements in combination with the multi-year, non-dilutive funding provided by our US Government contracts provides us with a sound financial foundation to pursue these objectives. “ 2023-2024 SELECT BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS Government Funding In September 2023, we were awarded the largest contract in our history from the US Government valued at up to $150.0 million. This multi-year, non-dilutive contract includes an initial award of approximately $54.9 million to fund development activities through Q1 2026 for our DeepView™ System for burn to submit a De Novo FDA application, and for government procurement of the device for distribution at various burn centers and emergency rooms across the United States. First Commercial Product Revenue In February 2024, we received UKCA Authorization to commence sales of our DeepView™ System for burn in the UK. We deployed our first burn device in March 2024 and expect to commence generating commercial revenues in the second half of 2024. Regulatory In October 2023, our DeepView SnapShot® wound imaging system received regulatory authorization in the UK and Class 1 medical device classification with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Clinical Trials In January 2023, we provided interim results for our DFU Clinical Study, which will be used in upcoming regulatory submissions in the UK and US.In December 2023, we initiated a pivotal study to validate our DeepView™ System for burn, which is expected to be the final clinical trial before seeking FDA approval. This study is being conducted in burn centers and emergency departments with an enrollment target of 240 subjects in both adult and pediatric patients. Product Development In March 2024, we received a new contract valued at $500,000 from the US Government that provides additional support for the development of the handheld version of our DeepView™ System called DeepView SnapShot® M. This new award brings total support for the DeepView SnapShot® M to more than $6 million. In August 2023, we received ISO 13485 certification for the manufacture and distribution of our DeepView™ System. Corporate Successfully listed on Nasdaq in September 2023, elevating our profile among US investors and other stakeholders.Added significant strength and industry depth to our board of directors with the appointments of Deepak Sadagopan, MHCDS, Erich Spangenberg, Dr. J.

Research & Development RevenueResearch & Development Revenue1 for Q4 2023 was $5.3 million compared to $6.1 million, primarily due to the implementation of the new BARDA PBS contract, executed in September 2023. For FY 2023, Research & Development revenue was $18.1 million compared to $25.4 million, reflecting a decrease in activity due to the completion of work under the BARDA Burn II contract, partially offset by the commencement of work under the new BARDA PBS contract. Gross Margin Gross margin for Q4 2023 was 46.1% compared to 41.1%. For FY 2023, gross margin rose to 43.6% from 42.7%. The improvement in gross margin for both periods reflected the commencement of work under the BARDA PBS contract, which carries a higher reimbursement rate than the prior BARDA Burn II contract. General & Administrative ExpenseGeneral & administrative expenses in Q4 2023 were $5.4 million compared to $4.3 million. For FY 2023, general & administrative expenses rose to $20.9 million from $13.5 million. The increase for both periods was the result of increased headcount required to support our organizational growth, and higher costs associated with an increase in non-revenue generating R&D activities. Net LossNet loss for Q4 2023 was $(3.5) million, or $(0.22) per share, compared to a net loss of $(1.7) million, or $(0.13) per share, for Q4 2022. For FY 2023, the net loss was $(20.9) million, or $(1.48) per share, compared to a net loss of $(2.9) million, or $(0.22) per share, for FY 2022. Net loss for the 2023 period included $8.3 million of non-recurring transaction costs associated with the consummation of the Company’s business combination that resulted in its Nasdaq listing; there were no such costs incurred in 2022. Cash As of December 31, 2023, cash was $4.8 million and the Company had no long-term debt. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company enhanced its financial position, as follows: Received proceeds of $5.0 million via a fixed price prepaid advance and standby equity purchase agreement (SEPA) with a long-only investor with a fixed conversion price of $3.16 as part of a total advance of $12.5 million. The SEPA facility provides for financing of up to $30.0 million in total. Received proceeds of approximately $2.8 million via a committed equity facility that was entered into in December 2023 under which the Company is able to draw an additional $3.0 million prior to utilizing the SEPA facility. ____________________________ 1Research and Development Revenue consisted primarily of funding from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 2024 Guidance The Company is reiterating its revenue guidance of approximately $28.0 million for FY 2024. Financial guidance for FY 2024 does not reflect expected contributions from the sale of the DeepView™ System for burn in the UK beginning in the second half of 2024 or any additional material financial contributions that may result from the commercialization of our DeepView™ System.

Varex Announces Closing of Revolving Credit Facility of $155 Million,2024-03-27T20:05:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Varex Imaging  (VREX) has secured a senior secured revolving credit agreement worth up to $155 million. The agreement aims to enhance liquidity for working capital and general corporate purposes, potentially aiding in debt repayment.","Varex Announces Closing of Revolving Credit Facility of $155 Million Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Varex Imaging (VREX) has secured a senior secured revolving credit agreement worth up to $155 million. The agreement aims to enhance liquidity for working capital and general corporate purposes, potentially aiding in debt repayment. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The new revolving credit agreement for Varex Imaging Corporation, with a principal amount of up to $155 million, offers a flexible financial tool that can be used to support the company's operational and strategic needs. The decision to switch from the previous asset-based credit facility to this new arrangement suggests a strategic move to improve liquidity management. By choosing Zions Bancorporation as the lead arranger, Varex may benefit from favorable terms due to Zions' expertise and reputation in the financial sector.This shift indicates Varex's proactive approach to capital management, which may be positively perceived by investors and analysts. The availability of funds for working capital and debt repayment can provide a cushion against market volatility and enable the company to pursue growth opportunities or weather downturns without diluting shareholder value through equity financing. However, it is important to monitor the terms of the credit facility, such as interest rates and covenants, as they can impact the company's financial flexibility and cost of capital. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Varex Imaging's announcement of the new credit facility could signal a broader strategic initiative. It may hint at upcoming investments in technology, potential acquisitions, or expansion efforts that require a robust financial backing. Market participants often view such credit arrangements as a vote of confidence from lending institutions, which can translate into a more favorable outlook for the company's stock.It's important to assess how this financial maneuver aligns with industry trends where companies are increasingly leveraging credit facilities for agility rather than relying solely on cash reserves or equity financing. The health of the balance sheet post-arrangement will be a key factor for investors to watch, as it affects the company's risk profile and its ability to capitalize on market opportunities. Debt Market Analyst Entering into a senior secured revolving credit agreement is a significant financial move that reflects on the company's creditworthiness and its relationship with lenders. The termination of the existing credit agreement in favor of the new RLOC Facility may be aimed at optimizing the company’s debt structure. It's important to analyze the credit terms, such as the interest rate spread, commitment fees and financial covenants, which will determine the cost-effectiveness of this facility.The impact on Varex's leverage ratios and interest coverage ratios should be considered, as these are key indicators of financial health in the eyes of debt holders. Investors in the debt market will be keen to understand how this new facility affects the company's ability to meet its financial obligations, especially in an environment where interest rates may fluctuate. 03/27/2024 - 04:05 PM SALT LAKE CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Varex Imaging Corporation (Nasdaq: VREX) today announced it has entered into a senior secured revolving credit agreement (the “RLOC Facility”) for an initial aggregate principal amount of up to $155 million.

Five Star Bancorp Announces Launch of Common Stock Offering,2024-03-27T20:09:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,Five Star Bancorp (FSBC) announced a public offering of common stock to support growth and general corporate purposes. The underwriters have an option to purchase additional shares. The net proceeds will be used for investments in the Bank and working capital.,"Five Star Bancorp Announces Launch of Common Stock Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Five Star Bancorp (FSBC) announced a public offering of common stock to support growth and general corporate purposes. The underwriters have an option to purchase additional shares. The net proceeds will be used for investments in the Bank and working capital. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The public offering of common stock by Five Star Bancorp represents a strategic move to increase the company's capital base. This action suggests a forward-looking approach by management to strengthen the company's financial position and support expansion initiatives. The decision to grant underwriters a 30-day option for additional shares provides a buffer to potentially raise more funds than initially anticipated, which could indicate a robust demand forecast for the stock.By engaging reputable financial institutions such as Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Stephens Inc. and D.A. Davidson & Co., the company is leveraging their networks and expertise to ensure a successful offering. The use of proceeds for 'general corporate purposes' is quite broad, but the specific mention of supporting growth through investments in the Bank suggests that the funds might be used for scaling operations, enhancing technology infrastructure, or pursuing strategic acquisitions. Investors would be interested in how these investments translate into future earnings potential. Market Research Analyst The banking sector is highly competitive and Five Star Bancorp's move to raise capital through a public offering is indicative of its growth ambitions. The timing of the offering and the market's reception can significantly impact the company's stock price and investor sentiment. The market will closely watch the subscription levels of the offering as an indicator of investor confidence in Five Star Bancorp's growth prospects.Additionally, the involvement of well-known co-managers in the offering might inspire confidence among potential investors. However, it is essential to monitor the pricing of the offering, as it may affect the perceived value of the company. A price set too high could deter investors, while a price set too low could undervalue the company and lead to potential losses for existing shareholders. Economist The broader economic context in which Five Star Bancorp is launching its public offering is important for understanding potential market behavior. Factors such as interest rate trends, regulatory changes and economic indicators play a significant role in the banking sector's performance. An offering's success can be influenced by these macroeconomic factors, which can either boost investor confidence or lead to heightened caution.From an economic standpoint, the additional capital raised could enable Five Star Bancorp to better navigate economic cycles and invest in areas that promise higher returns. However, the company's management must carefully balance the growth opportunities against the cost of capital to ensure shareholder value is not diluted in the process. 03/27/2024 - 04:09 PM RANCHO CORDOVA, Calif., March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Five Star Bancorp (Nasdaq: FSBC) (“Five Star” or the “Company”), a holding company that operates through its wholly owned banking subsidiary, Five Star Bank (the “Bank”), announced today that it has launched an underwritten public offering of shares of its common stock.

The prospectus should be read carefully before investing. Principal Risk Factors: You could lose money by investing in a fund. An investment in a fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed. There can be no assurance that a fund's objective(s) will be achieved. Investors buying or selling shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions. Please refer to each fund's prospectus and Statement of Additional Information for additional details on a fund's risks. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor. Past performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return and market value of an investment in a Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. A Fund's shares will change in value, and you could lose money by investing in a Fund. An investment in a Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency. There can be no assurance that a Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. An investment in a Fund involves risks similar to those of investing in any portfolio of equity securities traded on exchanges. The risks of investing in each Fund are spelled out in its prospectus, shareholder report, and other regulatory filings. ETF shares may only be redeemed directly from a fund by authorized participants in very large creation/redemption units. ETF shares may trade at a discount to net asset value and possibly face delisting. A fund that effects all or a portion of its creations and redemptions for cash rather than in-kind may be less tax efficient. Current market conditions risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of the fund in general, may fall in value due to current market conditions. As a means to fight inflation, the Federal Reserve and certain foreign central banks have raised interest rates and expect to continue to do so, and the Federal Reserve has announced that it intends to reverse previously implemented quantitative easing. Recent and potential future bank failures could result in disruption to the broader banking industry or markets generally and reduce confidence in financial institutions and the economy as a whole, which may also heighten market volatility and reduce liquidity. Ongoing armed conflicts between Russia and Ukraine in Europe and among Israel, Hamas and other militant groups in the Middle East, have caused and could continue to cause significant market disruptions and volatility within the markets in Russia, Europe, the Middle East and the United States. The hostilities and sanctions resulting from those hostilities have and could continue to have a significant impact on certain fund investments as well as fund performance and liquidity. The COVID-19 global pandemic, or any future public health crisis, and the ensuing policies enacted by governments and central banks have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets, negatively impacting global growth prospects. A fund is susceptible to operational risks through breaches in cyber security. Such events could cause a fund to incur regulatory penalties, reputational damage, additional compliance costs associated with corrective measures and/or financial loss. In managing a fund's investment portfolio, the portfolio managers will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have the desired result. Market risk is the risk that a particular security, or shares of a fund in general may fall in value. Securities are subject to market fluctuations caused by such factors as general economic conditions, political events, regulatory or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, spread of infectious disease or other public health issues, recessions, natural disasters or other events could have significant negative impact on a fund. A fund with significant exposure to a single asset class, country, region, industry, or sector may be more affected by an adverse economic or political development than a broadly diversified fund. Certain securities are subject to call, credit, extension, income, inflation, interest rate, prepayment and zero coupon risks. These risks could result in a decline in a security's value and/or income, increased volatility as interest rates rise or fall and have an adverse impact on a fund's performance. Securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to additional risks, including currency fluctuations, political risks, withholding, the lack of adequate financial information, and exchange control restrictions impacting non-U.S. issuers. These risk may be heightened for securities of companies located in, or with significant operations in, emerging market countries. A fund may invest in the shares of other funds, which involves additional expenses that would not be present in a direct investment in the underlying funds. In addition, a fund's investment performance and risks may be related to the investment performance and risks of the underlying funds. First Trust Advisors L.P.

(UGRO) reported a backlog of $110 million as of December 31, 2023, with a sequential increase of $26 million. The company's 2024 outlook projects revenue growth and positive Adjusted EBITDA. Full year 2023 results showed a 6.7% revenue increase to $71.5 million, while net income was $(18.7) million. For full year 2024, revenue is expected to exceed $84.0 million with positive Adjusted EBITDA.

Urban-gro remains focused on cost reduction and operational efficiency to drive sustained positive Adjusted EBITDA in 2024. Positive Strong backlog of $110 million as of December 31, 2023, with a $26 million sequential increase. Full year 2023 revenue increased by 6.7% to $71.5 million, while net income was $(18.7) million. Full year 2024 revenue expected to surpass $84.0 million with positive Adjusted EBITDA. First quarter 2024 preliminary guidance indicates revenue at or above $15.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA at or better than ($0.5) million. Cost reductions of over $8 million implemented to align cost structure and drive sustained positive Adjusted EBITDA in 2024. Negative Gross profit decrease in fourth quarter 2023 due to lower revenue and shift towards lower margin construction Design-Build. Operating expenses increased by $0.1 million in fourth quarter 2023 primarily due to higher legal expenses. Net loss in fourth quarter 2023 was $4.7 million, compared to $4.2 million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $3.0 million in fourth quarter 2023, lower than negative $1.7 million in the prior year period. Decrease in Adjusted EBITDA for full year 2023 attributed to lower equipment system revenues and European entity expenses. Market Research Analyst The reported backlog increase for urban-gro, Inc. to $110 million signals potential revenue growth and could be indicative of the company's ability to secure contracts, reflecting positively on its market position. The construction Design-Build sector, comprising the majority of the backlog, suggests urban-gro's strategic focus in this area may be paying dividends. The guidance for 2024, projecting revenue growth of at least 17.4% and a positive Adjusted EBITDA, paints an optimistic picture for the company's financial health and operational efficiency.However, the reported net loss and negative Adjusted EBITDA for 2023 highlight ongoing challenges. The shift towards lower margin construction Design-Build revenue and the decrease in equipment systems revenue due to regulatory delays in the CEA market are concerning. These factors, combined with the cost optimization efforts and the backlog, will be critical in determining whether urban-gro can achieve its 2024 targets. Stakeholders should monitor the company's ability to convert its backlog into high-margin revenue and the effectiveness of its cost reduction strategies. Financial Analyst The financial results for urban-gro, Inc. for the full year 2023 reflect a mixed performance, with a modest increase in revenue overshadowed by a larger net loss and a more significant negative Adjusted EBITDA compared to the previous year. This deterioration in profitability metrics may raise concerns among investors regarding the company's cost management and the scalability of its business model. The increase in operating expenses, despite a reduction in one-time business development expenses, suggests that the company's overhead may not be adequately aligned with its revenue streams.Looking ahead, the company's guidance for 2024 indicates a strategy focused on growth and operational improvements. The emphasis on positive Adjusted EBITDA is a step in the right direction, but the actual achievement of these targets will depend on urban-gro's ability to navigate market conditions and maintain cost discipline. The anticipated revenue growth is a positive signal, yet investors should remain cautious and seek evidence of sustainable profitability and cash flow generation before drawing conclusions about the company's long-term prospects. Legal Expert From a legal and regulatory standpoint, urban-gro's performance and outlook are significantly influenced by the evolving landscape of the Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) sector. The mention of potential regulatory changes, such as the rescheduling of cannabis and the passing of the SAFER Banking Act, highlights the company's dependency on favorable legislation for growth. While these changes could unlock opportunities for urban-gro, investors should be aware of the inherent risks associated with regulatory reliance. The company's ability to adapt to changes in the legal environment and to capitalize on new legislation will be important for its success in the CEA market.Additionally, the increase in legal expenses as part of the operating costs raises questions about the company's exposure to legal risks. This could be a reflection of the complex regulatory environment urban-gro operates in and stakeholders should consider the potential impact of ongoing and future legal challenges on the company's financial position and reputation. 03/27/2024 - 04:05 PM Backlog of $110 million as of December 31, 2023, a sequential increase of $26 million2024 outlook calls for strengthening revenues and positive Adjusted EBITDACompany to host conference call and webcast today, March 27, 2024 at 4:30 PM ETLAFAYETTE, CO / ACCESSWIRE / March 27, 2024 / urban-gro, Inc. (Nasdaq:UGRO) (""urban-gro"" or the ""Company""), an integrated professional services and Design-Build firm offering solutions to the Controlled Environment Agriculture (""CEA"") and other commercial sectors, today reported fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results, and provided preliminary results for first quarter 2024 as well as full year 2024 guidance. Full Year 2023 Results vs Prior Year Period:Revenue of $71.5 million, a 6.7% increase from $67.0 millionNet income (loss) of $(18.7) million, as compared to $(15.3) millionAdjusted EBITDA 1 of $(9.7) million, as compared to $(3.9) millionFull Year 2024 Guidance:Revenue of more than $84.0 million, representing growth of at least 17.4%Positive Adjusted EBITDA 1First Quarter 2024 Preliminary Guidance vs Prior Year Period:Revenue at or better than $15.0 million, as compared to $16.8 millionAdjusted EBITDA 1 at or better than ($0.5) million, as compared to $(3.4) million""2023 was a transitional year for the Company as our diversified end market exposure provided a hedge against prolonged softness in the Cannabis segment. In fact, 70% of our revenues were tied to these commercial sectors, with the remaining 30% in CEA, demonstrating a reversal from the trends we experienced in 2022 and highlighting the value of our diversification strategy,"" commented Bradley Nattrass, Chairman and CEO. That said, our fourth quarter was adversely impacted by project delays to several projects that pushed into fiscal year 2024. While these delays are disappointing, these projects remain active in the first quarter, and our $110 million project backlog at the end of 2023 bodes well for growth prospects in 2024. To better align our cost structure with the current environment, we implemented cost reductions of more than $8 million dollars on an annualized basis over the course of the past twelve months, which we believe will serve as the foundation to generate sustained positive Adjusted EBITDA in 2024.""Mr. Nattrass added, ""Looking ahead to 2024, our sector-diversified professional services and Design-Build model is in place and our optimized team of architects, interior designers, engineers, construction management personnel, and horticulturists is focused on servicing the demand we have in our backlog. We continue to see strong momentum across multiple sectors, and with the increased productivity in our services delivery to start the year, we expect to realize margin improvement as well. Our guidance implies a strong year of organic growth based on the latest estimates of project timing and the impact of our streamlined operating structure. We also remain well positioned to capture any momentum from industry-specific regulatory changes, should they arise. We believe that the potential rescheduling of cannabis, the passing of the SAFER Banking Act, and the approval from new states, like Florida, to legalize cannabis for adult use, are catalysts for Design-Build projects and ancillary equipment systems sales. We remain committed to operating as efficiently as possible and staying focused on the development of our project pipeline across our diverse client base so that we can achieve our near-term goal of returning to positive Adjusted EBITDA generation and drive long-term profitable growth.""Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial ResultsRevenue was $15.0 million, as compared to $17.3 million in the prior year period. This decrease from the prior year period was driven by lower construction Design-Build revenue of $1.3 million, and lower professional services revenue of $0.8 million.Gross profit was $1.7 million, or 11% of revenue as compared to $3.2 million, or 19% of revenue in the prior year period. The decrease in gross profit correlates to the decrease in revenue as well as a shift in mix toward lower margin construction Design-Build revenue. This was further impacted by a project cost revision in the fourth quarter that negatively impacted project profitability.Operating expenses were $6.4 million as compared to $6.2 million in the prior year period, representing an increase of $0.1 million. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increased legal expenses. On an annualized basis, the Company expects a year-over-year reduction of more than $8.0 million in operating expenses in 2024 primarily as a result of a cost optimization across the entire organization.Non-operating expenses were $0.1 million as compared to $1.3 million in the prior year period.Net loss was $4.7 million, or $(0.40) per share as compared to a net loss of $4.2 million, or $(0.39) per share in the prior year period.Adjusted EBITDA 1 was negative $3.0 million as compared to negative $1.7 million in the prior year period. The decrease was driven by lower margin construction Design-Build revenue, a decrease in profit margins on professional services revenue, and the Company's commitment to keep the equipment integration team and European entities in place to drive future growth.As of December 31 2023 , , the Company had $1.1 million in cash and $2.5 million drawn on its $10 million revolving credit facility. The Company put this revolving line of credit in place primarily to be able to handle the significant anticipated growth in construction Design-Build revenues and to better manage cash flow needs related to that overall business.Summary Full Year 2023 Financial ResultsRevenue was $71.5 million as compared to $67.0 million in the prior year, representing an increase of $4.5 million, or 6.7%. The increase was primarily driven by a significant increase in construction revenue of $26.4 million, offset by a significant decrease of $20.7 million in equipment systems revenue reflecting a continuation of significantly reduced demand in the CEA market as a result of ongoing state-level regulatory delays in the license-awarding process, as well as the lack of movement on passing key legislation impacting the industry.Gross profit was $10.3 million, or 14.4% of revenue, as compared to $14.2 million, or 21% of revenue in the prior year. The decrease in gross profit was primarily driven by the change in overall revenue contribution for the Company, with 65% composed of lower margin construction Design-Build revenue. In addition, the profit margin for the professional services revenue decreased to 39%, from 52% in the prior year, due to temporary inefficiencies during the integration of all acquired companies onto the same enterprise resource planning system.Operating expenses were $27.0 million as compared to $26.8 million in the prior year, due primarily to the net effects of a $3.8 million increase in general and administrative expenses and a $3.3 million reduction in a one-time business development expense. The increase in general and administrative expenses was the result of increased professional fees associated with legal defense costs and increased personnel costs associated with an increase in the average number of employees.Non-operating expenses were $2.2 million as compared to $3.0 million in the prior year, and included $1.5 million for the settlement of a litigation, and an additional contingent consideration expense of $0.3 million related to the impairment of the XS Financial investment.Net loss was $18.7 million, or $(1.66) per share as compared to a net loss of $15.3 million, or $(1.44) per share, in the prior year.Adjusted EBITDA 1 was negative $9.7 million as compared to negative $3.9 million in the prior year. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA 1 is predominantly attributed to the significant decrease in equipment system revenues, and expenses related to our European entity.1 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please see the information under ""Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information"" below for a description of Adjusted EBITDA and the table at the end of this press release for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial information to GAAP results.Backlog as of December 31, 2023Consolidated backlog is unrealized revenue represented by contractually committed construction Design-Build, equipment systems, and service orders. As of December 31, 2023, total backlog was approximately $110 million in contracts, comprised of $102 million in construction Design-Build, $7 million of professional services, and $1 million of equipment systems.The following table summarizes the year over year change in backlog from the year ended December 31, 2022 to the year ended December 31, 2023: Equipment Systems Services Construction Design-Build Total Backlog (in millions) Beginning backlog as of December 31, 2022 $5 $6 $82 $93 Revenue recognized (13) (12) (46) (71)Backlog additions 9 13 66 Ending backlog as of December 31, 2023 $1 $7 $102 $110 Geographic FootprintThe Company currently operates out of offices in Colorado, Texas and Georgia in the United States and an office in Dordrecht, Netherlands in Europe.Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA 1 Guidance - Full Year 2024 and First Quarter 2024For the 2024 full year, the Company anticipates consolidated revenues to grow by at least 17% to more than $84 million and that it will generate positive Adjusted EBITDA 1 . For the first quarter 2024, the Company expects revenue to be more than $15 million with Adjusted EBITDA 1 to be better than negative $0.5 million. While equipment revenues remain soft and construction is expected to be slightly better than the fourth quarter of 2023, revenues from professional services are expected to be robust, which is a strong leading indicator of future construction and equipment demand. Further, as a result of the expense reductions we implemented in 2023, gross margins are expected to improve year-over-year.Conference Call Detailsurban-gro will host a conference call and live audio webcast to discuss the operational and financial results today, March 27 , 2024 at 4:30 PM ET.

We use Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of our operating performance. Our board of directors and management team focus on Adjusted EBITDA as a key performance and compensation measure. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA assists us in comparing our performance over various reporting periods because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that our management believes do not reflect our core operating performance.We present a net loss (GAAP) reconciliation to adjusted net loss (Non-GAAP) and EPS in order to show the impacts on net income (loss) and EPS of non-recurring items, net of tax, so that our stakeholders can easily see what our results would have been had these items been excluded from those calculations. Our board of directors and management team believe this reconciliation allows our stakeholders to review our adjusted results to those presented by other companies in our industry.Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net loss are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, and they are not a substitute for net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure prescribed by GAAP.There are limitations to using non-GAAP measures such as Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net-loss. Although we believe that Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net-loss can make an evaluation of our operating performance more consistent because it removes items that do not reflect our core operations, other companies in our industry may define Adjusted EBITDA or adjusted net-loss differently than we do. As a result, it may be difficult to use Adjusted EBITDA or adjusted net-loss to compare the performance of those companies to our performance. Adjusted EBITDA or adjusted net-loss should not be considered as a measure of the income generated by our business or discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business.About urban-gro, Inc.urban-gro, Inc.® (Nasdaq:UGRO) is an integrated professional services and Design-Build firm.

""This past year, the Schwazze team delivered solid top-line growth in two highly competitive markets with 31% adjusted EBITDA margins and improved operating cash flow,"" said Forrest Hoffmaster, Interim CEO of Schwazze. ""We continued to sharpen our retail strategy while expanding our store footprint by more than 50% to 63 dispensaries across our two markets. Although the Colorado and New Mexico markets were pressured in 2023, we have built a solid foundation with best-in-class service for our patients and customers. Internally, we are also relentlessly focused on maximizing the operating efficiencies of our manufacturing and cultivation facilities to drive higher yields, improved flower quality, and greater output."" ""With strong demand and over 680 recreational retail stores at year-end, the competitive landscape in Colorado is fierce, underscoring the importance of our investments in and attention to elevating the customer experience. We significantly outpaced the market in Q4 on a sequential and year-over-year basis and expect to bolster our growth through improvements in customer acquisition, retention, and loyalty, as well as in the overall retail experience. Additionally, we are beginning to see wholesale pricing stabilize, which we anticipate will continue based on plant counts and ongoing retail pricing pressure."" ""In New Mexico, the proliferation of new licenses has led to increased competition and aggressive pricing strategies from certain players. Cannabis sales in the state were up 18% across a store base that was over 50% higher year-over-year in Q4, leading to lower average revenue per store. While we are beginning to see a slow-down in net new store openings, we anticipate a challenging market ahead. We remain focused on cost optimization and asset utilization while implementing a balanced pricing and promotional strategy to drive traffic into our stores, where we believe we excel in delivering an elevated retail experience. We are committed to fulfilling our promise of being the retailer of choice in New Mexico."" ""Looking ahead, we are optimistic about the regulatory momentum in the industry at large. In the meantime, we will continue to elevate the customer experience, improve our loyalty program, increase our cost efficiencies, and enhance our retail assets. Our team has a demonstrated track record of executing in competitive markets like Colorado and New Mexico where we remain one of the largest operators. We look forward to driving growth and profitability across each of our markets in 2024.""

The increase was primarily due to growth from new stores compared to the prior year period and increased wholesale revenue, partially offset by pricing pressure from the proliferation of new licenses in New Mexico. Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $7.0 million or 16.2% of total revenue, compared to $21.7 million or 54.1% of total revenue for the same quarter last year. The decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by one-time, non-cash inventory adjustments of approximately $13.1 million comprised of $3.1 million of product consolidation, obsolescence, and shrinkage expenses, $4.3 million of net realizable value adjustments, and $5.8 million of fair value adjustments on acquired inventory in New Mexico in 2023. Adjusted gross profit, which excludes non-cash inventory adjustments, for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $20.2 million or 46.6% of revenue. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $23.3 million compared to $24.2 million for the same quarter last year. The decrease was primarily due to a lower impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2023. This was partially offset by an increase in four-wall SG&A expenses associated with the 22 additional stores in Colorado and New Mexico that are still ramping, as well as greater salaries and stock-based compensation. Loss from operations for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $16.2 million compared to $2.5 million in the same quarter last year. The decrease was driven by the aforementioned lower gross profit, primarily related to the non-cash inventory adjustment. Net loss was $33.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $27.3 million for the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $11.0 million or 25.3% of revenue, compared to $13.3 million or 33.1% of revenue for the same quarter last year. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily driven by higher operating expenses associated with the 22 additional stores that are still ramping. As of December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents were $19.2 million compared to $38.9 million on December 31, 2022. Total debt as of December 31, 2023, was $156.8 million compared to $127.8 million on December 31, 2022.

The company secured 13 new carrier awards, expanding into larger markets and entering Europe. Despite a decrease in Q4 revenue to $13.4 million, Sonim remains debt-free with $9.4 million in cash. Positive 34% increase in net revenues to $93.6 million for 2023 Positive adjusted EBITDA of $4.0 million in 2023 Secured 13 new carrier awards, expanding into larger markets and entering Europe Debt-free status with $9.4 million in cash and equivalents Negative Decrease in Q4 revenue to $13.4 million Net loss of $1.4 million in Q4 2023 Market Research Analyst The expansion of Sonim Technologies' product portfolio and the acquisition of new carrier awards represent a strategic move to significantly increase the company's addressable market. The transition from a $400 million to a $52 billion market scope is indicative of the company's ambition to scale operations and diversify its product offerings. This shift is not only about entering new segments but also about geographic expansion, particularly into Europe, which can be a game-changer for the company's growth trajectory.With the introduction of rugged smartphones, connected devices and consumer durables, Sonim is tapping into the evolving needs of mobile users who require durable and reliable devices. This strategy is likely to resonate with specific customer segments, such as industrial workers and outdoor enthusiasts, who prioritize device resilience. Furthermore, the company's ability to secure 13 new carrier awards is a testament to the market's reception of their product innovation and could potentially lead to a stronger foothold in these markets, especially with the exit of a major competitor in Europe.However, it is important to monitor how these expansions will be executed, considering the substantial increase in the addressable market and the associated risks of overextending. The balance sheet indicates a relatively healthy financial position to support these growth initiatives, but the company will need to manage its operational expenses judiciously to maintain profitability. Financial Analyst Analyzing Sonim Technologies' financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023, reveals a substantial improvement in performance. A 34% increase in net revenues and a reduction in GAAP net loss from $14.1 million in 2022 to $90 thousand in 2023 are strong indicators of the company's operational efficiency and cost management. Additionally, achieving a positive adjusted EBITDA of $4.0 million, compared to the previous year's negative $9.9 million, reflects a significant turnaround in the company's financial health.The improved gross profit margin, from 16.6% to 20.6%, suggests a more profitable product mix, likely due to the refreshed XP10 ultra-rugged smartphone's success. The reduction in R&D expenses points towards a more strategic approach to product development, which could be a factor in the company's improved financial outcomes. However, investors should be cautious about the fourth-quarter revenue dip, which may signal volatility in sales or market demand fluctuations.While the company's expansion into new markets and product lines appears promising, it is important to evaluate the sustainability of these growth rates and the potential impact of new investments on future profitability. The company's debt-free status and cash reserves provide some buffer for investment in growth, but the management's execution of the expansion strategy will be critical to maintaining financial stability. Legal Expert The legal landscape of expanding into new markets, especially across different regions like Europe and Australia, involves navigating complex regulatory environments. Sonim's strategic decision to enter these markets could be influenced by the legal vacuum created by the exit of a major rugged supplier in Europe. This presents an opportunity for Sonim to establish a strong presence, but it also requires careful consideration of the legal implications, such as compliance with local consumer protection laws, data privacy regulations and intellectual property rights.Moreover, the company's positive financial results and the strategic plans for geographic and product expansion may attract investor interest and scrutiny.

This is only the beginning of what we plan to achieve. We look forward to further growth and scale in 2024, driven by a growing number of new product awards from tier-one carriers, expansion into large adjacent addressable markets, and our entry into Europe and Australia, all fueled by new sales activities.[*] Sources: QY Research, Industry Today; Insight Partners; GSA; Ericsson; Internal Estimates based on Market Pricing; Statista & Bank My Cell; North America + Europe Android Smartphone estimate valuation (Not including Samsung or Apple).[†] Non-GAAP financial measure. An explanation and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures are presented at the end of this press release.""The interest from carriers in our new products has been exceptional, with 13 product awards already announced for this year and a strong pipeline of additional opportunities in North America, Europe, and Australia. We believe that the launches for the new portfolio in the year ahead positions Sonim to become the preferred brand for reliable, durable devices in these larger markets. ""Furthermore, with the exit of the previous largest rugged supplier, Europe presents a significant opportunity for Sonim. We are actively working to qualify our newest products to fill this gap, targeting a major market opportunity for Sonim in rugged mobility and connected solutions.""Full Year 2023 Financial ResultsRevenue for the full year 2023 was $93.6 million, increased 34% from $69.8 million in 2022. Revenue reflected increased sales of the Company's refreshed ultra-rugged product line at carrier partners in North America and augmented by sales of the Company's ODM tablet products. Sonim also continues to win business in large adjacent markets concurrent with its strategy to bring additional solutions to market and expand its geographic reach to a global scale. To date, Sonim has now secured 13 carrier awards, including international awards, for its expanded range of mobile communication and data devices. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $19.3 million, or 20.6% of revenues, compared with 2022 gross profit of $11.6 million, or 16.6% of revenues. Gross profit margins reflected a more favorable product mix due to increased sales of the refreshed XP10 rugged smartphone. Operating expenses for 2023 were $18.8 million, declining from $25.9 million in 2022. This year-over-year decrease in operating expenses is mainly due to reduced R&D spending as the Company moved to more efficient, product development strategies, offset by increases in sales and marketing to support the launch of the Company's new connected solutions and international strategies.Net loss in 2023 was $90 thousand, compared with a net loss of $14.1 million in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA† was $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to negative $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.""Sonim delivered three consecutive quarters of positive GAAP net income in 2023, resulting in an improvement to the net loss to $90 thousand, and a solid full year adjusted EBITDA report of $4.0 million. We are well positioned for carrier launches with our new connected devices and rugged mobile lines scheduled throughout 2024. We are now driving sales across multiple large addressable markets in 2024, as compared with just one market in 2023. As part of this expanded strategy, we have also significantly expanded geographic reach, opening new and much larger opportunities for growth in Europe,"" said Clay Crolius, Chief Financial Officer of Sonim.Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial ResultsRevenue for the fourth quarter 2023 was $13.4 million, decreased from $27.6 million in the third quarter of 2023. Revenue reflected continued sales growth of the Company's differentiated rugged devices offset by the expected decline in sales from the Company's previous tablet customer, which hit end of life. The Company has secured new awards for white label smartphones, with shipments ramping up in the first quarter 2024. Additionally, the Company expects continued revenue growth in 2024 based on its carrier product awards scheduled to commence shipments throughout the year. Gross profit for the fourth quarter was $5.1 million, or 38.1% of revenues. Operating expenses were $6.4 million, reflecting the addition of sales resources in Europe as part of the Company's global growth strategy. Net loss in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1.4 million, compared with a net loss of $1.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company's first quarterly net loss following three successive quarters of GAAP net income in 2023.Balance Sheet and Working CapitalSonim ended 2023 with $9.4 million in cash and equivalents and remained essentially debt free. Accounts receivable was $25.3 million and inventory was $6.5 million. Sonim continues to self-fund its working capital and product development needs out of existing cash.

Adjusted EBITDA is a useful financial metric in assessing our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business, such as certain material non-cash items and other adjustments, such as stock-based compensation.We believe that Adjusted EBITDA, viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, our reported GAAP results, provides useful information to investors regarding our performance and overall results of operations for various reasons, including: non-cash equity grants made to employees at a certain price do not necessarily reflect the performance of our business at such time, and as such, stock-based compensation expense is not a key measure of our operating performance; and non-cash depreciation and amortization are not considered a key measure of our operating performance. We use Adjusted EBITDA: as a measure of operating performance; for planning purposes, including the preparation of budgets and forecasts; to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business; to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies; in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance; and as a consideration in determining compensation for certain key employees.Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations include: it does not reflect all cash expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; it does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; it does not reflect interest expense on our debt or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments; and other companies in our industry may define and/or calculate this metric differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.Set forth below is a reconciliation from net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the respective periods (in thousands):Year Ended December 31,2023 2022Net loss$(90) $(14,087)Depreciation and amortization2,206 2,375Stock-based compensation1,496 1,551Interest expense15 97Income taxes374 184Adjusted EBITDA$4,001 $(9,880) To view the source version of this press release, please visit https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/203281 What was Sonim Technologies' net revenue for 2023?

Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.45, down 16.7% from last year. The company aims to optimize cost structure amidst sluggish demand patterns. Positive Consolidated gross margin improved by 450 basis points compared to the prior year. Cost synergies of $153 million related to the Knoll integration were achieved. Net sales decreased by 11.4% to $872.3 million in Q3 FY 2024. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.45, a 16.7% decrease from the previous year. The company is focused on streamlining operations and enhancing efficiencies to drive growth. Despite challenging market conditions, the company remains optimistic about future growth. Restructuring measures have been implemented to align with current market conditions. Consolidated operating margin for Q3 was 4.9%, up from 2.2% in the same quarter last year. Cash flow from operations in Q3 was $60.6 million, with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.65x. The company expects net sales in Q4 FY 2024 to range between $880 million and $920 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for Q4 are projected to be between $0.49 and $0.57. Negative Net sales decreased by 11.4% in Q3 FY 2024, indicating a decline in revenue. Adjusted diluted earnings per share dropped by 16.7% compared to the same period last year. The company faces challenges from sluggish demand patterns and macro-economic conditions. Global Retail segment saw a decline in net sales by 17.0% in Q3 FY 2024. Despite cost synergies, the company needs to address the impact of volume declines on profitability. Financial Analyst The reported financial results of MillerKnoll Inc. show a mixed picture. While the consolidated gross margin has improved significantly, indicating potentially better cost management and pricing strategies, the decline in net sales by 11.4% for the third quarter and 12.5% for the nine months ended March 2, 2024, raises concerns about the company's top-line growth. The market will likely react to the earnings per share (EPS) increase of 73.2% over the nine-month period, which could be a sign of operational efficiency or cost-cutting measures taking effect. However, the adjusted EPS decrease of 16.7% for the quarter suggests that one-time benefits or adjustments may have influenced the reported EPS. Investors should consider the company's liquidity position and debt-to-EBITDA ratio when assessing its financial health. The ratio of 2.65x is within a reasonable range, indicating a manageable level of debt, but the scheduled debt maturities in the upcoming years could be a point of focus for long-term sustainability. Market Research Analyst MillerKnoll's performance reflects broader economic trends, particularly the impact of elevated interest rates and a lagging housing market in the U.S. on consumer and business spending. The company's efforts to capture cost synergies from the Knoll integration, which are expected to reach $160 million annually by July 2024, demonstrate a strategic move to streamline operations. However, the restructuring measures, including workforce reductions and showroom consolidations, indicate a response to the current challenging market conditions. The market will likely monitor the company's ability to navigate through these headwinds and the effectiveness of their strategies in driving future growth, especially given the inconsistent demand patterns noted in the International Contract and Specialty segment. Operational Efficiency Expert The report highlights MillerKnoll's focus on operational efficiency and cost management, evident in the gross margin expansion and run-rate cost synergies achieved. The company's proactive measures, such as price optimization and improved freight and distribution management, have contributed to this improvement. In the long term, these efforts could lead to a stronger competitive position and better financial resilience. However, it's important to note that the restructuring measures taken, including workforce reduction, could have implications for employee morale and corporate culture. The balance between cost-cutting and maintaining a productive workforce is delicate and critical for sustainable growth. 03/27/2024 - 04:05 PM ZEELAND, Mich., March 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- MillerKnoll Inc.

To our shareholders: Our teams continue to make great progress towards improving our profitability metrics with this quarter's Gross margins surpassing last year's levels across the three business segments despite volume declines. While the latter is driven by the current macro environment, we are building a fundamentally stronger company, protecting our profitability and enhancing our operational efficiency. Overall demand patterns across much of our business have continued to be sluggish, driven by elevated interest rates in major markets around the world, ongoing geopolitical concerns, and a lagging housing market in the U.S. Nonetheless, our optimism remains buoyed by a range of internal and external indicators which suggest that with more stable economic conditions, growth will resume in a meaningful way. In the near-term, we remain focused on adjusting and optimizing our cost structure while protecting investments that will better position us to thrive as market conditions improve. To this end, subsequent to the end of this quarter, we implemented restructuring measures aimed at streamlining our selling, general, and administrative structure to better align with current market conditions and potential opportunities. These measures included a workforce reduction and showroom consolidations, among other initiatives. Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Consolidated Results Consolidated net sales for the third quarter were $872.3 million, reflecting a decrease of 11.4% on a reported basis and a decrease of 10.1% organically compared to the same period last year. Orders in the quarter of $830.3 million were 6.2% lower on a reported basis and 4.7% lower organically compared to the prior year. Gross margin in the quarter was 38.6%, which is 450 basis points higher than the same period last year. The main drivers of the year-over-year increase in Gross margin were the realization of price optimization strategies; improved freight, distribution and inventory management; an impairment charge recorded in the prior year; and benefits from our ongoing synergy efforts. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of consolidated year-over-year adjusted Gross margin expansion. Consolidated operating expenses for the quarter were $294.2 million, compared to $314.4 million in the prior year. Consolidated adjusted operating expenses were $278.9 million, compared to $277.6 million in the prior year. Operating margin for the quarter was 4.9% compared to 2.2% in the same quarter last year. On an adjusted basis, consolidated operating margin for the quarter was 6.7%. In the third quarter of last year, adjusted operating margin totaled 7.5%. Reported diluted earnings per share were $0.30 for the quarter, compared to $0.01 for the same period last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share this quarter totaled $0.45, compared to $0.54 for the same period last year. As of March 2, 2024, our liquidity position reflected cash on hand and availability on our revolving credit facility totaling $558 million. During the third quarter, the business generated $60.6 million of cash flow from operations. We repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares for a total cash outlay of $40.0 million. We ended the third quarter with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as defined by our lending agreement, of 2.65x. Our scheduled debt maturities (which exclude the maturity of the revolver) for the remainder of fiscal year 2024, and for fiscal years 2025, 2026 and 2027 are $11.0 million, $41.3 million, $46.2 million and $276.3 million respectively. As of the end of the third quarter, we have achieved $153 million in run-rate cost synergies resulting from the acquisition of Knoll, Inc. in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. We continue to make meaningful progress on our integration plans expecting total run-rate cost synergies of $160 million per year by July 2024, which is the third-year anniversary of the Knoll, Inc. acquisition. Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Results by Segment Americas ContractFor the third quarter, the Americas Contract segment posted net sales totaling $441.1 million, down 9.0% year-over-year on a reported basis and down 9.2% organically. New orders in the quarter totaled $420.1 million, down 9.0% year-over-year on a reported basis and down 9.4% organically. With minimal improvement in the economic landscape, demand continued to be softer than expected. Although we remain confident that such an improvement is on the horizon, the persistence of inflationary pressures and high interest rates continues to weigh on both business and consumer sentiment. Still, key forward-looking indicators, including customer inquiries, project mock-up requests, and the overall volume of project opportunities give us confidence that demand will improve as we move through the calendar year. Adjusted operating margin for the Americas Contract segment was 8.1%, 70 basis points lower year-over-year. The main driver of this variance was lower year-over-year sales, which were partially offset by Gross margin expansion resulting from favorable price/cost dynamics, moderating input costs and the realization of synergy benefits. International Contract and SpecialtyThe International Contract and Specialty segment delivered net sales in the third quarter of $217.3 million, down 10.4% on a reported basis and down 10.6% organically on a year-over-year basis. New orders totaled $227.6 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 8.3% and 7.9% on a reported and organic basis, respectively. Month to month demand patterns remain inconsistent but grew in both December and February driven by mainland Europe along with South Korea, India, China, Australia and the Middle East. The transition from Herman Miller to full-line MillerKnoll dealers continues to gain traction. Currently over 40% of the international network is offering the MillerKnoll product portfolio with a steady cadence of more transitions planned in the coming months. Adjusted operating margin for this segment was 10.4%, 110 basis points lower year-over-year driven by lower sales. In spite of this, we continue to expand Gross margins due to favorable regional and product mix, improved freight and distribution management and proactive restructuring initiatives taken earlier in the year that have enhanced year-over-year manufacturing efficiency. Global RetailNet sales in the third quarter for our Global Retail segment totaled $213.9 million, a decline of 17.0% over the same quarter last year on a reported basis and down 11.3% organically mainly driven by soft housing-related demand. New orders in the quarter totaled $182.6 million, down 14.6% compared to the same period last year on a reported basis and down 7.1% organically. Despite facing challenges from macro-economic conditions, we are steadfast in enriching our in-store experiences, growing the product assortment and boosting brand awareness. This strategic approach aims to cultivate brand loyalty and stimulate greater engagement, mitigating the impact of external economic factors on organic demand. Adjusted operating margin for this segment was 5.6%, 10 basis points higher year-over-year, despite the decrease in net sales. The main drivers of the margin expansion were improved operational and delivery efficiencies, and favorable product mix. Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2024 Outlook Given the demand patterns we experienced in the third quarter and what remains a generally tepid near-term macro-economic backdrop, we expect net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 to range between $880 million and $920 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the period are expected to be between $0.49 and $0.57. The mid-point of this earnings range implies year-over-year growth of approximately 29% from the adjusted diluted earnings per share we reported in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year. Based on this forecast, we expect full year adjusted diluted earnings per share of between $1.90 and $1.98.

These non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to the related GAAP measurement. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our presentation of non-GAAP measures should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or infrequent items. We compensate for these limitations by providing equal prominence of our GAAP results. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are provided in the financial tables included within this presentation. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures are useful for investors as they provide financial information on a more comparative basis for the periods presented. The non-GAAP financial measures referenced within this presentation include: Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, Adjusted Operating Earnings (Loss), Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Earnings per Share, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted Operating Expenses, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Bank Covenant EBITDA, and Organic Growth (Decline). Adjusted Effective Tax Rate refers to the projected full-year GAAP tax rate, adjusted to exclude certain unusual or infrequent events that are expected to significantly impact that rate as well as impacts related to enactments of comprehensive tax law changes. Adjusted Operating Earnings (Loss) represents reported operating earnings plus integration charges, amortization of Knoll purchased intangibles, and restructuring expenses. These adjustments are described further below. Adjusted Operating Margin is calculated as adjusted operating earnings (loss) divided by net sales. Adjusted Earnings per Share represents reported diluted earnings per share excluding the impact from amortization of Knoll purchased intangibles, integration charges, restructuring expenses, impairment charges, and the related tax effect of these adjustments. These adjustments are described further below. Adjusted Gross Margin represents gross margin plus impairment charges. These adjustments are described further below. Adjusted Operating Expenses represents reported operating expenses excluding restructuring charges, integration charges, amortization of Knoll purchased intangibles, and impairment charges. These adjustments are described further below. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding income tax expense, interest income and expense, depreciation and amortization expense, restructuring and integration charges from net income. Adjusted Bank Covenant EBITDA is calculated by excluding depreciation, amortization, interest expense, taxes from net income, and certain other adjustments. Other adjustments include, as applicable in the period, charges associated with business restructuring actions, integration charges, impairment expenses, non-cash stock-based compensation, future synergies, and other items as described in our lending agreements. Organic Growth (Decline) represents the change in sales and orders, excluding currency translation effects, the impact of the additional week in fiscal 2023, and the impact of the closure of the Fully business. The adjustments to arrive at these non-GAAP financial measures are as follows: Amortization of Knoll purchased intangibles: Includes expenses associated with the amortization of acquisition related intangibles acquired as part of the Knoll acquisition. The revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure. We exclude the impact of the amortization of Knoll purchased intangibles as such non-cash amounts were significantly impacted by the size of the Knoll acquisition. Furthermore, we believe that this adjustment enables better comparison of our results as Amortization of Knoll Purchased Intangibles will not recur in future periods once such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets. Although we exclude the Amortization of Knoll Purchased Intangibles in these non-GAAP measures, we believe that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation. Integration charges: Knoll integration-related costs include severance, accelerated stock-based compensation expenses, asset impairment charges, and expenses related to synergy realization efforts and reorganization initiatives. Restructuring charges: Includes costs associated with actions involving targeted workforce reductions. Impairment charges: Includes non-cash, pre-tax charges for the impairment of assets associated with the decision to cease operating Fully as a stand-alone brand. Tax related items: We excluded the income tax benefit/provision effect of the tax related items from our non-GAAP measures because they are not associated with the tax expense on our ongoing operating results. Certain tables below summarize select financial information, for the periods indicated, related to each of the Company's reportable segments. The Americas Contract (""Americas"") segment includes the operations associated with the design, manufacture and sale of furniture products directly or indirectly through an independent dealership network for office, healthcare, and educational environments throughout North and South America. The International Contract and Specialty (""International & Specialty"") segment includes the operations associated with the design, manufacture and sale of furniture products, indirectly or directly through an independent dealership network in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia-Pacific as well as the global operations of the Specialty brands, which include Holly Hunt, Spinneybeck, Maharam, Edelman, and Knoll Textiles. The Global Retail (""Retail"") segment includes global operations associated with the sale of modern design furnishings and accessories to third party retailers, as well as direct to consumer sales through eCommerce, direct-mail catalogs, and physical retail stores. Corporate costs represent unallocated expenses related to general corporate functions, including, but not limited to, certain legal, executive, corporate finance, information technology, administrative and integration-related costs.

Financial Analyst The disclosure of financial results for RH's fourth quarter and fiscal year is a significant event that warrants close scrutiny. Investors and analysts alike will dissect the company's performance to gauge its financial health and strategic direction. A key focus will be on revenue growth, profit margins and earnings per share (EPS). It's also important to consider the company's cash flow statements to understand its operational efficiency and liquidity position.Moreover, the guidance provided for future quarters can influence investor sentiment and stock price movements. Any significant deviation from industry benchmarks or analyst expectations could lead to volatility in RH's stock. It's important to compare these results with those of competitors to understand RH's market position and potential for growth. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, RH's financial results help in assessing consumer trends and spending within the luxury home furnishing sector. The company's performance may reflect broader economic conditions, such as consumer confidence and discretionary spending levels. Additionally, analyzing the geographical revenue distribution can provide insights into market penetration and international expansion efforts.Understanding the company's online and in-store sales metrics is also essential, as it highlights the effectiveness of RH's omnichannel strategy. This analysis can inform stakeholders about the company's adaptability to changing retail landscapes and consumer preferences. Economist Examining RH's financial outcomes also offers a broader economic perspective. The results can serve as an economic indicator for the high-end retail market and consumer spending power. In periods of economic downturn, luxury retailers often experience a disproportionate impact. Conversely, strong results from RH could suggest economic resilience among affluent consumers.Furthermore, the company's performance must be contextualized within the current interest rate environment. Higher rates can affect consumer borrowing and spending, which in turn influences big-ticket purchases like furniture. This analysis can help stakeholders anticipate potential shifts in consumer behavior and adjust their strategies accordingly. 03/27/2024 - 04:05 PM CORTE MADERA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- RH (NYSE: RH) has released its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 3, 2024, in a shareholder letter from Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Gary Friedman, available on the Investor Relations section of its website at ir.rh.com.

Current international treatment guidelines recommend the use of ARIKAYCE for appropriate patients. ARIKAYCE is a novel, inhaled, once-daily formulation of amikacin, an established antibiotic that was historically administered intravenously and associated with severe toxicity to hearing, balance, and kidney function. Insmed's proprietary PULMOVANCE® liposomal technology enables the delivery of amikacin directly to the lungs, where liposomal amikacin is taken up by lung macrophages where the infection resides, while limiting systemic exposure. ARIKAYCE is administered once daily using the Lamira® Nebulizer System manufactured by PARI Pharma GmbH (PARI). About PARI Pharma and the Lamira® Nebulizer SystemARIKAYCE is delivered by a novel inhalation device, the Lamira® Nebulizer System, developed by PARI. Lamira® is a quiet, portable nebulizer that enables efficient aerosolization of ARIKAYCE via a vibrating, perforated membrane. Based on PARI's 100-year history working with aerosols, PARI is dedicated to advancing inhalation therapies by developing innovative delivery platforms to improve patient care. About BrensocatibBrensocatib is a small molecule, oral, reversible inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase 1 (DPP1) being developed by Insmed for the treatment of patients with bronchiectasis, CRSsNP, and other neutrophil-mediated diseases. DPP1 is an enzyme responsible for activating neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs), such as neutrophil elastase, in neutrophils when they are formed in the bone marrow. Neutrophils are the most common type of white blood cell and play an essential role in pathogen destruction and inflammatory mediation. In chronic inflammatory lung diseases, neutrophils accumulate in the airways and result in excessive active NSPs that cause lung destruction and inflammation. Brensocatib may decrease the damaging effects of inflammatory diseases such as bronchiectasis by inhibiting DPP1 and its activation of NSPs. Brensocatib is an investigational drug product that has not been approved for any indication in any jurisdiction. About TPIPTreprostinil palmitil inhalation powder (TPIP) is a dry powder formulation of treprostinil palmitil, a treprostinil prodrug consisting of treprostinil linked by an ester bond to a 16-carbon chain. Developed entirely in Insmed's laboratories, TPIP is a potentially highly differentiated prostanoid being evaluated for the treatment of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), PH-ILD, and other rare and serious pulmonary disorders. TPIP is administered in a capsule-based inhalation device. TPIP is an investigational drug product that has not been approved for any indication in any jurisdiction. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION AND BOXED WARNING FOR ARIKAYCE IN THE U.S. WARNING: RISK OF INCREASED RESPIRATORY ADVERSE REACTIONS ARIKAYCE has been associated with an increased risk of respiratory adverse reactions, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hemoptysis, bronchospasm, and exacerbation of underlying pulmonary disease that have led to hospitalizations in some cases. Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (reported as allergic alveolitis, pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, allergic reaction to ARIKAYCE) was reported at a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen (3.1%) compared to patients treated with a background regimen alone (0%). Most patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis discontinued treatment with ARIKAYCE and received treatment with corticosteroids. If hypersensitivity pneumonitis occurs, discontinue ARIKAYCE and manage patients as medically appropriate. Hemoptysis has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Hemoptysis was reported at a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen (17.9%) compared to patients treated with a background regimen alone (12.5%). If hemoptysis occurs, manage patients as medically appropriate. Bronchospasm has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Bronchospasm (reported as asthma, bronchial hyperreactivity, bronchospasm, dyspnea, dyspnea exertional, prolonged expiration, throat tightness, wheezing) was reported at a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen (28.7%) compared to patients treated with a background regimen alone (10.7%). If bronchospasm occurs during the use of ARIKAYCE, treat patients as medically appropriate. Exacerbations of underlying pulmonary disease has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Exacerbations of underlying pulmonary disease (reported as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), infective exacerbation of COPD, infective exacerbation of bronchiectasis) have been reported at a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen (14.8%) compared to patients treated with background regimen alone (9.8%). If exacerbations of underlying pulmonary disease occur during the use of ARIKAYCE, treat patients as medically appropriate. Anaphylaxis and Hypersensitivity Reactions: Serious and potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients taking ARIKAYCE. Signs and symptoms include acute onset of skin and mucosal tissue hypersensitivity reactions (hives, itching, flushing, swollen lips/tongue/uvula), respiratory difficulty (shortness of breath, wheezing, stridor, cough), gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, crampy abdominal pain), and cardiovascular signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis (tachycardia, low blood pressure, syncope, incontinence, dizziness). Before therapy with ARIKAYCE is instituted, evaluate for previous hypersensitivity reactions to aminoglycosides. If anaphylaxis or a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue ARIKAYCE and institute appropriate supportive measures. Ototoxicity has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Ototoxicity (including deafness, dizziness, presyncope, tinnitus, and vertigo) were reported with a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen (17%) compared to patients treated with background regimen alone (9.8%). This was primarily driven by tinnitus (7.6% in ARIKAYCE plus background regimen vs 0.9% in the background regimen alone arm) and dizziness (6.3% in ARIKAYCE plus background regimen vs 2.7% in the background regimen alone arm). Closely monitor patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction during treatment with ARIKAYCE. If ototoxicity occurs, manage patients as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing ARIKAYCE. Nephrotoxicity was observed during the clinical trials of ARIKAYCE in patients with MAC lung disease but not at a higher frequency than background regimen alone. Nephrotoxicity has been associated with the aminoglycosides. Close monitoring of patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction may be needed when prescribing ARIKAYCE. Neuromuscular Blockade: Patients with neuromuscular disorders were not enrolled in ARIKAYCE clinical trials. Patients with known or suspected neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis, should be closely monitored since aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness by blocking the release of acetylcholine at neuromuscular junctions. Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycosides, including ARIKAYCE, may be associated with total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in pediatric patients exposed in utero. Patients who use ARIKAYCE during pregnancy, or become pregnant while taking ARIKAYCE should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Contraindications: ARIKAYCE is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any aminoglycoside. Most Common Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions in Trial 1 at an incidence ≥5% for patients using ARIKAYCE plus background regimen compared to patients treated with background regimen alone were dysphonia (47% vs 1%), cough (39% vs 17%), bronchospasm (29% vs 11%), hemoptysis (18% vs 13%), ototoxicity (17% vs 10%), upper airway irritation (17% vs 2%), musculoskeletal pain (17% vs 8%), fatigue and asthenia (16% vs 10%), exacerbation of underlying pulmonary disease (15% vs 10%), diarrhea (13% vs 5%), nausea (12% vs 4%), pneumonia (10% vs 8%), headache (10% vs 5%), pyrexia (7% vs 5%), vomiting (7% vs 4%), rash (6% vs 2%), decreased weight (6% vs 1%), change in sputum (5% vs 1%), and chest discomfort (5% vs 3%). Drug Interactions: Avoid concomitant use of ARIKAYCE with medications associated with neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and ototoxicity. Some diuretics can enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering aminoglycoside concentrations in serum and tissue. Avoid concomitant use of ARIKAYCE with ethacrynic acid, furosemide, urea, or intravenous mannitol. Overdosage: Adverse reactions specifically associated with overdose of ARIKAYCE have not been identified. Acute toxicity should be treated with immediate withdrawal of ARIKAYCE, and baseline tests of renal function should be undertaken. Hemodialysis may be helpful in removing amikacin from the body. In all cases of suspected overdosage, physicians should contact the Regional Poison Control Center for information about effective treatment. U.S. INDICATION LIMITED POPULATION: ARIKAYCE® is indicated in adults, who have limited or no alternative treatment options, for the treatment of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lung disease as part of a combination antibacterial drug regimen in patients who do not achieve negative sputum cultures after a minimum of 6 consecutive months of a multidrug background regimen therapy. As only limited clinical safety and effectiveness data for ARIKAYCE are currently available, reserve ARIKAYCE for use in adults who have limited or no alternative treatment options. This drug is indicated for use in a limited and specific population of patients. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on achieving sputum culture conversion (defined as 3 consecutive negative monthly sputum cultures) by Month 6. Clinical benefit has not yet been established. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. Limitation of Use: ARIKAYCE has only been studied in patients with refractory MAC lung disease defined as patients who did not achieve negative sputum cultures after a minimum of 6 consecutive months of a multidrug background regimen therapy. The use of ARIKAYCE is not recommended for patients with non-refractory MAC lung disease. Patients are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.

Financial Analyst Observing the reported financial results of Sprinklr, the significant year-over-year growth in both total and subscription revenue indicates a robust expansion in the company's core business. The shift towards subscription models is a strategic move that aligns with the recurring revenue trend seen across the tech industry, providing a more predictable and stable revenue stream. The increase in the number of $1 million customers is a testament to the company's growing market penetration and ability to scale with larger clients.The authorization of an additional $100 million to the stock buyback program reflects management's confidence in the company's valuation and future prospects. This could be a signal to investors that the company believes its stock is undervalued. However, investors should be cautious and consider the opportunity cost of such buybacks, as these funds could alternatively be invested in R&D or market expansion. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Sprinklr's positioning as a Unified-CXM platform taps into the growing demand for AI-powered customer experience solutions. The company's focus on unifying customer-facing teams may cater to the needs of enterprises looking to streamline their operations and enhance customer engagement. The reported increase in RPO (Remaining Performance Obligations) and cRPO (current RPO) suggests a healthy sales pipeline and customer commitment, which can be seen as a positive indicator for future revenue growth.However, it's important to monitor the competitive landscape, as the customer experience management space is crowded with both established players and emerging innovators. Sprinklr's ability to maintain and grow its market share will be critical, especially as businesses continue to scrutinize their tech spend in light of broader economic conditions. Economist Examining the broader economic implications, Sprinklr's financial performance must be contextualized within the current macroeconomic environment. The reported increase in net income and improvement in operating margins suggests operational efficiency and cost management, which are particularly commendable during periods of economic uncertainty. The tech sector has been under pressure to demonstrate profitability rather than just growth and Sprinklr appears to be responding to this shift in investor sentiment.Furthermore, the company's financial outlook for the upcoming fiscal year suggests a cautious optimism, with projected growth in subscription revenue and non-GAAP operating income. However, investors should remain vigilant of external economic factors such as inflation, interest rate changes and geopolitical tensions that could impact business spending and, consequently, Sprinklr's performance. 03/27/2024 - 04:05 PM Q4 Total Revenue of $194.2 million, up 17% year-over-year Q4 Subscription Revenue of $177.0 million, up 19% year-over-year Q4 net cash provided by operating activities of $17.3 million and free cash flow* of $12.3 million in Q4 RPO and cRPO up 34% and 21% year-over-year, respectively 126 $1 million customers, up 17% year-over-year In March 2024, Board authorized an incremental $100 million to the existing stock buyback program NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Sprinklr (NYSE: CXM), the unified customer experience management (Unified-CXM) platform for modern enterprises, today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 31, 2024. “We are pleased with Sprinklr’s fourth quarter performance and overall success in FY 24.

Financial Outlook Sprinklr is providing the following guidance for the first fiscal quarter ending April 30, 2024: Subscription revenue between $177.5 million and $178.5 million. Total revenue between $194 million and $195 million. Non-GAAP operating income between $19.5 million and $20.5 million. Non-GAAP net income per share of approximately $0.07, assuming 289 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Sprinklr is providing the following guidance for the full fiscal year ending January 31, 2025: Subscription revenue between $740.5 million and $741.5 million. Total revenue between $804.5 million and $805.5 million. Non-GAAP operating income between $104 million and $105 million. Non-GAAP net income per share between $0.38 and $0.39, assuming 291 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release and the accompanying tables contain the following non-GAAP financial measures: Non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin Non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share We define these non-GAAP financial measures as the respective U.S. GAAP measures, excluding, as applicable, stock-based compensation expense-related charges and amortization of acquired intangible assets. We believe that it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation expense-related charges and amortization of acquired intangible assets in order to better understand the long-term performance of our core business and to facilitate comparison of our results to those of peer companies over multiple periods. In periods of net loss, we calculate non-GAAP net income (loss) per share by using non-GAAP net income (loss) divided by basic weighted average shares for the period regardless of whether we are in a non-GAAP net income or (loss) position and assuming that all potentially dilutive securities are anti-dilutive. In addition, the press release and the accompanying tables contain free cash flow, which is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used for purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software. We believe that free cash flow is a useful indicator of liquidity as it measures our ability to generate cash, or our need to access additional sources of cash, to fund operations and investments. We expect our free cash flow to fluctuate in future periods with changes in our operating expenses and as we continue to invest in our growth. We typically experience higher billings in the fourth quarter compared to other quarters and experience higher collections of accounts receivable in the first half of the year, which results in a decrease in accounts receivable in the first half of the year. However, non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in their usefulness to investors because they have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. As a result, our non-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Sprinklr has not reconciled its financial outlook expectations as to non-GAAP operating income, or as to non-GAAP net income per share, to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures as a result of the high variability, complexity and low visibility with respect to the charges excluded from these non-GAAP measures; in particular, the measures and effects of stock-based compensation expense specific to equity compensation awards that are directly impacted by unpredictable fluctuations in our stock price. We expect the variability of the above charges to have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on our future U.S. GAAP financial results. Accordingly, reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort, although it is important to note that these factors could be material to Sprinklr’s results computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Conference Call Information Sprinklr will host a conference call today, March 27, 2024, to discuss fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2024 financial results, as well as the first quarter and full year fiscal 2025 outlook, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time.

Fuller Company (FUL) reported strong financial results for Q1 2024, with net revenue of $810 million, a 0.2% increase year-on-year. Adjusted EPS grew by 22% to $0.67. The company achieved a 12% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $123 million, with an expanded margin of 15.2%. Cash flow from operations increased by $42 million year-on-year to $47 million. Despite a decline in organic revenue due to pricing changes, the company remains optimistic about achieving its fiscal 2024 guidance. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent financial results reported by H.B. Fuller Company indicate a mixed performance with some positive trends in profitability and cash flow, alongside a modest decline in organic revenue. The reported increase in adjusted EBITDA by 12% and the expansion of the adjusted EBITDA margin by 160 basis points are noteworthy, as they suggest improved operational efficiency and cost management. This is further evidenced by the 22% year-on-year growth in adjusted EPS, which reflects not only the company's ability to manage costs but also its pricing strategy and raw material cost actions.Investors should note the decline in organic revenue, which may raise concerns about the company's volume growth and market demand. However, the impact of this decline seems to be mitigated by the company's strategic pricing adjustments and restructuring benefits. The reduction in net working capital as a percentage of annualized net revenue also indicates a more efficient use of resources, which could lead to improved liquidity and financial flexibility in the future.Looking ahead, the company's reiteration of its financial guidance for fiscal 2024 suggests confidence in its ability to maintain growth and profitability. The projected net revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA figures should be of interest to stakeholders, as they provide a benchmark for evaluating the company's performance in the coming year. Market Research Analyst The modest increase in net revenue and the slight decrease in organic revenue reported by H.B. Fuller may reflect broader market trends and competitive dynamics within the adhesives and sealants industry. The influence of foreign currency translation and the impact of acquisitions on net revenue highlight the importance of global market forces and strategic growth initiatives in the company's financial performance.Investors might appreciate the company's focus on driving synergy realization and restructuring savings as a means to bolster profitability amidst a dynamic market environment. The improvement in gross profit margin, driven by favorable net pricing and raw material cost impact, suggests that the company has been successful in navigating cost pressures that are common in the manufacturing sector.The emphasis on organic investments and strategic acquisitions indicates a dual approach to growth, balancing internal development with external expansion. Stakeholders should consider how these strategies align with industry trends and the company's long-term growth and profitability goals. Debt Analyst The flat net debt and the slight reduction in the net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio from 2.9X to 2.8X are positive signals for the company's leverage and solvency. A lower debt-to-EBITDA ratio generally indicates a company's increasing ability to repay its debt, which could be reassuring for creditors and investors concerned about financial risk.However, it is important to monitor the company's net working capital decrease, which, while beneficial for short-term liquidity, could indicate potential challenges in managing inventory and receivables over the long term. The company's outlook suggests a focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet, which will be critical for supporting ongoing operations and future growth initiatives.Overall, the company's financial position appears stable, with a manageable level of debt and a commitment to improving cash flow. The projected operating cash flow for fiscal 2024 will be a key metric to watch, as it will provide further insight into the company's liquidity and financial health. 03/27/2024 - 04:05 PM Reported EPS (diluted) of $0.55; Adjusted EPS (diluted) of $0.67, up 22% year-on-year Net income of $31 million; Adjusted EBITDA of $123 million up 12% and Adjusted EBITDA margin up 160 basis points year-on-year Cash flow from operations increased $42 million year-on-year ST. PAUL, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- H.B. Fuller Company (NYSE: FUL) today reported financial results for its first quarter that ended March 2, 2024. First Quarter 2024 Noteworthy Items: Net revenue was $810 million, up slightly year-on-year; organic revenue decreased modestly year-on-year due primarily to anticipated pricing changes; Gross profit margin was 29.5%; adjusted gross profit margin was 30.1%, up 320 basis points year-on-year, driven principally by favorable net pricing and raw material cost impact and restructuring benefits; Net income was $31 million; adjusted EBITDA was $123 million, up 12% year-on-year; adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 160 basis points year-on-year to 15.2%; Reported EPS (diluted) was $0.55; adjusted EPS (diluted) was $0.67, up 22% versus the prior year, driven by strong operating income growth; Net working capital, as a percentage of annualized net revenue, decreased 270 basis points year-on-year from 19.8% to 17.1%; Cash flow from operations increased $42 million year-on-year to $47 million, driven by reductions in net working capital requirements and improved profitability. Summary of First Quarter 2024 Results: The Company’s net revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was $810 million, up 0.2% versus the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Organic revenue declined 4.2% year-on-year, with pricing adjustments reducing organic revenue by 3.3% and volume reducing organic revenue by 0.9%.

Adjusted gross profit was $244 million. Adjusted gross profit margin of 30.1% increased 320 basis points year-on-year.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense was $172 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and adjusted SG&A was $165 million versus $149 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The impact of acquisitions as well as inflation in wages and services and higher variable compensation expense, partially offset by restructuring savings, drove the year-on-year increase in adjusted SG&A.

Fuller for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was $38 million. Adjusted EPS was $0.67 per diluted share, up 22% year-on-year driven by strong operating income growth. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was $123 million, up 12% year-on-year driven principally by favorable net pricing and raw material cost developments, ramping restructuring savings, and benefits from the 2023 collection of acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 160 basis points year-on-year to 15.2%. “We are off to a good start to the year, with first quarter financial results largely consistent with our expectations. Our team is maintaining commercial discipline, proactively innovating to create win-win opportunities for our customers and pricing to that value, while also driving synergy realization and restructuring savings. As a result, we continue to drive strong adjusted EBITDA growth, margin expansion, and robust cash flow in a highly dynamic market environment,” said Celeste Mastin, H.B. Fuller president and chief executive officer. “Looking ahead, we remain on track for another year of strong profit growth, continued margin expansion, and improved volume trends in fiscal 2024. As we continue to strengthen the portfolio through targeted organic investments and complete new highly synergistic strategic acquisitions, we are confident in our ability to achieve our long-term growth and profitability goals.” Balance Sheet and Working Capital: Net debt at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was $1,665.5 million, essentially flat sequentially versus the fourth quarter and down $82 million year-on-year. Flat net debt and growth in adjusted EBITDA, reduced the ratio of net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA from 2.9X to 2.8X sequentially from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Net working capital in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 declined $25 million sequentially versus the fourth quarter and $87 million year-on-year. As a percentage of annualized net revenue, net working capital decreased 270 basis points year-on-year, to 17.1%. Fiscal 2024 Outlook: As a result of our good start to the year, which was largely consistent with our expectations, we are reiterating our previously communicated financial guidance for fiscal 2024: Net revenue growth is expected to be in the range of up 2% to 6% with organic revenue flat to up 3% year-on-year; Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $610 million to $640 million, equating to growth of approximately 5% to 10% year-on-year; Adjusted EPS (diluted) is expected to be in the range of $4.15 to $4.45, equating to year-on-year growth of between 7% and 15%; Operating cash flow is expected to be between $300 million and $350 million.

Financial Analyst The reported 33% year-over-year revenue growth for Braze indicates a robust expansion, outpacing many peers in the customer engagement sector. This growth trajectory, primarily fueled by new customer acquisitions and upsells, is a positive indicator for investors, reflecting the company's ability to scale and capture market share. However, the reported GAAP operating loss, despite narrowing from the previous fiscal year, raises concerns about the company's path to profitability. The significant stock-based compensation expense contributing to the loss is a common practice in tech companies to attract talent, but it does impact the bottom line and shareholder value.Furthermore, the dollar-based net retention rate decrease from 124% to 117% year-over-year suggests that while existing customers are spending more, the rate of increase has slowed. This metric is important for understanding customer satisfaction and future revenue stability. The increase in customers with an ARR of $500,000 or more is encouraging, indicating a growing base of high-value clients. Market Research Analyst Braze's introduction of new artificial intelligence features and partnerships with notable companies like DoorDash and Wendy’s showcase its commitment to product innovation and market penetration. These developments are likely to enhance customer stickiness and attract new clients in a competitive landscape. The company's recognition in various G2 categories also serves as a testament to its product efficacy and brand strength, which can be leveraged for future sales and marketing initiatives.However, the decrease in free cash flow compared to the previous year may indicate increased capital expenditures or operational costs, which investors should monitor closely. The guidance for the fiscal year 2025 suggests further revenue growth, yet the projected non-GAAP operating loss indicates ongoing investments in growth may continue to outweigh current earnings. This strategy can be double-edged; while it may lead to long-term market positioning, it also poses risks if growth expectations are not met or if market conditions change. Economist The financial performance of Braze must be contextualized within the broader economic landscape. A 33% revenue increase in the current economic climate reflects strong demand for customer engagement solutions, a segment that is becoming increasingly critical as businesses seek to personalize and enhance customer experiences. The tech sector, however, is facing headwinds from various macroeconomic factors, including potential interest rate hikes and inflationary pressures, which could affect discretionary spending on software solutions.Additionally, the company's forecast for the upcoming fiscal year suggests optimism about its growth prospects. However, the reliance on non-GAAP measures to project a more favorable financial outlook, excluding certain expenses, could obscure the true financial health of the company. Investors should consider both GAAP and non-GAAP measures to gain a comprehensive understanding of the company's performance and potential risks. 03/27/2024 - 04:05 PM Fourth quarter revenue grew 33% year-over-year to $131.0 million Achieved dollar-based net retention of 117% for the trailing 12 months Introduced first quarter and full year fiscal 2025 guidance NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Braze (Nasdaq: BRZE) the leading customer engagement platform that empowers brands to Be Absolutely Engaging™, today announced results for its fiscal year ended January 31, 2024.

Financial Outlook Braze is initiating guidance for the fiscal first quarter ending April 30, 2024 and fiscal year ending January 31, 2025. Metric (in millions, except per share amounts) FY 2025 Q1 Guidance FY 2025 Guidance Revenue $131.0 - 132.0 $570.0 - 575.0 Non-GAAP operating loss $(13.0) - (14.0) $(20.0) - (24.0) Non-GAAP net loss $(10.0) - (11.0) $(8.0) - (12.0) Non-GAAP net loss per share $(0.10) - (0.11) $(0.08) - (0.12) Weighted average shares outstanding ~99.5 ~101.0 Braze has not reconciled its guidance as to non-GAAP operating loss, non-GAAP net loss or non-GAAP net loss per share to their most directly comparable GAAP measure as a result of uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation expense specific to equity compensation awards that are directly impacted by unpredictable fluctuations in Braze’s stock price. Accordingly, reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort, although it is important to note that these factors could be material to Braze’s results calculated in accordance with GAAP. Conference Call Information: What: Braze Fiscal Year and Fourth Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call When: Wednesday, March 27th at 4:30 pm EDT / 1:30 pm PDT Webcast & Supplemental Data: investors.braze.com Replay: A webcast replay will be available on Braze’s investor site at investors.braze.com. Supplemental and Other Financial Information Supplemental information, including an accompanying financial presentation and other information can be accessed through Braze’s investor website at investors.braze.com. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release and the accompanying tables contain the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit and margin, non-GAAP sales and marketing expense, non-GAAP research and development expense, non-GAAP general and administrative expense, non-GAAP operating loss, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per share, basic and diluted, and non-GAAP free cash flow. Braze defines non-GAAP gross profit and margin, non-GAAP sales and marketing expense, non-GAAP research and development expense, non-GAAP general and administrative expense, non-GAAP operating loss, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP net loss as the respective GAAP balances, adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, employer taxes related to stock-based compensation, charitable contribution expense, contingent consideration adjustments, acquisition related expense, amortization of intangible assets, and restructuring expense. Prior to the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, Braze did not adjust non-GAAP gross profit and margin, non-GAAP sales and marketing expense, non-GAAP research and development expense, non-GAAP general and administrative expense, non-GAAP operating loss, non-GAAP operating margin, or non-GAAP net loss for acquisition related expense, because there was not acquisition activity by Braze in prior periods. Additionally, prior to the second quarter of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, Braze did not adjust non-GAAP gross profit and margin, non-GAAP sales and marketing expense, non-GAAP research and development expense, non-GAAP general and administrative expense, non-GAAP operating loss, non-GAAP operating margin or non-GAAP net loss for amortization of intangible assets, because there were no such amortizations in prior periods, or for restructuring expense, because such amounts were not material in prior periods. Further, prior to the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, Braze did not adjust non-GAAP gross profit and margin, non-GAAP sales and marketing expense, non-GAAP research and development expense, non-GAAP general and administrative expense, non-GAAP operating loss, non-GAAP operating margin or non-GAAP net loss for contingent consideration adjustments, because there were no such adjustments in prior periods. Braze defines non-GAAP free cash flow as net cash used in operating activities, minus purchases of property and equipment and minus capitalized internal-use software costs. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these historical non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Braze uses this non-GAAP financial information internally in analyzing its financial results and believes that this non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively with GAAP financial measures, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement their GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses that are required by GAAP to be recorded in Braze’s financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by Braze’s management about which expenses are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation is provided below in the financial statement tables included below in this press release for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Braze encourages investors to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which it includes in press releases announcing quarterly and fiscal year financial results, including this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Braze’s business. Definition of Other Business Metrics Customer: Braze defines a customer, as of period end, as the separate and distinct, ultimate parent-level entity that has an active subscription with Braze to use its products. A single organization could have multiple distinct contracting divisions or subsidiaries, all of which together would be considered a single customer. Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR): Braze defines ARR as the annualized value of customer subscription contracts, including certain premium professional services that are subject to contractual subscription terms, as of the measurement date, assuming any contract that expires during the next 12 months is renewed on its existing terms (including contracts for which Braze is negotiating a renewal). Braze’s calculation of ARR is not adjusted for the impact of any known or projected future events (such as customer cancellations, expansion or contraction of existing customers relationships or price increases or decreases) that may cause any such contract not to be renewed on its existing terms. ARR may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customers’ satisfaction or dissatisfaction with Braze’s products and professional services, pricing, competitive offerings, economic conditions or overall changes in Braze’s customers’ spending levels. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and does not represent Braze’s GAAP revenue on an annualized basis or a forecast of revenue, as it is an operating metric that can be impacted by contract start and end dates and renewal rates. Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate: Braze calculates dollar-based net retention rate as of a period end by starting with the ARR from a cohort of customers as of 12 months prior to such period-end (the Prior Period ARR). Braze then calculates the ARR from the same cohort of customers as of the end of the current period (the Current Period ARR). Current Period ARR includes any expansion and is net of contraction or attrition over the last 12 months, but excludes ARR from new customers in the current period. Braze then divides the total Current Period ARR by the total Prior Period ARR to arrive at the point-in-time dollar-based net retention rate. Braze then calculates the weighted average point-in-time dollar-based net retention rates as of the last day of each month in the current trailing 12-month period to arrive at the dollar-based net retention rate. Remaining Performance Obligations: The transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents amounts under non-cancelable contracts expected to be recognized as revenue in future periods, and may be influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, the timing of service delivery and contract terms. Unbilled portions of the remaining performance obligation are subject to future economic risks including bankruptcies, regulatory changes and other market factors.

Negative None. 03/27/2024 - 04:05 PM Key Takeaways: Grid Dynamics extends its Analytics Platform with an LLM-powered starter kit for data migration, designed to accelerate the transition from legacy data solutions to cloud-based platforms. The new starter kit enables Grid Dynamics to streamline and expedite large-scale data replatforming and modernization initiatives, achieving significant time and cost savings over conventional data migration methods. The new solution supports legacy data platform migration from Teradata, Netezza, and Talend, among others, to AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure—expanding the company’s solutions portfolio for enterprise-scale clients undergoing business transformation. SAN RAMON, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Grid Dynamics Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: GDYN) (Grid Dynamics), a leader in enterprise-level digital transformation services and solutions, today unveils a GenAI-powered Data Migration Starter Kit, a new component that enhances the capabilities of Grid Dynamics’ Analytics Platform and enables its clients to achieve faster, more cost-effective data modernization outcomes. In many enterprises, large-scale data modernization programs span several years and consume vast amounts of resources. The timelines and costs are typically driven up by a large number of data processing jobs and applications, convoluted and poorly documented business logic, performance issues and bottlenecks, and complex coordination across multiple organizations and vendors. Traditional data migration methodologies and tools help to facilitate the process and reduce migration costs, but still require significant amounts of engineering effort and manual operations. These challenges are particularly prominent for data modernization programs that require deep redesign of the processing pipelines, business logic, and data schemas. The GenAI-powered Data Migration Starter Kit automatically transforms business logic, target data schemas, and pipeline orchestration logic based on the requirements specified by the user. In particular, the starter kit automatically performs advanced redesigns of the data schemas such as normalization and denormalization. These capabilities greatly accelerate the delivery of large-scale data modernization and replatforming projects compared to traditional methods. The GenAI-powered Data Migration Starter Kit supports a broad range of migration and replatforming scenarios, including on-premises-to-cloud and cloud-to-cloud. The starter kit provides adapters for major cloud providers, Teradata, and Talend out of the box, and is designed to efficiently develop custom adapters. “The GenAI Data Migration Starter Kit enables our clients to drastically reduce costs and timelines for data modernization programs by automating operations that were not possible to automate without LLMs,” said Ilya Katsov, Vice President of Technology at Grid Dynamics. “This kit transforms our Analytics Platform into an end-to-end solution for delivering large-scale data modernization programs—from establishing platform services to onboarding applied pipelines and business logic to integrating with downstream data consumers.” The GenAI Data Migration Starter Kit is the latest, innovative, problem-solving solution from Grid Dynamics and supports the company’s GigaCube growth strategy.

(FC) reports $61.3 million in revenue for Q2 2024, with strong subscription sales and a record $227.3 million in the rolling four quarters. Operating cash flows increase to $30.2 million. Adjusted EBITDA expected at $54.5 million. The company's liquidity stands at over $103 million. Positive Consolidated revenue for Q2 2024 is $61.3 million, slightly lower than the prior year. Subscription and subscription services sales total $50.3 million for Q2 2024 and reach a record $227.3 million in the rolling four quarters. Cash flows from operating activities increase to $30.2 million in fiscal 2024. Free Cash Flow rises to $24.7 million through February 29, 2024. Liquidity remains strong at over $103 million with $40.9 million in cash. Company expects Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $54.5 million in constant currency. AAP subscription sales grow by 9% in Q2 2024 compared to the prior year. Education Division revenues increase by 3% to $14.6 million in Q2 2024. Net income for Q2 2024 is $0.9 million, with Adjusted EBITDA at $7.4 million. Consolidated deferred subscription revenue increases by 13% to $86.1 million at February 29, 2024. Cash flows from operating activities increase significantly to $30.2 million in the first half of fiscal 2024. Free Cash Flow rises to $24.7 million in the first half of fiscal 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results of Franklin Covey Co. indicate a relatively stable revenue stream with a slight decrease from $61.8 million to $61.3 million year-over-year for the second quarter. The modest growth in subscription and subscription services sales, which are up 5% to $50.3 million, is a positive signal for recurring revenue stability. The 9% increase in deferred subscription revenue to $158.8 million suggests a healthy pipeline for future revenue recognition. However, the company's net income drop from $1.7 million to $0.9 million raises concerns about profitability and cost management.Investors should note the strong liquidity position, with over $103 million in liquidity and no drawdowns on the credit facility. This robust liquidity position offers financial flexibility and may serve as a buffer against market volatility or investment in growth opportunities. The substantial increase in cash flows from operating activities and free cash flow is indicative of improved operational efficiency and effective working capital management. The company's expectation of achieving an Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $54.5 million aligns with its guidance, providing a level of predictability in its financial performance. Market Research Analyst The performance of Franklin Covey Co. in the educational and enterprise sectors reflects broader trends in the professional training and development industry. The increase in Education Division revenues and the delivery of additional training days indicate a growing demand for education and professional development services. The strong retention levels of AAP subscription revenue in North America, exceeding 90%, demonstrate a robust customer base and suggest a competitive edge in customer loyalty.However, the report highlights a slower-than-expected rebound of subscription services sales, which may signal a need for strategic adjustments in the company's service offerings or sales tactics. The increase in multi-year contracts for the company's AAP, now comprising 56% of contracts, is an encouraging trend for future revenue stability and may reflect a strategic shift toward long-term customer engagement. Economist Franklin Covey Co.'s financial results must be contextualized within the current macroeconomic environment. The slight decrease in consolidated sales year-over-year could be attributed to various factors, including market saturation, shifts in corporate spending due to economic uncertainty, or increased competition. The company's strong cash flow performance and increased liquidity are particularly noteworthy against the backdrop of potential tightening monetary policy and economic headwinds, which could challenge companies with weaker cash positions.The growth in deferred revenue and multi-year contracts suggests a strategic emphasis on long-term stability, which may be a prudent approach in the face of economic fluctuations. However, the reported slower-than-expected sales growth in subscription services could reflect broader economic trends that may impact discretionary spending on corporate training and development programs. 03/27/2024 - 04:05 PM Second Quarter Consolidated Revenue Totals $61.3 Million Compared with $61.8 Million in the Prior Year Second Quarter Subscription and Subscription Services Sales Total $50.3 Million and a Record $227.3 Million for the Rolling Four Quarters Ended February 29, 2024 Cash Flows From Operating Activities Increase to $30.2 Million Compared with $11.2 Million in Fiscal 2023 and Free Cash Flow Through February 29, 2024 Increases to $24.7 Million From $3.3 Million in the First Two Quarters of Fiscal 2023 Liquidity Remains Strong at over $103 Million, with $40.9 Million of Cash and No Drawdowns on the Company’s $62.5 Million Credit Facility Company Expects to Achieve Adjusted EBITDA of Approximately $54.5 Million in Constant Currency, within its Previously Announced Guidance Range SALT LAKE CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Franklin Covey Co. (NYSE: FC), a leader in organizational performance improvement that creates, and on a subscription basis, distributes world-class content, training, processes, and tools that organizations and individuals use to achieve systemic changes in human behavior to transform their results, today announced financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024, which ended on February 29, 2024. Introduction The Company’s consolidated sales for the quarter ended February 29, 2024 totaled $61.3 million compared with $61.8 million in the quarter ended February 28, 2023. Revenue for the rolling four quarters ended February 29, 2024 grew to $279.1 million compared with $276.1 million for the rolling four quarters ended February 28, 2023. The Company’s sales and related performance for the second quarter included the following: Enterprise Division revenues totaled $45.7 million compared with $46.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Increased All Access Pass (AAP) revenues in the quarter were offset primarily by decreased legacy training program sales, decreased subscription services, and reduced international licensee revenues. AAP subscription sales grew 9% compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and AAP subscription and subscription services sales grew 6% compared with the prior year. For the rolling four quarters ended February 29, 2024, AAP subscription and subscription services sales increased 5% to $162.1 million compared with $154.4 million for the rolling four quarters ended February 28, 2023. During the first two quarters of fiscal 2024, AAP subscription revenue retention levels in the United States and Canada remained strong and were greater than 90%. Education Division revenues grew 3% to $14.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 primarily due to increased membership subscription revenues in the quarter and increased sales of classroom and training materials. Education membership subscription and subscription services revenue increased 4% compared with the prior year primarily due to increased annual membership sales recognized. Delivery of training and coaching days remained strong and during the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the Education Division delivered nearly 100 more training and coaching days than the prior year, which are recognized in sales as they are delivered. Net income for the second quarter was $0.9 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, compared with $1.7 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was slightly better than expected at $7.4 million compared with $8.2 million in fiscal 2023. Total Company subscription and subscription services sales reached $50.3 million, a 5% increase over the second quarter of fiscal 2023, a quarter which had very strong subscription and subscription services revenue growth. For the rolling four quarters ended February 29, 2024, subscription and subscription service sales reached a second quarter record level of $227.3 million, a $10.0 million, or 5%, increase over the rolling four quarters ended February 28, 2023. Consolidated deferred subscription revenue at February 29, 2024 increased 13% to $86.1 million compared with $76.1 million at February 28, 2023. The sum of billed and unbilled deferred subscription revenue at February 29, 2024 grew 9%, or $13.0 million, to $158.8 million, compared with $145.8 million at February 28, 2023. The Company continues to be pleased with the growth of its multi-year contracts and the overall increase in deferred subscription revenue, which provide a strong base for future sales growth. At February 29, 2024, 56% of the Company’s AAP contracts are for at least two years, compared with 50% at February 28, 2023, and the percentage of contracted amounts represented by multi-year contracts increased to 62% from 57% at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Cash flows from operating activities for the first half of fiscal 2024 increased to $30.2 million compared with $11.2 million in the first two quarters of fiscal 2023. Free Cash Flow increased to $24.7 million in the first half of fiscal 2024 from $3.3 million in the first two quarters of fiscal 2023. The increase was primarily due to favorable changes in working capital and featured strong collections of accounts receivable. Paul Walker, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We are pleased that our second quarter results met our expectations as we generated $61.3 million of revenue and $7.4 million of Adjusted EBITDA. However, the slower-than-expected rebound of subscription services sales will impact our anticipated sales growth in the third and fourth quarters. Additionally, concern about economic conditions slowed decision-making and created a more difficult selling environment during the first half of fiscal 2024. As a result, we now expect to be at $54.5 million of Adjusted EBITDA (in constant currency) for the year, the low end of our guidance range. Despite these factors, which have weighed on our second quarter results, we are encouraged by expectations that our third and fourth quarters will reach all-time highs in sales, Adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow in fiscal 2024.” Walker added, “Our business has remained extremely resilient and we are particularly pleased with this durability in the context of an uncertain economic environment which has negatively impacted many of our clients in both our domestic and international markets. The resiliency of our business model in the second quarter was reflected by strong client retention, strong revenue retention (over 90% in United States and Canada), and strong growth in our deferred subscription revenue as our billed and unbilled deferred subscription revenue grew $13.0 million over the second quarter of fiscal 2023 to a second-quarter record of $158.8 million. In addition, the amount of multi-year contracts continues to grow and 62% of our AAP contracted revenue is now for 2 years or more.” Walker concluded, “We also believe that there are still tremendous opportunities for growth as economies improve, we ramp up client partners, and increase our market penetration with both existing and new clients. We have been expanding key initiatives which we expect to further accelerate our growth by: (a) increasing the extent to which we can further penetrate existing client accounts; and (b) further increasing the number of new accounts we can reach. We expect the roll-out of these initiatives to our already significant marketing, sales, and servicing capabilities will further expand and accelerate our reach. The strength of our powerful business model—a model that features the combination of increasing revenue per client; high revenue and client retention; high gross margins; upfront invoicing; low capital intensity; and disciplined reinvestment for growth—is driving significant amounts of both Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow in fiscal 2024 and we expect these to increase significantly in future periods.” Second Quarter 2024 Financial Overview The following is a summary of the Company’s financial results for the quarter ended February 29, 2024: Net Sales: The Company’s consolidated sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 totaled $61.3 million compared with $61.8 million in the prior year. Direct Office sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 were $43.0 million compared with $43.6 million in the prior year. Increased AAP subscription sales in the second quarter through the Company’s Direct Office segment were offset by decreased legacy onsite programs and add-on services revenue compared with the prior year. International licensee revenues decreased 6% compared with fiscal 2023 primarily due to decreased royalty revenue. Foreign exchange rates had a $0.3 million unfavorable impact on the Company’s sales and a $0.2 million adverse impact on the Company’s operating results during the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Education Division revenues increased 3% to $14.6 million compared with $14.2 million in fiscal 2023. This growth was primarily due to increased membership subscription revenues and sales of classroom and related training materials. Education membership subscription and subscription services revenue increased 4% compared with the prior year primarily due to increased annual membership sales recognized. Delivered training days remained strong as the Education Division delivered nearly 100 more training and coaching days than the prior year, which are recognized as sales when they are delivered. Deferred Subscription Revenue and Unbilled Deferred Revenue: On February 29, 2024, the Company had $158.8 million of billed and unbilled deferred subscription revenue, a 9%, or $13.0 million, increase compared with February 28, 2023. This total includes $86.1 million of deferred subscription revenue on the balance sheet, a 13%, or $9.9 million, increase compared with deferred subscription revenue at February 28, 2023. Unbilled deferred subscription revenue represents business (typically multi-year contracts) that is contracted but unbilled and excluded from the Company’s balance sheet. Gross profit: Gross profit for the quarter ended February 29, 2024, was $46.9 million compared with $47.2 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2023. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 remained strong and was consistent with the prior year at 76.4% of sales. Cost of goods sold and gross profit each decreased primarily due to sales performance as previously described. Operating Expenses: The Company’s operating expenses for the quarter ended February 29, 2024, increased $1.0 million compared with the prior year, which was primarily due to $1.7 million of restructuring expenses and a $0.9 million impaired asset charge. These increases were partially offset by a $1.6 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense resulting from the second quarter reassessment of long-term incentive plan award shares expected to vest, and decreased depreciation and amortization expense. Restructuring Costs: During the quarter ended February 29, 2024, the Company commenced a plan to realign and restructure certain areas of its operations to sharpen the focus of its efforts on proven growth initiatives. As a result of this restructuring plan, the Company incurred severance charges totaling $1.7 million. Impaired Asset: In a prior period, the Company began investing in the development of a student leadership assessment. However, due to societal changes in perception regarding the collection of student information and potential legal challenges, the Company determined that it was in its best interest to suspend further development of the student leadership assessment and impair the associated asset, which resulted in a $0.9 million charge during the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Operating Income: As a result of the factors noted above, the Company’s income from operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was $1.4 million, compared with $2.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Pre-tax income did not differ materially from operating income for each of the second quarters of fiscal 2024 and 2023. Income Taxes: The Company’s income tax provision for the quarter ended February 29, 2024, was $0.5 million compared with $1.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The effective income tax rate for the second quarter was generally consistent with the prior year at 38.2% in fiscal 2024, compared with 37.5% in fiscal 2023. The effective tax rates for the second quarters of both fiscal 2024 and 2023 were higher than statutory rates primarily due to non-deductible executive compensation and additional income tax related to foreign earnings. Net Income: The Company’s net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was $0.9 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, compared with $1.7 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in fiscal 2023. Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended February 29, 2024 was $7.4 million compared with $8.2 million in the prior year, reflecting the items discussed above. Adjusted EBITDA for the rolling four quarters ended February 29, 2024 grew $2.9 million, or 7%, to $46.8 million compared with $43.9 for the corresponding period ended February 28, 2023. Purchases of Common Stock: During the first two quarters of fiscal 2024, the Company purchased 460,609 shares of its common stock for $18.4 million, including 251,686 shares withheld for income taxes on stock-based compensation awards and 208,923 shares purchased on the open market under the terms of a Board of Directors approved purchase plan. Liquidity and Financial Position: Even after the purchase of $18.4 million of common stock during the first two quarters of 2024, and $49.3 million over the rolling four quarters ended February 29, 2024, the Company’s liquidity and financial position remain strong. At February 29, 2024, the Company had over $103 million of available liquidity which consisted of $40.9 million of cash and an undrawn $62.5 million line of credit. Fiscal 2024 Year-to-Date Financial Results Consolidated revenue for the first two quarters of fiscal 2024 was $129.7 million compared with $131.1 million in the first two quarters of fiscal 2023. Enterprise Division sales for the first half of fiscal 2024 were $98.3 million, compared with $100.0 million in the first half of the prior year. AAP subscription and subscription services sales increased 5% to $79.1 million compared with $75.0 million in the prior year. For the two quarters ended February 29, 2024, sales through the Company’s foreign direct offices decreased $0.6 million primarily due to weak economies in certain of the countries where the Company operates. International licensee revenues were $6.1 million for the first two quarters of fiscal 2024 compared with $6.2 million in the prior year. Education Division sales grew 3%, or $0.8 million, to $29.3 million compared with $28.5 million in the first two quarters of fiscal 2023. Education Division sales grew primarily due to increased consulting, coaching, and training days delivered during the year, increased international education royalties, and increased recognition of previously deferred revenue related to Leader in Me subscriptions. Consolidated gross profit for the first two quarters of fiscal 2024 was $99.1 million compared with $100.0 million in the first two quarters of fiscal 2023 and reflected the sales performance noted above. Gross margin for the two quarters ended February 29, 2024 remained strong and increased to 76.4% of sales compared with 76.2% in the first half of fiscal 2023. Operating expenses for the two quarters ended February 29, 2024 increased $1.6 million compared with the first two quarters of the prior year primarily due to $2.3 million of restructuring expenses and a $0.9 million impaired asset charge. These expenses were partially offset by a $1.6 million reduction of stock-based compensation expense resulting from the second quarter 2024 reassessment of long-term incentive plan award shares expected to vest, and decreased depreciation and amortization expense. As a result of these factors, the Company’s income from operations through February 29, 2024 was $6.8 million compared with $9.2 million in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the first two quarters of fiscal 2024 was $18.4 million compared with $19.7 million in the first two quarters of fiscal 2023 and was the second-best start to a fiscal year in recent history. The Company’s net income for the two quarters ended February 29, 2024 was $5.7 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, compared with $6.4 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, for the two quarters ended February 28, 2023. Fiscal 2024 Guidance and Outlook Based on the strength of the Company’s business model that features high recurring revenue, high gross margins, and low capital intensity, combined with the continued strength and strategic durability of the All Access Pass and Leader in Me membership subscriptions, the Company looks forward to a strong second half of fiscal 2024. Despite the challenges from the first half of fiscal 2024, the Company expects that its Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2024 will be at the lower end of its previously announced guidance range of $54.5 million to $58.0 million in constant currency, which represents 13% growth over the $48.1 million of Adjusted EBITDA achieved in fiscal 2023. The Company expects to achieve this growth despite an uncertain economic environment and while continuing to make additional growth investments. The Company is also confident in the strength of its subscription offerings, which have driven Franklin Covey’s growth across recent years, and which are expected to deliver in fiscal 2024 the highest levels of revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow since the sale of the Company’s consumer products division.

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 including those statements related to the Company’s future results and profitability and other goals relating to the growth and operations of the Company. Forward-looking statements are based upon management’s current expectations and are subject to various risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to: general macroeconomic conditions; renewals of subscription contracts; growth in and client demand for add-on services; the impact of deferred revenues on future financial results; impacts from geopolitical conflicts; market acceptance of new products or services, including new AAP portal upgrades and content launches; inflation; the ability to achieve sustainable growth in future periods; and other factors identified and discussed in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Many of these conditions are beyond the Company’s control or influence, any one of which may cause future results to differ materially from the Company’s current expectations, and there can be no assurance that the Company’s actual future performance will meet management’s expectations. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances subsequent to this press release. Non-GAAP Financial Information This earnings release includes the concept of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, which are non-GAAP measures. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income excluding the impact of interest, income taxes, intangible asset amortization, depreciation, stock-based compensation expense, and certain other infrequently occurring items such as restructuring costs and impaired assets. Free Cash Flow is defined as cash flows from operating activities less capitalized expenditures for purchases of property and equipment and curriculum development. The Company references these non-GAAP financial measures in its decision-making because they provide supplemental information that facilitates consistent internal comparisons to the historical operating performance of prior periods and the Company believes they provide investors with greater transparency to evaluate operational activities and financial results. Refer to the attached tables for the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure, Adjusted EBITDA, to consolidated net income, a related GAAP financial measure, and for the calculation of Free Cash Flow. The Company is unable to provide a reconciliation of the above forward-looking estimate of non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP measures because certain information needed to make a reasonable forward-looking estimate is difficult to obtain and dependent on future events which may be uncertain, or out of the Company’s control, including the amount of AAP contracts invoiced, the number of AAP contracts that are renewed, necessary costs to deliver the Company’s offerings, such as unanticipated curriculum development costs, and other potential variables. Accordingly, a reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort. About Franklin Covey Co. Franklin Covey Co.

The company's AI-powered open platform drives bundled SaaS momentum, leading to a 28% increase in SaaS revenue. Verint raises its revenue and EPS outlook for FYE25, targeting a 5% year-over-year growth in revenue and a 6% growth in diluted EPS. Positive Revenue for the three months ended January 31, 2024, was $265 million, up 12% year-over-year. Revenue for the year ended January 31, 2024, was $910 million on a GAAP basis and $911 million on a non-GAAP basis. Diluted EPS for the three months ended January 31, 2024, was $0.37 on a GAAP basis and $1.07 on a non-GAAP basis. Verint's differentiated approach to CX Automation is driving AI business outcomes, leading to a 16% year-over-year increase in Bundled SaaS New ACV bookings in Q4. The company is targeting a greater than 40% increase in free cash flow for FYE 25, expecting approximately $180 million. Verint's non-GAAP outlook for FYE 25 includes revenue of $930 million +/- 2% and diluted EPS of $2.89 at the midpoint of the revenue guidance. Negative None. Financial Analyst Verint's recent financial results indicate a positive trajectory in terms of revenue and diluted EPS, outperforming their own guidance. With a 12% year-over-year growth and a significant increase in SaaS revenue, approximately 28%, the company is showing strong performance in the highly competitive Customer Engagement and CX Automation market. The focus on AI-powered solutions and the shift towards a recurring revenue model, with 89% of software revenue recurring, is a strategic move that aligns with current industry trends towards sustainable and predictable revenue streams.Furthermore, the company's commitment to becoming a 'Rule of 40' company, which is a threshold for balancing growth and profitability in the software industry, suggests a disciplined approach to financial management. The planned increase in free cash flow and the use of this capital for share buybacks could be seen as a confidence signal to investors, potentially leading to an increase in shareholder value. However, the divestiture of a managed service offering may indicate a narrowing of focus, which could have implications for the company's market positioning and revenue diversification. Market Research Analyst The emphasis on AI-driven Bundled SaaS offerings and the expansion of the company's R&D capabilities, with around 1,300 engineers, reflect Verint's commitment to innovation and customer success. This could resonate well with businesses seeking to enhance their customer engagement through AI and automation. The reported increase in the Bundled SaaS New ACV bookings and pipeline suggests a growing customer base and a strong product-market fit.However, it's important to monitor the competitive landscape, as the CX Automation space is rapidly evolving with numerous players. Verint's ability to maintain its momentum and differentiate its offerings will be critical. Investors should also consider the long-term implications of the company's strategic decisions, such as the divestiture of manual services and the increased focus on AI, which could lead to a more streamlined but potentially riskier business model. Technology Sector Analyst Verint's strategic investment in AI and the reported growth in their AI-powered open platform demonstrate the company's alignment with the technology sector's shift towards intelligent automation. The increase in gross margin and free cash flow indicates operational efficiency and a strong execution of their business strategy. The technology sector, particularly SaaS, values innovation and agility and Verint's performance in these areas could have a positive impact on their valuation and market share.It's also worth noting the potential risks associated with heavy reliance on AI, such as the need for continuous investment in innovation to stay ahead of the curve and potential challenges in AI adoption by customers. Verint's focus on customer success teams to drive AI adoption is a proactive measure, but the efficacy of these efforts will be important for sustained growth. 03/27/2024 - 04:05 PM Revenue and Diluted EPS Come in Ahead of Guidance Raising Revenue and EPS Outlook for FYE25 AI-Powered Open Platform Resonating Well in the Market Driving Bundled SaaS Momentum MELVILLE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Verint® (Nasdaq: VRNT), The Customer Engagement Company™, today announced results for the three months and year ended January 31, 2024 (FYE 2024). Revenue for the three months ended January 31, 2024 was $265 million, representing 12% year-over-year growth. Revenue for the year ended January 31, 2024 was $910 million on a GAAP basis and $911 million on a non-GAAP basis. For the three months ended January 31, 2024, diluted EPS was $0.37 on a GAAP basis and $1.07 on a non-GAAP basis. For the year ended January 31, 2024, diluted EPS was $0.28 on a GAAP basis and $2.73 on a non-GAAP basis. “The market today is looking to increase CX Automation, and Verint is leading the way with an AI-powered open platform. I am pleased to report strong Q4 results, ahead of our expectations. Our differentiated approach to CX Automation enables Verint to deliver tangible AI business outcomes better than any other vendor in our market. Our customers purchase our AI innovation in Bundled SaaS, and we are pleased with our 16% year-over-year increase in Bundled SaaS New ACV bookings in Q4, and our over 20% year-over-year increase in Bundled SaaS pipeline as of the end of Q4. For the current year we are raising our outlook to reflect our AI momentum,” said Dan Bodner, Verint CEO. Q4 FYE 2024 Highlights Revenue: Up 12% year-over-year SaaS Revenue: Up ~28% year-over-year Recurring Revenue: 89% of software revenue recurring (up ~200bps year-over-year) Gross Margin: Up ~300bps year-over-year Free Cash Flow: Up 20% year-over-year for the full year Grant Highlander, Verint CFO, added, “As we execute our roadmap to become a ‘Rule of 40’ company, we continue our AI investments in the platform, ending Q4 with ~1,300 engineers in R&D and Cloud Operations, and adding resources to our Customer Success team to drive AI adoption by our customers. In Q4, we also aligned our services catalog to our AI offerings by adding value realization services and divesting a manual managed services offering that is being replaced with AI-powered bots.” Highlander continued, “We expect our AI innovation to drive Bundled SaaS growth and free cash flow acceleration. For FYE 25, we are targeting a greater than 40% increase in free cash flow, to approximately $180 million. We expect our largest use of free cash flow to be share buybacks, to further reduce our share count.” FYE 2025 Outlook We are providing our non-GAAP outlook for the year ending January 31, 2025. Our outlook reflects the divestiture of a managed service offering on January 31, 2024 that generated $25 million in FYE 24 revenue. Revenue: $930 million +/- 2%, reflecting 5% year-over-year growth (growth rate adjusted for divestiture) Diluted EPS: $2.89 at the midpoint of our revenue guidance, reflecting 6% year-over-year growth Our non-GAAP outlook for three months ending April 30, 2024 and year ending January 31, 2025 excludes the following GAAP measure which we are able to quantify with reasonable certainty: Amortization of intangible assets of approximately $4 million and $17 million, for the three months ending April 30, 2024 and year ending January 31, 2025, respectively. Our non-GAAP outlook for the three months ending April 30, 2024 and year ending January 31, 2025 excludes the following GAAP measures for which we are able to provide a range of probable significance: Stock-based compensation expenses are expected to be between approximately $17 million and $19 million, and $70 million and $74 million, for the three months ending April 30, 2024 and year ending January 31, 2025, respectively, assuming market prices for our common stock approximately consistent with current levels. Our non-GAAP guidance does not include the potential impact of any in-process business acquisitions that may close after the date hereof, and, unless otherwise specified, reflects foreign currency exchange rates approximately consistent with current rates. We are unable, without unreasonable efforts, to provide a reconciliation for other GAAP measures which are excluded from our non-GAAP outlook, including the impact of future business acquisitions or acquisition expenses, future restructuring expenses, and non-GAAP income tax adjustments due to the level of unpredictability and uncertainty associated with these items. For these same reasons, we are unable to assess the probable significance of these excluded items. While historical results may not be indicative of future results, actual amounts for the three months and year ended January 31, 2024 and 2023 for the GAAP measures excluded from our non-GAAP outlook appear in Tables 2, 3, 4 and 5 of this press release.

The tables above include a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure for completed periods presented in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures, used in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business by: facilitating the comparison of our financial results and business trends between periods, by excluding certain items that either can vary significantly in amount and frequency, are based upon subjective assumptions, or in certain cases are unplanned for or difficult to forecast, facilitating the comparison of our financial results and business trends with other technology companies who publish similar non-GAAP measures, and allowing investors to see and understand key supplementary metrics used by our management to run our business, including for budgeting and forecasting, resource allocation, and compensation matters. We also make these non-GAAP financial measures available because a number of our investors have informed us that they find this supplemental information useful. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, as substitutes for, or superior to, comparable GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures we present have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP, and these non-GAAP financial measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures do not represent discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business, and we may in the future incur expenses similar to or in addition to the adjustments made in these non-GAAP financial measures. Other companies may calculate similar non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Our non-GAAP financial measures are calculated by making the following adjustments to our GAAP financial measures: Revenue adjustments. For acquisitions completed prior to February 1, 2023, we exclude from our non-GAAP revenue the impact of fair value adjustments required under previous GAAP guidance relating to SaaS services, optional managed services and customer support contracts acquired in a business acquisition, which would have otherwise been recognized on a stand-alone basis. Beginning February 1, 2023, we adopted accounting guidance which eliminates the fair value provision that resulted in the accounting adjustment on a prospective basis. We believe that it is useful for investors to understand the total amount of revenue that we and the acquired company would have recognized on a stand-alone basis under GAAP, absent the accounting adjustment associated with the business acquisition under prior accounting guidance. Our non-GAAP revenue also reflects certain adjustments from aligning an acquired company’s revenue recognition policies to our policies. We believe that our non-GAAP revenue measure helps management and investors understand our revenue trends and serves as a useful measure of ongoing business performance. Amortization of acquired technology and other acquired intangible assets. When we acquire an entity, we are required under GAAP to record the fair values of the intangible assets of the acquired entity and amortize those assets over their useful lives. We exclude the amortization of acquired intangible assets, including acquired technology, from our non-GAAP financial measures because they are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of acquisitions. We also exclude these amounts to provide easier comparability of pre- and post-acquisition operating results. Stock-based compensation expenses. We exclude stock-based compensation expenses related to restricted stock unit and performance stock unit awards, stock bonus programs, bonus share programs, and other stock-based awards from our non-GAAP financial measures. We evaluate our performance both with and without these measures because stock-based compensation is typically a non-cash expense and can vary significantly over time based on the timing, size and nature of awards granted, and is influenced in part by certain factors which are generally beyond our control, such as the volatility of the price of our common stock. In addition, measurement of stock-based compensation is subject to varying valuation methodologies and subjective assumptions, and therefore we believe that excluding stock-based compensation from our non-GAAP financial measures allows for meaningful comparisons of our current operating results to our historical operating results and to other companies in our industry. Losses on early retirements of debt. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures losses on early retirements of debt attributable to refinancing or repaying our debt because we believe they are not reflective of our ongoing operations. Acquisition and divestitures expenses (benefit), net. In connection with acquisition activity (including with respect to acquisitions that are not consummated), we incur expenses (benefits), including legal, accounting, and other professional fees, integration costs, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations, and other costs. Integration costs may consist of information technology expenses as systems are integrated across the combined entity, consulting expenses, marketing expenses, and professional fees, as well as non-cash charges to write-off or impair the value of redundant assets. In connection with divestiture activity, we exclude the gain or loss on divestiture as well as any expenses incurred, including legal, accounting, and other professional fees. We exclude these expenses from our non-GAAP financial measures because they are unpredictable, can vary based on the size and complexity of each transaction, and are unrelated to our continuing operations or to the continuing operations of the acquired businesses. Restructuring expenses (benefit). We exclude restructuring expenses (benefit) from our non-GAAP financial measures, which include employee termination costs, facility exit costs (except as included in accelerated lease costs and IT facilities and infrastructure realignment described below), certain professional fees, asset impairment charges (except as included in acquisition or IT facilities and infrastructure realignment), and other costs directly associated with resource realignments incurred in reaction to changing strategies or business conditions. All of these costs can vary significantly in amount and frequency based on the nature of the actions as well as the changing needs of our business and we believe that excluding them provides easier comparability of pre- and post-restructuring operating results. Separation expenses. On February 1, 2021, we completed the spin-off of our former Cyber Intelligence Solutions business. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures expenses incurred in connection with the spin-off, including third-party advisory, accounting, legal, tax, consulting, and other similar services related to the separation as well as costs associated with the operational separation of the two businesses, including those related to human resources, brand management, real estate, and information technology (which are included in Separation expenses to the extent not capitalized). Separation expenses also include incremental cash income taxes related to the reorganization of legal entities and operations in order to effect the separation and other expense adjustments associated with a tax-related indemnification asset as a result of the spin-off. These costs are incremental to our normal operating expenses and are being incurred solely as a result of the separation transaction. Accordingly, we are excluding these separation expenses from our non-GAAP financial measures in order to evaluate our performance on a comparable basis. Accelerated lease costs. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures accelerated facility costs and associated accelerated lease expenses, including losses on terminations, due to the early termination or abandonment of certain office leases as a result of our move to a hybrid work model because these charges are not reflective of our ongoing business and operating results. IT facilities and infrastructure realignment. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures nonrecurring IT facilities and infrastructure realignment costs and other IT charges associated with modifying the workplace, including consolidating and/or migrating data centers and labs to the cloud, simplifying the corporate network, and one-time costs for implementing collaboration tools to enable our work from anywhere strategy, as well as asset impairment charges, accelerated depreciation and IT facility exit costs. Impairment charges and other adjustments. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures asset impairment charges (other than those already included within restructuring, acquisition, or IT facilities and realignment activity), rent expense for redundant facilities, gains or losses on sales of property, gains or losses on settlements of certain legal matters, and certain professional fees unrelated to our ongoing operations, all of which are unusual in nature and can vary significantly in amount and frequency. Non-GAAP income tax adjustments. We exclude from our non-GAAP measures of net income attributable to Verint Systems Inc., our GAAP provision for (benefit from) income taxes and instead include a non-GAAP provision for income taxes, determined by applying a non-GAAP effective income tax rate to our income before provision for income taxes, as adjusted for the non-GAAP items described above. The non-GAAP effective income tax rate is generally based upon the income taxes we expect to pay in the reporting year. Our GAAP effective income tax rate can vary significantly from year to year as a result of tax law changes, settlements with tax authorities, changes in the geographic mix of earnings including acquisition activity, changes in the projected realizability of deferred tax assets, and other unusual or period-specific events, all of which can vary in size and frequency. We believe that our non-GAAP effective income tax rate removes much of this variability and facilitates meaningful comparisons of operating results across periods. Our non-GAAP effective income tax rate for the year ended January 31, 2024 is 8% and was 9% for the year ended January 31, 2023. We evaluate our non-GAAP effective income tax rate on an ongoing basis, and it can change from time to time. Our non-GAAP income tax rate can differ materially from our GAAP effective income tax rate. Revenue Metrics and Operating Metrics Recurring revenue, on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, is the portion of our revenue that we believe is likely to be renewed in the future, and primarily consists of SaaS revenue, optional managed services revenue and initial and renewal post contract support. Nonrecurring revenue, on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, primarily consists of our perpetual licenses, consulting, implementation and installation services, hardware, training and patent license royalties. SaaS revenue includes bundled SaaS, software with standard managed services and unbundled SaaS (including associated support) that we account for as term licenses where managed services are purchased separately. Optional Managed Services are recurring services that are intended to improve our customers' operations and reduce expenses. Percentage of software revenue that is recurring revenue is calculated as the sum of SaaS revenue, optional managed services revenue and support revenue as a percentage of total SaaS revenue, optional managed services revenue, support revenue, and perpetual revenue. New SaaS Annual Contract Value (ACV) includes the annualized contract value of all new SaaS contracts received within the period; new unbundled SaaS contracts only include the license portion of those orders. In cases where SaaS is offered to partners through usage-based contracts, we include the incremental value of usage contracts over a rolling four quarters. Orders are only included in New SaaS ACV with a completed customer contract signed by both parties before the end of the period. SaaS Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS ARR) represents the annualized quarterly run-rate value of active or signed SaaS contracts as of the end of a period. For unbundled SaaS contracts, the amount included in SaaS ARR is generally consistent with the amount that we invoice the customer annually for the term-based license transaction. We use SaaS ARR to identify the annual recurring value of customer contracts at the end of a reporting period and to monitor the growth of our recurring business as we shift to SaaS. SaaS ARR reduces fluctuations due to seasonality, contract term, and the sales mix of subscriptions for bundled SaaS and unbundled SaaS. SaaS ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, and does not represent our revenue under ASC 606 on an annualized basis, as it is an operating metric that is impacted by contract start and end dates and renewal rates. SaaS ARR is not intended to be a replacement for forecasts of SaaS revenue. Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, stock-based compensation expenses, revenue adjustments, restructuring expenses, acquisition expenses, separation expenses, accelerated lease costs, IT facilities and infrastructure realignment, and other expenses excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures as described above. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is also commonly used by investors to evaluate operating performance between companies because it helps reduce variability caused by differences in capital structures, income taxes, stock-based compensation expenses, accounting policies, and depreciation and amortization policies. Adjusted EBITDA is also used by credit rating agencies, lenders, and other parties to evaluate our creditworthiness. Net Debt Net Debt is a non-GAAP measure defined as the sum of long-term and short-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet, excluding unamortized discounts and issuance costs, less the sum of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents, restricted bank time deposits, and restricted investments (including long-term portions), and short-term investments. We use this non-GAAP financial measure to help evaluate our capital structure, financial leverage, and our ability to reduce debt and to fund investing and financing activities and believe that it provides useful information to investors. Free Cash Flow Free Cash Flow is defined as GAAP cash provided by operating activities less our capital expenditures, which include purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software development costs. Supplemental Information About Constant Currency Because we operate on a global basis and transact business in many currencies, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our consolidated U.S. dollar operating results. To facilitate the assessment of our performance excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, we calculate our GAAP and non-GAAP revenue, cost of revenue, and operating expenses on both an as-reported basis and a constant currency basis, allowing for comparison of results between periods as if foreign currency exchange rates had remained constant. We perform our constant currency calculations by translating current-period results into U.S. dollars using prior-period average foreign currency exchange rates or hedge rates, as applicable, rather than current period exchange rates. We believe that constant currency measures, which exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, facilitate the assessment of underlying business trends. Unless otherwise indicated, our financial outlook, which is provided on a non-GAAP basis, reflects foreign currency exchange rates approximately consistent with rates in effect when the outlook is provided. We also incur foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the revaluation and settlement of monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency. Our financial outlook for diluted earnings per share includes net foreign exchange gains or losses incurred to date, if any, but does not include potential future gains or losses.

Negative Aqua Metals generated no significant revenue in 2023 due to pilot-scale production. Expenses related to plant operations increased by 59% in 2023 to $6.3 million compared to $4.0 million in 2022. The net loss for 2023 was $23.9 million, or $(0.25) per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $15.4 million, or $(0.20) per basic and diluted share, for 2022. The net loss for 2023 included $4.9 million of non-cash items, impacting the adjusted net loss to $19.1 million or $(0.20) per basic and diluted share. As of December 31, 2023, Aqua Metals had $16.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. Total cash used in operations for 2023 was $3.2 million. Financial Analyst The disclosed financial results of Aqua Metals, Inc. highlight a significant increase in operational expenses, a common occurrence for companies in the growth phase, particularly those investing in innovative technologies like sustainable lithium-ion battery recycling. The 59% rise in plant operation costs and 19% increase in general and administrative expenses reflect strategic investments aimed at scaling up operations and pursuing commercial readiness. However, the net loss widening from $15.4 million to $23.9 million year-over-year signals to investors the heightened financial risk associated with the company's expansion efforts.While the equity raise and strategic partnership with Yulho Co., Ltd., injecting $25 million into the company, provide a cushion, the cash burn rate, as evidenced by the $3.2 million used in operations, remains a critical metric for assessing financial health. Investors should closely monitor the company's path to profitability, considering the potential revenue of $30 million annually from the Sierra ARC, against the backdrop of current and future capital requirements. Environmental Sustainability Expert Aqua Metals' reported 83% reduction in CO2 emissions through its Li AquaRefining™ process compared to standard hydrometallurgical processes represents a substantial environmental advancement. This reduction is a testament to the company's commitment to sustainability and positions it favorably in an industry under increasing scrutiny for environmental impacts. The significance of this achievement cannot be understated, as it aligns with global carbon reduction goals and increases the appeal of Aqua Metals to environmentally-conscious investors and partners.The strategic partnership with 6K Energy and the supply agreement to create a circular supply chain for critical minerals in the U.S. further solidify the company's dedication to sustainable practices. These initiatives not only enhance the company's brand as a leader in sustainability but also potentially open doors to government incentives and support, which can be important for long-term viability and success in the green economy. Market Research Analyst The lithium-ion battery recycling market is poised for growth, driven by the global surge in electric vehicle (EV) production and corresponding demand for battery materials. Aqua Metals' operational highlights, such as the establishment of the Li AquaRefining™ pilot plant and the strategic partnerships for a circular supply chain, position the company strategically within this burgeoning market. The anticipated commercial production capacity to generate critical battery minerals for approximately 30,000 average-sized EV battery packs annually taps into a significant market opportunity.However, with the industry still maturing, investors should consider the competitive landscape, including emerging technologies and market entrants, which could impact Aqua Metals' market share and pricing power. Additionally, the reliance on strategic partnerships and off-take agreements highlights the importance of robust business relationships for the company's success. The ability to secure more commercial agreements in 2024 will be a key determinant of the company's market traction and investor confidence. 03/27/2024 - 04:05 PM RENO, Nev., March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aqua Metals, Inc. (NASDAQ: AQMS), a pioneer in sustainable lithium-ion battery recycling, today reported financial results for the full-year ended December 31, 2023. Full-Year 2023 Financial and Recent Operational Highlights Operational Established a platform for commercial production by successfully commissioning the Li AquaRefining™ pilot plant and operating the plant for over one year including 24-hour/five-day per week operations at the Company’s Innovation Center, with the recovery of lithium hydroxide and carbonate, nickel, copper, cobalt, and manganese dioxide, and de-risking through pilot operations.Completed an engineering report that included a Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) of Li AquaRefining™ through ICF, an internationally recognized third party, showing an 83% reduction in CO2 emissions versus standard hydrometallurgy processes.Acquired a five-acre parcel in Tahoe-Reno and materially completed major upfit of the existing building to advance Phase 1 of the Sierra AquaRefining™ Campus (ARC) on time and within budget with commissioning beginning this summer and commercial production commencing this year with expected financing.

The company aims to address severe invasive fungal infections with potential new treatment paradigms. Successful Compassionate/Expanded Use Access Program and advancements in the LNC platform demonstrate promising results. Positive Clear regulatory approval pathway for oral MAT2203 in treating invasive aspergillosis Alignment with FDA on Phase 3 ORALTO trial design for MAT2203 Successful outcomes in Compassionate/Expanded Use Access Program for severe fungal infections Advancements in LNC platform for oncology and inflammation applications Financial results showing revenue of $1.1 million for 2023 and net loss of $22.9 million Cash position sufficient to fund operations through third quarter of 2024 Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The alignment between Matinas BioPharma and the FDA on the Phase 3 ORALTO trial design for MAT2203, an oral treatment for invasive aspergillosis, is a significant milestone in the drug's development pathway. This agreement signifies a shared understanding of the necessary efficacy and safety benchmarks required for potential approval. The focus on a serious infection like invasive aspergillosis, which primarily affects immunocompromised individuals, addresses a critical unmet medical need.From a medical research perspective, the use of MAT2203 as an oral step-down treatment could revolutionize the management of invasive fungal infections by potentially offering a safer and more convenient alternative to traditional IV therapies, which are often associated with significant side effects. The primary efficacy endpoint of all-cause mortality at day 42 is a robust measure, as it directly correlates with the drug's impact on survival. Additionally, the focus on treatment-related toxicities and long-term survival underscores the importance of not only treating the infection but also improving the overall quality of life for patients.The compassionate use program's success further suggests MAT2203's efficacy in a real-world setting, potentially leading to expedited patient discharge and reduced healthcare costs. However, the small sample size of 19 patients warrants caution until larger clinical trial data are available. Financial Analyst Matinas BioPharma's financial results for 2023, with reported revenue of $1.1 million, reflect a decrease from the previous year's $3.2 million. This decline is attributed to the completion of certain research collaborations. However, the reduced total costs and expenses, primarily due to lower clinical trial expenses, indicate a strategic allocation of resources towards the most promising projects, such as the MAT2203 program.The company's net loss of $22.9 million, although significant, is within the norm for clinical-stage biopharmaceutical companies, which often operate at a loss during the development phase of their products. The current cash position is expected to fund operations through the third quarter of 2024, which suggests an upcoming need for capital. This could be addressed through partnership discussions, as mentioned by the CEO, or potentially through future financing rounds.Investors should consider the potential impact of the successful development and commercialization of MAT2203 on the company's financials. A successful Phase 3 trial and subsequent FDA approval could lead to a substantial increase in the value of Matinas BioPharma, although the inherent risks of clinical development remain. Market Research Analyst The biopharmaceutical sector is highly competitive, with numerous companies vying for market share in the treatment of invasive fungal infections. Matinas BioPharma's strategic focus on leveraging its LNC platform for oral delivery of therapeutics in areas like oncology and inflammation could position the company favorably within niche markets.The successful development of oral LNC-docetaxel, as an example, could disrupt the current chemotherapy administration paradigm by offering a less toxic and potentially more effective oral alternative. This would not only enhance patient convenience and compliance but could also open up new market segments for the company.However, the market adoption of new treatments depends on several factors, including efficacy, safety, cost and reimbursement policies. Matinas BioPharma's ability to demonstrate clear advantages over existing treatments will be critical for market penetration. Additionally, the company's efforts to secure partnerships for advancing MAT2203 into Phase 3 trials could be a catalyst for future growth, as partnerships often provide not only financial support but also strategic expertise in drug development and commercialization. 03/27/2024 - 04:05 PM Clear registration pathway and FDA agreement on the ORALTO Phase 3 trial for MAT2203 represent critical steps forward and supports partnership discussions Continued success of Compassionate/Expanded Use Access Program demonstrates potential of MAT2203 in treating multiple severe invasive fungal infections, including invasive aspergillosis Successful in vivo LNC platform studies demonstrating (a) the oral delivery of small oligonucleotides with biological activity and (b) the dramatically improved safety of LNC-docetaxel over IV-docetaxel, with similar efficacy, supports the future use of the LNC platform in inflammation and oncology Conference call begins at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time today BEDMINSTER, N.J., March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Matinas BioPharma Holdings, Inc.

Jabbour, Chief Executive Officer of Matinas. “Reaching agreement with FDA on the design of the ORALTO registration trial and the consistent successful treatment outcomes in our ongoing Compassionate/Expanded Use Access Program have elevated our confidence that, if approved, MAT2203 could represent a new treatment paradigm for addressing the unmet medical need in the treatment of a variety of difficult to treat invasive fungal infections. With these important elements secured, we are actively pursuing partnership opportunities to advance MAT2203 into Phase 3 as quickly as possible. “We have also advanced the application of our LNC platform into exciting areas, including oncology and inflammation. In the oncology space, our in vivo data demonstrate that treatment with oral LNC-docetaxel at dosages substantially higher than those proven effective in targeting melanoma tumors resulted in tumor size reductions comparable to IV-docetaxel and was associated with none of the toxicity (body weight loss) observed with conventional IV-docetaxel. In the field of inflammation, we have demonstrated the successful oral delivery of biologically active – and potentially therapeutic – small oligonucleotides in several inflammatory disease models. “Overall, we are pleased with all of the progress made by our team throughout 2023 and so far in 2024, and our focus remains on executing our strategic plan to make the LNC platform the preferred next-generation orally available intracellular drug delivery technology, facilitating an internal and external pipeline of drug candidates.” Key Program Updates MAT2203 (Oral Amphotericin B) Program Phase 3 ORALTO Registration Trial Matinas reached alignment with the FDA on the design of a single Phase 3 registration trial of oral MAT2203 in patients with invasive aspergillosis who have limited treatment options. This is a serious and life-threatening invasive fungal infection that occurs primarily in severely immunocompromised patients, including those with hematological malignancies and in transplant recipients. In 2022, the World Health Organization released its Fungal Priority Pathogen List that designated the most common invasive aspergillosis, Aspergillus fumigatus, to be in the Critical Priority group, which is designated as the highest perceived public health threat. Aspergillus fumigatus is also included in the FDA qualified designation list of pathogens that pose a serious and life-threatening risk.The Phase 3 randomized, multicenter, open-label, adjudicator-blinded ORALTO trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of MAT2203 as an oral step-down treatment following two days of treatment with AmBisome® (liposomal IV-amphotericin B) compared with the standard of care in patients with invasive aspergillosis who have limited treatment options. The primary efficacy endpoint in this non-inferiority study is all-cause mortality at study day 42. Key secondary objectives include demonstration of superiority for treatment-related toxicities leading to changes in treatment, long-term survival benefit of MAT2203 using all-cause mortality at study day 84 and the impact of MAT2203 on healthcare resource utilization and quality of life.The Phase 3 ORALTO trial is expected to include approximately 65 investigator sites in the U.S., Europe, South America, the Middle East and Asia Pacific. Enrollment is expected to include approximately 216 adults with recently diagnosed probable or proven invasive aspergillosis who are being treated with AmBisome due to their inability to receive an IV mold-active azole and with limited alternative treatment options. Following up to two days of treatment with AmBisome, eligible participants will be randomized 2:1 to receive either oral MAT2203 or continued AmBisome treatment followed by standard of care. All study participants will receive up to 12 weeks of treatment starting from the first day of treatment with AmBisome. All study participants are expected to be hospitalized during the initial AmBisome treatment period. After step-down to oral MAT2203, study participants may be discharged to continue treatment on an outpatient basis, as clinically appropriate. An independent Data Review Committee, which will be blinded to treatment, will adjudicate primary and secondary endpoints, including clinical, radiological, and mycological responses.Once approximately 75% of participants are enrolled, an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board will review the pooled all-cause mortality rate in a blinded fashion to ensure sample size assumptions are reasonable and the study is adequately powered. Should the pooled event differ substantially from expected levels, a sample size adjustment can be made to the trial.The Company is engaged in active dialogues with potential partners and is seeking to finalize a partnership as soon as possible in order to commence the Phase 3 ORALTO trial. MAT2203 Compassionate/Expanded Use Access Program A total of 19 patients with serious/life-threatening invasive fungal infections have been enrolled in the program to date, with others being evaluated. The infections treated include a variety of micro-organisms (including Aspergillus, Mucorales species, Candidiasis, Fusarium and suspected Coccidioides) at multiple sites of infection including brain, bladder/colon, bone, lung, sinus, and skin. The majority of enrolled patients are post-transplant or are undergoing treatment for underlying malignancies.Patients have been enrolled in the Program at prestigious institutions including the University of Michigan, Johns Hopkins, Nationwide Children’s Hospital, City of Hope, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, the National Institutes of Health, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine.Most patients were receiving AmBisome prior to enrollment but developed treatment-limiting nephrotoxicity, and most also required treatment for azole-resistant organisms or had failed azole therapy and had no other treatment options. All patients who transitioned to MAT2203 after developing renal toxicity following treatment with AmBisome experienced a reversal of renal impairment with a return to baseline renal function and no subsequent renal issues. In addition, most patients to date were able to be discharged from the hospital setting and effectively treated at home, supporting the potential significant pharmacoeconomic impact of MAT2203.Eight patients who completed the desired course of treatment with oral MAT2203 had complete clinical resolution of their infection and patients with ongoing treatment continue to experience significant clinical improvement. LNC Platform Updates Internal Oral LNC Oncology Program Conventional docetaxel, a well-known chemotherapeutic agent used in the management of multiple metastatic and unresectable tumors, is only administered intravenously, and is associated with significant side effects and toxicities.LNC’s crystalline structure encapsulates and protects the body from the docetaxel cargo and selectively delivers drug to tumor cells. This markedly reduces the amount of free drug circulated systemically, avoiding one of the primary drivers of toxicity.LNC-docetaxel is an effective targeting vehicle and an efficient delivery platform for oncology applications due to its unique phospholipid composition that allows for targeting and delivering docetaxel to tumor cells that express phosphatidylserine on their surface.In vivo study data reported in November 2023 demonstrated that oral LNC-docetaxel effectively targeted melanoma tumors and was able to reduce tumor sizes to a degree comparable to that of IV-docetaxel with no apparent toxicity.Additional in vivo study data reported in March 2024 corroborated the lack of toxicity in a more comprehensive safety study with a longer treatment duration and higher doses of oral LNC-docetaxel. Healthy mice administered oral LNC-docetaxel at doses more than 8x greater than IV-docetaxel showed no weight loss, versus an average 20% peak weight loss in mice treated with IV-docetaxel. Mice treated with oral LNC-docetaxel maintained their body weight, which was statistically no different than the weight of control mice treated with oral saline. Internal Oral LNC Small Oligonucleotide Inflammation Program In vivo studies documented the successful oral delivery and biological activity of two different LNC-formulated small oligonucleotides targeting inflammatory cytokines IL-17A and TNFα with reductions in tissue cytokine mRNA in both colitis and psoriasis, along with significant reductions in serum TNFα levels in colitis.The LNC-formulated small oligonucleotides evaluated in these studies interfered with cytokine synthesis rather than simply targeting the cytokine itself, which creates additional opportunities for potential future applications of LNC-delivered therapeutics. Corporate Development The Company received notification from the NYSE American LLC that it has regained compliance with the NYSE American LLC continued listing standards by resolving the continued listing deficiency with respect to the low selling price of its common stock as described in Section 1003(f)(v) of the NYSE American Company Guide. 2023 Financial Results Revenue for 2023 was $1.1 million, which was generated from the Company’s research collaborations with BioNTech SE and Genentech Inc. This compares with revenue for 2022 of $3.2 million, which was generated from the Company’s research collaboration with BioNTech SE. Total costs and expenses for 2023 were $24.9 million compared with $27.8 million for 2022. The decrease was primarily due to lower clinical trial expenses and lower professional and consulting fees. Income from selling unused New Jersey net operating losses (NOLs) and research and development tax credits was $0.5 million and $3.5 million for 2023 and 2022, respectively. The net loss for 2023 was $22.9 million, or $0.11 per share, compared with a net loss for 2022 of $21.0 million, or $0.10 per share. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2023 were $13.8 million compared with $28.8 million as of December 31, 2022. Based on current projections, the Company believes its cash position is sufficient to fund planned operations through the third quarter of 2024.

About Matinas BioPharmaMatinas BioPharma is a biopharmaceutical company focused on delivering groundbreaking therapies using its lipid nanocrystal (LNC) platform delivery technology. Matinas’ lead LNC-based therapy is MAT2203, an oral formulation of the broad-spectrum antifungal drug amphotericin B, which although highly potent, can be associated with significant toxicity. Matinas’ LNC platform provides oral delivery of amphotericin B without the significant nephrotoxicity otherwise associated with IV-delivered formulations. Combining comparable fungicidal activity with targeted delivery results in a lower risk of toxicity and potentially creates the ideal antifungal agent for the treatment of invasive fungal infections. MAT2203 was successfully evaluated in the completed Phase 2 EnACT study in HIV patients suffering from cryptococcal meningitis, meeting its primary endpoint and achieving robust survival. MAT2203 will be further evaluated in a single Phase 3 registration trial (the “ORALTO” trial) as an oral step-down monotherapy following treatment with AmBisome® (liposomal amphotericin B) compared with the standard of care in patients with invasive aspergillosis who have limited treatment options. In addition to MAT2203, preclinical and clinical data have demonstrated that this novel technology can potentially provide solutions to many challenges of achieving safe and effective intracellular delivery of both small molecules and larger, more complex molecular cargos including small oligonucleotides such as ASOs and siRNA. The combination of its unique mechanism of action and flexibility with routes of administration (including oral) positions Matinas’ LNC technology to potentially become a preferred next-generation orally available intracellular drug delivery platform.

PLBY Group aims to increase margins, expand licensing, and enhance digital content in 2024. Negative Total revenue for the year ended 2023 decreased by 23% compared to 2022, with significant declines in direct-to-consumer and licensing revenue. Net loss from continuing operations for the year ended 2023 was $186.4 million, including impairments. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended 2023 was a loss of $7.3 million. Honey Birdette experienced a decrease in revenue in 2023, despite efforts to reduce days on sale and improve product quality. Financial Analyst The financial results reported by PLBY Group indicate a challenging period, with a reported net loss of $3.8 million and an adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 million. The company's transition to a capital-light business model and cost-cutting measures, such as outsourcing e-commerce and reducing corporate overhead, are strategic moves aimed at improving financial health. However, the 12% decrease in Q4 revenue year-over-year and the 23% decrease in annual revenue reflect underlying challenges in both direct-to-consumer and licensing segments. Notably, the amended credit facility to eliminate the total net leverage covenant until Q2 2026 and maintaining a minimum cash balance may provide some financial flexibility. The company's stock buyback program, with the repurchase of approximately 1.5 million shares, suggests confidence in the intrinsic value of the stock. However, investors should be cautious about share repurchases in the context of net losses, as it may impact the company's cash reserves. One area of concern is the poor performance of Chinese licensees and the resulting legal actions. This highlights the risk of international operations and reliance on minimum guarantees from licensees. The focus on rebuilding the China business and the JV with Li & Fung could potentially stabilize and grow the licensing revenue in the long term. The growth in Honey Birdette and the digital business is a positive sign, but the company's overall performance will depend on the successful execution of its restructuring plan and the ability to adapt to market demands while managing costs effectively. Market Research Analyst PLBY Group's efforts to restructure and move towards a more capital-efficient model are commendable. The reduction in overhead costs and the shift in strategy for Honey Birdette to focus on premium branding and reduced discounting may improve brand value and profit margins over time. The significant 14% increase in Honey Birdette's sales in Q4 2023 is a testament to the potential success of these strategies. However, the digital space is highly competitive and while the company's creator platform, now branded as the 'Playboy Club', has seen a tenfold increase in gross merchandise value year-over-year, it will require continuous innovation and marketing to maintain and accelerate growth. The introduction of a digital currency, Bunny Money and an affiliate program are innovative steps that could enhance customer engagement and reduce transaction costs. The company's focus on expanding licensing in China and the rest of the world, particularly in lifestyle categories, could open new revenue streams. However, the success of these initiatives hinges on the careful selection of partners and the management of contractual compliance to avoid past issues. Overall, the company's diversification into digital and lifestyle experiences, along with its cost-cutting measures, presents opportunities for growth. Still, it will be critical to monitor the execution of these strategies and their impact on the company's financial health. Legal Expert The termination of licensing agreements and subsequent legal action against the largest former Chinese licensee for past due amounts and under-reporting of sales is a significant development. This move indicates PLBY Group's commitment to enforcing its contractual rights and protecting its intellectual property, which is important for maintaining the integrity and profitability of its licensing business. While the legal process can be lengthy and outcomes uncertain, successful litigation could lead to substantial monetary recovery. However, investors should consider the potential financial and reputational risks associated with such disputes, including the impact on future licensing opportunities in China and the associated costs of litigation. The shift to a joint venture model in China aims to provide better control and accountability, which could mitigate future risks and enhance licensing revenue. It is essential to ensure that new agreements incorporate lessons learned from past experiences to safeguard the company's interests. From a legal perspective, the proactive management of contractual relationships and the protection of intellectual property rights are critical for the company's long-term success, especially in international markets where regulatory and enforcement frameworks may differ significantly from domestic ones. 03/27/2024 - 04:05 PM Q4 Revenue of $39.4 Million, Net Loss of $3.8 Million & Adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 Million Amends Credit Facility to Eliminate Total Net Leverage Covenant Until Q2 2026 Company to Hold Question-and-Answer Session at 4:30 pm ET Today LOS ANGELES, March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PLBY Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: PLBY) (“PLBY Group” or the “Company”), a leading pleasure and leisure lifestyle company and owner of Playboy, one of the most recognizable and iconic brands in the world, today provided financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Comments from Ben Kohn, Chief Executive Officer of PLBY Group “In 2023, we worked on five main goals. First, restructure the Company and move to a capital-light business model; second, reduce overhead; third, stabilize and reposition Honey Birdette back to a premium brand; fourth, move our China business to a JV model with better accountability and control; and fifth, grow our creator platform, the Playboy Club. We made major progress on all five goals in 2023. As part of our restructuring, we sold Yandy and Lovers, two businesses that were not core to our future plans. We also organized our art and furniture collection for auction, signed contracts with two auction houses, completed one successful sale in November of fine art and plan to have two other, larger auctions in 2024, which we expect will result in the sale of a majority of our collection. We also successfully outsourced operation of our e-commerce business, eliminating approximately $11 million of direct losses, as incurred in the full year of 2022. We have significantly reduced our corporate overhead from approximately $50 million for the full year of 2022, to this year’s projected corporate overhead of approximately $27 million. We remain burdened by long-term fixed overhead costs, such as our corporate office lease that was signed before COVID, but we are actively working to reduce overhead where we can. At Honey Birdette, we brought back the former CEO from when we first purchased the business, reduced the number of sale days by 34% year-over-year, changed our shipping policies, replaced our North American third-party logistics and global freight forwarder, identified four stores with negative 4-wall EBITDA margin contribution for closure (one of which was closed in 2023), improved our product quality and, most importantly, returned Honey Birdette to the boundary-pushing designs which it was known for in the past. These changes resulted in a strong 4th quarter of 2023 for the business, as evidenced by a 14% increase in sales as compared to the 4th quarter of 2022. In March 2023, we signed a joint venture agreement with an affiliate of Li & Fung to manage our China business. This was important given the macroeconomic issues facing the Chinese economy and our licensees’ challenges in meeting the demands of the e-commerce platforms in China, which ultimately led to difficulties with our licensees paying the minimum guarantees they owed us. We also conducted third-party legal and accounting audits of our major licensees, in which we identified additional material violations of our agreements, including the sale of non-approved products and the sale of Playboy tags. Despite our attempts to work with the licensees to help them regain compliance with their obligations under their agreements, we could not reach satisfactory deals and were left with no choice but to terminate two of our three largest Chinese licensing agreements. We have now sued our largest former licensee for past due amounts, the acceleration of the remaining $140 million due under the agreement, as well as for monetary damages, including for the under-reporting of sales over the past few years. We have also begun to sign new agreements with new licensees and former sublicensees as we rebuild our China business. We expect that progress to continue throughout this year. We also successfully amended our credit agreement multiple times in 2023, and I am happy to announce that we have amended it again, replacing our total net leverage covenant until the second quarter of 2026 with a simple requirement to maintain a minimum cash balance of $7.5 million. In addition, given our stock price during the 4th quarter of 2023, and with flexibility previously provided by prior amendments of our credit facility with respect to stock buybacks, our board authorized us to proceed with repurchases under our previously announced stock buyback program, resulting in the repurchase of approximately 1.5 million shares in the 4th quarter. During 2023, we continued to make significant progress on our creator platform and building a single foundation for our entire digital business. We started the year with a product that was at parity with our competitors from a feature set perspective, and we’ve continued to make improvements. Given the decline in collections from China, we were not in a position to invest in marketing and content for our creator platform. Despite that, it still grew significantly, increasing gross merchandise value by a multiple of ten year-over-year and paid out tens of millions of dollars to creators last year. Here are a few of the creator platform’s accomplishments from the past year: In the 4th quarter of 2023, we rebranded the platform the ‘Playboy Club’ to make clear that it is the place to interact with the world's most beautiful and interesting women. The Playboy Club also provides a home for our new paid membership product, which combines aspects of both the virtual and physical worlds, and ultimately allows us to launch new products, like a new magazine and other content, including our legacy digital offerings, within a single combined platform. We introduced a paid membership tier of the Playboy Club, which unlocks premium features, including access to 70+ years of Playboy magazine and opportunities to attend live Playboy events in real life. In addition to the added revenue, memberships also give us additional flexibility in marketing the platform. We have also launched Playboy Club’s digital currency, Bunny Money, to reduce transaction friction and make engaging with our creators easier than ever. We intend to expand the use of Bunny Money, which we expect should reduce our credit card fees and give us unique promotional opportunities. In addition, we launched our proprietary affiliate program, which initially allows creators and third parties to earn commissions on new creator referrals and membership sales. We expect to continue to expand the affiliate program to give our creators additional opportunities to earn, for example by selling customers the opportunity to join a foursome at a member golf tournament or attend a meet-and-greet, giving creators avenues to earn money that no other platforms offer. Customers and creators are responding to the new and improved Playboy Club. We now have over 3.5 million registered users and multiple creators earning over $1 million per year. Crucially, this increased scale is giving us the data we need to really understand what works and what doesn’t from the creator and user perspectives, as well as how we can utilize the assets we have to further enhance the platform experience and accelerate growth. As we move forward into 2024, we believe we have a clear set of goals within each business line, accompanied by a strategy to achieve those goals. Our goals for Honey Birdette in 2024 are: to increase our average selling price and gross product margin by continuing to elevate the brand by further reducing the number of days on sale, to increase product pricing by 10%, and to focus on selling higher margin items at higher price points. We also plan to introduce a Honey Birdette loyalty program to create a better customer journey across our brick-and-mortar and online channels. For our brick-and-mortar channel, we are also focusing on investing in our employees through extensive training on our products and operations. And for our online channel, we will focus on organic advertising and marketing. In doing so, we seek to increase our visibility in organic search by driving more of our core keywords into the top three Google search results, pursue aggressive social media outreach for product placement with creators and influencers, and leverage our new customer relationship management for enhanced customer segmentation in both email and SMS marketing. In China, we are focusing our strategy on re-licensing previously licensed product categories and the development of relevant new lifestyle categories. We have entered into several new license agreements and together with our China JV partner, we will continue to seek out and select companies with proven track records in design, development and distribution of men’s and women’s apparel and accessories to reset Playboy's China fashion licensing business, with an eye towards greater contractual compliance and long-term royalty revenue generation. In the rest of the world, we plan to grow our business by expanding our relationships with our top existing licensees that generate the majority of our royalties. By granting expanded rights under their existing agreements, we can quickly add new categories such as swim or activewear, as well as new retail channels, including online and in-person retailers and marketplaces. Further, we will focus new business development on categories and markets that matter most to our customers, such as cosmetics, home decorative accessories, wellness, toys, gaming, and land-based entertainment, in markets such as Europe and Asia-Pacific. We are excited by the initial success of PLAY HARD, our spirits joint venture’s entry into the ready-to-drink market, and look forward to what comes next. Our goals for our digital business going forward are to add new creators and customers and improve the experience for existing creators and users. We will do that by: giving our creators more opportunities to earn money, by raising their profiles to gain a larger audience in a manner that best suits their long-term goals and image, and giving our customers more opportunities to spend with Playboy, by offering them a deeper connection with the Playboy lifestyle and the broad range of digital and in-person experiences that only Playboy can offer. Content is key to us achieving our digital goals. Accordingly, we plan to relaunch two key features that promote the women we work with and showcasing them in a new magazine. We plan to bring back the iconic Playboy Playmate franchise to highlight top creators. In addition, we plan to produce other audio and video content that promotes and celebrates our creators. Content will serve four main purposes: first, it will re-energize the brand; second, it will give our creators opportunities to be featured by Playboy and help build their brands and audiences; third, it will help us acquire new audiences for the Playboy Club; and fourth, it will provide another revenue stream to us and our creators as we place advertising against that content. We will continue the consolidation of our legacy digital products into one platform to save costs, optimize the consumer funnel and give our creators and customers more choices. We recently made our magazine archives available as part of the paid Playboy Club membership, and they have begun to drive incremental traffic as we search engine optimized the full archive. We expect to bring our adult sites Playboy Plus and Playboy TV to the Playboy Club platform later this year to allow us to have single sign-on from a user experience across our digital channels. We’ve seen encouraging evidence that audiences from our adult sites will convert to the Playboy Club platform experience. For example, almost 40% of our Playboy Club memberships to date have been sold through Playboy Plus. There is a huge opportunity for us to expand our audience acquisition strategy there and then cross-sell membership. We also have the opportunity to use the various heat levels of our different products to create different spaces within the single platform to offer different homes for different types of creators (for example, safe-for-work and more risqué). With the elimination of the total net leverage covenant until the second quarter of 2026, our cash on hand and the stabilization we have begun to see in our other business lines, we plan to focus on growing and marketing our digital business through content this year. While we will continue to not give specific guidance for future fiscal periods, given all the recent changes we have made to the Company, including the reduction of our overhead, we plan on reducing net loss and being EBITDA positive for the full-year 2024, and we believe we currently have the capital to invest in growth while also servicing our debt.” Q4 2023 Financial Highlights Total revenue from continuing operations in the fourth quarter was $39.4 million versus $44.9 million in the prior year period, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of 12%. Of the $5.5 million decrease in revenue, $6.8 million was attributable to the elimination of playboy.com e-commerce, as well as a decline in licensing, partially offset by growth in Honey Birdette and the digital business.Net loss from continuing operations in the fourth quarter was $9.6 million, including $8.3 million of trademark and other impairments. The adjusted EBITDA income from continuing operations was $1.1 million. Direct-to-consumer revenue from continuing operations declined $4.3 million, or 18%, year-over-year to $20.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Revenues from playboy.com e-commerce declined by $6.8 million, as the Company completed the transition from an owned-and-operated model to a licensing model. Also, during the quarter, revenue from Honey Birdette increased by $2.5 million, or 14% year-over-year, to $20.4 million from $17.9 million due to improvement in consumer demand. Licensing revenue decreased 14% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2023 to $13.4 million, from $15.5 million a year ago. The decrease is largely attributable to the poor financial performance of our China licensees and the resulting non-payment of minimum guarantees, partly offset by $5.1 million of revenue recognized from prepaid royalty guarantees due to termination of our largest Chinese licensing agreement. Digital subscriptions and content revenue was up 22% compared to a year ago, to $5.6 million from $4.6 million. Revenue growth from the Company’s creator platform more than offset a decrease in the Company’s legacy digital business revenue. Net loss from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $9.6 million, an improvement of $0.3 million from a net loss from continuing operations of $9.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Total net loss of the Company for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $3.8 million, an improvement of $6.4 million from a total net loss of $10.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1.1 million, an improvement of $3.7 million from a $2.6 million adjusted EBITDA loss during the prior year period. This reflects growth in Honey Birdette and digital, as well as the Company’s cost-cutting initiatives as it moves to a more capital-light model. The Company ended the fourth quarter with approximately $31.7 million in restricted and unrestricted cash. Full Year 2023 Financial Highlights Total revenue from continuing operations for the year ended 2023 was $143.0 million, as compared to $185.5 million in 2022, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of 23%. Of the $42.5 million decrease in revenue, $27.2 million was attributable to direct-to-consumer products and $16.6 million was attributable to licensing, partially offset by a $1.2 million increase in the digital and other segments.Net loss from continuing operations for the year ended 2023 was $186.4 million, including $154.9 million of impairments. The adjusted EBITDA loss from continuing operations was $7.3 million. Direct-to-consumer revenue from continuing operations declined 26% year-over-year to $78.0 million in 2023. During the year, revenues from playboy.com e-commerce declined by $16.6 million as the Company completed the transition from an owned-and-operated model to a licensing model. In addition, revenue from Honey Birdette decreased by $10.7 million, or 13% year-over-year, to $72.9 million from $83.6 million. Honey Birdette reduced the days on sale during 2023 by 34%, in an effort to protect brand integrity and combat rising production and distribution costs. Licensing revenue decreased 27% year-over-year in 2023 to $44.3 million from $60.9 million a year ago. The decline is largely attributable to the poor financial performance of our China licensees and the resulting non-payment of minimum guarantees, partly offset by $5.1 million of revenue recognized from prepaid royalty guarantees due to termination of our largest Chinese licensing agreement. Digital subscriptions and content revenue was up 10% compared to a year ago, to $20.7 million from $18.7 million. Revenue growth from the Company’s creator platform more than offset a decrease in the Company’s legacy digital business revenue. Net loss from continuing operations for the year ended 2023 was $186.4 million, down from a net loss of $250.7 million in 2022. The lower loss was largely driven by $283.5 million of non-cash asset impairments related to the write-down of goodwill, trademarks and other assets recorded in 2022, while there was only $154.9 million of impairments in 2023. Total net loss of the Company for 2023 was $180.4 million, an improvement of $97.3 million from a total net loss of $277.7 million in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA loss in 2023 was $7.3 million, as compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $4.5 million in 2022. This was driven by a reduction in high margin China licensing revenue and weaker performance at Honey Birdette during the first three quarters of the year.

Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of the Company’s performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. The Company believes that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing its financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, investors should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, the Company may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, the Company’s presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. The Company’s computation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. In addition to adjusting for non-cash stock-based compensation, non-cash charges for the fair value remeasurements of certain liabilities and non-recurring non-cash impairments, asset write-downs and inventory reserve charges, we typically adjust for nonoperating expenses and income, such as non-recurring special projects, including the implementation of internal controls, non-recurring gain on the sale of assets, expenses associated with financing activities, and reorganization and severance expenses that result in the elimination or rightsizing of specific business activities or operations. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Company’s GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. Investors should review the reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company’s business.

Negative None. 03/27/2024 - 04:05 PM BOULDER, Colo., March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gaia, Inc. (NASDAQ: GAIA) (“Gaia” or the “Company”), a conscious media and community company, reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. “We continue to build on Gaia’s increasing momentum. The member count grew to 806,000 at the end of the year and we expect to finish the first quarter of 2024 at about 838,000, a good milestone toward our 15% revenue growth target for 2024,” said Jirka Rysavy, Gaia’s Chairman. “The growth in gross profit per employee was the main driver of our significant cashflow improvement.” Gaia CFO Ned Preston commented: “During 2023, the company generated improvement of $4.2 million in operating cash flow and $8.4 million in free cash flow, with our significant increase in annualized gross profit per employee and working capital driving this increase through improved cash management and deferred revenue growth.” Gaia CEO James Colquhoun commented: “As we closed Q4 2023, we continued our trend of executing on cash flow positive growth. We found continued improvements in marketing efficiency with some of our lowest customer acquisition costs since the beginning of 2021. We also launched a beta version of our Gaia Marketplace; a curated selection of experiences, retreats, courses, and physical goods - an initiative aimed at increasing ARPU, without further marketing expenditure, while supporting the conscious lifecycle of our members. Our focus for 2024 will include improving on marketing efficiency, the continued rollout of our Marketplace initiative, alongside a renewed focus on our premium membership tier.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial ResultsResults compare the 2023 fiscal fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023 to the 2022 fiscal fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022, unless otherwise indicated. Revenues for the fourth quarter 2023 increased 6% to $20.7 million from $19.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily driven by the growth of Gaia’s member base.Member growth increased during the year, growing sequentially by an additional 16 thousand members during the fourth quarter, with the member count ending at 806,000 up from 759,000 on December 31, 2022. The Company expects the member growth to further accelerate with continuing increases of Gaia’s ARPU during 2024.Gross profit in the fourth quarter increased to $17.7 million from $17.0 in the fourth quarter of 2022. Gross margin was 85.4%, in line with the year.Net loss was $(1.8) million or $(0.08) per share as compared to a net loss of $(1.0) million or $(0.05) per share in the year-ago quarter with higher amortization, but operating cash flow improved $2.1 million and free cash flow improved $1.7 million to $1.0 million from ($0.7 million) during the last year quarter.The cash balance as of December 31, 2023 was $7.8 million with an unused $10 million line of credit, compared to net cash of $2.6 million or $11.6 million of cash with $9 million of borrowing on the credit line a year ago. 2023 Financial ResultsResults compare the 2023 fiscal full year ended December 31, 2023 to the 2022 fiscal full year ended December 31, 2022, unless otherwise indicated. Revenue for the year was $80.4 million as compared to $82.0 million in 2022, as the company was recovering from the post-COVID subscriber contraction experienced industry-wide during the later part of 2022.Loss for the year was $(5.6) million or $(0.27) per share, as compared to a loss of $(3.6 million), or $(0.19) per share for 2022, with increased marketing spend and amortization, however, operating cash flow improved by $4.2 million.For the year, free cash flow improved by $8.4 million to $1.1 million from ($7.3 million), even as the Company increased marketing to 41.1% of revenue from 37.2% in the prior year. The free cash flow was helped by elimination of $5 million in annualized spending finalized in the beginning of the year, which included 36 headcounts added previously to offset reduced efficiency because of work-from-home mandates.With Gaia’s new CFO, the Company decided to restate the consolidated financial statements for 2022 and the first three quarters of 2023, making some presentation changes to be in line with the industry. None of these changes or the restatement impacts Gaia’s revenue or free cash flow and are already reflected in this release.The Company expects member growth to accelerate during 2024 as it is now forecasting to double net member additions from 16,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023 to 32,000 in the first quarter of 2024, finishing the quarter with about 838,000 members, while continuing to generate positive free cash flow.

Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. When used in this discussion, we intend the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “contemplate,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “future,” “hope,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “objective,” “ongoing,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “strive,” “target,” “will,” “would” and similar expressions as they relate to us to identify such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation: the Company’s plans related to restatement of the financial statements; our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively, including for customer engagement with different modes of entertainment; maintenance and expansion of devise platforms for streaming; fluctuation in customer usage of our service; fluctuations in quarterly operating results; service disruptions; production risks; general economic conditions; future losses; loss of key personnel; price changes; brand reputation; acquisitions; new initiatives we undertake; security and information systems; legal liability for website content; failure of third parties to provide adequate service; future internet-related taxes; our founder’s control of us; litigation; consumer trends; the effect of government regulation and programs; the impact of public health threats, including the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and our response to it; and other risks and uncertainties included in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those implied by forward-looking statements, including the outcome of the Company’s completion of the quantification and evaluation of the specific impact of the errors identified in the Company’s financial results and previously issued financial statements, including the possibility of material adjustments thereto, the discovery of additional and unanticipated information during the procedures required to be completed before the Company is able to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the application of accounting or tax principles in an unanticipated manner. See also additional risk factors set forth in the Company’s periodic filings with the SEC, including, but not limited to, those risks and uncertainties listed in the section entitled “Risk Factors,” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. We caution you that no forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future performance, and you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which reflect our views only as of the date of this press release. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking information. Non-GAAP MeasuresIn addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States of America, the financial information included in this release contains non-GAAP financial measures, including Free Cash Flow. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures and results calculated in accordance with GAAP, including net income, and reconciliations to GAAP financial statements should be carefully evaluated. Free Cash Flow represents net cash provided by operating activities, adjusted for interest payments, and less capital expenditures. We believe Free Cash Flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing the Gaia’s performance with its competitors. Although Free Cash Flow and similar measures are frequently used as measures of cash flows generated from operations by other companies, Gaia’s calculation of Free Cash Flow might not necessarily be comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

The partnership targets the growing demand for self-driven cars in India, with Zoomcar Hosts earning $4 million in Q3 2023. The collaboration with ACKO Drive enables Hosts to access exclusive offers and upgrade their car fleet to cater to evolving consumer preferences. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The partnership between Zoomcar Holdings, Inc. and ACKO Drive represents a strategic alignment within the burgeoning car sharing industry in India. It's a clear response to the increasing consumer demand for self-drive travel options, which is part of a larger global trend towards shared economy models. By offering substantial savings on new car purchases and attractive financial incentives, this collaboration is designed to bolster Zoomcar's supply side by encouraging Hosts to expand their fleets.From a market perspective, initiatives that streamline the process of fleet expansion for micro-entrepreneurs can be a catalyst for growth. For Zoomcar, which operates on a marketplace model, the vitality of its service is contingent on the availability and diversity of its vehicle offerings. By enhancing the quantity and quality of cars, Zoomcar can potentially increase its market share and improve customer satisfaction, which in turn could translate into higher revenue streams.Moreover, the emphasis on newer car models can positively impact the brand image of Zoomcar, aligning it with consumer preferences for modern and reliable vehicles. This strategic move could also create a competitive edge over other players in the market, as consumers often gravitate towards platforms that offer superior experiences. Financial Analyst Zoomcar's partnership with ACKO Drive has implications for its financial health and attractiveness to investors. The reported earnings of approximately $4 million by Zoomcar Hosts in Q3 2023 indicate a lucrative and growing segment of their business model. The partnership could further augment these earnings by reducing the barriers to fleet expansion for Hosts through financial incentives.From an investment standpoint, the ability of Zoomcar to scale its operations efficiently by leveraging strategic partnerships is a positive indicator. It suggests prudent management and a proactive approach to capturing market opportunities. Additionally, the partnership could lead to improved asset turnover ratios if the increased number of vehicles translates into higher utilization rates without a proportional increase in capital expenditures.However, one must consider the risks associated with such partnerships. The dependency on third-party platforms like ACKO Drive for growth could introduce vulnerabilities, especially if the terms of the partnership change or if competition in the financing sector intensifies. Investors should monitor the execution of this partnership and its actual impact on Zoomcar's bottom line over the coming quarters. Automotive Industry Analyst The strategic partnership between Zoomcar and ACKO Drive is indicative of a shift in the automotive industry towards integrated service offerings. By facilitating easier access to vehicles and financing, ACKO Drive is essentially enabling Zoomcar to tap into a wider base of micro-entrepreneurs.

Ongoing communication with FDA for Larsucosterol in Alcohol-Associated Hepatitis. Webcast of earnings call on March 27th. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent update from DURECT Corporation regarding their financial results and business update, specifically the mention of ongoing communication with the FDA about Larsucosterol, presents a mixed scenario for investors and stakeholders. On one hand, the financial results provide a quantifiable measure of the company's performance, which is essential for assessing its valuation and future prospects. On the other hand, the progress with Larsucosterol, a treatment for Alcohol-Associated Hepatitis, implies potential future revenue streams and could significantly impact the company's market position.It is important to note that the drug development process is fraught with risk and positive FDA communications do not guarantee approval. However, should Larsucosterol receive approval, the implications for DURECT could be substantial, considering the limited treatments currently available for Alcohol-Associated Hepatitis. This could lead to a reevaluation of the company's stock, as markets often react to the anticipation of increased earnings potential. Investors should monitor the situation closely, as any developments could lead to volatility in the stock price. Medical Research Analyst From a medical research perspective, DURECT's ongoing discussions with the FDA about Larsucosterol are a critical step in bringing a new therapy to market. Alcohol-Associated Hepatitis is a serious condition with high morbidity and current treatment options are limited. The development of Larsucosterol represents a significant advancement in this therapeutic area. If the communication with the FDA results in a clear path to approval, this could not only benefit patients but also position DURECT as a leader in hepatic treatments.Investors should understand that the value of DURECT's stock could be influenced by the outcomes of these FDA discussions. A positive outcome could lead to increased investor confidence, while any setbacks might have the opposite effect. Moreover, the success of Larsucosterol could pave the way for DURECT to expand its pipeline in the field of liver diseases, which would be a strategic move to diversify and strengthen the company's portfolio. 03/27/2024 - 04:01 PM - Ongoing Communication with FDA to Align on Next Steps for Larsucosterol in Alcohol-Associated Hepatitis - Webcast of Earnings Call Today, March 27th at 4:30 p.m. ET CUPERTINO, Calif., March 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- DURECT Corporation (Nasdaq: DRRX) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023 and provided a business update. ""We remain enthusiastic about the improvement in 90-day mortality demonstrated in our Phase 2b AHFIRM clinical trial and are communicating with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about the design of a confirmatory Phase 3 trial to support the potential approval of larsucosterol as a treatment for alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH),"" stated James E. Brown, D.V.M., President and CEO of DURECT. ""Larsucosterol could be the first FDA-approved treatment to address AH, a highly lethal condition that results in approximately 158,000 hospitalizations in the U.S. annually with a 30% mortality rate at 90 days."" Business Update: In November 2023, DURECT announced topline data from the AHFIRM trial that showed a compelling efficacy signal in favor of larsucosterol in the key secondary endpoint of mortality at 90 days. Both the 30 mg and 90 mg larsucosterol doses demonstrated clinically meaningful trends in reduction of mortality at 90 days with mortality reductions of 41% (p=0.068) in the 30 mg arm and 35% (p=0.124) in the 90 mg arm compared with placebo.The reductions in mortality at 90 days were more pronounced in U.S. patients with reductions of 57% (p=0.014) in the 30 mg arm and 58% (p=0.008) in the 90 mg arm compared with placebo. The numerical improvement in the primary endpoint of mortality or liver transplant at 90 days did not achieve statistical significance for either dose of larsucosterol.Larsucosterol appeared safe and well tolerated in the AHFIRM trial with fewer treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in the larsucosterol arms compared with placebo.DURECT is in ongoing communications with the FDA to align on next steps for the development of larsucosterol, including the design for a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in AH. DURECT plans to provide an update in the second quarter of 2024.In March 2024, DURECT announced that it entered into a co-marketing and collaboration agreement with Charles River Laboratories for the ALZET® Osmotic Pumps Portfolio and Associated Product Line in the U.S. and Canada. Charles River Research Models & Services (RMS) sales and marketing teams will collaborate with DURECT to jointly market and commercialize the ALZET product line to existing and new customers in the pharmaceutical industry and academic laboratories over a multi-year period.Financial Highlights for Q4 and Full Year 2023: Total revenues were $2.7 million and net loss was $1.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to total revenues of $3.3 million and net loss of $10.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022.

About the AHFIRM TrialAHFIRM was a Phase 2b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international, multi-center study conducted in subjects with severe alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) to evaluate the saFety and effIcacy of laRsucosterol treatMent (AHFIRM). The study was comprised of three arms and enrolled 307 patients, with approximately 100 patients in each arm: (1) SOC, which consists of placebo plus supportive care, with or without methylprednisolone capsules at the investigators' discretion; (2) larsucosterol (30 mg); and (3) larsucosterol (90 mg). Patients in the larsucosterol arms received the same supportive care without steroids. In order to maintain blinding, patients in the two active arms received matching placebo capsules if the investigator prescribed steroids. The primary outcome measure was the 90-Day incidence of mortality or liver transplantation for patients treated with larsucosterol compared to those treated with SOC. The Company enrolled patients at clinical trial sites across the U.S., EU, U.K., and Australia. In November 2023, the Company announced topline data for the AHFIRM Trial, as discussed above. Reflecting the life-threatening nature of AH and the lack of therapeutic options, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted larsucosterol Fast Track Designation for the treatment of AH. For more information, refer to ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04563026. About Alcohol-associated Hepatitis (AH)AH is an acute form of alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), associated with long-term heavy intake of alcohol and often occurs after a recent period of increased alcohol consumption (i.e., a binge). AH is typically characterized by severe inflammation and destruction of liver tissue (i.e., necrosis), potentially leading to life-threatening complications including liver failure, acute kidney injury and multi-organ failure. There are no FDA approved therapies for AH and a retrospective analysis of 77 studies published between 1971 and 2016, which included data from a total of 8,184 patients, showed the overall mortality from AH was 26% at 28 days, 29% at 90 days and 44% at 180 days. A subsequent global study published in December 2021, which included 85 tertiary centers in 11 countries across 3 continents, prospectively enrolled 2,581 AH patients with a median Model of End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score of 23.5, reported mortality at 28 and 90 days of approximately 20% and 31%, respectively. Stopping alcohol consumption is necessary, but frequently not sufficient for recovery in many moderate (defined as MELD scores of 11-20) and severe (defined as MELD scores >20) patients and therapies that reduce liver inflammation, such as corticosteroids, are limited by contraindications, have not been shown to improve survival at 90 days or one year, and have demonstrated an increased risk of infection. While liver transplantation is becoming more common for ALD patients, including AH patients, the total number of such transplants is still relatively small, and limited by organ availability. Average charges for a liver transplant exceed $875,000, and patients require lifelong immunosuppressive therapy to prevent organ rejection. About Larsucosterol Larsucosterol is an endogenous sulfated oxysterol and an epigenetic modulator. Epigenetic regulators are compounds that regulate patterns of gene expression without modifying the DNA sequence. DNA hypermethylation, an example of epigenetic dysregulation, results in transcriptomic reprogramming and cellular dysfunction, and has been found to be associated with many acute (e.g., AH) or chronic diseases (e.g., MASH). As an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3a and 3b), larsucosterol inhibits DNA methylation, which subsequently modulates expression of genes that are involved in cell signaling pathways associated with stress responses, cell death and survival, and lipid biosynthesis. This may ultimately lead to improved cell survival, reduced inflammation, and decreased lipotoxicity. As an epigenetic modulator, the proposed mechanism of action provides further scientific rationale for developing larsucosterol for the treatment of acute organ injury and certain chronic diseases. About DURECT CorporationDURECT is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering the development of epigenetic therapies that target dysregulated DNA methylation to transform the treatment of serious and life-threatening conditions, including acute organ injury and cancer. Larsucosterol, DURECT's lead drug candidate, binds to and inhibits the activity of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), epigenetic enzymes that are elevated and associated with hypermethylation found in alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) patients. Larsucosterol is in clinical development for the potential treatment of AH, for which FDA has granted a Fast Track Designation; metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is also being explored. In addition, POSIMIR® (bupivacaine solution) for infiltration use, a non-opioid analgesic utilizing the innovative SABER® platform technology, is FDA-approved and is exclusively licensed to Innocoll Pharmaceuticals for sale and distribution in the United States.

DURECT Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements, including statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, relating to: the potential for larsucosterol to demonstrate a reduction in mortality or liver transplant in patients with AH and to save lives, our ability to clarify with the FDA the design of the Phase 3 clinical trial of larsucosterol for AH, the potential FDA or other regulatory approval of larsucosterol for the treatment of AH, the potential to develop larsucosterol for AH, MASH or other indications, and the potential benefits, if any, of our product candidates. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements contained in this press release, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those projected include, among other things, the risk that future clinical trials of larsucosterol do not confirm the results from subset analyses of the AHFIRM trial, including geographic or other segmentation, or of earlier clinical or pre-clinical trials, or do not demonstrate the safety or efficacy of larsucosterol in a statistically significant manner, risks that Innocoll may not commercialize POSIMIR successfully, and risks related to the sufficiency of our cash resources, our anticipated capital requirements, our need or desire for additional financing, our ability to meet the minimum bid price for continued listing on Nasdaq, our ability to obtain capital to fund our operations and expenses and our ability to continue to operate as a going concern. Further information regarding these and other risks is included in DURECT's most recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, including its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 and annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, when filed, under the heading ""Risk Factors.""

They achieved a major milestone with the public launch of Rumble Cloud, unveiling new revenue streams. The company also announced strategic partnerships and launched key monetization features. Positive Impressive 106% growth in full-year 2023 revenue to $81.0 million compared to the previous year. 16% increase in fourth-quarter average monthly active users to 67 million, with 48 million based in the U.S. and Canada. Successful public launch of Rumble Cloud, offering infrastructure-as-a-service and targeting a share of the public cloud market. Strategic partnerships with Qinshift, ACP CreativIT, Barstool Sports, and 1775 Coffee to enhance services and offerings. Introduction of key monetization features like pre-roll video advertising, tipping functionality, and livestream contribution for political campaigns. Negative Increase in cost of services by 68% to $39.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. General and administrative expenses decreased by 3% to $9.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Research and development expenses increased by 39% to $3.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Sales and marketing expenses rose by 18% to $3.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Uncertainty regarding the impact of transitioning from Universal Analytics to Google Analytics 4 on reported metrics like Monthly Active Users. Market Research Analyst The reported increase in revenue of 106% to $81.0 million for the full year 2023 indicates a substantial growth trajectory for Rumble Inc., which could potentially affect investor sentiment and the company's stock market performance. The growth appears to be driven by diversification into new products, such as Rumble Cloud and strategic partnerships, including those with Qinshift and Barstool Sports. This diversification strategy suggests an expansion beyond the company's traditional video sharing platform, positioning it within the competitive cloud services market.However, the modest 2% revenue increase in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022, coupled with a significant 68% rise in cost of services, raises questions about the sustainability of the company's profit margins. While Rumble's user engagement metrics, such as MAUs and MWPM, show positive signs of growth, the decrease in advertising revenue by $3.1 million could be a concern for future revenue streams, as advertising typically forms a significant portion of revenue for content platforms.The company's liquidity position, with $219.5 million in cash and marketable securities, appears robust and may provide the necessary capital to support ongoing research and development, as well as marketing efforts. Investors may view this as a buffer against short-term volatility while the company focuses on long-term growth strategies. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, Rumble's commitment to achieving breakeven by 2025 is a critical target for investors. The company’s strategy to reduce guaranteed creator commitments towards the end of 2024 could alleviate some of the financial pressures and improve profitability. The entry into the cloud services market with Rumble Cloud represents a significant step towards diversifying revenue streams, which is essential in a rapidly evolving tech landscape.Nevertheless, the escalation in costs, particularly in content and hosting, is a concern that requires careful management. The 39% increase in research and development costs indicates investment in innovation, which could lead to future growth but also contributes to the current strain on profitability. Investors will likely monitor these investments closely to ensure they translate into tangible returns.The strategic partnerships and new product launches, such as Rumble Studio and monetization features, are promising developments. However, the ultimate success of these initiatives in contributing to the top line will be a determining factor in the company's ability to meet its financial targets and impact the stock's performance. Legal Expert The transition from Google's Universal Analytics to Google Analytics 4 could have legal implications regarding data accuracy and reporting. As Rumble has disclosed, this change may affect the comparability of user metrics reported, which are critical for investors and advertisers. The company must ensure that its disclosures are transparent and comply with regulatory standards to avoid legal complications that could arise from potential misrepresentation of user engagement data.Moreover, the partnerships and product launches mentioned, such as the exclusive Rumble-branded products with 1775 Coffee and the strategic partnership with Barstool Sports, will likely involve complex contractual agreements. These agreements must be crafted to protect Rumble's interests, intellectual property and revenue-sharing terms, while also considering the legal implications of cross-platform content distribution and cloud services. 03/27/2024 - 04:05 PM ~ Full Year 2023 Revenue Increased 106% to $81.0 Million ~ ~ Fourth Quarter Average Monthly Active Users Sequentially Increased 16% to 67 Million ~ ~ Achieved Company’s Largest Milestone To-Date with Public Launch of Rumble Cloud ~ LONGBOAT KEY, Fla., March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rumble Inc. (Nasdaq: RUM) (""Rumble"" or the ""Company”), the video sharing platform and cloud services provider, today announced financial results for the fiscal quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Q4 2023 and Full Year Key Highlights Revenue for the full year 2023 increased 106% to $81.0 million, compared to $39.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Fourth quarter revenue increased to $20.4 million, compared to $20.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, and $18.0 million in the third quarter of 2023.Average global Monthly Active Users (“MAUs”) of 67 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 16% from 58 million in the third quarter of 2023. Of the 67 million MAUs, 48 million were based in the U.S. and Canada.Average estimated Minutes Watched Per Month (“MWPM”) were 10.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to 10.7 billion in the third quarter of 2023. Estimated MWPM is derived from bandwidth consumption metrics. For additional details, please see “Notes on KPIs,” below, and the “Key Business Metrics” section of Rumble’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.Hours of uploaded video per day increased by 21% to 12,520 in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to 10,373 in the fourth quarter of 2022, and decreased from 15,700 in the third quarter of 2023, which we believe is due to the previously disclosed impacts resulting from YouTube’s decision to disable tools that allowed for the automatic sync of creators’ YouTube and Rumble channels.As of December 31, 2023, Rumble’s balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was approximately $219.5 million.Launched the beta release of Rumble Studio, an all-new patent-pending livestreaming tool designed for creators to easily stream video to multiple platforms, invite guests, and engage with audiences.Continued to launch meaningful feature enhancements to the Rumble platform, including playlists and watch history on web/desktop, search autocomplete, static stream key for live streaming and many other creator workflow and user interface improvements.Served as the exclusive livestream platform for the fourth Republican presidential primary debate, gaining over an estimated 950,000 views across all Rumble platforms. Subsequent to Quarter End Highlights Publicly launched Rumble Cloud in March 2024, as committed, which is a newly formed infrastructure-as-a-service solution offering a variety of compute, storage and networking packages. Rumble Cloud is primed to provide a new revenue stream for Rumble by capturing a share of the public cloud market by serving a growing segment of businesses that are looking for alternatives to ‘Big Tech.’On the heels of the Rumble Cloud launch, entered into a strategic partnership with Qinshift, a global leader in managed IT services and solutions, to support Rumble Cloud by leveraging both companies’ expertise, resources and applications while providing Rumble the access to Qinshift’s global footprint to support the long-term operations of Rumble Cloud.Announced comprehensive strategic partnership with ACP CreativIT to bolster the managed services offering of Rumble Cloud.Completed rollout of Rumble Studio as a livestreaming tool, laying the foundation for Rumble’s emerging Streaming Marketplace and future monetization features.Announced a strategic partnership with Barstool Sports combining Rumble’s cross-suite of solutions with access to the full content library of Barstool Sports creators, the provision of Rumble Cloud services to support Barstool and a mutual advertising sales agreement.Entered a partnership with 1775 Coffee to launch an exclusive Rumble-branded products.Launched several key monetization features, including: pre-roll video advertising on mobile apps, tipping functionality added to Android, and a livestream contribution feature for U.S. federal political campaigns, which allows channels affiliated with a candidate running for U.S. federal office to receive “tips”—constituting federal campaign contributions—through Rumble during live events. Management Commentary Rumble’s Chairman and CEO Chris Pavlovski commented, “As planned, 2023 was a year of product focus for Rumble as we concentrated on execution, prioritizing our infrastructure and product. Today, Rumble has four top-of-the-line products: our video platform, the Rumble Advertising Center (RAC), our unique Rumble Studio platform, and our biggest accomplishment to date, the Rumble Cloud. We have a beautiful business, and I am incredibly proud of the Company we have built and the team behind this incredible undertaking. The fact that today we have this portfolio of assets able to compete in such sizable addressable markets is an unbelievable accomplishment. “Looking ahead, with our functioning products now online, we expect clarity on the performance of our assets beginning in the second quarter, leading to a stronger topline in the second half of the year. With this solid foundation in place, we are now positioned to benefit from the synergies of our full suite of offerings and focus on selling to yield topline momentum. We continue to stay true to principle, running the un-cancelable highway of the free and open internet that we can proudly offer as a service. With our trajectory for monetization becoming more evident as we progress through 2024, our commitment to deliver long-term value to all stakeholders and our path towards breakeven in 2025 are well underway,” concluded Mr. Pavlovski.

The increase is due to an increase in other services revenue of $3.5 million, offset by a decrease in advertising revenue of $3.1 million. The increase in other services revenue was driven mainly by subscriptions, content licensing, tipping features, and provision of one-time content. Cost of services was $39.5 million for the quarter compared to $23.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase is due to an increase in programming and content costs of $14.0 million and an increase in hosting expenses and other service costs of $2.0 million. General and administrative expense was $9.6 million for the quarter, compared to $9.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. There was a $1.0 million increase related to the recognition of rights to contingent consideration in connection with the Callin acquisition, offset by a $1.3 million decrease in payroll and other administrative expenses, most of which are public company-related, including legal, investor relations, insurance, and other administrative services. Research and development expense was $3.6 million for the quarter, compared to $2.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was due to an increase in payroll and related expenses of $0.6 million, as well as a $0.4 million increase in costs related to computer hardware, software, and other expenses used in research and development related activity. Sales and marketing expense was $3.2 million for the quarter, compared to $2.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was due to a $0.6 million increase in staffing-related and consulting service costs, offset by $0.1 million decrease in marketing initiatives in the quarter. Liquidity As of December 31, 2023, Rumble had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $219.5 million. Outlook Beginning with the second quarter of 2024, we expect revenue to increase on a sequential basis. As a result of our revenue engines coming online and our guaranteed creator commitments set to significantly decrease by the end of 2024 and into 2025, we continue to move materially towards breakeven in 2025. Conference Call Webcast Information Rumble will host a conference call at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time today, Wednesday, March 27, 2024, to discuss its quarterly results. Access to the live webcast and replay of the conference call will be available here and on Rumble's Investor Relations website at investors.rumble.com under 'News & Events.’ Chris Pavlovski, the Chairman and CEO of Rumble, will also be interviewed by Matt Kohrs this evening at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The interview will be accessible here and streamed live on the Matt Kohrs Rumble channel at rumble.com/MattKohrs. Notes on KPIs Monthly Active Users (""MAUs""). We use MAUs as a measure of audience engagement to help us understand the volume of users engaged with our content on a monthly basis. MAUs represent the total web, mobile app, and connected TV users of Rumble for each month, which allows us to measure our total user base calculated from data provided by Google, a third-party analytics provider. Google defines “active users” as the number of distinct users who visited your website or application. We have used the Google analytics systems since we first began publicly reporting MAU statistics, and the resulting data have not been independently verified. As of July 1, 2023, Universal Analytics (“UA”), Google’s analytics platform on which we historically relied for calculating MAUs using company-set parameters, was phased out by Google and ceased processing data. At that time, Google Analytics 4 (“GA4”) succeeded UA as Google’s next-generation analytics platform, which has been used to determine MAUs since the third quarter of 2023 and which we expect to continue to use to determine MAUs in future periods. Although Google has disclosed certain information regarding the transition to GA4, Google does not currently make available sufficient information relating to its new GA4 algorithm for us to determine the full effect of the switch from UA to GA4 on our reported MAUs. Because Google has publicly stated that metrics in UA may be more or less similar to metrics in GA4, and that it is not unusual for there to be apparent discrepancies between the two systems, we are unable to determine whether the transition from UA to GA4 has had a positive or negative effect, or the magnitude of such effect, if any, on our reported MAUs. It is therefore possible that MAUs that we reported based on the UA methodology for periods prior to July 1, 2023, cannot be meaningfully compared to MAUs based on the GA4 methodology in subsequent periods. Estimated Minutes Watched Per Month (""MWPM""). We use estimated MWPM as a measure of audience engagement to help us understand the volume of users engaged with our content on a monthly basis and the intensity of users’ engagement with the platform. Estimated MWPM represents the monthly average of minutes watched per user within a quarterly period, which helps us measure user engagement. Estimated MWPM is calculated by converting actual bandwidth consumption into minutes watched, using our management’s best estimate of video resolution quality mix and various encoding parameters. We continually seek to improve our best estimates based on our observations of creator and user behavior on the Rumble platform, which changes based on the introduction of new product features, including livestreaming. We are currently limited, however, in our ability to collect data from certain aspects of our systems. These limits may result in errors that are difficult to quantify, especially as the proportion of livestreaming on the Rumble platform increases over time, and as we improve the quality of various video formats by increasing bit rates. Bandwidth consumption includes video traffic across the entire Rumble platform (website, apps, embedded video, connected TV, RAC, etc.). In addition, our management believes bandwidth consumption includes a nominal amount of non-video traffic on the Rumble and Locals platforms and a potentially significant amount of consumption of Rumble videos outside of the Rumble video player and Rumble apps, due in part to intentional user circumvention of the Rumble platform that, despite our continuous efforts, we are unable to eliminate. Combined, the bandwidth consumption for this traffic may be material and difficult to quantify, resulting in an inability for us to monetize a potentially significant portion of our estimated MWPM. Hours of Uploaded Video Per Day. We use the amount of hours of uploaded video per day as a measure of content creation to help us understand the volume of content being created and uploaded to us on a daily basis. In the fourth quarter of 2023, YouTube disabled the ability of its users to utilize our tool that automatically imports videos from creators’ YouTube channels to their Rumble channels, commonly known as the “YouTube sync” tool. We provided additional information about this issue in a current report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on January 16, 2024. About Rumble Rumble is a high-growth neutral video platform and cloud services provider that is creating the rails and independent infrastructure designed to be immune to cancel culture. Rumble's mission is to restore the Internet to its roots by making it free and open once again. For more information, visit corp.rumble.com.

changes to our existing content and services could fail to attract traffic and advertisers or fail to generate revenue; we derive the majority of our revenue from advertising and the failure to attract new advertisers, the loss of existing advertisers, or the reduction of or failure by existing advertisers to maintain or increase their advertising budgets would adversely affect our business; we depend on third-party vendors, including internet service providers, advertising networks, and data centers, to provide core services; hosting and delivery costs may increase unexpectedly; we have offered and intend to continue to offer incentives, including economic incentives, to content creators to join our platform, and these arrangements may involve fixed payment obligations that are not contingent on actual revenue or performance metrics generated by the applicable content creator but rather are based on our modeled financial projections for that creator, which if not satisfied may adversely impact our financial performance, results of operations and liquidity; we may be unable to develop or maintain effective internal controls; potential diversion of management’s attention and consumption of resources as a result of acquisitions of other companies and success in integrating and otherwise achieving the benefits of recent and potential acquisitions; we may fail to maintain adequate operational and financial resources or raise additional capital or generate sufficient cash flows; we may be adversely impacted by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors;

(NASDAQ: TOI) reported financial results for Q4 2023, showing revenue growth, a capitated contract in South Florida, and an acquisition. Despite revenue growth, there was a decrease in gross profit and a net loss. TOI's CEO is optimistic about future success, with an outlook for 2024 projecting revenue of $400-415 million and adjusted EBITDA of $(8)-$(18) million. Positive TOI reported a 20.1% increase in consolidated revenue for Q4 2023 compared to the prior year quarter. The company signed a full-risk capitated contract in South Florida and acquired a pharmacy in California. TOI's CEO highlighted improved performance in Q4 2023 with expanded gross margin and reduced SG&A. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, increased by 28.4% compared to the prior year. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2023, increased by 14.4% year-over-year. TOI's outlook for 2024 projects revenue of $400-415 million and adjusted EBITDA of $(8)-$(18) million. Negative Gross profit in Q4 2023 decreased by 8.0% compared to Q4 2022. Net loss for Q4 2023 was $18.8 million compared to a net loss of $11.0 million for the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 2023 was $(6.3) million compared to $(4.6) million for the prior year quarter. TOI reported a net loss of $83.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $(25.8) million. Financial Analyst The Oncology Institute's (TOI) reported revenue increase of 20.1% in Q4 2023 compared to the prior year is a positive indicator of the company's topline growth, likely reflecting successful expansion strategies such as the acquisition of new clinics and the implementation of capitated contracts. However, the reported net loss widening from $11.0 million to $18.8 million in the same quarter is a concerning signal for profitability, suggesting that despite revenue growth, TOI is facing challenges in controlling costs or encountering significant non-operational expenses such as goodwill impairment charges.TOI's gross profit decline by 8.0% indicates potential issues with cost management, particularly with the fluctuating costs of oral and IV drugs, which are critical components in oncology care. This is an area where TOI needs to focus on achieving better economies of scale or negotiating more favorable terms with suppliers to improve margins. The SG&A reduction is a positive step towards cost control, but it's imperative to consider whether this reduction impacts the company's ability to invest in growth opportunities.The guidance for fiscal year 2024, with an anticipated Adjusted EBITDA of $(8) to $(18) million, suggests that TOI is expecting to continue operating at a loss. This projection, along with the reliance on non-GAAP measures like Adjusted EBITDA, should be approached with caution by investors, as it excludes several costs that affect the company's actual financial health. Healthcare Market Analyst TOI's recent operational highlights, including the full-risk capitated contract in South Florida, signal a strategic move towards value-based care, which is increasingly becoming a norm in the healthcare industry. This could position TOI favorably in a competitive market by aligning patient outcomes with financial incentives.The launch of a California-based pharmacy and the completion of over 1,300 specialty medication fills is an important development, as it suggests TOI's intention to integrate the pharmaceutical aspect into their care delivery model, potentially increasing patient retention and revenue per patient. However, the impact of such integration on overall cost structure and the company's ability to manage the complexities associated with pharmaceutical operations should be monitored closely.TOI's increase in revenue per capitated member is noteworthy, as it indicates improved efficiency or pricing power in their contracts. However, the Medi-Cal Rx transition affecting dispensary revenue growth is an example of how regulatory changes can impact revenue streams and TOI must continue to adapt to such changes to maintain growth. Healthcare Legal Expert TOI's remediation of a material weakness in internal controls over the review of complex accounting transactions is a critical step in ensuring financial compliance and restoring investor confidence. It's imperative for healthcare companies, especially those like TOI operating in the heavily regulated oncology sector, to maintain rigorous financial controls to prevent regulatory scrutiny and potential legal repercussions.The company's reliance on the unreasonable efforts exception for not providing a quantitative reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP measures could raise questions about transparency. While this practice is not uncommon, it is important for stakeholders to be aware of the limitations in the financial information provided and the potential impact of excluded items on the company's financial statements. 03/27/2024 - 04:05 PM CERRITOS, Calif., March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Oncology Institute, Inc. (NASDAQ: TOI) (“TOI” or the “Company”), one of the largest value-based community oncology groups in the United States, today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. Recent Operational Highlights Remediated material weakness in Internal Controls over review of Complex Accounting Transactions.Signed full-risk capitated contract in South Florida, effective January 1, 2024 and have now successfully onboarded the membership and the IPA providers.Acquired and launched our California-based pharmacy in December and have already completed over 1,300 specialty medication fills.Jeremy Castle enjoyed his first full quarter as our new Chief Operating Officer.Hired 7 new providers in the quarter and ended the year with 69 clinics and 119 employed providers. Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Highlights Consolidated revenue of $86 million, an increase of 20.1% compared to the prior year quarterGross profit of $14 million, a decrease of 8.0% compared to the prior year quarterNet loss of $18.8 million compared to net loss of $11.0 million for the prior year quarterBasic and diluted loss per share of $(0.21) and $(0.21), respectively, compared to $(0.12) and $(0.16) for the prior year quarterAdjusted EBITDA of $(6.3) million compared to $(4.6) million for the prior year quarterCash, cash equivalents, and investments of $83 million as of December 31, 2023 Management Commentary Daniel Virnich, CEO of TOI, commented, ""I am very pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter of 2023, as we delivered strong growth, expanded our gross margin and reduced SG&A. Our full-risk capitated contract in South Florida is a significant milestone for TOI and we are excited to prove our model through this partnership. Our demonstrated ability to concurrently grow topline while improving margins lays the groundwork for continued success in 2024 and beyond."" Outlook for Fiscal Year 2024 TOI uses Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP metric, as an additional tool to assess its operational performance. See ""Financial Information: Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below. In reliance on the unreasonable efforts exception provided under Regulation S-K, TOI is not reasonably able to provide a quantitative reconciliation for forward-looking information of Adjusted EBITDA to net (loss) income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, without unreasonable efforts due to uncertainties regarding taxes, share-based compensation, goodwill impairment charges, change in fair value of liabilities, unrealized (gains) losses on investments, practice acquisition-related costs, consulting and legal fees, transaction costs and other non-cash items. The variability of these items could have an unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on TOI’s future GAAP financial results. TOI expects interest expense in the range of $4 million to $5 million, other adjustment add backs in the range of $2 million to $4 million, and depreciation and amortization in the range of $4 million to $6 million. 2024 GuidanceRevenue$400 to $415 millionGross Profit$68 to $79 millionAdjusted EBITDA$(8) to $(18) million TOI's achievement of the anticipated results is subject to risks and uncertainties, including those disclosed in its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The outlook does not take into account the impact of any unanticipated developments in the business or changes in the operating environment, nor does it take into account the impact of TOI's acquisitions, dispositions or financings. TOI's outlook assumes a largely reopened global market, which would be negatively impacted if closures or other restrictive measures persist or are reimplemented. Fourth Quarter 2023 Results Consolidated revenue for Q4 2023 was $86 million, an increase of 20.1% compared to Q4 2022, and a 4.6% increase compared to Q3 2023. Revenue for patient services was $56 million, up 17.0% compared to Q4 2022. Growth in patient services revenue was driven by an increase in capitated contracts entered into during 2023 and in the latter half of 2022 as well as growth in fee-for-service (""FFS"") revenue due to practice acquisitions and an overall increase in clinic count. Dispensary revenue increased 27.8% compared to Q4 2022 due to an increase in the number of filled prescriptions and an increase in the average revenue per filled prescription. Clinical trials & other revenue increased by 10.1% compared to Q4 2022 primarily due to an increase in Proposition 56 revenue and TOI Clinical Research revenue. Gross profit in Q4 2023 was $14 million, a decrease of 8.0% compared to Q4 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by ongoing cost management fluctuations of oral and IV drugs. Gross profit is calculated by subtracting direct costs of patient services, dispensary, and clinical trials and other from consolidated revenues. Selling, general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses in Q4 2023 were $28 million or 32.7% of revenue, compared with $30 million, or 41.4% of revenue, in Q4 2022 During Q4 2023, share-based compensation expense was $4 million. The decrease in SG&A expenses was due to restructuring in early 2023 and reduced overhead during the year. Net loss for Q4 2023 was $18.8 million, a decrease of $7.7 million compared to Q4 2022 primarily due to an increase in operating revenue and decrease in SG&A expenses, offset by a decreased change in fair value of derivative liabilities and the goodwill impairment charge. Adjusted EBITDA was $(6.3) million, an increase of $1.6 million compared to Q4 2022, primarily as a result of a decrease in share-based compensation and change in fair value of liabilities, offset by the goodwill impairment charge in Q4 2022. Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2023 Consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $324 million, an increase of 28.4% compared to the prior year. Revenue for patient services was $214 million, an increase of 28.0% year-over-year. Growth in patient services revenue was primarily driven by an increase in capitated contracts entered into during the year ended December 31, 2023 and in the latter half of 2022 as well as growth in revenue from fee-for-service contracts due to practice acquisitions and an overall increase in clinic count. Dispensary revenue growth lagged the growth in revenue from patient services largely due to the Medi-Cal Rx transition. Despite the Medi-Cal Rx transition, dispensary revenue increased 30.9% compared to the comparable prior year period due to an increase in the average revenue per filled prescription. Clinical trials & other revenue increased by 8.6% compared to the prior year period due to an increase in miscellaneous contract revenue. Revenue per capitated member was $39.5 PMPY (per member per year) at December 31, 2023, an increase of 10.5% compared to the prior year. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $60 million, an increase of 14.4% year-over-year. The increase was driven by improved cost management of our oral and IV drugs and enhanced rebate opportunities. SG&A expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, for year ended December 31, 2023 were $114 million or 35.1% of revenue, compared with $120 million, or 47.4% of revenue, in the prior year. During 2023, share-based compensation expense was $18 million and SG&A related to transaction costs was $141 thousand. SG&A decline was primarily due to our restructuring in early 2023 and re-alignment of our vendors. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $83.1 million, a decrease of $83.2 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to the increase in gross profit and the change in the fair value of the warrant, earnout and conversion option derivative liabilities, offset by the goodwill impairment charge and increased operating expenses. Adjusted EBITDA was $(25.8) million, an increase of $2.3 million compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of the change in fair value of the warrant, earnout and conversion option derivative liabilities.

Financial Information; Non-GAAP Financial Measures Some of the financial information and data contained in this press release, such as Adjusted EBITDA and revenue per capitated member, have not been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). TOI’s non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Because of the limitations of non-GAAP financial measures, you should consider the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release in conjunction with TOI’s financial statements and the related notes thereto. TOI believes that the use of Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool to assess operational and results of our performance, to plan and forecast future periods, and factors and trends in, and in comparing our financial measures with, other similar companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. The principal limitation of Adjusted EBITDA is that it excludes significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in TOI's financial statements. TOI defines Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income plus depreciation, amortization, interest, taxes, non-cash items, share-based compensation, goodwill impairment charges, change in fair value of liabilities, unrealized gains or losses on investments and other adjustments to add-back the following: consulting and legal fees related to acquisitions, one-time consulting and legal fees related to certain advisory projects, software implementations and debt or equity financings, severance expense and temporary labor and recruiting charges to build out our corporate infrastructure. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most comparable GAAP metric, is set forth below.

TOI defines revenue per capitated member as capitated revenue divided by lives under value-based contracts. TOI believes that use of revenue per capitated member is an appropriate measure of individual value-based contract economics as our business takes on adjacent specialty risk and establishes more Medicare Advantage only contracts outside of California. This will provide a clearer picture of the impact of incremental contracts signed and growth across markets and to provide more clarity to analysts and shareholders.

The study demonstrated safety and pharmacokinetics of denifanstat in subjects with hepatic impairment, with positive results supporting the planned Phase 3 program. Positive Successful completion of Phase 1 hepatic impairment study for denifanstat 38 subjects enrolled in the study, including different categories of hepatic impairment Denifanstat well-tolerated with no reported safety signals Pharmacokinetic results expected to support Phase 3 program for denifanstat in MASH Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The completion of the Phase 1 hepatic impairment study by Sagimet Biosciences for their drug denifanstat is a significant milestone in the drug development process. Denifanstat's potential to treat metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a condition that currently has few effective treatments, is of particular interest. The successful assessment of the drug in patients with varying degrees of liver impairment is essential, as liver function can significantly affect drug metabolism and safety profiles.From a research perspective, the absence of safety signals in this early phase is promising. However, the real test of the drug's efficacy and safety will come in later stage trials. The pharmacokinetics data will be important for determining appropriate dosing for patients with different levels of hepatic function. It's important to note that Phase 1 studies are primarily focused on safety and while positive, they do not guarantee success in later phases that assess efficacy more rigorously.For stakeholders, the progression to Phase 3 trials could mean a significant increase in investment into the company as it moves closer to potential commercialization. However, they should be aware of the risks inherent in drug development, particularly in the competitive field of metabolic diseases, where many drugs fail to make it to market. Healthcare Economist Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis represents a growing healthcare concern, correlating with the rising prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes. The economic implications of introducing a new treatment option like denifanstat could be substantial. Currently, the cost burden of MASH on the healthcare system is significant, due to the lack of targeted therapies and the potential progression to cirrhosis or liver cancer.If denifanstat proves to be effective, it could reduce long-term healthcare costs by preventing disease progression and the need for more expensive interventions, like liver transplants. Moreover, the development of treatments for MASH is likely to attract attention from healthcare providers and payers looking to manage this costly condition more effectively.On the other hand, the high costs associated with bringing a new drug to market could lead to a high price tag for denifanstat, which might affect its adoption and reimbursement by insurance companies. Payers will closely scrutinize its cost-effectiveness compared to existing treatments and the overall impact on healthcare expenditure. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The announcement regarding denifanstat's Phase 1 study completion is a key indicator of Sagimet Biosciences' potential trajectory in the pharmaceutical market. The market for MASH treatments is relatively untapped, providing ample opportunity for first-movers like Sagimet. Investors should monitor the development of denifanstat closely, as a successful Phase 3 trial could position the company as a leader in this niche market.It is important to consider the competitive landscape, as other companies are also aiming to capitalize on the demand for effective MASH therapies. The timing of denifanstat's entry into the market, pending regulatory approval, could be a decisive factor in its market share capture. Additionally, strategic partnerships or licensing agreements could be beneficial in scaling production and distribution capabilities to meet global demand.Investors should also be mindful of the volatility of biotech stocks, which are highly sensitive to clinical trial outcomes and regulatory news. While the completion of the Phase 1 study is a positive development, the long-term success of Sagimet Biosciences hinges on the outcomes of future trials and the eventual market acceptance of denifanstat. 03/27/2024 - 04:01 PM SAN MATEO, Calif., March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sagimet Biosciences Inc. (Sagimet, Nasdaq: SGMT), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel fatty acid synthase (FASN) inhibitors designed to target dysfunctional metabolic and fibrotic pathways, today announced the completion of a Phase 1 hepatic impairment study with denifanstat, a selective FASN inhibitor in development for the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). This study was designed to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of denifanstat in subjects with hepatic impairment, a typical requirement of development programs in MASH. A total of 38 subjects were enrolled and completed this non-randomized, parallel group study. The study population included 8 subjects in each category of mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment, and 14 healthy subjects with normal hepatic function demographically matched to the subjects with hepatic impairment for age, body weight, and gender. All subjects received oral denifanstat 50 mg once a day for 4 days. Denifanstat was well-tolerated and no safety signals were reported. The pharmacokinetic results from this study are anticipated to support the planned Phase 3 program for denifanstat in MASH. About Sagimet Biosciences Sagimet is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel fatty acid synthase (FASN) inhibitors that are designed to target dysfunctional metabolic pathways in diseases resulting from the overproduction of the fatty acid, palmitate. Sagimet’s lead drug candidate, denifanstat, is an oral, once-daily pill and selective FASN inhibitor in development for the treatment of MASH. FASCINATE-2, a Phase 2b clinical trial of denifanstat in MASH with liver biopsy-based primary endpoints, was successfully completed with positive results. For additional information about Sagimet, please visit www.sagimet.com. About MASH MASH is a progressive and severe liver disease which is estimated to impact more than 115 million people worldwide, for which there is only one recently approved treatment in the United States and no currently approved treatments in Europe. In 2023, global liver disease medical societies and patient groups formalized the decision to rename non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Additionally, an overarching term, steatotic liver disease (SLD), was established to capture multiple types of liver diseases associated with fat buildup in the liver. The goal of the name change was to establish an affirmative, non-stigmatizing name and diagnosis.

"Applied UV, Inc.

The offering includes the sale of Common Stock, Pre-Funded Warrants, and Common Warrants.","Applied UV, Inc. Announces Pricing of $2.76 Million Registered Direct and Private Placement Priced at the Market Under Nasdaq Rules Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Applied UV, Inc. announces agreements with institutional investors for a direct offering, expecting $2.76 million in gross proceeds. The offering includes the sale of Common Stock, Pre-Funded Warrants, and Common Warrants. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Applied UV's move to raise capital through a combination of direct stock sales and warrants is a strategic decision to bolster its financial position. The immediate cash infusion of approximately $2.76 million, while not substantial for a large corporation, could be significant for Applied UV, depending on its operational burn rate and investment needs. Investors should note that the public offering price of $1.60 per share represents the current market valuation of the company's confidence in its growth prospects.However, the issuance of pre-funded warrants and common warrants could lead to potential dilution of existing shareholders' equity. The initial exercise price of $16.00 per share for the common warrants is a notable premium over the public offering price, which might indicate management's optimism about the company's future performance or a strategic pricing mechanism to minimize immediate dilution and incentivize long-term holding.Stakeholders should closely monitor the deployment of the raised funds. The company's ability to leverage this capital into meaningful growth initiatives or technological advancements in smart building solutions will be critical to its future success and stock performance. The timing and effectiveness of these strategies in a competitive market will be key factors in evaluating the long-term impact of this financial maneuver. Market Research Analyst Applied UV operates in the smart building technology sector, a domain experiencing an uptick in demand due to increased focus on energy efficiency and intelligent infrastructure integration. The capital raised could enable Applied UV to invest in research and development, expand its product offerings, or enhance its market penetration.It is also important to understand the investor sentiment towards such offerings. The offering's success and the subsequent performance of the stock will hinge on institutional and retail investors' perception of the company's growth trajectory and the smart building industry's potential. While the immediate effect on the stock price might be a concern due to dilution, long-term investors might view this as an opportunity if they believe in the company's value proposition and market opportunity.Moreover, the terms of the warrants, especially the exercise price, will be closely scrutinized. If the stock fails to reach the exercise price within the stipulated period, it could reflect poorly on the company's ability to meet market expectations, potentially impacting investor confidence. Legal Expert The structure of the offering, combining both registered direct offerings and private placements, is designed to comply with securities regulations while providing the company with flexibility in raising capital. The registration of the direct offering ensures transparency for investors, while the private placement of warrants allows for additional funding mechanisms without immediate dilution.Investors should be aware of the legal ramifications of the pre-funded warrants and common warrants. The terms of these instruments, including the exercise period and price, are bound by contractual obligations and securities law. It is important for investors to understand the rights, restrictions and expiration associated with these financial instruments to make informed decisions.Furthermore, the closing of these transactions is likely contingent on customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. Any delays or failure to meet these conditions could affect the company's capital raising plans and consequently, its strategic initiatives. 03/27/2024 - 02:35 PM NEW YORK, NY, March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NewMediaWire -- Applied UV, Inc. (NASDAQ: AUVI; AUVIP) (“Applied UV” or the “Company”), a leader in smart building technology solutions, today announced that it has entered into definitive agreements with institutional investors for the purchase and sale of common stock of the Company (“Common Stock”) and pre-funded warrants (“Pre-Funded Warrants”) in a registered direct offering. In a concurrent private placement, the Company also agreed to sell to the same investors, common warrants (“Common Warrants”). Aggregate gross proceeds to the Company from both transactions are expected to be approximately $2.76 million, the maximum availability under the effective shelf registration statement. The transactions consist of (i) the public sale of an aggregate of 1,726,875 shares of Common Stock (or Pre-Funded Warrants in lieu thereof) and (ii) the private placement of Common Warrants to purchase up to 518,065 shares of Common Stock at an initial exercise price of $16.00 per share. The public offering price per share of Common Stock is $1.60 (or $1.5999 for each Pre-Funded Warrant, which is equal to the public offering price per share of Common Stock to be sold in the offering minus an exercise price of $0.0001 per Pre-Funded Warrant). The Pre-Funded Warrants will be immediately exercisable and may be exercised at any time until exercised in full. For each Pre-Funded Warrant sold in the offering, the number of shares of Common Stock in the offering will be decreased on a one-for-one basis. The Common Warrants are exercisable immediately subject to registration and expire 5 years after the initial issuance date. The transactions are expected to close on or about April 1, 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The Company expects to use the net proceeds from the offering to help fund recent large orders within the Smart Building Technologies division from customers including: Siemens, Sherwin Williams and Arco Murray and other general corporate purposes. Aegis Capital Corp. is acting as the exclusive placement agent for the offerings. Sichenzia Ross Ference Carmel LLP is serving as counsel to the Company for the offerings. Kaufman & Canoles, P.C. is serving as counsel to the Placement Agent for the offerings. The registered direct offering is being made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-266015) previously filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and declared effective by the SEC on July 12, 2022.

The offer and sale of the Common Warrants in the private placement are being made in a transaction not involving a public offering and have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or applicable state securities laws. Accordingly, the Common Warrants may not be reoffered or resold in the United States except pursuant to an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and such applicable state securities laws.

Announces Proposed Public Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Praxis Precision Medicines, Inc. (NASDAQ: PRAX) announced a proposed public offering of common stock and prefunded warrants to certain investors. The offering, managed by Piper Sandler, Guggenheim Securities, and Truist Securities, includes an option for underwriters to purchase additional shares. The offering is subject to market conditions and regulatory approvals. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Praxis Precision Medicines of a proposed public offering, including both common stock and prefunded warrants, is a significant event that warrants an evaluation of its potential impact on the company's financial health and market valuation. This type of offering is often undertaken by companies seeking to raise capital to fund operations, research and development, or to pay off existing debts. In the case of Praxis, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on CNS disorders, the infusion of funds could accelerate their research pipeline and potentially bring therapies to market more quickly.However, investors should be aware of the dilutive effect of such offerings, where the introduction of additional shares could lead to a decrease in existing shareholders' equity. The market's reception to this news can vary; a positive response could indicate investor confidence in the company's future, while a negative reaction could reflect concerns over dilution or the company's need for additional capital. The involvement of established financial institutions as book-runners and managers may lend credibility to the offering, but the final terms disclosed in the final prospectus supplement will be critical in assessing the offering's attractiveness. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Praxis' decision to engage in a public offering is a strategic move that can be influenced by several external factors, such as market conditions and investor sentiment towards the biopharmaceutical sector. The timing of the offering, in relation to market performance and sector-specific trends, can significantly affect the success of the capital raise. For instance, a bullish market or positive news within the CNS therapeutic area could enhance the offering's success.Additionally, the 30-day option for underwriters to purchase additional shares up to 15% of the offering provides a buffer that could help stabilize the stock price post-offering. It is also indicative of the underwriters' confidence in the offering's potential success. The market will closely monitor the uptake of this option as an indicator of institutional confidence in Praxis' growth trajectory and the underlying value of its research portfolio. Biotech Industry Analyst The realm of central nervous system disorders presents a challenging yet highly rewarding space for biopharmaceutical companies like Praxis Precision Medicines. The company's focus on translating genetic insights into therapies is a cutting-edge approach that aligns with current industry trends towards personalized medicine. The funds raised through this offering could significantly bolster Praxis' position within the biotech industry, allowing for the advancement of their pipeline products through clinical trials, which is a critical step towards FDA approval and commercialization.Investors should consider the high-risk, high-reward nature of the biotech sector, where the development timeline can be protracted and uncertain. The success of Praxis' therapies in clinical trials will be a major determinant of the company's future revenue and growth potential. Therefore, the proposed offering could be seen as an investment into the company's long-term strategic development rather than immediate financial gain. 03/27/2024 - 04:01 PM BOSTON, March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Praxis Precision Medicines, Inc. (NASDAQ: PRAX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company translating genetic insights into the development of therapies for central nervous system (CNS) disorders characterized by neuronal excitation-inhibition imbalance, today announced a proposed public offering of its common stock and, in lieu of common stock to certain investors, prefunded warrants to purchase shares of common stock.

Piper Sandler, Guggenheim Securities and Truist Securities are acting as joint book-running managers for the offering. H.C.

Partnering discussions for alvelestat are advancing, with cash of $57.4 million as of December 31, 2023, expected to fund operations until 2026. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Reviewing Mereo BioPharma Group plc's financial results and forward-looking statements, several key takeaways emerge. The company's cash position of $57.4 million at the end of 2023 is robust, suggesting a strong runway that extends funding into 2026. This is critical for investors as it indicates the company does not require immediate financing, which could dilute current shareholders or introduce debt. The net loss reduction from $42.2 million in 2022 to $29.5 million in 2023 reflects tighter control over expenses and a potentially more efficient use of resources.The revenue of $10.0 million, including milestone payments from partnerships, is a positive indicator of the company's ability to monetize its assets. However, investors should be aware that milestone payments can be intermittent and are not a guarantee of future revenue. The decrease in R&D and G&A expenses could be interpreted as a prudent cost management strategy, but it's essential to consider whether these reductions could impact the company's long-term growth potential.Investors should also note the potential future payments tied to clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones, which could provide additional cash flow if achieved. However, the reliance on milestones and partnerships for such payments introduces a degree of uncertainty and risk. The market opportunity for setrusumab, targeting a patient population with unmet medical needs and the progress of alvelestat, with its potential as the first oral therapy for AATD-LD, are promising but hinge on successful clinical outcomes and regulatory approvals. Medical Research Analyst The completion of enrollment for the Phase 2/3 Orbit Study and Phase 3 Cosmic Study of setrusumab in Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) represents a significant step forward for Mereo BioPharma. The 67% reduction in annualized fracture rate from the Phase 2 portion of the Orbit study is a strong indicator of setrusumab's potential efficacy. The focus on pediatric and adult populations in the EU's largest markets underscores the strategic targeting of a specific demographic with a significant unmet need.For alvelestat, the alignment with the FDA on a Phase 3 study design using the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) as a primary endpoint is a positive regulatory development. This patient-reported outcome measure is critical for assessing the drug's impact on quality of life, a key consideration in treatment for chronic conditions like Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency-associated Lung Disease (AATD-LD).The potential use of lung density measured by CT scan as a primary endpoint for European regulatory approval is also notable. It reflects a tailored approach to different regulatory environments and suggests a strategic understanding of the nuances in achieving approval across markets. The indication that a p value of <0.1 may be sufficient for full approval in Europe could signal a lower regulatory hurdle, but it also suggests that robust clinical evidence will be important to convincing regulators and payers of the drug's value. Market Research Analyst Mereo's strategic focus on pre-launch activities, such as patient identification and understanding the patient journey in key European markets, indicates a proactive approach to market access. The use of real-world evidence, like Project SATURN, to understand OI's baseline disease state and the potential impact of setrusumab treatment, is a forward-thinking strategy that could facilitate payer negotiations.The company's anticipation of significant commercial opportunities for setrusumab in OI, based on identified patient populations in Europe, is promising. However, the success of these opportunities will largely depend on the outcomes of ongoing clinical studies and the ability to secure favorable pricing and reimbursement conditions.The active engagement with potential partners for the development and commercialization of alvelestat, along with the aim to initiate a Phase 3 study by the end of 2024, demonstrates a strategic approach to risk-sharing and capitalizing on external expertise. The collaboration with Ultragenyx for the global development of setrusumab is another example of leveraging partnerships to mitigate development risks and extend the company's market reach. 03/27/2024 - 04:01 PM Phase 2/3 Orbit Study and Phase 3 Cosmic Study of setrusumab in Osteogenesis Imperfecta expected to complete enrollment around the end of first quarter and in the first half of 2024, respectively Partnering discussions for alvelestat progressing with plans to initiate Phase 3 with a partner around the end of 2024 Cash of $57.4 million as of December 31, 2023 expected to fund operations into 2026 LONDON, March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mereo BioPharma Group plc (NASDAQ: MREO) (“Mereo” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on rare diseases, today announced its financial results for the full year ended December 31, 2023, and provided an update on recent corporate highlights. “We reached a number of important milestones in 2023, which have set the stage for a potentially transformative 2024,” said Dr. Denise Scots-Knight, Chief Executive Officer of Mereo. “Both Orbit and Cosmic, the two Phase 3 studies of setrusumab in Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) being conducted by our partner Ultragenyx, are on-track to complete enrollment shortly. Our pre-launch activities are continuing to progress well. We have gained a solid understanding of the patient journey and pathways to market in the five key European markets, as well as a clear understanding of OI epidemiology in pediatrics and adults. We continue to believe that the European market for setrusumab in OI represents a significant opportunity.” Dr. Scots-Knight continued, “In addition, with the clear regulatory guidance from the FDA and the EMA for alvelestat in Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency-associated Lung Disease (AATD-LD), we are continuing our partnering discussions in parallel with all the preparatory work needed to initiate the Phase 3 global pivotal study with a partner by the end of the year. Alvelestat has the potential to become the first approved oral therapy for the treatment of AATD-LD and potentially the first to demonstrate positive clinical outcomes, especially in earlier stage patients. We maintained a strong cash position through prudent financial management and believe that Mereo remains well positioned to deliver on multiple inflection points in the year ahead.” 2023 Highlights, Recent Developments and 2024 Anticipated Milestones Setrusumab (UX143) Continued enrollment in two global studies, Orbit (Phase 2/3) and Cosmic (Phase 3), of setrusumab in OI patients, conducted by our partner Ultragenyx. The Phase 3 portion of the Orbit Phase 2/3 trial was initiated in mid-2023 and the study is expected to be fully enrolled around the end of the first quarter of 2024. The pivotal study will include approximately 150 patients aged 5 to <26 years randomized 2:1 to receive setrusumab or placebo, with a primary efficacy endpoint of annualized clinical fracture rate.Cosmic was initiated in the second half of 2023 and is anticipated to be fully enrolled in the first half of 2024. Cosmic is a Phase 3 open-label, randomized study in approximately 60 patients aged 2 to <7 years evaluating setrusumab compared to bisphosphonates on reduction in total annualized clinical fracture rate. In October 2023, data from the Phase 2 portion of the Phase 2/3 Orbit study showed that setrusumab treatment reduced the annualized fracture rate by 67% in patients with OI who had been treated for at least 6 months. This reduction was associated with improvements in bone mineral density (BMD). Setrusumab was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events or drug-related hypersensitivity reported. Additional data from the Phase 2 portion of the Orbit study are expected in the second half of 2024.The Company continues to invest in pre-launch activities and other studies to generate further evidence that will inform coverage, pricing and reimbursement decisions in the EU and the UK. These include patient identification in the key European markets, interrogation of the data from IMPACT, the largest ever burden of disease survey on the impact of OI on people, their caregivers and physicians, and Project SATURN, an interrogation of existing registries in European centers of excellence, to provide a baseline of disease for OI in the current population and downstream real world evidence on the effect of treatment with setrusumab.The Company continues to build a compelling evidence base to support productive pricing and reimbursement discussions in the EU and the UK based on rolling interactions with the HTA and payor decision-makers.To-date, the Company has identified 5,000 pediatric patients and 5,000 adult patients across the five largest European markets (Germany, Italy, Spain, France and the UK) and continues to believe that the European market for setrusumab in OI represents a significant commercial opportunity based on the size of the patient population and magnitude of unmet medical need. Alvelestat (MPH-966) Following extensive discussions with the Division of Pulmonology, Allergy and Critical Care (DPACC) and the Division of Clinical Outcome Assessment (DCOA) of the FDA throughout 2023, the Company has aligned on a Phase 3 study design using a patient-reported outcome (PRO) tool, the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) Total Score, as the primary efficacy endpoint, with a functional assessment as a key secondary endpoint, in the upcoming Phase 3 trial of alvelestat in AATD-lung disease.Mereo plans to submit the initial validation work supporting the use of SGRQ-Total Score in the AATD population, as the primary efficacy endpoint in the study alongside the detailed study protocol, to the FDA in the first half of 2024.In Europe, the Company will use lung density measured by CT scan as the primary endpoint for potential regulatory approval. The European Medicines Agency has indicated that a p value of <0.1 may be sufficient for full regulatory approval if the study is successful.The global Phase 3 study is expected to enroll approximately 220 early- and late-stage patients with the severe Pi*ZZ genotype and confirmed emphysema, with a treatment period of 18 months. If the Phase 3 trial is successful, it is expected to support full approvals of alvelestat in the US and Europe.The planned Phase 3 study design is supported by positive results from the ATALANTa and ASTRAEUS studies, including those with early-stage disease who may not qualify for the current standard of care nor for participation in clinical trials of other investigational therapies.Mereo continues to actively engage with multiple potential partners for the development and commercialization of alvelestat and aims to initiate the Phase 3 study with a partner around the end of 2024. Etigilimab (MPH-313) Etigilimab in combination with nivolumab, is being studied in an ongoing investigator-led single-arm, two-stage, open-label Phase 1b/2 trial in a subtype of platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer (clear cell ovarian cancer) at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, financed by the Cancer Focus Fund. Based on the results to-date, the study has been expanded from the initial 10 patients to 20 patients and an update may be provided by the investigator in the second half of 2024 or early 2025. Leflutrozole In December 2023, the Company entered into an exclusive global license agreement with ReproNovo SA for the development and commercialization of leflutrozole, a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor. Under the terms of the License Agreement, ReproNovo, a reproductive medicine company, is responsible for all future development and commercialization of leflutrozole. Mereo received an upfront payment and will be eligible to receive up to $64.25 million in future clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones as well as tiered mid-single digit royalties on global annual net sales of leflutrozole. Navicixizumab In the fourth quarter of 2023, Feng Biosciences, Inc. completed a restructuring and recapitalization and closed on a refinancing. Feng Biosciences is a clinical stage therapeutics company advancing precision medicine for people with cancer. The company will continue to utilize its XernaTM platform to progress navicixizumab. For additional information on navicixizumab and our partner, please refer to the discussions on pages 1 and 13 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K.Under the global licensing agreement with Feng Biosciences, Mereo is eligible to receive up to $300 million in future clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones, and tiered sales royalties. Full Year 2023 Financial Results Effective January 1, 2024, the Company began complying with and reporting under the SEC rules and Nasdaq listing requirements applicable to U.S. domestic filers. Accordingly, the full year 2023 financial results are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) and in U.S. dollars. Revenue of $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, comprised a one-time milestone payment upon dosing of the first patient in the Phase 3 portion of the Orbit study in patients aged 5 to under 26 in accordance with the collaboration and license agreement with Ultragenyx and a $1.0 million up-front payment from the global license agreement with ReproNovo for the development and commercialization of leflutrozole. Cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $2.6 million, representing amounts payable pursuant to our 2015 agreement with Novartis, under which the Company pays a percentage of proceeds resulting from milestone revenue received, subject to certain deductions. Total research and development expenses decreased by $12.0 million, or 41%, from $29.5 million in 2022 to $17.4 million in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a $12.4 million reduction in R&D expenses for etigilimab, partially offset by an increase of $0.7 million in expenses for setrusumab. The reduction in etigilimab expenses was primarily due to the winding down and completion of the open label Phase 1b/2 basket study in combination with an anti-PD-1 in a range of tumor types. Program expenses for setrusumab are in relation to ongoing activities in Europe, and input into development, regulatory and manufacturing plans with our partner, Ultragenyx, as the global development of the program is funded by Ultragenyx pursuant to our license and collaboration agreement. Program expenses for alvelestat primarily include the preparatory work for the Phase 3 study, including CMC and drug formulation activities, SGRQ validation activities and regulatory interactions. General and administrative expenses decreased by $7.7 million, or 29%, from $26.1 million in 2022 to $18.4 million in 2023. The decrease is primarily related to overall reductions in staff costs, professional fees and corporate costs of $7.1 million, in addition to $3.6 million received from our depositary to reimburse certain expenses incurred by us in respect of our ADR program in the current and prior years and $2.0 million received under a claim on our Directors and Officers insurance policy to reimburse us for certain legal and professional costs incurred in prior years. General and administrative expenses included $2.7 million in 2023 (2022: $2.6 million) related to pre-commercial activities, including those to support pricing and reimbursement by HTA authorities and payor decision-makers in Europe. Net loss for the full year ended December 31, 2023 was $29.5 million, compared to $42.2 million during the comparable period in 2022, primarily reflecting an operating loss of $28.4 million. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $57.4 million. Net cash burn during the fourth quarter of 2023 amounted to $6.7 million. The Company’s guidance remains unchanged, and it continues to expect, based on current operational plans, that its existing cash and cash equivalents balance will enable it to fund its currently committed clinical trials, operating expenses, and capital expenditure requirements into 2026. This guidance does not include any potential upfront payments associated with a partnership for alvelestat or business development activity around any of the Company’s non-core programs. Total ordinary shares issued as of December 31, 2023 were 701,217,089. Total ADS equivalents as of December 31, 2023 were 140,243,417, with each ADS representing five ordinary shares of the Company.

Capital Southwest Receives Affirmed Investment Grade Rating from Fitch Ratings,2024-03-27T20:01:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Fitch affirms Capital Southwest 's BBB- long-term issuer rating with a stable outlook. The rating is supported by factors like first lien senior focus, improving portfolio diversification, strong asset coverage, consistent performance, and funding flexibility.","Capital Southwest Receives Affirmed Investment Grade Rating from Fitch Ratings Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Fitch affirms Capital Southwest 's BBB- long-term issuer rating with a stable outlook. The rating is supported by factors like first lien senior focus, improving portfolio diversification, strong asset coverage, consistent performance, and funding flexibility. Positive None. Negative None. Credit Analyst The affirmation of Capital Southwest's BBB- long-term issuer rating by Fitch Ratings is a significant indicator of the company's creditworthiness. This rating, being on the lower end of investment grade, suggests that the company maintains a sufficient level of stability and low default risk, which is paramount for investors and creditors seeking reliable returns. The emphasis on first lien senior focus in the portfolio enhances the security for debt holders, as these are typically the first to be repaid in the event of a bankruptcy or liquidation, thereby reducing credit risk.Moreover, the improving portfolio diversification is a positive sign that the company is actively managing risk by not over-concentrating in any single investment or sector. This strategy can provide resilience against market volatility. The above-average asset coverage cushion further indicates that the company has more assets than legally required to cover its debt, which provides an additional layer of protection for debt investors. A consistent operating performance and strong funding flexibility are key for sustaining growth and meeting financial obligations. Access to public debt and equity markets implies that the company can raise capital efficiently, which is important for a business development company that relies on external financing to support its investment activities. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the stable outlook awarded by Fitch can be interpreted as a signal that Capital Southwest is expected to maintain its current credit profile in the medium term. This can influence investor sentiment by providing a degree of assurance regarding the company's financial health. For a business development company like Capital Southwest, which relies heavily on market perceptions to secure funding, such stability is valuable.Investors might also interpret the diversified investment portfolio and the balance between first lien debt and equity investments as an indicator of strategic asset allocation aimed at optimizing returns while managing risk. This balance is essential for long-term sustainability and can affect the company's ability to attract further investments. The market will also note the company's ability to generate core earnings consistently, as this reflects its operational efficiency and potential to provide steady returns. These factors combined could contribute to a positive perception among investors and analysts, potentially impacting the company's stock performance and market valuation. 03/27/2024 - 04:01 PM Fitch affirms BBB- long-term issuer rating with a stable outlookDALLAS, March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Capital Southwest Corporation (“Capital Southwest”) (Nasdaq: CSWC), an internally managed business development company focused on providing flexible financing solutions to support the acquisition and growth of middle market businesses, today announced that Fitch Ratings, Inc.

Erasca has a strong balance sheet with $322 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of December 31, 2023. Erasca's R&D update conference call and webcast are scheduled for March 28, 2024, at 8:30 am ET. Positive Erasca reached significant clinical and regulatory milestones in 2023, including gaining regulatory clarity for a global Phase 3 study for naporafenib and achieving Fast Track Designation for naporafenib in combination with trametinib, and ERAS-801. The company presented promising preliminary clinical activity for ERAS-007 at ASCO 2023 and advanced ERAS-801 for further characterization in patients with EGFR-amplified recurrent glioblastoma. Key catalysts for 2024 include the ongoing SEACRAFT-1 trial for naporafenib and the expected initiation of the SEACRAFT-2 trial for NRAS-mutant melanoma. A pooled analysis of mOS data for naporafenib plus trametinib in patients with NRASm melanoma showed significant improvement compared to historical benchmarks. Erasca was granted Fast Track Designation for naporafenib and entered into CTCSAs with Novartis for the naporafenib combination in SEACRAFT-1 and SEACRAFT-2 trials. Financially, Erasca reported a cash position of $322 million as of December 31, 2023, with R&D expenses decreasing and a net loss of $29.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. Negative The decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities from $435.6 million as of December 31, 2022, to $322 million as of December 31, 2023. A net loss of $29.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, and $125.0 million for the full year ended December 31, 2023, compared to a net loss of $135.3 million and $242.8 million for the same periods in 2022, respectively. Oncology Doctor An Oncology Doctor would note the progress in clinical trials for therapies targeting the RAS/MAPK pathway-driven cancers as a significant advancement. The mention of Fast Track Designation (FTD) for naporafenib in combination with trametinib is a positive sign, indicating the FDA's recognition of the potential benefit to patients and a possible expedited review process. The therapeutic potential of ERAS-007 and ERAS-801 in specific cancer subtypes, such as BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer and EGFR-amplified recurrent glioblastoma, highlights the company's focus on precision medicine, which could lead to better patient outcomes and a competitive edge in the oncology market. Financial Analyst From a Financial Analyst's perspective, the robust balance sheet with $322 million in cash reserves as of December 31, 2023, provides Erasca with a significant runway to fund ongoing trials and R&D efforts. The decrease in R&D expenses year-over-year suggests effective cost management, while the partnership with Novartis, which includes the provision of trametinib at no cost, could reduce future R&D expenses. The median overall survival (mOS) data for naporafenib plus trametinib showing approximately 13-14 months compared to historical controls is promising and could impact the company's valuation positively if the data leads to successful commercialization. Market Research Analyst A Market Research Analyst would focus on the competitive landscape and market potential of the therapies in question. Given the high prevalence of cancers such as melanoma and glioblastoma, the successful development and approval of naporafenib, ERAS-007 and ERAS-801 could capture a significant market share. The analyst would evaluate the historical benchmarks of current treatments and the potential market disruption that Erasca's pipeline could introduce, especially considering the unmet medical needs in these indications. 03/27/2024 - 04:01 PM Gained global registrational clarity for naporafenib and achieved key clinical milestones for naporafenib, ERAS-007, and ERAS-801 Multiple data readouts expected in 2024 for naporafenib (SEACRAFT-1), ERAS-007 (HERKULES-3), and ERAS-801 (THUNDERBBOLT-1) and planned initiation of pivotal SEACRAFT-2 trial Robust balance sheet with cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $322 million as of December 31, 2023 Erasca to host R&D update conference call and webcast Thursday, March 28, 2024 at 8:30 am ET SAN DIEGO, March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Erasca, Inc. (Nasdaq: ERAS), a clinical-stage precision oncology company singularly focused on discovering, developing, and commercializing therapies for patients with RAS/MAPK pathway-driven cancers, today provided business updates and reported financial results for the fiscal quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. “In 2023, our three clinical candidates reached important clinical and regulatory milestones, including gaining regulatory clarity to allow us to begin our global Phase 3 study for naporafenib, demonstrating encouraging therapeutic potential for ERAS-007, and achieving Fast Track Designation (FTD) for each of naporafenib in combination with trametinib, and ERAS-801,” said Jonathan E. Lim, M.D., Erasca’s chairman, CEO, and co-founder. “For ERAS-007, we presented promising preliminary clinical activity at ASCO 2023 in combination with encorafenib and cetuximab (EC) in EC-naïve patients with BRAF-mutant (BRAFm) colorectal cancer (CRC), and we expect to share additional data in the first half of 2024. We also advanced our central nervous system (CNS)-penetrant EGFR inhibitor ERAS-801 to further characterize activity in patients with EGFR-amplified recurrent glioblastoma (GBM), which represents approximately 85% of all patients with EGFR-altered GBM.” Dr. Lim continued, “In 2024, we have several key catalysts for naporafenib, which is currently being developed in two trials, SEACRAFT-1, which is ongoing in patients with RAS Q61X tissue agnostic solid tumors, and SEACRAFT-2, which is expected to initiate in the first half of 2024 in patients with NRAS-mutant (NRASm) melanoma. We are excited by our recent pooled analysis of the median overall survival (mOS) data from the Phase 1b and Phase 2 trials for naporafenib plus trametinib in patients with NRASm melanoma. These data showed an mOS of approximately 13-14 months, which nearly doubles the mOS observed for historical control observations for cytotoxic chemotherapy and single agent MEK inhibitors in patients similar to the SEACRAFT-2 patient population.” Research and Development (R&D) Highlights Achieved Key Milestones for Naporafenib and ERAS-801 and Prioritized Pipeline: In November 2023, Erasca gained alignment with US and EU health authorities for the pivotal Phase 3 SEACRAFT-2 trial design that provided clarity on a registrational pathway for naporafenib plus trametinib in patients with NRASm melanoma. Erasca also completed dose escalation and identified a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for ERAS-801, supporting the ongoing enrollment of efficacy signal-seeking expansion cohorts in patients with EGFR-altered GBM. In addition, a strategic pipeline prioritization sharpened Erasca’s focus on existing programs that we believe have the highest probability of success for patients.Analysis of mOS Data for Naporafenib: A pooled analysis of patients with NRASm melanoma dosed with the combination of naporafenib and trametinib at two different doses across two different trials (Phase 1b and Phase 2) showed an mOS of 13.0 and 14.1 months, respectively. The pooled dataset at each dose compares favorably relative to historical benchmarks. Corporate Highlights Granted Fast Track Designation for Naporafenib: In December 2023, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted FTD to naporafenib in combination with trametinib (MEKINIST®) for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma who have progressed on, or are intolerant to, an anti‑programmed death-1 (ligand 1) (PD‑(L)1)-based regimen, and whose tumors contain an NRAS mutation.Entered into two CTCSAs with Novartis for Naporafenib Combination in SEACRAFT-1 and SEACRAFT-2: In February 2024, Erasca announced two clinical trial collaboration and supply agreements (CTCSAs) with Novartis pursuant to which Novartis will provide its MEK inhibitor trametinib at no cost to Erasca in connection with two clinical trials evaluating naporafenib in combination with trametinib for the treatment of patients with RAS Q61X solid tumors as part of the ongoing Phase 1b SEACRAFT-1 trial, and for the treatment of patients with previously treated NRASm unresectable or metastatic melanoma as part of the planned randomized pivotal Phase 3 SEACRAFT-2 trial. Key Upcoming Anticipated Milestones SEACRAFT-1: Phase 1b trial for naporafenib (pan-RAF inhibitor) plus trametinib in patients with RAS Q61X tissue agnostic solid tumors Initial Phase 1b combination data expected between the second and fourth quarters of 2024 SEACRAFT-2: Randomized pivotal Phase 3 trial for naporafenib plus trametinib in patients with NRASm melanoma Phase 3 trial initiation expected in the first half of 2024 HERKULES-3: Phase 1b trial for ERAS-007 (ERK inhibitor) plus encorafenib (BRAFTOVI®) + cetuximab (ERBITUX®) (EC) in EC-naïve patients with BRAFm CRC Phase 1b combination data expected in the first half of 2024 THUNDERBBOLT-1: Phase 1 trial for ERAS-801 (CNS-penetrant EGFR inhibitor) in patients with GBM Initial Phase 1 monotherapy data expected in 2024 Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results Cash Position: Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $322.0 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $435.6 million as of December 31, 2022. Research and Development (R&D) Expenses: R&D expenses were $24.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to $29.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by decreases in expenses incurred in connection with clinical trials, preclinical studies, discovery activities, and outsourced services and consulting fees, as a result of pipeline prioritization. R&D expenses were $103.8 million for the full year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $112.5 million for the full year ended December 31, 2022. The full year ended December 31, 2022 also included $102.0 million of in-process R&D expenses related to upfront and milestone payments and stock issuances under certain of our asset acquisition and license agreements. General and Administrative (G&A) Expenses: G&A expenses were $9.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to $8.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, partially offset by decreases in insurance costs and legal fees. G&A expenses were $37.7 million for the full year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $33.0 million for the full year ended December 31, 2022. Net Loss: Net loss was $29.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to $135.3 million, inclusive of the $100.0 million of in-process R&D expenses recorded in connection with the Novartis license agreement, for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. For the full year ended December 31, 2023, Erasca reported a net loss of $125.0 million, or $(0.83) per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $242.8 million, inclusive of the $100.0 million of in-process R&D expenses recorded in connection with the Novartis license agreement, or $(1.99) per basic and diluted share, for the full year ended December 31, 2022.

Financial Analyst Usio, Inc.'s reported revenue increase of 19% and the expansion of gross margins by 150 basis points to 22.5% reflect a robust financial performance. The company's focus on expense control, evident from the relatively modest increase in operating expenses compared to revenue growth, suggests efficient management practices. The transition to a PayFac model, with a 25% increase in revenues, indicates a strategic pivot towards a more scalable and potentially lucrative business model. This transition is likely to attract investor attention due to the recurring revenue model associated with payment facilitation.Furthermore, the company's strong balance sheet, with $7.2 million cash on hand and no significant debt, positions Usio favorably for future investments and growth opportunities. The share repurchase program, which indicates confidence in the company's valuation, along with the anticipation of significant PayFac deals, could signal to investors a positive outlook on Usio's market position and future earnings potential. Market Research Analyst Usio's performance in the electronic payment sector reflects broader industry trends, where companies are increasingly relying on integrated, cloud-based financial solutions. The 105% increase in prepaid card services revenue and the milestone of exceeding $100 million in dollars loaded onto prepaid cards for two consecutive quarters demonstrate strong market demand and the success of Usio's disbursement programs. The company's investment in capital improvements for Output Solutions, leading to capacity expansion, aligns with the necessity for FinTech companies to continuously innovate and scale up to meet growing market demands.Given the projected 10-12% revenue growth and 70-90% growth in Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2024, Usio appears to be leveraging its market position to capture a larger share of the electronic payments market. This forward-looking guidance, however, is contingent on stable economic conditions, which should be a consideration for stakeholders evaluating the potential volatility of future earnings. Economist Usio's financial results are indicative of a healthy economic environment for FinTech companies, despite potential macroeconomic uncertainties. The company's ability to generate nearly $1.7 million in interest income from improved returns on cash accounts is a testament to effective treasury management and favorable interest rate environments. However, investors should note the caution in the company's guidance, which is predicated on no appreciable deterioration in economic conditions.The FinTech industry is sensitive to economic cycles and any downturn could impact disposable income and consumer spending, potentially affecting transaction volumes. Nonetheless, Usio's diversified revenue streams across ACH, credit card, prepaid card services and Output Solutions might provide a buffer against sector-specific downturns. The company's strategic growth and cost control measures, coupled with an emphasis on improving bottom-line profitability, could be key factors in sustaining performance through economic headwinds. 03/27/2024 - 04:01 PM Full Year Revenues up 19%; Seventh Consecutive Year of Record Revenue Adjusted EBITDA up Nearly $3 Million in Fiscal 2023 as Compared to Fiscal 2022 SAN ANTONIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Usio, Inc: (Nasdaq: USIO), a leading FinTech company that operates a full stack of integrated, cloud-based electronic payment and embedded financial solutions, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year 2023, which ended December 31, 2023. Louis Hoch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Usio, said, “For the seventh consecutive year, Usio achieved record revenues, with full year 2023 revenues of $82.6 million, up 19%. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA1 totaled $2.4 million for the year. Both of these results met the fiscal 2023 Guidance established at the outset of 2023, illustrating our focus throughout the year on delivering on our commitments to our shareholders. Results were achieved on the strength of our 11th consecutive quarter of quarterly revenue growth primarily attributable to a 21% increase in processing volumes. We ended the year with our strongest ever balance sheet, which provides the resources to support our growth strategy. We believe that fiscal 2024 will be another year of revenue growth and bottom-line improvement. In addition to the momentum created by the recurring revenue of our many long-term clients, I am extremely excited by large opportunities in the pipeline that, when contracted, could change our growth trajectory and establish a broader and deeper base in our markets to help us build shareholder value over the long term.” Full year revenue growth was led by Prepaid, where revenues were up 105% as total dollars loaded on prepaid cards exceeded $100 million in both the third and fourth quarters. Output Solutions revenues were up 11% in fiscal 2023. In the fourth quarter, Output Solutions added new equipment and technology, significantly expanding capacity, which is expected to power another year of double-digit revenue growth. Card revenues were up 5% for the year. More importantly, we made progress transitioning to a primarily PayFac portfolio, with PayFac revenues up 25% for the year and now comprising a much larger proportion of our credit card business, which should support stronger future growth. And, our ACH business has turned the corner. In the fourth quarter, ACH revenues grew 4%, which enabled us to post full year ACH revenue growth and to build momentum headed into 2024."" For 2023, total gross profits climbed 27% as gross margins expanded 150 basis points to 22.5% from 21.0% in fiscal 2022. Selling, general and administrative expense were up just 8% in the year while total operating expenses were up just 4%, reflecting continued strong expense control. For the year, the Company generated nearly $1.7 million in interest income as a result of negotiations with financial institutions that improved returns on the company’s various cash accounts. The Company closed the 2023 fiscal year with $7.2 million cash on hand compared to year end cash of $5.7 million and no significant debt at December 31, 2022. The increase in cash was accomplished while $0.6 million was utilized to repurchase shares during the year. Mr. Hoch concluded, ""I am very pleased with the progress achieved across all of our businesses in 2023 and the strong financial position in which it has placed us entering the new year. I am encouraged with the prospects for 2024. Our Card pipeline is extremely robust and we are on the precipice of potentially signing some of the largest PayFac deals in the Company’s history. Output Solutions has significantly expanded their capacity through a major capital improvement program, which we expect will lead to further growth and increased profitability. After its first ever $100 million card load volume quarter in the third quarter, prepaid set a new record for load volume in the fourth quarter, a key indicator of the underlying strength of their business. And, ACH grew in both the fourth quarter and for the full year after a year of tough comparables. Margins were up, costs grew significantly below the rate of revenue, and we added $1.5 million of cash to the balance sheet despite expending $0.6 million on share repurchases as the Company demonstrates its belief in the value of our franchise. Our commitment is to continue to grow the business and to improve bottom line profitability. With seven consecutive years of growth, we are confident we have the products, solutions and strategies that are meeting the needs of a large and rapidly growing market for electronic payments and adjacent services.” Fiscal 2024 Guidance The Company continues to expect strong 10-12% growth in revenue in 2024 while also anticipating 70% - 90% growth in Adjusted EBITDA1 to a range of $4 to $4.5 million and $0.05 to $0.07 EPS. Guidance is conditioned on no appreciable deterioration in economic conditions. Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Summary Revenues were $19.4 million for the fourth quarter, up 4% compared to $18.7 million in the same period last year.

Gross margins in the quarter primarily reflect a shift in revenue mix, and some decrease in prepaid profitability due to the wind down of a large, one-time government card program. The Company had an operating loss of $0.8 million, compared to an operating loss of $0.1 million from the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA1 was a positive $0.3 million in the quarter, up approximately $0.4 million on a sequential basis, but down $0.7 million from $1.0 million in the same period a year ago.

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release includes non-GAAP financial measures, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margins and adjusted operating cash flows, as defined in Regulation G of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company reports its financial results in compliance with GAAP, but believes that also discussing non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with financial measures it uses in the management of its business. The Company defines EBITDA as operating income (loss), before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of intangibles. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, as defined above, plus non-cash stock option costs and certain non-recurring items, such as costs related to acquisitions. The Company defines adjusted operating cash flow as net cash provided (used) by operating activities, less changes in prepaid card load obligations, customer deposits, merchant reserves and net operating lease assets and obligations. These adjustments to net cash provided (used) by operating activities are not inclusive of any regular expense items, and only include changes in our assets and liabilities accounts on the balance sheet. These measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management uses EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted operating cash flows as indicators of the Company's operating performance and ability to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures and other investments and, in the absence of refinancing options, to repay debt obligations. Management believes EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margins and adjusted operating cash flows are helpful to investors in evaluating the Company's operating performance because non-cash costs and other items that management believes are not indicative of its results of operations are excluded. EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margins and adjusted operating cash flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. They are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to revenue, net income, or cash provided (used) by operating activities, as applicable, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other businesses. EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margins and adjusted operating cash flow have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider these Non-GAAP measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. 1 See reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures below FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS DISCLAIMER Except for the historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this release include forward-looking statements which are covered by safe harbors.

The company prioritizes TFF TAC based on promising Phase 2 results, showing potential in lung transplant medicine. Positive None. Negative None. Pharmaceutical Industry Analyst The recent announcement by TFF Pharmaceuticals regarding their TFF TAC and TFF VORI clinical programs presents a significant development within the pharmaceutical industry, particularly in the realm of lung transplant medicine and treatment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). The ability of their Thin Film Freezing (TFF) technology to facilitate direct-to-lung delivery of drugs represents a potential paradigm shift in medication administration, potentially improving efficacy and reducing systemic toxicity.From an industry perspective, the successful transition of patients from oral Tacrolimus to TFF TAC with no signs of acute rejection is a notable achievement. This could lead to a reduction in kidney toxicity, a common side effect associated with oral Tacrolimus. Furthermore, the favorable safety and efficacy profile of TFF VORI in treating IPA could address a critical need in immunocompromised patients, such as those undergoing lung transplants. The decision to prioritize the TFF TAC program and explore strategic alternatives for TFF VORI indicates a strategic focus on addressing unmet medical needs while considering market viability.The potential for these products to reduce systemic exposures while maintaining therapeutic efficacy could result in a competitive advantage in the market. The focus on reduced systemic toxicity is particularly relevant given the increasing emphasis on personalized medicine and patient-centric care. As the company moves towards Phase 3 development for TFF VORI and continues to progress with the TFF TAC program, investors and stakeholders should monitor the regulatory pathway and potential market impact of these innovative drug delivery technologies. Medical Research Analyst The clinical data updates for TFF TAC and TFF VORI offer promising insights into the management of post-lung transplant care and the treatment of IPA. The reported data suggest that the inhalation delivery method of these drugs may lead to improved patient outcomes by localizing the drug effect and minimizing systemic side effects. This approach aligns with current trends in medical research that emphasize targeted therapies and precision medicine.The reported absence of acute rejection in patients transitioned to TFF TAC is particularly noteworthy. Acute rejection is a major concern post-transplant and the ability to manage this risk while reducing kidney toxicity from systemic Tacrolimus could significantly improve patient quality of life and transplant success rates. The maintenance of kidney function is a critical factor in the long-term health of transplant recipients and the TFF technology may offer a substantial benefit in this regard.Regarding TFF VORI, the clinical responses and mycologic responses observed in the majority of patients are encouraging for the management of IPA, a serious infection that can be life-threatening for immunocompromised individuals. The absence of hepatic toxicity and visual disturbances is significant, as these are common side effects associated with oral voriconazole. The decision to halt enrollment in the Phase 2 study to concentrate on Phase 3 development suggests confidence in the data thus far and a strategic move to expedite the availability of this treatment option. Healthcare Market Analyst The prioritization of the TFF TAC program by TFF Pharmaceuticals, based on the positive Phase 2 data, reflects an astute assessment of the market opportunity within lung transplant medicine. The company's strategic decision to seek partners and funding for the development of TFF VORI also indicates an awareness of the cost and complexity associated with bringing a new drug to market, especially in a specialized therapeutic area such as antifungal treatments.The market for lung transplant medication is niche but growing, with an increasing number of transplants being performed globally. The ability to offer a safer and more effective form of drug delivery could position TFF Pharmaceuticals favorably within this market. For TFF VORI, targeting the treatment of IPA—a condition with limited effective treatment options—could allow the company to capture a significant share of the antifungal market, particularly if the safety and efficacy profile is superior to existing therapies.Investors should consider the potential for these products to obtain market share and the impact of successful commercialization on TFF Pharmaceuticals' revenue growth. The company's proactive approach in seeking strategic partnerships may facilitate the development process and mitigate financial risks. However, the long-term success will depend on continued positive clinical outcomes, regulatory approvals and the ability to effectively penetrate the market against established treatments. 03/27/2024 - 04:01 PM Eight of Eight Patients Successfully Transitioned from Oral Tacrolimus to TFF TAC with No Sign of Acute Rejection at Reduced Systemic Exposures Data from TFF VORI Phase 2 and EAP Program Continue to Demonstrate Antifungal Activity and a Favorable Safety and Tolerability Profile TFF TAC Program Prioritized Based on Positive Phase 2 Data, the Potential to Address a Significant Unmet Need in Lung Transplant Medicine and Substantial Market Opportunity Company to Hold Conference Call and Webcast Today at 4:30 pm ET FORT WORTH, Texas , March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TFF Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: TFFP) (“the Company”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative drug products based on its patented Thin Film Freezing (TFF) technology platform, today announced updated data from the Tacrolimus Inhalation Powder (TFF TAC) and Voriconazole Inhalation Powder (TFF VORI) clinical programs. “Today’s updated data provide further promising evidence in support of the continued development of both TFF TAC and TFF VORI, with the interim clinical data suggesting that each product can be delivered safely and efficaciously into the lungs,” said Harlan Weisman, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of TFF Pharmaceuticals. “Based on the totality of these clinical data, we believe TFF TAC and TFF VORI have the potential to establish a new and significantly improved form of delivery for these two life-saving medicines. Initial data from these two programs demonstrate that Thin Film Freezing can generate inhalational products from approved medicines to improve efficacy through direct-to-lung delivery while decreasing systemic exposures and toxicities, with what we believe could become a best-in-class pulmonary drug delivery technology.” TFF TAC and TFF VORI Clinical Data UpdatesToday, the Company is presenting new data from the ongoing Phase 2 study of TFF TAC for the prevention of acute rejection in lung transplant, and from the Phase 2 study and the Expanded Access Program (EAP) of TFF VORI for the treatment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). The updated safety and efficacy data are based on the cutoff date of March 8, 2024. TFF TAC – updated Phase 2 dataThe ongoing Phase 2 trial of TFF TAC is an open-label study in lung transplant patients who require reduced tacrolimus blood levels due to kidney toxicity. Part A of the trial is a 12-week treatment period, and Part B is an optional safety extension period. Trial endpoints include safety, tolerability, kidney function, and acute allograft rejection. In December, the Company announced initial data from the first four patients enrolled in the trial. Today, the Company is presenting data from another four patients in the trial (N=8). Updated Efficacy Successful transition eight of eight patients from oral Tacrolimus to TFF TACNo evidence of acute rejection: No signs and symptoms suggestive of acute rejectionNo use of pulse corticosteroids to treat acute rejectionNo deterioration in spirometryNo chest x-ray findings suggestive of acute rejection 4/4 patients who completed Part A chose to remain on TFF TAC and proceeded to Part B. Biomarker data will be disclosed at a Late Breaking Clinical Science abstract session at 44th Annual International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) 2024 Meeting on April 13, 2024. Professor Gregory Snell, the lead Principal Investigator of the TFF TAC Phase 2 study, will deliver the oral presentation. Updated Safety No mortalityNo TFF TAC discontinuation due to an AEMajority of TEAEs were Grade 2 or lower in severityMaintenance of kidney function On March 20, 2024, the Company announced prioritization of the TFF TAC program based on positive data from the ongoing Phase 2 study, the potential of the product to address a significant unmet need in lung transplant medicine, and the substantial market opportunity. TFF VORI – updated Phase 2 and EAP data The Phase 2 trial of TFF VORI enrolled patients with IPA and evaluated TFF VORI versus oral voriconazole in a 3:1 randomization after 13 weeks of treatment in an open label study. The trial endpoints included safety and tolerability, clinical, radiologic and mycologic responses, as well as all-cause mortality. In December 2023, the Company presented initial safety data from a total of seven patients treated with TFF VORI – three from the Phase 2 study and four from the EAP. Of these seven patients, five had completed at least eight weeks of TFF VORI therapy and were therefore also eligible for assessment of treatment response. The Company found the initial data from TFF VORI to be directionally informative, and given the availability of considerable historical and real-world data on safety, tolerability and efficacy for oral voriconazole, sufficient to move towards Phase 3 development. Therefore, enrollment in the Phase 2 study was stopped to focus resources on next steps for the program. The Expanded Access Program is still open and is continuing to enroll patients. As of March 8, 2024, two additional patients have enrolled in the EAP, bringing the total number of patients receiving TFF VORI up to nine. Today, the Company now has follow-up safety data on one of the two new EAP patients and is therefore providing updated safety data for eight patients. With respect to efficacy, one additional patient from the Phase 2 study completed TFF VORI therapy and therefore became available for treatment response bringing the total number of patients for assessment of efficacy to six. Updated Efficacy Five of six patients achieved a clinical response with TFF VORI, which we define as improvements in signs, symptoms and/or spirometryFive of six patients achieved a mycologic response, meaning no evidence of fungal infection on follow up assessmentThree of four patients, who had an abnormal chest CT at baseline and also had a follow up chest CT, achieved a radiologic response, meaning improvement in radiologic findings attributable to their fungal infection.No need for continued anti-fungal use after treatment with TFF VORI in all six patients. Updated Safety TFF VORI continues to maintain an attractive safety profile: No IPA-related mortality.No all-cause mortality One TFF VORI discontinuation due to an unrelated adverse event of COVID infection that required intubation.Majority of treatment-related adverse events (TEAEs) were deemed unrelated to TFF VORIMajority of TEAEs were Grade 2 or lower in severity.No hepatic toxicityNo visual disturbances. On March 20, 2024, the Company announced its decision to explore strategic alternatives, including partnering opportunities, collaborations, and government-based funding sources to support the continued development of TFF VORI.

ABOUT TFF PHARMACEUTICALS’ THIN FILM FREEZING (TFF) TECHNOLOGY TFF Pharmaceuticals’ proprietary Thin Film Freezing (TFF) technology allows for the transformation of both existing compounds and new chemical entities into dry powder formulations exhibiting unique characteristics and benefits. The TFF process is a particle engineering process designed to generate dry powder particles with advantageous properties for inhalation, as well as parenteral, nasal, oral, topical and ocular routes of administration. The process can be used to engineer powders for direct delivery to the site of need, circumventing challenges of systemic administration and leading to improved bioavailability, faster onset of action, and improved safety and efficacy. The ability to deliver therapies directly to the target organ, such as the lung, allows TFF powders to be administered at lower doses compared to oral drugs, reducing unwanted toxicities and side effects. Laboratory data suggests the aerodynamic properties of the powders created by TFF can deliver as much as 75% of the dose to the deep lung. TFF does not introduce heat, shear stress, or other forces that can damage more complex therapeutic components, such as fragile biologics, and instead enables the reformulation of these materials into easily stored and temperature-stable dry powders, making therapeutics and vaccines more accessible for distribution worldwide. The advantages of TFF can be used to enhance traditional delivery or combined to enable next-generation pharmaceutical products. ABOUT TFF PHARMACEUTICALS TFF Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaging patented rapid freezing technology to develop and transform medicines into potent dry powder formulations for better efficacy, safety, and stability. The company’s versatile TFF technology platform has broad applicability to convert most any drug, including vaccines, small and large molecules, and biologics, into an elegant dry powder highly advantageous for inhalation, or for topical delivery to the eyes, nose and the skin. TFF Pharmaceuticals has two lead drug candidates in the clinic: TFF TAC (Tacrolimus Inhalation Powder) and TFF VORI (Voriconazole Inhalation Powder). The Company continues collaborations with a broad array of pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, and government partners to revolutionize healthcare around the globe.

The company reported a net loss of $3.8 million in Q4 and $10.8 million for the full year, with a focus on strategic growth, product innovation, and market expansion. Positive Revenue in Q4 2023 was $8.7 million, with global recurring revenue at $5.6 million. Full-year 2023 revenue reached $33.4 million, with global recurring revenue at $21.5 million. The company increased its domestic installed base to 923 devices by the end of 2023. STRATA launched the TheraClear®X Acne Therapy System and implemented a recurring revenue model targeting clinical dermatology insurance reimbursed procedures. Leadership transition occurred in October 2023, appointing Dr. Dolev Rafaeli as Vice-Chairman, President, and CEO. The company re-implemented a strategic revenue model emphasizing recurring revenue through a Direct-to-Consumer approach. Sales and marketing department optimization led to reduced expenditures in 2023. An amended credit facility with MidCap Financial Trust was obtained to refinance existing debt. Initiated an outreach initiative to broaden Current Procedural Terminology code coverage. Showcased products at Maui Derm 2024, demonstrating efficacy in reducing acne lesions. Net loss for Q4 2023 was $3.8 million, including a goodwill impairment expense of $2.3 million. Full-year 2023 net loss was $10.8 million, including a goodwill impairment expense of $2.3 million. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at December 31, 2023, totaled $8.1 million. Negative Net loss increased from $5.6 million in 2022 to $10.8 million in 2023. Gross profit decreased from 65% of revenues in Q4 2022 to 55% in Q4 2023. Impairment expense of $2.3 million in Q4 2023 related to goodwill impairment. Selling and marketing costs remained high, at $2.8 million for Q4 2023. General and administrative costs increased from $2.5 million in Q4 2022 to $2.8 million in Q4 2023. Financial Analyst The financial results reported by STRATA Skin Sciences indicate a decline in both quarterly and annual revenues, with fourth quarter revenues dropping from $10.6 million to $8.7 million year-over-year and full-year revenues decreasing from $36.2 million to $33.4 million. A key factor contributing to this downturn is the reduction in global recurring revenue, which is a vital measure of predictability and stability in a company's revenue streams. The decrease in equipment revenues also signifies a potential slowdown in new device placements or market saturation.Moreover, the impairment expense of $2.3 million, related to goodwill impairment in the dermatology recurring procedures segment, suggests a reassessment of the segment's future profitability. This non-cash charge has significantly impacted net losses, which have nearly doubled from the previous year. The company's shift towards a Direct-to-Consumer model and cost optimization in sales and marketing, which led to reduced expenditures, indicates a strategic pivot that may improve margins in the future. However, the increased net loss and lower gross profit margins raise concerns about the company's near-term profitability and cash flow management. Medical Technology Market Analyst From a market perspective, the launch of the new TheraClear®X Acne Therapy System and the expansion of the XTRAC® device installed base are strategic moves to capture more of the dermatology market. The adoption of a recurring revenue model for TheraClear®X, targeting insurance-reimbursed clinical dermatology procedures, could enhance customer loyalty and create a steady income stream. However, the actual impact of these initiatives on revenue growth will depend on the rate of market penetration and the effectiveness of the company's patient-focused marketing strategies.The company's efforts to broaden CPT code coverage aim to increase patient access and provider reimbursement rates, which could potentially improve service adoption and profitability. The showcasing of products at industry events like Maui Derm 2024 is an important marketing strategy, but the real-world efficacy and adoption rates post such events will be critical to evaluate the success of these efforts. The company's amended credit facility with MidCap Financial Trust suggests confidence from creditors but also underscores the necessity for external financing to support operations. Healthcare Industry Financial Consultant STRATA's emphasis on non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, highlights an attempt to provide a more favorable view of financial performance by excluding certain expenses. While these measures can offer insights into the company's operational efficiency, investors should approach them with caution, as they do not replace the importance of GAAP measures. The reported non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $957 thousand, compared to $2.557 million in the previous year, still reflects a decline in operational profitability.The reconciliation of non-GAAP XTRAC gross domestic billings to domestic recorded revenue reveals the company's accounting for deferred revenue and adjustments for discounts. Understanding these reconciliations is important for investors, as they provide a clearer picture of actual revenue recognition practices. The decline in recognized GAAP domestic revenue from $21.537 million to $19.715 million year-over-year suggests that despite billing practices, revenue realization is facing challenges. 03/27/2024 - 04:01 PM Company to host conference call and webcast today, March 27, 2024, at 4:30 PM ETHORSHAM, Pa., March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- STRATA Skin Sciences, Inc.

Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresWe have determined to supplement our consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), presented elsewhere within this report, with certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, which excludes the non-cash expense of amortization of acquired intangible assets classified as cost of revenues, and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, “Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization.” These non-GAAP disclosures have limitations as an analytical tool, should not be viewed as a substitute for Gross Profit or Net Earnings (Loss) determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. We consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to our results prepared under current accounting standards, but they are not a substitute for, nor superior to, U.S. GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance readers’ overall understanding of our current financial performance and to provide further information for comparative purposes. This supplemental presentation should not be construed as an inference that the Company's future results will be unaffected by similar adjustments to Gross Profit or Net Earnings (Loss) determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Specifically, we believe the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to management and investors by isolating certain expenses, gains and losses that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook. In addition, we believe non-GAAP measures enhance the comparability of results against prior periods.

From a medical research perspective, the potential of gedatolisib, a PI3K/AKT/mTOR (PAM) inhibitor, has been underscored by nonclinical data suggesting superior cytotoxicity compared to other inhibitors in this class. The implications for patients with mCRPC, a population with limited treatment options, could be profound if the trial results are positive.Furthermore, the financial commitment to the project, as evidenced by the recent equity sale raising $65 million, indicates a robust backing for the development of gedatolisib. The projected funding into the first half of 2026 suggests confidence in the drug's pipeline and its potential market impact. For stakeholders, the long-term benefits hinge on successful trial outcomes, which could lead to a new therapeutic option in a high-need oncology segment. Financial Analyst Analyzing the financial results presented by Celcuity Inc., the increase in operating expenses, primarily driven by research and development (R&D) for their VIKTORIA-1 Phase 3 trial and the CELC-G-201 Phase 1b/2 clinical trial, reflects a strategic investment in their drug development programs. The reported net losses for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023, while substantial, are not uncommon for clinical-stage biotech companies focused on R&D.The capital raised through equity sales is a important indicator of market confidence in Celcuity's pipeline. This capital infusion, coupled with a prudent cash burn rate, positions the company to operate without the immediate need for additional financing, which is a positive sign for investors. However, the dependency on the success of clinical trials for future revenue generation remains a risk factor that must be monitored closely. Market Research Analyst The prostate cancer treatment market is highly competitive, with several established therapies and numerous drugs in development. Celcuity's strategic focus on a combination therapy approach with gedatolisib and darolutamide could differentiate it from monotherapies currently available. This approach aligns with the trend towards personalized medicine, where the efficacy of treatment is enhanced by targeting specific pathways involved in cancer progression.Given that the Phase 1b/2 trial results will not be available until the first half of 2025, the impact on Celcuity's market position will be long-term. Yet, early positive indicators from nonclinical studies may position Celcuity favorably among investors and industry partners. In the interim, Celcuity's financial health and operational execution will be critical to maintaining stakeholder confidence. 03/27/2024 - 04:01 PM Dosed the first patient in a Phase 1b/2 trial evaluating gedatolisib in combination with darolutamide for the treatment of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer Presented nonclinical data demonstrating the superior therapeutic effects of gedatolisib compared to other PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors at the 2023 SABCSRaised $65 million from the sale of equity; expect cash, cash equivalents, investments and available funds under our debt facility, to fund current operational activities into first half of 2026 Management to host webcast and conference call today, March 27, 2024, at 4:30 p.m. ET MINNEAPOLIS, March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Celcuity Inc. (Nasdaq: CELC), a clinical-stage biotechnology company pursuing development of targeted therapies for oncology, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023 and other recent business developments. “In 2023, we made significant progress advancing development of gedatolisib while strengthening our balance sheet and adding to our leadership team,” said Brian Sullivan, CEO and Co-Founder of Celcuity. “Our Phase 3 VIKTORIA-1 trial remains on track to report topline data from the PI3KCA wild type patient sub-group in the second half of this year. We were also excited to begin development of gedatolisib for patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer this past year. Enrollment has begun in our Phase 1b/2 trial evaluating gedatolisib in combination with darolutamide, and we look forward to sharing preliminary data from this trial in the first half of 2025.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Business Highlights and Other Recent Developments The VIKTORIA-1 Phase 3 trial remains on track to provide topline data for the PIK3CA wild type patient sub-group in the second half of 2024 and for the PIK3CA mutant patient sub-group in the first half of 2025. VIKTORIA-1 is evaluating gedatolisib in combination with fulvestrant with and without palbociclib in adults with HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer who have received prior treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor.The Phase 3 VIKTORIA-1 clinical trial is enrolling patients at approximately 220 sites in 23 countries in North and South America, Europe, and Asia. The Phase 1b/2 clinical trial evaluating gedatolisib in combination with darolutamide for the treatment of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2023. In February 2024, the first patient was dosed. The trial is expected to enroll up to 54 patients with mCRPC whose disease progressed after treatment with an androgen receptor signaling inhibitor. In December 2023, Celcuity presented data from nonclinical studies evaluating gedatolisib and other PI3K/AKT/mTOR (PAM) inhibitors in breast cancer cell lines during a poster session at the 2023 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS). In a panel of breast cancer cell lines, gedatolisib was found to be more cytotoxic and at least 300-fold more potent, on average, compared to the single node PAM inhibitors.In February 2024, Eldon Mayer was appointed Chief Commercial Officer. His 30 years of biopharmaceutical commercial experience includes senior leadership roles at several companies where he led the launch of their first drug. Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results Unless otherwise stated, all comparisons are for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2022. Total operating expenses were $19.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $11.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Operating expenses for the full year 2023 were $66.2 million, compared to $39.4 million for the full year 2022. Research and development (R&D) expenses were $18.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $10.6 million for the prior-year period. Of the approximately $7.5 million increase in R&D expenses, $6.8 million primarily related to activities supporting the VIKTORIA-1 Phase 3 trial and the initiation of the CELC-G-201 Phase 1b/2 clinical trial, and $0.7 million was related to increased employee and consulting expenses. R&D expenses for the full year 2023 were $60.6 million, compared to $35.3 million for the prior year. Of the approximately $25.3 million increase in R&D expenses, $22.9 million was related to activities supporting the VIKTORIA-1 Phase 3 trial and the initiation of the CELC-G-201 Phase 1b/2 clinical trial. The remaining $2.4 million increase in R&D expenses was related to increased employee and consulting expenses. General and administrative (G&A) expenses were $1.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $1.0 million for the prior-year period. Employee-related expenses accounted for $0.5 million of the increase. The remaining increase resulted from professional fees and other expenses associated with compliance related activities that support financing and clinical operations. G&A expenses for the full year 2023 were $5.6 million, compared to $4.1 million for the prior year. Of the approximately $1.5 million increase in G&A expenses, $1.1 million was related to increased employee-related expenses, and $0.4 million was related to professional fees and other expenses associated with compliance related activities that support financing and clinical operations. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $18.8 million, or $0.65 loss per share, compared to a net loss of $11.6 million, or $0.69 loss per share, for the fourth quarter of 2022. Net loss for the full year 2023 was $63.8 million, or $2.69 loss per share, compared to a net loss of $40.4 million, or $2.64 loss per share, in 2022. Non-GAAP adjusted net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $17.6 million, or $0.61 loss per share, compared to non-GAAP adjusted net loss of $10.3 million, or $0.61 loss per share, for the fourth quarter of 2022. Non-GAAP adjusted net loss for the full year 2023 was $57.8 million, or $2.44 loss per share, compared to non-GAAP adjusted net loss of $35.0 million, or $2.27 loss per share, for 2022. Non-GAAP adjusted net loss excludes stock-based compensation expense, non-cash interest expense, and non-cash interest income. Because these items have no impact on Celcuity’s cash position, management believes non-GAAP adjusted net loss better enables Celcuity to focus on cash used in operations. For a reconciliation of financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) to non-GAAP financial measures, please see the financial tables at the end of this press release. Net cash used in operating activities for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $18.5 million, compared to $9.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Net cash used in operating activities for the full year 2023 was $53.8 million, compared to $36.0 million for the full year 2022. In October of 2023, Celcuity closed a private placement of equity that resulted in gross proceeds of approximately $50 million. In December 2023, Celcuity closed on an additional $15 million of gross proceeds through its at-the-market offering. The Company expects to use the net proceeds to advance the clinical development of gedatolisib and for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2023, Celcuity reported cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $180.6 million. We expect cash, cash equivalents, investments and available funds under our debt facility to provide adequate capital to fund current operational activities into the first half of 2026.

Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful supplemental measures for planning, monitoring, and evaluating operational performance as they exclude stock-based compensation expense, non-cash interest expense, and non-cash interest income from net loss and net loss per share. Management excludes these items because they do not impact Celcuity’s cash position, which management believes better enables Celcuity to focus on cash used in operations. However, non-GAAP adjusted net loss and non-GAAP adjusted net loss per share are not recognized measures under GAAP and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP. As a result, management’s method of calculating non-GAAP adjusted net loss and non-GAAP adjusted net loss per share may differ materially from the method used by other companies. Therefore, non-GAAP adjusted net loss and non-GAAP adjusted net loss per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Investors are cautioned that non-GAAP adjusted net loss and non-GAAP adjusted net loss per share should not be construed as alternatives to net loss, net loss per share or other statements of operations data (which are determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of Celcuity’s performance or as a measure of liquidity and cash flows.

Biotech Industry Analyst The acquisition of AlmataBio by Avalo Therapeutics represents a strategic move in the biotech industry, particularly within the inflammatory disease treatment sector. The centerpiece of this acquisition, the anti-IL-1β monoclonal antibody (mAb) AVTX-009, is poised for Phase 2 clinical trials in hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), a chronic skin condition with limited treatment options. The financial backing through private placement financing underscores investor confidence in Avalo's strategy and the potential of AVTX-009.From a market perspective, targeting HS, a disease with unmet medical needs, could offer Avalo a significant competitive advantage. Should AVTX-009 demonstrate efficacy and safety in Phase 2 trials, it could capture a sizeable share of a multi-billion-dollar market. The investment syndicate's involvement, including firms like Commodore Capital and RA Capital Management, suggests a robust validation of Avalo's approach and the asset's commercial prospects.However, the long timeline until topline results in 2026 and the projected cash runway extending into 2027 suggest a period of sustained investment before potential returns. Investors should monitor the progress of the Phase 2 trial closely, as any deviations from projected timelines or unexpected clinical results could impact the company's financial position and stock performance. Pharmaceutical Development Expert AVTX-009's progression to a Phase 2 trial is a critical step in its development pathway. The molecule's inhibition of IL-1β, a cytokine involved in inflammatory responses, makes it a promising candidate for treating HS. Previous data validating IL-1β's role in HS strengthens the scientific rationale behind targeting this pathway.Moreover, the mention of AVTX-009's potential for 'best-in-class' and 'best-in-indication' status suggests a favorable comparison with existing treatments in terms of target specificity, half-life and potency. These attributes could lead to improved patient outcomes and adherence due to more convenient dosing schedules. The development in additional chronic inflammatory indications could further enhance the therapeutic's value proposition and market potential.Nevertheless, the inherent risks of drug development persist, including the possibility of adverse events or insufficient efficacy data, which could halt the drug's progression. Stakeholders should be aware of these risks while considering the potential long-term benefits of a successful treatment entering the market. Financial Analyst The financial structuring accompanying the acquisition, with an initial upfront investment of $115.6 million and additional financing up to $185 million, reflects a strong capital foundation for Avalo's near-term operations. This financing is particularly significant in extending Avalo's cash runway, a vital factor for biotech firms where cash flow is often negative during the extensive R&D phase.Investors should note that the net upfront proceeds of approximately $105 million, after estimated transaction costs, will support the company through important development milestones. The commitment from high-profile investment firms could also serve as a positive signal to the market, potentially bolstering investor sentiment and Avalo's stock performance.The strategic implications of this acquisition and financing extend beyond immediate cash flow concerns. They potentially position Avalo for future partnerships or acquisition interest, especially if AVTX-009 advances successfully through clinical trials. However, it's important to balance these prospects against the risks of dilution from the issuance of preferred stock and warrants, which could affect current shareholder value. 03/27/2024 - 04:01 PM Avalo acquires Phase 2-ready anti-IL-1β mAb, AVTX-009, through acquisition of AlmataBio, Inc. Topline results from planned Phase 2 trial in hidradenitis suppurativa expected in 2026Executed private placement financing of up to $185 million, including initial upfront investment of $115.6 million; expected to extend cash runway into 2027 Webcast to be held tomorrow, March 28, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. E.T. WAYNE, Pa. and ROCKVILLE, Md., March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: AVTX) today announced it has acquired a Phase 2-ready anti-IL-1β mAb, which it refers to as AVTX-009, through the acquisition of privately held AlmataBio, Inc. Concurrent with the acquisition, Avalo entered into a definitive agreement for the sale of preferred stock and warrants in a private placement led by Commodore Capital and TCGX, with participation from BVF Partners, Deep Track Capital, OrbiMed, Petrichor, and RA Capital Management. The private placement will provide up to $185 million in gross proceeds, including an initial gross upfront investment of $115.6 million. After deducting estimated transaction costs from both the private placement financing and the acquisition of AlmataBio, Avalo expects net upfront proceeds to be approximately $105 million. The private placement is expected to close on March 28, 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Avalo intends to pursue the development of AVTX-009 in hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). Topline results from a planned Phase 2 trial in HS are expected in 2026 and the upfront funding is expected to fund operations through this data readout and into 2027. In addition to HS, Avalo intends to develop AVTX-009 in at least one other chronic inflammatory indication. “We are thrilled to announce the acquisition of AVTX-009 and concurrent financing of up to $185 million. Avalo remains focused on the treatment of inflammatory conditions, and we are excited to prepare to initiate a Phase 2 trial in HS, a severe autoimmune disease with significant unmet needs. We believe AVTX-009, which was originally developed by Eli Lilly, has a high probability of success for the treatment of HS as evidenced by recent data readouts validating inhibition of IL-1β in this disease. We believe that HS is a multi-billion-dollar commercial opportunity and that AVTX-009 has the potential to be best-in-class and best-in-indication because of its target, half-life, and potency, which may allow for strong efficacy and convenient dosing,” said Garry A. Neil, MD, CEO, and Chairman of the Board at Avalo. “We are excited to be fully funded through our expected data readout and we appreciate the support of this outstanding investment syndicate.” Dr. Neil continued, “I want to thank Patrick Crutcher and his team at AlmataBio for their great work in identifying and bringing this potentially best-in-class molecule forward. Mr. Crutcher has a long history of successful biotech entrepreneurship and identifying high quality opportunities. We greatly value his partnership and expertise.” Patrick J. Crutcher, former CEO of AlmataBio, added, ""We are pleased that Avalo recognizes the promise of AVTX-009, an important potential treatment option for patients with inflammatory diseases. AlmataBio was founded to identify, acquire, and accelerate the development of clinically meaningful therapies, and we are proud of the contribution of the talented AlmataBio team to this mission. We look forward to the advancement of AVTX-009 into a Phase 2 trial in HS under Dr. Neil’s stewardship."" Management and OrganizationAvalo’s current leadership team will continue to lead Avalo and no person affiliated with AlmataBio will become an officer or employee of Avalo. Pursuant to the acquisition, Jonathan Goldman, M.D. was appointed to Avalo’s Board of Directors effective on the closing of the transaction. Prior to the closing of the financing transaction, Samantha Truex and Aaron Kantoff are expected to be appointed to Avalo’s Board of Directors. The five existing Avalo directors will continue in their roles. About the Acquisition and Financing TransactionAvalo’s acquisition of AlmataBio, Inc. was structured as a stock-for-stock transaction whereby all outstanding equity interests in AlmataBio were exchanged in a merger for a combination of Avalo common stock and shares of Avalo non-voting convertible preferred stock, valued at approximately $15 million in the aggregate, resulting in the issuance of approximately 0.2 million shares of Avalo common stock and approximately 2,400 shares of non-voting convertible preferred stock. In addition, a cash payment of $7.5 million is due to the former AlmataBio stockholders upon the initial closing of the private placement investment. Avalo is also required to pay development milestones to the former AlmataBio stockholders, including $5 million due upon the first patient dosed in a Phase 2 trial in patients with HS for AVTX-009 and $15 million due upon the first patient dosed in a Phase 3 trial for AVTX-009, both of which are payable in cash, Avalo stock, or a combination thereof at the election of the former AlmataBio stockholders, subject to the terms and conditions of the definitive merger agreement. Concurrently, Avalo entered into a definitive agreement for a private placement investment with institutional investors to raise up to $185 million in which the investors will be issued (i) an aggregate of $115.6 million of non-voting convertible preferred stock, resulting in the issuance of approximately 19,900 shares of non-voting convertible preferred stock and (ii) warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of approximately 12.0 million shares of Avalo’s common stock or an equivalent amount (as converted to common stock) of non-voting convertible preferred stock, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the warrant agreement, for an aggregate exercise price of $69.4 million. The warrants are exercisable for approximately $5.80 per underlying share of common stock until the earlier of five years from the date of issuance or 30 days after the public announcement of the first patient dosed in a Phase 2 trial of AVTX-009 in HS. After deducting estimated transaction costs from both the private placement financing and the acquisition of AlmataBio, Avalo expects net upfront proceeds to be approximately $105 million. The estimated transaction costs do not include the $7.5 million cash payment due to former AlmataBio stockholders upon the initial closing of the private placement investment. The private placement is expected to close on March 28, 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Subject to and upon Avalo stockholder approval, each share of Avalo non-voting convertible preferred stock (i) issued to former AlmataBio stockholders and (ii) issued pursuant to the private placement investment will automatically convert to 1,000 shares of Avalo common stock, subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations. The non-voting convertible preferred stock holds no voting rights. The acquisition was approved by the Board of Directors of Avalo and by the Board of Directors and stockholders of AlmataBio, Inc. The closings of the transactions are not subject to the approval of Avalo stockholders. On an as-converted basis and after accounting for these transactions (excluding the exercise of the warrants), the total number of shares of Avalo common stock outstanding would be approximately 23.4 million immediately after the closing of the transactions. Oppenheimer & Co. is serving as sole placement agent to Avalo. Wyrick Robbins Yates & Ponton LLP is serving as legal counsel to Avalo. Goodwin Procter LLP is serving as legal counsel to AlmataBio, Inc. Schulte Roth & Zabel, LLP is serving as legal counsel to Commodore Capital and Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin & Hachigian, LLP is serving as legal counsel to TCGX.

The project aims to transition gas- and diesel-powered fleets to zero-emission road freight by providing a comprehensive charging infrastructure Action Plan for the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area. The collaboration with RMI will help inform utilities, energy regulators, and decision-makers on optimal locations for charging stations. FedEx's commitment to sustainable transportation includes transitioning its parcel pickup and delivery fleet to zero-emission vehicles by 2040. Positive None. Negative None. Transportation Policy Analyst As the transportation sector grapples with the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the initiative by the Pembina Institute, supported by FedEx, represents a strategic approach to addressing one of the critical challenges in fleet electrification: the deployment of adequate charging infrastructure. The focus on the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) is particularly significant given its status as a major economic and transportation hub in Canada.From a policy perspective, the Grid Readiness Project could serve as a model for other regions. The comprehensive action plan Pembina aims to develop will likely highlight the importance of data-driven decision-making in infrastructure investment. This is crucial, as misaligned infrastructure can lead to bottlenecks that impede the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), potentially derailing efforts to meet emissions targets. Furthermore, the involvement of a major player like FedEx signals a shift in corporate responsibility towards sustainable practices, which could encourage other businesses to follow suit, amplifying the project's impact. Energy Market Analyst Transitioning to zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) is not just a transportation issue but also poses significant implications for the energy market, particularly in terms of demand and grid stability. The anticipated steep increase in energy demand from ZEVs will require not only more power generation but also grid enhancements to handle peak load times associated with vehicle charging.Utilities and energy regulators will need to consider the implications of the Grid Readiness Project's findings on energy pricing, load management and the potential for renewable energy integration. The use of RMI's GridUp data platform suggests a move towards more sophisticated grid management tools that can forecast and accommodate the localized spikes in electricity demand. This project could set a precedent for how energy markets adapt to the electrification of transport, influencing investment in energy infrastructure and possibly spurring innovation in smart grid technologies. Environmental Economist The environmental benefits of fleet electrification are clear, with significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions projected from the switch to electric vehicles. However, the economic implications are multi-faceted. On the one hand, there is a potential for job creation in the manufacturing of EVs and the development of charging infrastructure. On the other hand, there may be disruptions in industries related to traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.From an environmental economics standpoint, the Grid Readiness Project aligns with the concept of 'green economy,' where economic growth and environmental responsibility coexist. The long-term savings from reduced emissions and fossil fuel dependence can be substantial, but the upfront costs and economic shifts must be managed carefully. The action plan developed by the Pembina Institute will need to balance these considerations, ensuring that the transition supports economic stability while achieving environmental goals. 03/27/2024 - 02:45 PM The Pembina Institute launches initiative to help accelerate fleet electrificationTORONTO, ON / ACCESSWIRE / March 27, 2024 / With generous support from FedEx, the Pembina Institute has launched the Grid Readiness Project to help accelerate the transition from gas- and diesel-powered fleets to zero-emission road freight.The Grid Readiness Project is a unique collaboration between the Pembina Institute and RMI. At the end of the project's research and analysis phase, Pembina will release a comprehensive charging infrastructure Action Plan for the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) that will assist decision-makers in determining optimal locations for commercial freight charging and refueling stations and their anticipated energy loads.Operators of large fleets have already begun to switch over to low-carbon and electric commercial vehicles, and uptake is expected to continue its rise. However, the adoption of zero-emission medium- and heavy-duty vehicles is at risk of stalling largely because the deployment of charging infrastructure has not kept pace.Utilities and energy regulators are only now beginning to make planning decisions that will address the steep increase in energy demand from zero-carbon road transportation. In the absence of research that can inform complex and dispersed decisions and investments, the Pembina Institute will undertake analysis using RMI's new GridUp data platform, a powerful tool that will inform utilities, energy regulators, and others on how to proactively locate, strengthen and upgrade charging infrastructure.Pembina will also be working with municipalities, industry stakeholders, and policymakers to assess grid readiness and recommend next steps.This announcement reflects a commitment by FedEx to advance sustainable transportation throughout Canada. FedEx is working toward transforming its entire parcel pickup and delivery fleet to zero-tailpipe-emissions vehicles by 2040, as part of its goal to reach carbon-neutral operations by the same year.Quotes""Fleet electrification is a key pillar of the FedEx roadmap to carbon-neutral operations by 2040 and our commitment to deliver a more sustainable future for all. Our commitment to the Pembina Institute will bring RMI's advanced grid planning tools to the Greater Toronto area, empowering key players in the electrification ecosystem with information needed to support a wide-scale transition to EVs.""- Dean Jamieson, Vice President of Operations, FedEx Express Canada""We've been witnessing the gradual shift to fleet electrification, which is likely going to go into overdrive in less than 10 years. This means enormous changes in the types of trucks and buses on the road and the infrastructure needed to power these vehicles. Given the timelines, planning for charging locations and energy demand needs to happen as soon as possible and decisions need to be data driven. The support from FedEx for this project shows how the private sector can be a leader in some of the most important climate actions we can take to realize a net zero-carbon future.""- Adam Thorn, Transportation Director, Pembina Institute""RMI is thrilled to work with the Pembina Institute as they leverage the GridUp platform to advance planning for their region's electric vehicle charging needs. Equipped with data-driven insights from GridUp, utilities and grid operators in the GTHA will be able to validate proactive infrastructure investments where the imminence of electric vehicle charging demand is clear, enabling rapid electric vehicle adoption that avoids unnecessary expenditures.""- Dave Mullaney, Principal of Carbon Free Transportation, RMIQuick factsIn June of 2023, FedEx Express Canada received its first 50 Zevo 600 all-electric delivery vehicles from GM subsidiary BrightDrop.

Positive None. Negative None. 03/27/2024 - 02:42 PM Stockholders Urged to Reject Costly and Distracting Proxy Contest PINE MOUNTAIN, Georgia, March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Parks! America, Inc. (OTCPink: PRKA) (“Parks! America” or the “Company”), a leading operator of regional safari parks in the United States, today advised stockholders of its view that the dissident slate of directors offered by Focused Compounding Fund, L.P. is not qualified to operate Parks! America as a public company. Parks! America urges stockholders to vote for the Company’s slate of director candidates. The full text of the letter to stockholders follows. Dear Parks! America Stockholders: The slate of nominees proposed by Focused Compounding Fund, L.P. (“FC”) is not qualified to run Parks! America, Inc. (“Parks! America” or the “Company”). The nominees have no experience operating a wildlife safari entertainment company or similar enterprise, and they have no experience running a public company and all that is involved from an operational and a regulatory perspective. FC’s dissident slate of directors includes: Andrew Kuhn, age 27, an FC principal;Geoffrey Gannon, age 38, an FC principal;Jacob McDonough, age 31, founder and portfolio manager of McDonough Investments; andRalph Molina, age 26, senior investor relations analyst at The Cheesecake Factory since January 2024. These individuals are not prepared by training, education or experience to run a public company. Their experience appears to be entirely as investment advisors and commentators. They have not worked in senior management positions in any corporate environment, much less at a publicly traded company. They have never confronted the challenges of operating or managing a public company, including developing a strategic plan, executing on such plan, dealing with strategic vendors, managing and overseeing the well-being of employees or satisfying the regulatory-reporting and corporate-governance requirements that come with running a public company. Nothing in their backgrounds to this point suggests their ability or qualification to run a public company. The two FC principals, Andrew Kuhn and Geoffrey Gannon, operate a small hedge fund – so small in fact that it is not even required to file quarterly regulatory reports. FC is exempt from reporting assets under management, return on its investments or past track record. While Mr. Kuhn and Mr. Gannon say they are effective investment advisors and stock traders, how can we know? They have not publicly disclosed their fund’s performance benchmarked against major indices. But even if they can show decent performance, they are investment advisors, stock traders and podcasters who have never occupied management positions at any public company, let alone senior management positions. Indeed, Mr. Kuhn and Mr. Gannon do not even have basic textbook training on how to manage a company. Both are high school graduates with no college or other advanced degrees. Jacob McDonough, age 31, is the founder and portfolio manager of McDonough Investments, which manages capital for clients as a registered investment advisor in a separately managed accounts structure. That firm was founded in June 2021, less than three years ago. McDonough Investments manages capital for clients as a registered investment adviser, much like FC says it does. According to McDonough Investments’ 2023 annual report,1 the fund has a mere $1.5 million dollars in assets under management. FC touts Mr. McDonough as being “the guy who LITERALLY wrote the book on capital allocation”2; however, it appears that Mr. McDonough may be more suited to writing about capital allocation than actually raising and allocating capital, as evidenced by the fact that McDonough Investments underperformed the S&P 500 by a cumulative 33%3 over the last three years.4 As with the FC principals, Mr. McDonough has never occupied a senior-management position at any public company. Mr. McDonough received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Finance from Michigan State University in 2014. Ralph Molina, age 26, currently serves as a senior investor relations analyst at The Cheesecake Factory, a NASDAQ exchange listed company. He has been in the position less than three months – only since January 2024. From 2021 to 2023, Mr. Molina was an investor relations analyst at Edison International, a New York Stock Exchange listed electric utility. Once again, Mr. Molina has never occupied a senior management position at any public company. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Finance from San Diego State University in 2019. FC’s Proposed Slate Would Jeopardize the Future of Parks! America Running a public company is challenging. Yet, FC has put forward a slate of directors with no experience operating a company like Parks! America, or with any of the diverse disciplines necessary to be successful. Where FC’s proposed slate lacks any industry experience, the long-tenured members of the Company’s current board of directors have deep experience in key areas critical to Parks! America’s business, including in the entertainment, leisure, amusement, resort development and operation, location-based entertainment operations and marketing and real estate development sectors of the economy. A well-designed board brings together directors with a wide range of experience and expertise. FC’s slate is monotone – small-time money managers with very limited experience. Nothing in their backgrounds even suggests that any member of FC’s slate has the slightest idea what the animals we care for at Parks! America need to thrive, or what our customers want and expect in terms of their experience when they visit one of our facilities. Upon acquiring an additional 20% of Parks! America stock on December 14, 2023 from the Company’s former Chairman of the Board, bringing its stake in the Company to 38.5%, FC has adopted a ready-shoot-aim approach, rushing immediately to try to wrest control of the Company, demanding the immediate installation of its dissident slate of directors, which would have given FC a majority of the Board and control of the Company [without paying existing stockholders any premium at all and without a shareholder vote]. Almost as its first act, FC put the Company through the distraction and expense of a special meeting of stockholders when an annual meeting was already in the works. And when the special meeting proved unsuccessful to give FC control of the Board, FC ran to court demanding in effect that the court just give FC the control it could not secure through the stockholder meeting. The court, not surprisingly, refused to do so. But again, FC’s approach imposed an unneeded expense and an unwarranted distraction. FC’s capricious actions reflect its principals’ inexperience and lack of concern not only for the Company’s assets and resources, but also for the other stockholders, who collectively own a majority of the Company’s stock. FC Refuses to Constructively Engage, Seeks Control at Stockholders Expense FC has outright rejected or refused to constructively engage with the Company on reasonable proposals to amicably resolve the current situation, including an offer for FC to receive representation on the board of directors commensurate with FC’s percentage ownership of the Company. It appears that FC’s goal is nothing short of gaining full control of the Company and its assets, without regard for the Company’s other stockholders, or fair compensation to them. FC’s principals appear to believe that their narrow skill sets are immediately transferrable into running a unique public company like Parks! America. They are not! We urge Parks! America stockholders to seriously consider the importance of these factors. Sincerely, Lisa BradyPresident and Chief Executive Officer(706) 663-8744 About Parks! America, Inc. Parks! America, Inc.

Who are some of the individuals included in FC's dissident slate of directors? Some of the individuals included are Andrew Kuhn, Geoffrey Gannon, Jacob McDonough, and Ralph Molina. What is the concern raised about the experience of the nominees in managing a public company? The concern is that the nominees lack senior management experience in a corporate environment, especially in a publicly traded company. What is mentioned about Andrew Kuhn and Geoffrey Gannon's background? They operate a small hedge fund that is not required to file quarterly regulatory reports and lack formal training in managing a company. What is highlighted about Jacob McDonough's experience? Jacob McDonough is the founder of McDonough Investments, managing capital for clients, but the firm has a relatively small asset under management. Why is there skepticism about the qualifications of the nominees to run a public company? The nominees lack experience in strategic planning, regulatory reporting, and corporate governance required for managing a public company."

Cash and cash equivalents totaling $1.1 million at the end of 2023. Financial Analyst The reported financial results of BioCardia, Inc. show a decrease in revenues from $1.4 million in 2022 to $0.5 million in 2023, which is a significant drop and could raise concerns among investors regarding the company's revenue generation capabilities. However, it's important to note that the reduction in research and development expenses, from $8.8 million to $7.7 million, may reflect a strategic reallocation of resources following the pause and completion of enrollment in the CardiAMP Cell Therapy Heart Failure Trial. The company's ability to reduce its net loss marginally from $11.9 million to $11.6 million despite lower revenues might be seen as a positive sign of management's ability to control costs. Furthermore, the announcement of anticipated milestones for 2024, including the completion of the CardiAMP Heart Failure II Trial and potential FDA approval for the Morph DNA steerable introducer sheath product family, could be seen as a forward-looking statement that may influence investor sentiment. However, the company's cash position, with a runway into the third quarter of 2024, suggests a potential need for additional financing, which could lead to dilution for current shareholders. It's important for investors to weigh the potential for future revenue against the risks associated with the company's current financial position and the need for additional capital. Medical Research Analyst The interim data from the CardiAMP Heart Failure trial, despite missing the primary endpoint, indicates a reduction in heart death equivalents and other major adverse cardiac events, which could be promising for patients with heart failure. However, the nuanced results of the subgroup analysis, where patients with elevated NTproBNP at baseline experienced a significant relative risk reduction, suggest that the therapy may be more effective in certain patient populations. This specificity could influence the trial design and regulatory strategy going forward. The confirmation of these results in the ongoing trials and the subsequent approval in Japan could potentially open up a new market for BioCardia. The progression of the CardiALLO Phase I/II trial and the strategic partnerships for the Helix Biotherapeutic Delivery system also demonstrate BioCardia's commitment to diversifying its portfolio. These developments could potentially mitigate the impact of any single trial's outcome on the company's overall value proposition. The focus on non-dilutive funding strategies for the CardiALLO trial is noteworthy, as it may alleviate investor concerns regarding share dilution and cash burn. The overall clinical development plan positions BioCardia at a critical juncture, where the outcomes of the ongoing trials will be pivotal in shaping the company's future. Market Research Analyst The cell therapy and regenerative medicine sectors are rapidly growing, with increasing interest in treatments for cardiovascular diseases, which remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide. BioCardia's focus on this market through its various product candidates and trials positions the company in a high-potential space. The market's response to BioCardia's updates will likely hinge on the perceived viability of the CardiAMP and CardiALLO therapies, as well as the commercial potential of the Helix and Morph product lines. The company's strategic partnerships, such as those with CellProthera and StemCardia, could be critical in bolstering its market position and potentially providing revenue streams through sharing agreements. The anticipation of FDA approval for the Morph DNA products could also be a significant catalyst for the company's stock. Investors will be closely monitoring the execution of the company's stated milestones, as delays or failures could adversely affect the stock. Conversely, successful execution and positive trial outcomes could provide upside potential. It's important for stakeholders to keep an eye on industry trends, competitor developments and regulatory changes, as these factors will also influence BioCardia's market standing. 03/27/2024 - 04:00 PM SUNNYVALE, Calif., March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BioCardia®, Inc. [Nasdaq: BCDA], a developer of cellular and cell-derived therapeutics for the treatment of cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, today reported financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023 and filed its annual report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company will also hold a conference call at 4:30 PM ET today in which it will discuss business highlights with call details below. “Heart failure of reduced ejection fraction or HFrEF remains an unmet clinical need with none of the recently approved therapies reducing mortality,” said BioCardia CEO Peter Altman, Ph.D. “The interim data from our CardiAMP Heart Failure trial, where we missed the primary endpoint, shows reduced heart death equivalents, reduced major adverse cardiac events, reduced cardiac arrhythmias, and enhanced heart function in treated patients relative to the control patients. These results and their remarkable subgroup outcomes in patients with active heart failure underlie the potential to help millions of patients should they be confirmed.” Dr. Altman continued, “In 2024, we aim to complete the study follow-up, seek approval in Japan, and advance the confirmatory CardiAMP Heart Failure II Trial. We also intend to advance our earlier biotherapeutic product candidates, while securing meaningful value from our supportive Helix™ Biotherapeutic Delivery and Morph Access Innovations businesses.” RECENT BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS: CardiAMP® Autologous Cell Therapy for Ischemic HFrEF (BCDA-01) The CardiAMP Cell Therapy Heart Failure Trial Study enrollment in the randomized double-blind controlled trial, which has both FDA breakthrough designation and Medicare coverage, was completed during the fourth quarter of 2023 as the study was unlikely to be able to meet the primary endpoint as designed.The interim results on 110 randomized patients were presented at the Technology and Heart Failure Therapy meeting in March 2024 and showed treated patients appeared to benefit in the two most important tiers of the primary composite endpoint. Treated patients had a 37% relative risk reduction in heart death equivalent (all cause death, heart transplantation, and left ventricular assist device implantation) and a 9% reduction in non-fatal major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, but that both treated and control patients improved in the third component of the primary endpoint, of the six-minute walk distance.In a subgroup analysis of patients with elevated NTproBNP at baseline – encompassing 59% of total enrolled randomized patients – patients treated with CardiAMP cell therapy experienced an 86.2% relative risk reduction in heart death equivalents and a 23.9% relative risk reduction in MACCE. These patients saw more than a 17% lower rate of heart death equivalents at up to two years compared to control patients treated with heart failure medication alone (2.9% vs. 21.1%, respectively).The Company anticipates completing follow-up in the trial and preparing this dataset on 115 randomized patients enrolled with a minimum of one-year follow-up for final lock in the fourth quarter of 2024. This data may be sufficient to support product approval in Japan. The CardiAMP Cell Therapy Heart Failure II Trial The study, approved by FDA in the fourth quarter of 2023, is a confirmatory Phase III, multi-center, randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled study of up to 250 patients with NTproBNP levels >500 pg/ml at up to 40 centers in the United States. The primary endpoint is an outcomes composite score based on a three-tiered Finkelstein-Schoenfeld hierarchical analysis. The tiers, starting with the most serious events, would be (1) all-cause death, including cardiac death equivalents such as heart transplant or left ventricular assist device placement, ordered by time to event; (2) non-fatal Major Adverse Coronary and Cerebrovascular Events (MACCE), excluding those deemed procedure-related occurring within the first seven days post-procedure (heart failure hospitalization, stroke or myocardial infarction), ordered by time to event, and (3) change from baseline in quality of life at a minimum of 12 months and a maximum of 24 months.The trial has greater than 90 percent power (statistical probability of success) to meet the primary endpoint based on the CardiAMP Heart Failure Trial interim results.The Study was activated in the first quarter of 2024 and subsequently received certification of Medicare reimbursement to substantially offset the clinical costs of performing the study. CardiAMP Autologous Cell Therapy for Chronic Myocardial Ischemia (BCDA-02) The CardiAMP Cell Therapy Chronic Myocardial Ischemia Trial is a Medicare reimbursed Phase III, multi-center, randomized, double-blinded, controlled study of up to 343 patients at up to 40 clinical sites, designed to provide the primary support for the safety and efficacy in pursuit of market clearance. The Company intends to introduce an adaptive statistical analysis plan with an initial assessment for efficacy when 100 patients reach their primary endpoint, although aspects of this statistical analysis plan remain the subject of study considerations with the FDA. Data from the roll in cohort is expected in 2024. CardiAMP Platform Opportunities BioCardia has had discussions on partnering its CardiAMP therapy for other clinical indications and continues to explore partnerships worldwide. CardiALLO Allogeneic Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Ischemic HFrEF (BCDA-03) The CardiALLO Phase I/II trial for the treatment of HFrEF includes a 3+3 roll-in dose escalation cohort followed by a 60-patient randomized double-blind controlled study and utilizes the Finkelstein Schoenfeld three tier primary composite endpoint of mortality, MACCE, and functional capacity as measured by six-minute walk distance. The cohort receiving the lowest dose of 20 million cells was initiated in December 2023. There have been no treatment-emergent adverse events, arrhythmias, rejection, or allergic response, consistent with our presentation at the Technology and Heart Failure Therapeutics meeting on March 4, 2024.The Company intends to fund later development through nondilutive grant applications and partnering. With such funding, it is possible to complete enrollment in Phase I as early as the end of 2024. Phase II development is anticipated to be advanced in both the United States and Japan and would also enroll in approximately one year. Helix Biotherapeutic Delivery Partnering Business The Helix transendocardial biotherapeutic delivery system is a therapeutic-enabling platform for minimally invasive targeted delivery of biologic agents to the heart. Helix empowers a seamless transition from bench to commercialization for partners. Our biotherapeutic delivery partnerships are expected to enhance future treatment options for millions of people suffering from heart disease, offset the costs of biotherapeutic delivery for our own programs, and provide our investors with meaningful revenue sharing should our partnering efforts contribute successful therapeutic development.In September 2023, our biotherapeutic delivery partner CellProthera announced completion of enrollment in their Phase I/II cell therapy study in post-myocardial infarction and that results are expected soon.In March 2024, we announced a biotherapeutic delivery partnership with StemCardia for a long-term partnership to advance StemCardia’s investigational pluripotent stem cell product candidate for the treatment of heart failure, initially through a Phase I/II Clinical Study.Two additional premier biotherapeutic delivery partnerships are expected in 2024. Morph Access Innovations Business BioCardia expects to obtain FDA approval for a product family of Morph DNA steerable sheath introducers in a variety of sizes and lengths with clinical indications for use in the heart and peripheral vasculature during the third quarter of 2024. These Morph DNA products are derived from our FDA approved steerable introducer platform utilized for navigating Helix within the heart for biotherapeutic intervention. BioCardia is actively exploring pathways for commercializing these products in the second half of the year. 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS: Revenues were $0.5 million in 2023, compared to $1.4 million in 2022, due primarily to the timing of revenue from new and existing collaborative partners coupled with the fulfillment of performance obligations for several partners in 2022.Research and development decreased to $7.7 million in 2023, compared to $8.8 million in 2022, primarily due to the recent pause of the CardiAMP Cell Therapy Heart Failure Trial and its subsequent completion of enrollment coupled with reduced expenses in clinical and related supporting functions.Selling, general and administrative expenses were $4.4 million for the years ended 2023 and 2022.Our net loss was $11.6 million in 2023, compared to $11.9 million in 2022.Net cash used in operations was $10.0 million in 2023, compared to $10.6 million in 2022. The Company ended the year with cash and cash equivalents totaling $1.1 million, which together with financing proceeds in the first quarter of 2024 provide runway into the third quarter of 2024.The Company intends to remain listed on Nasdaq.

""The CFR credits sold under this Agreement will be developed under Canada's CFR program, the first national low-carbon fuel program in North America. Our ability to meet these stringent requirements showcases DevvStream's expertise in the carbon sector.""The CFR is a crucial component of Canada's climate plan aimed at reducing emissions, advancing clean technologies and fuels, and fostering sustainable jobs in various sectors like clean technology, agriculture, and low-carbon energy. CFR regulations focus on making gasoline and diesel cleaner over time, promoting the adoption of clean fuels and technologies, and driving innovation across multiple industries. According to company estimates, the expected price for compliance credits developed under the CFR program is $200 - $300 CAD per credit.DevvStream's Low Carbon Fuels Advisor, Dr. Michael Rensing, will oversee the generation of CFR credits under this Agreement. Dr. Rensing has been instrumental in developing and implementing successful low-carbon fuel standard (""LCFS"") policies and legislation, including British Columbia's, which is one of the most successful LCFS Programs in North America. Carbon credits that are sold in the BC LCFS market are among the world's highest in value, with prices in 2023 averaging $472 CAD per credit.The CFR program aims to reduce the carbon intensity of transportation fuels, such as gasoline and diesel, by approximately 15% below 2016 levels by 2030, resulting in significant greenhouse gas reductions of up to 26 megatonnes. The CFRs have replaced Canada's Renewable Fuel Regulations and focus on lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions rather than volumetric blending requirements. To comply with these regulations, primary suppliers must create credits and can trade them through a credit market established to meet specific carbon intensity reduction requirements. The CFR program was developed under the 2016 Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change (""PCF""), and is now included under Canada's 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan, which provides a roadmap for the Canadian economy to achieve 40-45% emissions reductions below 2005 levels by 2030, building upon the actions outlined in Canada's previous climate plans. The PCF is considered a foundational step for Canada to achieve its commitments under the Paris Agreement and work towards a prosperous net-zero emissions future by 2050.About DevvStreamFounded in 2021, DevvStream is a leading authority in the use of technology in carbon project development. The Company's mission is to create alignment between sustainability and profitability, helping organizations achieve their climate initiatives while directly improving their financial health. With a pipeline of over 140 technology-based projects worldwide, DevvStream makes it simple for corporations and governments to address their net-zero goals while generating premium carbon credits in the process. DevvStream takes a programmatic approach to evaluating project opportunities, and co-develops projects spanning energy-efficient buildings, facilities and homes, industrial facilities, LED systems, EV charging stations, and technologies to seal oil wells. The Company's end-to-end proprietary solution removes the risk and complexity from every step, allowing organizations to move from project ideation to credit monetization with ease. The result is a multi-year stream of carbon credit revenue that transforms sustainability into a financial investment. In addition, for organizations that need help to offset their most difficult-to-reduce emissions, we also provide premium carbon credits for purchase.On September 13, 2023, DevvStream and Focus Impact Acquisition Corp (NASDAQ: FIAC) (""Focus Impact"") announced that they have entered into a definitive business combination agreement for a business combination that would result in the combined company (DevvStream) to be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol ""DEVS"".

The company's focus on US-based banks through partnerships has led to tailored product offerings for the community banking sector. Anticipated onboarding of community bank customers in Q2 of this year. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The integration of Trust Stamp's Orchestration Layer platform into a significant number of financial institutions, particularly through a channel partnership, signals a robust expansion strategy. The partnership with FIS and engagement with the ThinkTech program indicates a deliberate move to penetrate the community banking sector, which is traditionally underserved by advanced technological solutions. The potential increase in market share and diversification of the client base could positively affect Trust Stamp's revenue streams and sustainability, especially as community banks look to enhance their digital capabilities in a competitive financial landscape.Moreover, the low-code aspect of the platform suggests ease of integration and adaptability, which are critical factors for technology adoption in institutions where resources for IT development might be limited. This could lead to an increase in customer satisfaction and retention rates, as financial institutions seek reliable and efficient technology partners to navigate the increasing demands for data privacy and security. Financial Analyst The announcement of a five-fold increase in financial institutions adopting Trust Stamp's technology could have a tangible impact on the company's financial health. Investors should monitor the company's forthcoming financial statements for indicators of revenue growth and expansion costs. The onboarding of additional financial institutions, including community banks, may result in an upsurge in market confidence, potentially influencing Trust Stamp's stock price. However, investors should also consider the costs associated with customer acquisition and product tailoring for the community banking sector. Long-term benefits hinge on the company's ability to maintain these relationships and continuously innovate to meet the evolving needs of its clientele. Cybersecurity Expert Trust Stamp's emphasis on privacy-first solutions is a timely response to the increasing concerns over data security and privacy regulations in the financial sector. The Orchestration Layer platform's adoption by multiple institutions underscores the demand for robust cybersecurity measures in the banking industry. As financial institutions face the dual challenges of protecting client data and complying with stringent regulations, Trust Stamp's platform could become a pivotal tool in mitigating these risks. The company's proactive approach in customizing their offerings for community banks demonstrates an understanding of the unique cybersecurity challenges faced by smaller institutions, potentially setting a new standard for data protection in the financial services industry. 03/27/2024 - 02:56 PM Atlanta, Georgia, March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Trust Stamp (Nasdaq: IDAI), the Privacy-First Identity CompanyTM Trust Stamp announces the 50th Financial Institution to onboard to its low-code Orchestration Layer platform via its channel partnership bringing the total number of financial institutions onboarded to 54.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent disclosure of ArcelorMittal's statutory financial statements provides a comprehensive overview of the company's financial health. A detailed analysis of the balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement would reveal the company's asset quality, profitability and liquidity positions. In particular, investors would be interested in the debt-to-equity ratio, which indicates the level of financial leverage and potential risks associated with it. Moreover, the return on equity (ROE) metric would give insights into how efficiently the company is utilizing its shareholders' equity to generate profits.From a market perspective, these financials are instrumental in recalibrating valuation models. The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, often used to gauge a stock's valuation, could be updated with the latest earnings data to determine if the stock is undervalued or overvalued relative to industry peers. Any significant deviation from expected financial performance could prompt analysts to revise their stock price targets and recommendations, potentially impacting the stock's market performance in the short term. Market Research Analyst An analysis of ArcelorMittal's financial statements extends beyond the numbers. It involves understanding the context of the steel industry's current market dynamics, including demand drivers, supply chain challenges and competitive landscape. For instance, the cost of raw materials and energy prices can significantly affect the company's margins. Observing trends in these areas could help in predicting future financial performance.Additionally, ArcelorMittal's market share and sales volumes in comparison to competitors provide an indication of the company's competitive position. Any strategic initiatives or capital investments outlined in the financial report could signal the company's future growth prospects and potential for market expansion. These insights are important for stakeholders to assess the company's long-term strategic direction and sustainability in a highly cyclical industry. Economist From an economic standpoint, ArcelorMittal's financial results serve as a barometer for the broader steel industry and, by extension, the global economy. The steel industry is often seen as a leading indicator of economic activity due to its ties to construction, automotive and other key sectors. Therefore, strong financial performance might suggest robust industrial activity and economic growth, while weak results could raise concerns about a potential slowdown.Moreover, the company's performance can be influenced by international trade policies, tariffs and currency fluctuations, which are particularly relevant for a global player like ArcelorMittal. The financials could provide insights into how such macroeconomic factors are impacting the company and may offer a glimpse into the economic health of the regions where ArcelorMittal operates. 03/27/2024 - 03:15 PM 27 March 2024, 20:15 CET ArcelorMittal has published the statutory financial statements of ArcelorMittal parent company for the year ended 31 December 2023.

Hoth Therapeutics Announces Exercise of Warrants for $4.2 Million Gross Proceeds,2024-03-27T18:00:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,"Hoth Therapeutics, Inc. (HOTH) announces the immediate exercise of warrants, resulting in approximately $4.2 million in gross proceeds. The company will issue new warrants for the purchase of up to 3,750,000 shares of common stock at a reduced exercise price.","Hoth Therapeutics Announces Exercise of Warrants for $4.2 Million Gross Proceeds Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Hoth Therapeutics, Inc. (HOTH) announces the immediate exercise of warrants, resulting in approximately $4.2 million in gross proceeds. The company will issue new warrants for the purchase of up to 3,750,000 shares of common stock at a reduced exercise price. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The decision by Hoth Therapeutics to adjust the exercise price of its warrants can be seen as a strategic move to incentivize the warrant holders to convert their warrants into equity, thus providing the company with an influx of cash. This is a common practice among companies seeking to raise capital without resorting to additional public or private equity offerings. The immediate cash infusion of approximately $4.2 million, though not substantial for larger firms, could be significant for a small-cap biopharmaceutical company like Hoth Therapeutics, depending on its current cash burn rate and funding requirements for ongoing research and development projects. Investors should note the issuance of new unregistered warrants, which could potentially dilute existing shareholders if exercised. The new exercise price of $1.50 per share, below the original $5.00, may raise concerns about the company's valuation and future stock performance. However, the ability to exercise these new warrants until 2028 provides flexibility and could be seen as a longer-term vote of confidence by the company in its prospects. Biotech Market Analyst In the biopharmaceutical industry, funding is a continuous challenge, especially for patient-focused companies like Hoth Therapeutics that may have significant research and development costs. The capital raised through the exercise of warrants is typically earmarked for advancing clinical trials, scaling up manufacturing, or expanding the pipeline of drug candidates. The timing of this transaction suggests that Hoth Therapeutics may be looking to accelerate its operations or fund a specific project that requires immediate capital. The market's response to such financial maneuvers can vary. On one hand, the reduced exercise price might be perceived as an attractive entry point for investors, which could increase trading volumes and interest in the company's stock. On the other hand, the potential dilution could be a point of concern, as it may affect the stock's value. Observers will be closely monitoring the company's next steps, particularly how effectively the raised funds are deployed towards advancing its biopharmaceutical programs. Securities Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the issuance of new unregistered warrants as part of the transaction is noteworthy. These securities are not registered with the SEC, which means they are subject to certain restrictions on resale and are typically offered to accredited investors. It is important for the company to adhere strictly to the exemptions provided under the Securities Act, such as Regulation D, to avoid any regulatory complications. Investors should be aware of the implications of holding unregistered securities, including the limitations on their liquidity. The fact that these new warrants are immediately exercisable and have a lengthy expiration period suggests that the company is providing an incentive for long-term investment rather than quick turnover, which aligns with the typical investment horizon for stakeholders in the biotech sector. 03/27/2024 - 02:00 PM NEW YORK, March 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Hoth Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: HOTH), a patient focused biopharmaceutical company, today announced the entry into a definitive agreement for the immediate exercise of certain outstanding warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,500,000 shares of common stock of the Company originally issued in January 2023, having an exercise price of $5.00 per share, at a reduced exercise price of $1.6775 per share. The shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants are registered pursuant to an effective registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-269224). The gross proceeds to the Company from the exercise of the warrants are expected to be approximately $4.2 million, prior to deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses. H.C. Wainwright & Co. is acting as the exclusive placement agent for the offering. In consideration for the immediate exercise of the warrants for cash, the Company will issue new unregistered warrants to purchase shares of common stock. The new warrants will be exercisable for an aggregate of up to 3,750,000 shares of common stock, at an exercise price of $1.50 per share, will be immediately exercisable upon issuance and will expire on July 3, 2028. The offering is expected to close on or about April 1, 2024, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general working capital needs. The new warrants described above were offered in a private placement pursuant to an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""1933 Act"") and, along with the shares of common stock issuable upon their exercise, have not been registered under the 1933 Act, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements. The Company has agreed to file a registration statement with the SEC covering the resale of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the new warrants. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.

Tombigbee leverages Calix SmartTown and the Broadband Platform to strategically deploy Wi-Fi systems, educate first responders, and enhance community services. The initiative aims to save lives, improve healthcare access, and ensure crucial communication for deputies in rural areas. Positive None. Negative None. Telecommunications Industry Analyst The initiative by Tombigbee Fiber to provide free Wi-Fi to first responders through Calix SmartTown represents a strategic move in the telecommunications sector, particularly for rural broadband expansion. This approach not only enhances public safety infrastructure but also positions Tombigbee as a community-focused provider, potentially increasing brand loyalty and customer satisfaction. The Net Promoter Score of 91 is significantly higher than industry averages, indicating strong customer advocacy which could lead to organic growth through word-of-mouth.From an industry standpoint, Tombigbee's strategy reflects a growing trend where broadband service providers (BSPs) are increasingly seen as integral community partners rather than mere utility providers. This could set a precedent for other rural BSPs, leading to a potential increase in investments in similar community-centric infrastructure projects. The long-term benefits may include enhanced market penetration and reduced churn, as customers see added value in services that contribute to community welfare. Public Safety Communications Expert Ubiquitous Wi-Fi coverage for first responders is a critical enhancement to emergency services in areas with unreliable cell service. The deployment of the Calix GigaPro® p6he outdoor system by Tombigbee Fiber is a substantial improvement to the communications reliability for emergency personnel. In emergency situations, every second counts and the ability for first responders to connect automatically to reliable broadband can reduce response times and improve coordination efforts during crises.Furthermore, the educational initiatives for first responders on utilizing these new systems are equally important, ensuring that the technology is used effectively. This proactive approach to community safety and service can be seen as an investment in human capital which, in turn, may lead to reduced operational risks and potentially lower insurance premiums for the community over time. Cybersecurity Specialist Tombigbee Fiber's inclusion of ProtectIQ® home network virus, malware and phishing protection in all their packages demonstrates a commitment to cybersecurity that is commendable in the current digital landscape. The emphasis on cybersecurity is particularly pertinent given the increase in cyber threats and the vulnerability of rural areas that may lack robust digital security infrastructure.By offering advanced content controls and network security services at no extra cost, Tombigbee not only enhances the value proposition of their service but also contributes to the overall online safety of their customers. This can lead to a reduction in cybersecurity incidents, which, in the long run, may help in maintaining the integrity of the network and customer trust, potentially reducing costs associated with data breaches and cyber-attacks. 03/27/2024 - 01:30 PM Tombigbee Fiber continues to build on a commitment to improve life for families in rural Mississippi by leveraging Calix SmartTown to connect 68 first responder organizations with free, secure Wi-Fi that extends lifesaving emergency services to everyone in the area SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Today, Calix, Inc.

Soon, the Tombigbee team will deliver the same support to an additional 43 volunteer fire stations to reach hundreds more people. “Parts of our communities cannot even access reliable cell service,” said Scott Hendrix, chief executive officer at Tombigbee Fiber and Tombigbee Electric Power Association. “The Tombigbee network, now free of cost to first responders, will save lives. It will support rural patients in need of immediate healthcare, provide critical communication lines for first responders, and ensure deputies have the backup they need in crucial moments. These are services every person deserves to have access to, regardless of where they live.” To transform how first responders in rural Mississippi save lives and service the community, Tombigbee leverages the capabilities of SmartTown and the complete Calix Broadband Platform.

After engaging with the community, Tombigbee saw enthusiastic responses and signups. “Enabling first responders with free Wi-Fi is our way to give back to those communities and customers we serve,” said Hendrix. “If we can aid in saving one life, then we have succeeded.” Established in 2019 by member-owned cooperative Tombigbee Electric Power Association, Tombigbee Fiber swiftly recognized the pressing need for essential managed services in northern Mississippi. Leveraging their partnership with Calix, they pioneered utilizing managed services to transform their community. They were the first broadband service provider (BSP) to deploy SmartTown to their entire network footprint.

Instead of competing with for-profit companies indifferent to community welfare, we choose to invest directly in our community’s connectivity and wellbeing, making it not only safer but also a more desirable place to live.” “Rural communities need BSPs who step up to do more than provide a connection, and in northern Mississippi, Tombigbee is expanding what they do for the community every day,” said Michael Weening, president and chief executive officer at Calix. “They started by providing ProtectIQ® home network virus, malware, and phishing protection in all packages to ensure that every single customer, including vulnerable elderly and families with young children, can access safe internet experiences. Last year, they deployed SmartTown to provide access to safe Wi-Fi at 9 local football fields. Now, they are making the community safer by supporting lifesaving first responders. “When a first responder drives up to a Tombigbee-connected home with bad cell service, they can be assured that their devices will remain safely connected through SmartTown. This initiative reflects Tombigbee's commitment to improving life in their community and reinforces their 91 NPS. Tombigbee is the first Calix customer to identify the first responder use case for SmartTown, and they made it happen fast—without requiring additional capital investment. We are proud to be their partner in helping to make the Mississippi communities they have served for 90+ years a safer place to live.” Watch this video to learn how Tombigbee transforms life in northern Mississippi by leveraging the Calix Broadband Platform and managed services.

The initiative aims to improve health outcomes by investing in diabetes management services, education, and resources. Positive None. Negative None. Public Health Expert The initiative by CVS Health to invest in health care access and social determinants of health in Phoenix is a strategic move that reflects the growing emphasis on community health and preventive care. By addressing obesity, diabetes and hypertension through integrated services, CVS is tackling some of the most pressing chronic health issues that contribute significantly to healthcare costs. The investment in education and resources to manage these conditions can lead to better health outcomes and potentially reduce the long-term financial burden on the healthcare system.Furthermore, the collaboration with local organizations is essential. These organizations often have a deeper understanding of the community's needs and can ensure that interventions are culturally relevant and accessible. This approach aligns with the best practices in public health, which advocate for community-based participatory research and interventions. The potential benefits extend beyond the immediate population, as successful models of care can be replicated in other communities facing similar challenges. Healthcare Financial Analyst CVS Health's $3 million investment in Phoenix represents a strategic approach to corporate social responsibility with potential long-term financial implications. By investing in preventative health measures and addressing social determinants of health, CVS may be positioning themselves to mitigate future healthcare costs associated with chronic diseases. These costs often manifest as higher insurance payouts, which can impact the bottom line for CVS's Aetna division.The financial commitment spread over three years indicates a long-term vision that may lead to a more health-savvy customer base, potentially driving down the incidence of chronic health conditions. This could result in lower healthcare costs for CVS in the future, as healthier populations typically require less medical intervention. Additionally, this initiative may enhance CVS's brand reputation, potentially increasing customer loyalty and attracting new customers who value community-focused companies. Sustainability Analyst CVS Health's emphasis on sustainability, particularly in the context of the Phoenix community, underscores the importance of environmental factors in public health. The focus on educating the community about the effects of air pollution is a forward-thinking strategy that recognizes the intersectionality of health and the environment. Poor air quality is a known risk factor for various health conditions, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.By addressing air pollution, CVS Health is not only contributing to the immediate health of the community but also to the broader goal of environmental sustainability. This could have a positive impact on the company's sustainability ratings, which are increasingly relevant to investors who are looking for socially responsible investment opportunities. Companies that demonstrate a commitment to environmental and social governance (ESG) principles tend to attract a growing segment of the market interested in sustainable investing. 03/27/2024 - 02:00 PM WOONSOCKET, R.I., March 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- CVS Health® (NYSE: CVS) today announced more than $3 million in new grants to support organizations in Phoenix working to increase equitable access to health care, address social determinants of health and educate the community on the effects of air pollution. This announcement was made during a Project Health event in Phoenix and included CVS Health leaders, community organizations and local officials. ""No two communities are the same,"" said Sheryl Burke, Senior Vice President of Corporate Social Responsibility and Chief Sustainability Officer at CVS Health. ""That's why we are constantly looking for ways to pull together all our community-based and sustainability efforts – like here in Phoenix – to make a meaningful impact and collaborate with organizations who know the community best to address the unique barriers to improving health outcomes. With nearly 12,000 employees working across the state who deliver care through 187 pharmacies, dozens of MinuteClinic®, specialty pharmacy and Oak Street Health® locations, and for a million Aetna® members, this is also a part of our continued work to invest in the communities where we live and work."" Bridging a critical gap in the health care and social systemsWith 65% of South Phoenix residents overweight or obese and knowing that 80% of health care costs are primarily due to preventable chronic diseases, CVS Health saw an opportunity to tailor its Health Zones initiative in Phoenix to address the high levels of diabetes and hypertension. The CVS Health Foundation is investing $2.1 million over three years between Valleywise Health, Home Assist Health and Advance to support integrated diabetes management services, including home health and monitoring, medically tailored food boxes and educational resources. By encouraging this more connected, coordinated use of resources between each Health Zone organization, the company aims to help simplify a complex care navigation process and bridge a critical gap in the health care and social systems. ""We believe that the right resources can transform health outcomes for individuals, families, and communities, greatly reducing or eliminating generational health inequities for improved quality of life for patients in the Greater South Phoenix community,"" said Dr. Michelle Barker, Senior Vice President of Ambulatory Services and Chief Executive Officer of FQHC, Valleywise Health. ""This visionary investment from CVS Health will allow our clinical teams and valued community partners, Home Assist Health and Advance, to wrap our arms around our most vulnerable patients and provide them with the care, education and resources they need to live healthy lives."" Collaborating to educate the community about air pollutionOne in three Americans lives in a community with unhealthy air levels, and Phoenix ranks among the most polluted cities in the U.S. for ozone and particulate pollution. Through a new collaboration with the American Lung Association, CVS Health is investing $3.5 million over four years nationwide to combat this health issue and will pilot it first in Phoenix. The company will distribute nearly $1 million of the $3.5 million project to support Phoenix health care providers and organizations working to expand educational resources, increase access to care and supportive services for individuals with lung disease and leverage local air quality data to raise awareness of where pollution is most concentrated. The Phoenix health care providers and organizations will be named in April. ""Every day, we work with people whose lung health has been impacted by climate change,"" said Harold Wimmer, President and CEO of the American Lung Association. ""It is critical to address this in the communities that are seeing the greatest impact, like Phoenix, and we're thankful to be working with the CVS Health Foundation on this innovative project to improve the health of people in Phoenix who are living with lung disease."" Increasing access to mental health and free screening servicesCVS Health also recently awarded a $100,000 grant over two years to support the Phoenix Indian Center's efforts to fund its Suicide-Safer Communities project, which will expand its suicide prevention services for Native Americans living in Phoenix. As studies continue to show that suicide is among the leading causes of death in the United States, bolstering the Phoenix Indian Center's efforts is part of the company's continued commitment to supporting organizations that improve the quality and availability of mental health services in under-resourced communities. In addition to these new grants, CVS Health will offer free health screenings to the Phoenix community through its Project Health program, starting in March. Project Health mobile unit events are hosted at CVS Pharmacy parking lots and a vast network of local organizations to help ensure transportation is not a barrier to receiving health services. They offer free biometric screenings, including blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose level and body mass index to detect early risks of chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. The screenings also offer a PHQ-2 assessment to help identify people who require additional evaluation for depression. All individuals have an on-site consult with a nurse practitioner and are provided a directory of local health care providers and resources. In 2023, CVS Health hosted 109 events in Phoenix and screened 2,814 participants, including 1,022 depression, 715 osteoporosis bone density, 581 mini-cognitive and 126 smoking cessation consultations. The full schedule of Project Health events can be found online. ""A person's zip code shouldn't determine how long they'll live or whether they'll develop preventable chronic diseases,"" said Phoenix Councilwoman Laura Pastor. ""That's why I'm proud of the over $3 million investment CVS Health is making over the next three years to support diabetes management services and increase access to care and education for individuals with lung diseases throughout Phoenix. As someone who has always advocated for equitable access to health care, I am impressed by the commitment CVS Health continues to show the community by removing barriers and meeting people where they're at to deliver health care.""

Positive 91% of business leadership agree that tuition assistance benefits programs can give organizations a competitive advantage by upskilling the workforce. 85% of business leadership agree that the positive outcomes from offering tuition assistance benefits outweigh the costs of paying for employees’ education. Primary motivations for offering TA programs include building future workforce skills, improving employee retention, and developing high-potential talent. Key performance indicators for measuring TA program success include impact on employee retention, skills gained, and participation rates. Respondents acknowledge the strategic value of TA benefits for both employers and employees, with 89% agreeing on its importance. Challenges for organizations include program cost as a barrier to adoption and employees feeling they lack time to pursue education while working. Negative 39% of business leadership say their organization has not evaluated or made updates to its TA program within the past three years. Barriers like program cost and lack of time hinder organizations from offering TA benefits and employees from utilizing them effectively. 03/27/2024 - 01:31 PM HERNDON, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Harvard Business Review Analytic Services (HBR-AS) released findings from a survey, sponsored by Strategic Education, Inc., of business leadership* that show organizations may be missing out on a key upskilling and retention tool. Ninety-one percent agree that tuition assistance (TA) benefits programs can give organizations a competitive advantage by upskilling the workforce. The survey also revealed that nearly 90% of business leadership agree that, for organizations in their industry, there is strategic value in offering tuition assistance benefits to employees. Yet, despite this agreement, the survey highlights an inherent paradox and an opportunity for employers to gain a competitive advantage. Eighty-five percent of the business leadership surveyed agree that the positive outcomes from offering tuition assistance benefits outweigh the costs of paying for employees’ education. Despite this, 39% of business leadership say their organization has not evaluated or made updates to its TA program within the past three years. “This survey confirms what we consistently hear from the employers we work with – that TA benefits are a critical retention and upskilling tool,” said Karl McDonnell, Chief Executive Officer of Strategic Education, Inc. “Yet, despite its value, its prioritization by employers varies significantly. There is tremendous opportunity for employers to evaluate and update this benefit so they meet the needs of both employees and the organization.” The survey found several common reasons organizations offer TA benefits to their employee base. Among business leadership, their organizations’ most common, primary motivations for offering a program are to build the workforce skills needed for the future (51%), improve employee retention (50%), develop high-potential talent (47%), and increase talent attraction/hiring (43%). The business leadership surveyed also suggested a lack of measurement of TA benefits. When asked what key performance indicators their organization uses to measure success of the program, the most common performance indicators included impact on employee retention (29%), skills or competencies gained by participants (27%), and participation rates (25%). The HBR-AS survey found that respondents overwhelmingly recognize the potential value of TA benefits programs, for both the employer and the employees: 89% agree that, for organizations in their industry, there is strategic value in offering TA benefits to employees. 88% agree that an organization can make its employees feel more engaged at work by offering TA benefits. 86% agree that their organization’s TA program is valuable for the organization. Despite respondent agreement on the value of TA benefits, the survey found that certain barriers prevent organizations from offering them and employees from using them. Among respondents whose organizations do not have a TA benefits program, 68% believe program cost is a barrier to adoption. At organizations with active TA benefit programs, 45% of respondents identified employees not feeling they have enough time to pursue education while working as one of the challenges their organization faces with their TA program. “Like any benefit, tuition benefit programs need to evolve to meet shifting employee and workforce demands. This may mean offering more incentives and support to employees who want to use the benefit or partnering with a tuition benefit platform that makes enrollment and measurement seamless,” explained McDonnell. “To get the most out of this benefit, employers should commit to measuring the impact of the program on the organization, identifying what is working and what is not, and modifying as needed.” To read the full results, visit: https://hbr.org/sponsored/2024/03/realizing-and-unlocking-the-strategic-value-of-tuition-assistance-benefits. *In 2023, Strategic Education, Inc. sponsored Harvard Business Review Analytic Services to conduct a survey of 294 members of the HBR audience (75% are in executive or senior management, 13% in middle management, and 12% in other grades) who are involved in their organization’s decisions about offering U.S. TA benefits.

Tufts Medicine and Acadia Healthcare Break Ground on New Behavioral Health Hospital to Serve the Greater Boston Area,2024-03-27T17:13:00.000Z,Low,Very Positive,"Tufts Medicine and Acadia Healthcare Break Ground on New Behavioral Health Hospital in Malden, Massachusetts","Tufts Medicine and Acadia Healthcare Break Ground on New Behavioral Health Hospital to Serve the Greater Boston Area Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Tufts Medicine and Acadia Healthcare Break Ground on New Behavioral Health Hospital in Malden, Massachusetts Positive None. Negative None. Healthcare Industry Analyst The partnership between Tufts Medicine and Acadia Healthcare to construct a new behavioral health hospital is a strategic move that reflects the growing demand for mental health services. The joint venture is expected to leverage Acadia's expertise in behavioral health and Tufts Medicine's academic resources, potentially creating a robust center for patient care and professional training.From an industry perspective, the investment in a 144-bed facility signals confidence in the long-term need for such services, which may be driven by increasing awareness and destigmatization of mental health issues. The collaboration with local organizations and the integration of a teaching component aligns with broader trends in healthcare towards community engagement and workforce development.For investors, the implications of this development are multifaceted. The construction of the hospital could lead to increased employment opportunities, both during the building phase and once the facility is operational. Additionally, as a center of excellence, the hospital may attract patients from a wider area, potentially increasing revenue streams for both Tufts Medicine and Acadia Healthcare. However, investors should also consider the capital expenditure required and the time frame until the hospital becomes operational in 2025. Medical Education Expert The establishment of a new behavioral health hospital that also functions as a teaching hospital is a significant development in medical education. The Tufts University School of Medicine's involvement suggests an innovative approach to addressing the shortage of behavioral health professionals in Massachusetts.Training students and residents on-site provides them with hands-on experience that is important for their professional development. This model not only benefits the students but also serves the community by potentially increasing the number of qualified practitioners in the region. The focus on creating a pipeline of trained professionals could alleviate the long-term workforce challenges faced by the healthcare industry.For stakeholders, this could translate into a more sustainable healthcare ecosystem with a steady influx of new talent. The quality of training and the reputation of the institutions involved could also enhance the attractiveness of the program to prospective students, further solidifying the hospital's position as a leader in behavioral health education. Community Health Expert The construction of the new behavioral health hospital by Tufts Medicine and Acadia is poised to have a substantial impact on community health infrastructure. The emphasis on serving patients of all ages and providing a continuum of care is indicative of a holistic approach to mental health treatment.Behavioral health hospitals play a critical role in addressing public health challenges and the integration of intensive outpatient programs suggests a commitment to comprehensive care. The collaboration with local organizations and first responders is particularly noteworthy, as it suggests a model of care that extends beyond the hospital walls and into the community.While the benefits to the community could be significant, there may be challenges related to integrating the new facility into the existing healthcare landscape. Ensuring smooth referral pathways and continuity of care with other providers will be essential for maximizing the hospital's positive impact on community health. 03/27/2024 - 01:13 PM MALDEN, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Tufts Medicine, a leading Massachusetts integrated, academic health system, and Acadia Healthcare Company, the largest standalone provider of behavioral health services in the U.S., today held a ceremony to celebrate the start of construction on its previously announced state-of-the-art, 144-bed behavioral health hospital in Malden, Massachusetts. The event occurred on the site of the new hospital located at 100 Hospital Road and celebrated the joint venture partnership between Tufts Medicine and Acadia. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240327491580/en/Tufts Medicine and Acadia Healthcare Break Ground on the Construction of a New Behavioral Health Hospital in Malden, Massachusetts, with an anticipated opening in Fall of 2025. (Photo: Business Wire) “We are pleased construction has begun on our new behavioral health hospital and training site for future behavioral health clinicians,” said Michael Dandorph, President and Chief Executive Officer of Tufts Medicine. “We are excited to have a partner such as Acadia who brings unrivaled behavioral health expertise and shares our commitment to quality patient care. This occasion marks an important milestone in our effort to improve access to behavioral health care for our patients and the region.” Slated to open in the Fall of 2025, the hospital will be a center of excellence serving patients of all ages. For decades, MelroseWakefield Hospital and Lawrence Memorial Hospital have been known and highly respected for the inpatient behavioral healthcare services that they provide in their respective communities. The proposed new hospital will build upon that legacy, offering the latest in inpatient behavioral healthcare and intensive outpatient programs, and providing the continuum of care needed to support patients and their families. Turner Construction Company is the general contractor and Stengel Hill Architecture is the architect for the project. “This new hospital will provide the greater Boston area with expanded access to quality behavioral health services and treatment from specialized clinical teams in a carefully designed environment,” said Chris Hunter, Chief Executive Officer of Acadia Healthcare. “We are so proud to be affiliated with Tufts Medicine, working together to address the strong need in the Commonwealth and building upon their legacy and commitment to behavioral health services. This hospital will be a strong member of the Malden community, collaborating with local organizations, hospitals and first responders.” The new hospital will also serve as a teaching hospital for psychiatry and other behavioral health professionals, training students and residents from the Tufts University School of Medicine. This will help to address the shortage of clinical behavioral healthcare professionals in the area, as many of these new professionals will go on to practice in the Commonwealth and carry forth Tufts Medicine’s work to improve the health and well-being of the state.

This could position Beyond, Inc. at the forefront of e-commerce innovation, provided they execute it effectively. E-commerce Strategy Consultant The announcement of Beyond, Inc.'s partnership for content creation and commerce campaigns is a testament to the evolving nature of retail and the importance of omnichannel strategies. By spotlighting their brands during key events and holidays, they are likely to capture higher sales volumes due to increased consumer spending during these periods.However, the success of this partnership will largely depend on the execution of these campaigns and the quality of content produced.

Additionally, the integration of shopping into this content stream could revolutionize the customer journey, reducing friction and potentially increasing impulse purchases.It's essential for Beyond, Inc. to monitor the performance of these campaigns closely, using metrics such as engagement rates, conversion rates and return on advertising spend (ROAS) to gauge success and inform future strategies.

That altruism is reflected in the organization's mission, and as a result, the FinServ Foundation has shown itself to be a bright spot in an industry which is ever evolving. We are excited to partner with the WSFS CARES Foundation to support local schools like Delaware State University and future professionals in the PA, NJ and DE area.” “We are grateful for the generous grant from the WSFS CARES Foundation and the impact it will have across our region,” said Bernel Hall, President and CEO of New Jersey Community Capital. “This investment will help NJCC continue to foster an equitable path to building wealth that will strengthen neighborhoods in traditionally underserved communities.” “The Wilmington Land Bank is proud to join forces with WSFS Bank in the transformative revitalization of the Lower Hilltop neighborhood,” said Rick Gessner, Board President, Wilmington Land Bank. “This once-neglected community has experienced significant investment in the past two years, and with the generous support of WSFS, we will continue this important work.

The net proceeds will be used for operational needs and expanding silver-copper ore production at its U.S. and Mexico operations.","Americas Gold and Silver Corporation Announces Closing of Financings Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Americas Gold and Silver (USAS) successfully closed an offering, raising $7.8 million through the sale of 21,667,000 Units at $0.30 per Unit. The Company also issued additional Units through private placements, totaling 25,000,000 Units. The net proceeds will be used for operational needs and expanding silver-copper ore production at its U.S. and Mexico operations. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent closure of Americas Gold and Silver Corporation's offering, accumulating $7.8 million in gross proceeds, is a strategic financial maneuver that warrants a closer look from an investment perspective. The company's decision to sell 21.667 million Units at $0.30 each, with an additional 3.333 million Units through a non-brokered private placement, indicates a pursuit of capital infusion to bolster its working capital. This is particularly significant for the Cosalá Operations and Galena Complex, as it suggests an impending scale-up in silver-copper ore production.The inclusion of a common share purchase warrant in each Unit, with an exercise price of C$0.40 for a 36-month period, provides an incentive mechanism that could potentially lead to further capital inflows if the company's stock performs well, thereby diluting existing shares but also providing a cash buffer without immediate debt service requirements. This strategic choice reflects a balance between immediate capital needs and future financing flexibility.Investors should note the potential for share dilution but also consider the growth opportunities that the increased capital could unlock. The success of this offering and the subsequent deployment of funds into the company's operations will be critical to watch, as it could significantly impact the company's financial health and stock performance. Market Research Analyst Examining Americas Gold and Silver Corporation's recent financial activities from a market dynamics perspective, the timing and structure of the offering provide insights into the company's market positioning. The mining sector is capital-intensive and the ability to secure funding through market offerings is often indicative of investor confidence and market appetite for the industry.The price point of $0.30 per Unit is reflective of current market valuation and investor sentiment towards the company. The fully exercised Agent's option suggests a favorable reception among institutional participants, which could be a positive signal to the market. The earmarking of funds for operational transitions towards silver-copper ore production aligns with market trends favoring metals with industrial applications, such as copper, which is in high demand for its use in electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies.It is important for stakeholders to monitor commodity prices and their effects on the company's revenue potential. Shifts in the silver and copper markets could either amplify the impact of this capital raise or dampen the expected benefits, depending on how well the company can capitalize on these market trends. 03/27/2024 - 11:52 AM Not for distribution to United States newswire services or for dissemination in the United States TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Americas Gold and Silver Corporation (TSX: USA, NYSE American: USAS) (the “Company”) is pleased to announce that it has closed its offering as previously announced in its press releases dated March 20, 2024 and March 21, 2024 for total aggregate gross proceeds of $7,800,000 (the “Offering”).

The devices offer higher reliability, withstand 46,000 IOL cycles, and are footprint-compatible with industry standards. They are ideal for high frequency power conditioning systems, high current converters, and more. Positive None. Negative None. Electrical Engineer The introduction of Vishay Intertechnology's new FRED Pt® 500 A Ultrafast soft recovery diode modules represents a significant advancement in power electronics. These modules are engineered to address two critical aspects: efficiency and reliability. The improved life expectancy due to higher IOL cycle tolerance is a noteworthy enhancement. This directly correlates to reduced maintenance costs and downtime, which is particularly beneficial in high-demand applications like high frequency welding and power conditioning systems.From an electrical engineering perspective, the low forward voltage drop and thermal resistance of these diodes are indicative of their ability to operate efficiently under high stress conditions, which can translate into improved performance of the end products. The common cathode configuration also offers design flexibility, potentially simplifying the circuitry and reducing costs associated with additional components. Supply Chain Analyst With a lead time of 26 weeks for the new diode modules, supply chain considerations are crucial. This lead time must be factored into the production planning of OEMs and system integrators. The extended lead time could be indicative of complex manufacturing processes or high demand, which might affect the stock availability and could lead to potential bottlenecks in the supply chain.Furthermore, Vishay's positioning as a key player with one of the largest portfolios of discrete semiconductors and passive electronic components suggests that their product releases could influence market trends in these segments. Adoption rates of the new modules will be a key metric to monitor, as they could affect future stock levels and pricing strategies. Market Research Analyst The semiconductor industry is highly competitive and the release of these modules places Vishay in a strong position within the market for high frequency power conditioning systems. The emphasis on compatibility with existing designs indicates a strategic move to capture market share from competitors by offering a drop-in replacement that doesn't require significant redesign efforts.Assessing the impact on Vishay's market position requires examining customer adoption rates and the performance of these modules in real-world applications. Positive feedback and adoption can lead to an increase in market share and potentially influence the company's financial performance.

Offering higher reliability than previous-generation solutions, the Vishay Semiconductors VS-VSUD505CW60 and VS-VSUD510CW60 are designed to reduce losses and EMI / RFI in high frequency power conditioning systems. The rugged TO-244 package of the diode modules released today withstands 46 000 IOL cycles at given conditions, offering an improved life expectancy over previous-generation devices. In addition, the industry-standard package is footprint-compatible with competing solutions in the TO-244 to provide a drop-in replacement for existing designs. The VS-VSUD505CW60 and VS-VSUD510CW60 are ideally suited for high frequency welding; high current converters and ballast water management systems (BWMS) in railway equipment, cranes, and ships; UPS; and other applications where switching losses comprise a significant portion of the total losses. In these applications, the softness of their recovery eliminates the need for a snubber, reducing component counts and lowering costs. Offered in a common cathode configuration, the diode modules provide low forward voltage drop down to 0.82 V, thermal resistance — junction to case — of 0.16 °C/W, and an operating temperature range up to +175 °C.

Templeton Emerging Markets Income Fund (“TEI” or the “Fund”) Notification of Sources of Distributions,2024-03-27T15:36:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Templeton Emerging Markets Income Fund (TEI) announces sources of distributions for March 2024 and fiscal year 2024. The estimated allocations reveal a distribution per share of $0.0475 for March, with 92% from net investment income and 8% from net realized short-term capital gains. For the fiscal year-to-date, the distribution per share is $0.0950, with 74% from net investment income and 26% from return of capital.

The Fund reports a cumulative loss in undistributed net realized and unrealized capital gains and losses totaling $3.5063 per share. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement from Templeton Emerging Markets Income Fund regarding its distribution sources provides a snapshot into the fund's current financial health. Notably, the significant portion of the distribution, 92% for the March monthly distribution, comes from net investment income, which is a positive indicator of the fund's ability to generate revenue through its investments. However, the absence of net realized short-term and long-term capital gains in the cumulative fiscal year-to-date allocations could suggest a lack of profitable investment sales or a conservative strategy in realizing gains.Furthermore, the disclosure of a cumulative loss in undistributed net realized and unrealized capital gains and losses is critical. This figure, especially the $1.3768 per share in unrealized depreciation, may raise concerns about the fund's asset valuation and portfolio performance. Investors should consider the potential for future distributions to be affected by these unrealized losses, as they may eventually need to be realized, impacting the fund's ability to maintain its current level of distributions. Tax Specialist From a tax perspective, the composition of the fund's distributions can have significant implications for shareholders. The predominance of the distribution being classified as net investment income could be more favorable for shareholders, as it may be taxed at different rates compared to capital gains, depending on individual tax situations. The lack of capital gains distributions could also mean that shareholders will not be subject to taxes on capital gains in the current period, which could be advantageous for tax planning purposes.It's important to note that the return of capital component of the distribution is zero for both the March distribution and fiscal year-to-date. This suggests that the fund is not returning any principal to shareholders but is instead paying out from its income. While this can be a sign of a fund's operational efficiency, it also means that shareholders' cost basis is not being reduced, which could have tax implications upon the sale of shares. Investment Strategist Investors often look at the source of fund distributions to gauge the sustainability of income streams. In this case, the fund's reliance on net investment income rather than capital gains to support its distributions signals a strategy that may prioritize income-generating investments over capital appreciation. This could resonate with income-focused investors, particularly during volatile market periods where stable income is prized.However, the reported cumulative loss hints at potential underlying issues with the fund's investment strategy or market conditions that have negatively impacted the portfolio. Investors might be cautious and seek further clarity on the fund's long-term strategy and how management plans to address the unrealized depreciation of portfolio securities. The ability of the fund to navigate these challenges will be instrumental in maintaining investor confidence and ensuring the sustainability of future distributions. 03/27/2024 - 11:36 AM FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Templeton Emerging Markets Income Fund [NYSE: TEI] Notification of Sources of Distributions Pursuant to Section 19(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 The Fund’s estimated sources of the distribution to be paid on March 28, 2024, and for the fiscal year 2024 year-to-date are as follows: Estimated Allocations for March Monthly Distribution as of February 29, 2024: Distribution Per Share Net Investment Income Net Realized Short-Term Capital Gains Net Realized Long-Term Capital Gains Return of Capital $0.0475 $0.0439 (92%) $0.0036 (8%) $0.00 (0%) $0.00 (0%) Cumulative Estimated Allocations fiscal year-to-date as of February 29, 2024, for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024: Distribution Per Share Net Investment Income Net Realized Short-Term Capital Gains Net Realized Long-Term Capital Gains Return of Capital $0.0950 $0.0707 (74%) $0.00 (0%) $0.00 (0%) $0.0243 (26%) The Fund has experienced a cumulative loss in undistributed net realized and unrealized capital gains and losses totaling $3.5063 per share. Of that amount, $1.3768 per share represents unrealized depreciation of portfolio securities. Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the Plan. TEI estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of the TEI distribution to shareholders may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that a shareholder invested in a Fund is paid back to them. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect TEI’s investment performance and should not be confused with ‘yield’ or ‘income’. The amounts and sources of distributions reported herein are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund’s investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send a Form 1099-DIV to shareholders for the calendar year that will describe how to report the Fund’s distributions for federal income tax purposes. Average Annual Total Return (in relation to the change in net asset value (NAV) for the 5-year period ended on 2/29/2024)1 Annualized Distribution Rate (as a percentage of NAV for the current fiscal period through 2/29/2024)2 Cumulative Total Return (in relation to the change in NAV for the fiscal period through 2/29/2024)3 Cumulative Fiscal Year-To-Date Distribution Rate (as a percentage of NAV as of 2/29/2024)4 -3.83 9.52% 3.16% 1.59% Fund Performance and Distribution Rate Information: Average Annual Total Return in relation to NAV represents the compound average of the Annual NAV Total Returns of the Fund for the five-year period ended through February 29, 2024. Annual NAV Total Return is the percentage change in the Fund’s NAV over a year, assuming reinvestment of distributions paid. The Annualized Distribution Rate is the current fiscal period’s distribution rate annualized as a percentage of the Fund’s NAV through February 29, 2024. Cumulative Total Return is the percentage change in the Fund’s NAV from December 31, 2023 through February 29, 2024, assuming reinvestment of distributions paid. The Cumulative Fiscal Year-To-Date Distribution Rate is the dollar value of distributions for the fiscal period December 31, 2023 through February 29, 2024, as a percentage of the Fund’s NAV as of February 29, 2024. The Fund’s Board of Trustees (the “Board”) has authorized a managed distribution plan (the “Plan”) pursuant to which the Fund makes monthly distributions to shareholders at the fixed rate of $0.0475 per share. The Plan is intended to provide shareholders with consistent distributions each month and is intended to narrow the discount between the market price and the net asset value (“NAV”) of the Fund’s common shares, but there can be no assurance that the Plan will be successful in doing so. The Fund is managed with a goal of generating as much of the distribution as possible from net ordinary income and short-term capital gains, that is consistent with the Fund’s investment strategy and risk profile. To the extent that sufficient distributable income is not available on a monthly basis, the Fund will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return of capital in order to maintain its managed distribution rate. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that was invested in the Fund is paid back to shareholders. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund’s investment performance and should not be confused with “yield” or “income”. Even though the Fund may realize current year capital gains, such gains may be offset, in whole or in part, by the Fund’s capital loss carryovers from prior years. The Board may amend the terms of the Plan or terminate the Plan at any time without prior notice to the Fund’s shareholders. The amendment or termination of the Plan could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund’s common shares. The Plan will be subject to the periodic review by the Board, including a yearly review of the fixed rate to determine if an adjustment should be made.

Positive None. Negative None. 03/27/2024 - 11:43 AM MATHESON, Ontario, March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mayfair Gold Corp. (“Mayfair” or the “Company”) (TSX-V: MFG; OTCQB: MFGCF) today announced that the Company’s Board of Directors has approved advancing the 100% controlled Fenn-Gib gold project in the Timmins region of Ontario to the pre-feasibility study phase. The Company’s pre-feasibility study will build further on the metallurgical, geotechnical, hydrogeology, and environmental evaluations completed to date to develop a clearly defined project description in support of an environmental assessment. Mayfair has engaged AGP Mining Consultants (“AGP”) as lead engineers of a multi-disciplinary group (“AGP Group”) to deliver the pre-feasibility study. Mayfair’s president and CEO, Patrick Evans, commented: “Initiation of the Fenn-Gib pre-feasibility study is a major milestone towards the potential development of the Fenn-Gib project. Since acquiring Fenn-Gib approximately three years ago, Mayfair has increased the mineral resource by more than 70 percent and ongoing drilling continues to deliver encouraging results that are expected to further grow the resource. In 2023, Mayfair completed pre-feasibility level metallurgical, geotechnical, and hydrogeology studies to de-risk the project ahead of the pre-feasibility study. Three years of baseline environmental studies have also confirmed that there are no species at risk within the Fenn-Gib project area. By following a rigorous and disciplined pre-feasibility approach, we expect the viability of the Fenn-Gib project will be enhanced.” At the start of the pre-feasibility study, the AGP Group will undertake tradeoff studies to define the optimal parameters of the project. The tradeoff studies are expected to be completed in Q2 2024, following which guidance will be provided for the completion of the pre-feasibility study. Mayfair Gold today also announced the resignation of Mr. Sean Pi as a director of the Company. Mr. Pi, a partner at Heeney Capital, is a co-founder of Mayfair and has served as a director since the formation of the Company in 2019. Mr. Harry Pokrandt, chairman of Mayfair, commented: “On behalf of the Board of Mayfair, I thank Mr. Pi for his service as a director. His contribution to the formation of the Company and subsequent acquisition of the Fenn-Gib project contributed significantly to the success of Mayfair Gold. We wish Mr. Pi every success in his future endeavors.” About MayfairMayfair Gold is a Canadian mineral exploration company focused on advancing the 100% controlled Fenn-Gib gold project in the Timmins region of Northern Ontario.

Negative None. 03/27/2024 - 12:04 PM VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Algernon Pharmaceuticals Inc. (the “Company” or “Algernon”) (CSE: AGN) (FRANKFURT: AGW0) (OTCQB: AGNPF), a Canadian clinical stage pharmaceutical development company, is pleased to announce that it has closed on its agreement with Seyltx Inc. (“Seyltx”), a privately owned U.S. based drug development company, for the acquisition of Algernon’s NP-120 (“Ifenprodil”) research program for the purchase price of USD $2M cash and a 20% common share equity position in Seyltx. The Company previously announced on November 22, 2003 that it had signed a Letter of Intent with Seyltx, to acquire Algernon’s Ifenprodil research program. Ifenprodil is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (“NMDA”) receptor antagonist specifically targeting the NMDA type subunit 2B (GluN2B), which prevents glutamate signaling. Ifenprodil is one of Algernon’s lead research programs and represents a novel first-in-class potential treatment for chronic cough. It is thought to interfere with central signalling in the brain, suppressing the urge to cough. “There are multiple converging lines of evidence that define GluN2B as the master regulator of the cough reflex in the deep brain, including human clinical data with the allosteric inhibitor Ifenprodil in the hardest to treat cough population, those with underlying idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, illustrating dramatic reductions in cough counts. This human efficacy data is complemented by an extensive safety package that de-risks the final phases of clinical development,” said Dietrich A. Stephan, Ph.D. co-founder and CEO of Seyltx. “I have great respect for the Algernon team who have done an outstanding job at maturing the program to this point, and we look forward to completing the clinical development of this exciting agent for a common and debilitating condition.” Seyltx plans to initiate an Ifenprodil multi-center Phase 2b placebo-controlled chronic cough study in CY2024. Algernon’s clinical management team will be available to provide support, oversight, and management of the study. “We are very pleased to have closed this transaction with Seyltx,” said Christopher J. Moreau, Algernon’s Chief Executive Officer. “We believe that Ifenprodil, a first in class potential treatment for chronic cough could outperform all other drugs that have been clinically investigated to date. We look forward to working with Seyltx as they advance Ifenprodil into the Phase 2b clinical trial.” In connection with the transaction, Maxim Group LLC was paid a transaction advisory services fee pursuant to an agreement with Algernon whereby Maxim was retained to identify and evaluate potential M&A and strategic opportunities. Algernon’s Phase 2a Study Data Algernon’s decision to advance to a Phase 2b cough study was based on positive data previously reported from the Company’s proof of concept Phase 2a study of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (“IPF”) and chronic cough, where Ifenprodil showed a significant reduction in cough count. Patients with IPF are usually excluded from trials in refractory chronic cough (“RCC”), and cough in this population is regarded as extremely difficult to treat. Key Data: The geometric mean 24-hour cough counts were reduced by 32.0% at 4 weeks(p = 0.023) and 39.5% at 12 weeks (p = 0.001) compared to baselineThe geometric mean awake cough counts were reduced by 30.2% at 4 weeks(p = 0.038) and 37.4% at 12 weeks (p = 0.002) compared to baselineAlgernon previously announced on January 14, 2022, that it had received positive feedback from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration at its pre-Investigational New Drug (pre-IND) meeting for its investigation of Ifenprodil solely for the treatment of chronic cough. About Chronic Cough Chronic cough is defined as a cough lasting for more than eight weeks in duration and in the United States cough continues to be one of the most common reasons that adults consult medical doctors. Some cases of chronic cough are so debilitating that quality of life is severely impacted leading to depression, anxiety, urinary incontinence, dysphonia, sleep interruption, vomiting, and even rib fractures further adding to the decay in socio-familial dynamics. Chronic cough is believed to be the result of a hypersensitivity of the cough reflex within the neuronal circuitry that governs the urge to cough, wherein one or more aspects that regulate cough are over-active to stimulus, triggering a cough at abnormal levels. Trials of cough suppressants (“Antitussives”) have shown differences in response that may reflect differing pathological processes driving cough in different patients. Experimental Antitussives (like gefapixant and camlipixant) often only engage a single receptor, while the overall cough response is governed by multiple receptors triggered by a large variety of stimuli. A compound like Ifenprodil, acting centrally in the brain where all peripheral messages are sent and coordinated, may achieve a better outcome than what has been achieved by others in clinical trials. Chronic Cough Market According to Data Bridge Market Research analyses, the global chronic cough market was valued at USD $6.15B in 2021 and is projected to grow up to USD $11.38B by 2029. Merck & Co. obtained the rights to gefapixant, a P2X3 receptor antagonist, as the lead asset in the acquisition of Afferent Pharmaceuticals in 2016. At the time, gefapixant had interim data from a Phase 2b study in RCC. The deal was worth up to USD $1.25 billion. Bellus Health, which was advancing camlipixant, its own novel P2X3 receptor antagonist, closed a deal on June 16, 2023 with GSK plc which bought all the outstanding shares in Bellus for USD $14.75 per share in cash with a total deal value estimated at USD $2 billion, confirming the need for better therapies for chronic cough. About NP-120 (Ifenprodil) NP-120 selectively inhibits GluN2B receptors which diminish excitability of neurons and prevent the relaying of information along neuronal circuitry, including the cough reflex. NP-120 may also inhibit the neuroplastic enhancement of central and peripheral cough response neurons. About Seyltx Inc. Seyltx is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on addressing refractory chronic cough by modulating the master switch of the cough reflex in the brain. Refractory chronic cough is a common disorder estimated to affect between 4-5 million individuals in the United States alone, for which there exist no effective therapies. About Algernon Pharmaceuticals Inc. Algernon Pharmaceuticals is a Canadian clinical stage drug development company investigating multiple drugs for unmet global medical needs. Algernon Pharmaceuticals has active research programs for chronic kidney disease and is the parent company of a private subsidiary called Algernon NeuroScience, that is advancing a psychedelic program investigating a proprietary form of DMT for stroke and traumatic brain injury.

Positive Record annual profits exceeding $300 million, a 60% increase from the previous year EPS of $9.93 and EBITDA of $490 million reported 100% increase in common dividends for shareholders Dynamic growth and fleet renewal initiatives, including a green ship initiative Market fundamentals remain strong for TEN Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of TEN Ltd's record annual profits and the increase of their common dividend is a significant indicator of the company's financial health and strategic direction. The 60% increase in net income, coupled with a 24% increase in adjusted EBITDA, reflects a robust operational performance. The substantial rise in average TCE per ship per day suggests that TEN has effectively capitalized on favorable market rates, which is indicative of a strong demand for shipping services. The reduction in total debt obligations is a positive sign for investors, as it indicates prudent financial management and a commitment to de-leveraging the balance sheet.From a financial perspective, the increase in vessel operating expenses and overhead costs is noteworthy, as it reflects the broader inflationary pressures affecting global economies. However, the company's ability to maintain solid cash balances despite these pressures is commendable. The dynamic growth and fleet renewal, with a focus on 'green ship initiatives', aligns with the increasing emphasis on environmental sustainability in the shipping industry and may provide a competitive advantage in the long run.The doubling of the common dividend is a clear signal to shareholders of the company's confidence in its financial position and future prospects. However, investors should be aware of potential risks associated with the shipping industry, such as fluctuations in global trade volumes, charter rates and operational costs, which could impact future earnings. Market Research Analyst Analysis of TEN's financial results reveals a strategic positioning within a shipping industry that continues to show strong market fundamentals. The company's focus on fleet renewal and the green ship initiative demonstrates an understanding of the long-term trends in the industry, particularly the shift towards more environmentally friendly operations. This strategic foresight is likely to resonate with stakeholders who are increasingly valuing sustainability.The high vessel utilization rate and increased TCE suggest that TEN is optimizing its fleet efficiency, which is important in an industry where margins can be significantly impacted by operational downtime. The decision to invest in new vessel acquisitions and the construction of a suezmax DP2 Shuttle Tanker with a long-term charter agreement indicates a forward-looking approach to securing future revenue streams.It's important to note that the shipping industry is cyclical and sensitive to global economic conditions. While the current market fundamentals are strong, changes in trade policies, geopolitical tensions, or economic downturns could alter the landscape. Investors should consider how TEN's strategic initiatives position it to weather potential industry downturns and capitalize on market upswings. Environmental Sustainability Expert TEN's green ship initiative represents a proactive approach to the increasing regulatory and societal pressures for environmental sustainability within the maritime sector. The investment in newer, more efficient vessels is likely to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and operational costs over time. This initiative not only addresses the environmental impact but also aligns with the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) regulations aimed at reducing the shipping industry's carbon footprint.From an environmental perspective, the modernization of the fleet with more energy-efficient ships can lead to a reduction in fuel consumption, which is one of the most significant operational expenses for shipping companies. Furthermore, the company's commitment to environmental sustainability can enhance its reputation among consumers and investors, potentially leading to more business opportunities and a stronger market position.However, the transition to greener operations requires substantial capital investment and the returns on such investments may take time to materialize. Stakeholders should evaluate the balance between the short-term financial impact of these investments and the long-term benefits of improved sustainability and regulatory compliance. 03/27/2024 - 11:00 AM Record annual profits in excess of $300 million – an increase of 60% - EPS of $9.93 EBITDA of $490 million 100% increase of common dividend Dynamic growth and fleet renewal with green ship initiative Market fundamentals remain strong ATHENS. Greece, March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TEN, Ltd. (TEN) (NYSE: TNP) (the “Company”) reports results (unaudited) for the fourth quarter and the year ended December 31, 2023. FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR 2023TEN celebrated its 30th year as a public company, with another record year performance. In 2023 it generated $890 million in revenues resulting to a net income of $327 million before impairment charges, a significant increase from last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the year reached $490 million, $95 million higher than in 2022, a 24% increase. Average TCE per ship per day for 2023 amounted to $36,822, 21% higher from the 2022 level while vessel utilization climbed to 96.3% in 2023 from 94.7% the prior year. Depreciation and amortization combined for 2023 remained relatively stable compared to 2022 at $144 million. The Company’s total debt obligations were reduced from the 2022 level and settled at $1.56 billion at December 31, 2023. Interest and finance costs continued to be impacted by higher rates globally and reached $101 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This elevated rate environment resulted to an increase of interest income from $2 million in 2022 to $15 million in 2023. Vessel overhead costs per ship per day in 2023 were at $1,535 from $1,248 in the 2022 equivalent period while operating expenses settled at $9,617 in 2023 from $8,467 in 2022 impacted by the global inflationary pressures evident in world economies for most of 2023. Cash balances, as on December 31, 2023 remained solid at $377 million, $67 million higher the December 31, 2022, levels after approximately $138 million of preferred shares redemptions and common stock dividends, from cash reserves, that took place during the year. FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2023 The fourth quarter of 2023 was a transitional period for TEN, as it operated six fewer vessels than the same period in 2022 due to vessel sales and before the add-on of the five new vessel acquisitions. This resulted to an adjusted EBITDA of $124 million from $159 million in the 2022 fourth quarter and an operating income of $83 million before impairment charges. This reduction in the number of vessels led to equivalent decreases in voyage, charter hire and operating expenses when compared to the 2022 fourth quarter with the most notable decrease being in voyage expenses which were $9 million lower than the 2022 level. Depreciation and amortization remained largely unchanged at $38 million in the 2023 fourth quarter. As a result of this reduced fleet, operating income in the fourth quarter of 2023, amounted to $83 million with a resulting net income at $58 million, or $1.74 per share before impairment charges. Fleet utilization reached 98.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023 from a still high 97.4% in the 2022 fourth quarter due to the increase of vessels in time-charter employment. The average daily Time Charter Equivalent (TCE) rate per vessel in the fleet reached $35,565 with vessel operating expenses per ship per day at $9,607 during the fourth quarter of 2023. DIVIDEND – CORPORATE AFFAIRS Reflecting its strong performance and positive market fundamentals, the Company will pay $0.60 per common share semi-annual dividend in June 2024 which is double the amount distributed in 2023 for the same period. Management intends to distribute a second semi-annual dividend to holders of its common shares in December 2024. SUBSEQUENT EVENTSIn February 2024, TEN signed a newbuilding contract with a major South Korean yard for the construction of one option one suezmax DP2 Shuttle Tanker with expected delivery in 2026. The vessel has a 10-year employment with a major energy concern with embedded charterer options to increase the duration of the charter to a maximum of 20 years. The expected gross revenues over the maximum life of this contract are about $500 million. Under the recently announced agreement to acquire five-modern eco-friendly tankers employed on term contracts, the first vessel, the DF Montmartre, a 2023-built LNG-powered LR2 aframax tanker was delivered to the Company on March 26, 2024. The other four are expected to join the fleet between early April 2024 and June 2024. STRATEGY & OUTLOOKTEN celebrated its 30th year with a record performance and is on a springboard for future growth. Following its tried and tested strategy of vessel renewal, it has sold nine vessels of an average age of 18.5 years and replaced them with 16 vessels with an average of 1.3 years, whilst increasing its dwt by 1.5 million tonnes. It has used the strong market fundamentals to extend and secure new employments with profit-sharing arrangements for 32 of its vessels, resulting to $2 billion of minimum contracted revenues. “Strong balance sheet, high utilization, operational excellence and our environmentally friendly fleet secures visibility of growing earnings and allows TEN to further reward its shareholders going forward”, said Mr George Saroglou, President and COO of TEN.

This collaboration with Skylo enables devices to maintain reliable communication links, even in remote areas, by providing access to satellite networks. Positive None. Negative None. Telecommunications Analyst The integration of Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) support into Semtech's HL series modules represents a strategic move in the telecommunications industry, potentially disrupting traditional connectivity paradigms. Satellite communication, once a niche and expensive option, is increasingly becoming mainstream, thanks to advancements in technology and greater demand for global coverage. Semtech's collaboration with Skylo could open up new markets and applications where continuous connectivity is essential, such as maritime and logistics, emergency services and remote monitoring.The potential impact on the business is multifold. Firstly, the ability to maintain connections in remote areas can lead to increased adoption of IoT devices, which could, in turn, drive up the demand for Semtech's modules. Secondly, the partnership with Skylo could create a competitive advantage by offering a differentiated product that leverages Skylo's network, which may not be readily available to competitors. This could potentially lead to increased market share and revenue for Semtech. However, the adoption rate and the practical performance of the technology in real-world conditions will be critical to monitor. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the software update enabling NTN capabilities is a significant value proposition for customers in industries where connectivity is non-negotiable. The decision to provide this update as a software enhancement to existing products can be seen as a customer retention strategy, ensuring that current users of the HL78 modules see immediate benefits without additional hardware investments. This could lead to increased customer loyalty and potentially reduce churn.Furthermore, the move to integrate NTN support aligns with the growing trend of 'always-on' connectivity and could position Semtech as a forward-thinking player in the IoT space. However, the long-term success of this initiative will depend on the effectiveness of the commercial rollout, the reliability of the Skylo network and the ability of Semtech to communicate these benefits to potential customers. The market will be watching closely to see how this development affects Semtech's financial performance in the quarters following the commercial release. Financial Analyst Investors should consider the implications of Semtech's announcement in the context of the company's growth strategy and potential return on investment. The move to enhance the HL78 modules with NTN support could be seen as a proactive investment in product development, which may lead to increased revenue streams in the future. The partnership with Skylo indicates a strategic alliance that could lower the barriers to entry into the satellite connectivity market and potentially improve profit margins through shared infrastructure and technology.It is important to note that while the announcement is promising, the actual financial impact will depend on the successful execution of the software update, market adoption rates and the scalability of the solution. Investors should also consider the potential risks associated with the reliance on a single partner for network capabilities and the need for ongoing investment in technology to maintain a competitive edge. 03/27/2024 - 11:00 AM CAMARILLO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Semtech Corporation (Nasdaq: SMTC), a high-performance semiconductor, IoT systems, and connectivity service provider, today announced the integration of Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) support into its HL series LPWA modules, specifically the HL7810 and HL7812. This significant advancement showcases a major leap forward in enabling uninterrupted global connectivity even amidst the most challenging conditions. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240327462605/en/Semtech Sierra Wireless HL781 Series Module with NTN capabilities (Graphic: Semtech) Connectivity is crucial for ensuring safety and driving business success. Semtech’s LPWA HL78 modules, now upgraded with NTN support via a straightforward software update, enable devices to maintain dependable global connectivity through satellite networks, supporting continuous connection even in the most isolated regions. Semtech has partnered with Skylo, a pioneer in offering satellite over cellular services, to integrate NTN capabilities into its HL series modules. As a result of this collaboration, Semtech’s upcoming software update, slated for commercial release in Q2 and pending testing and certification on Skylo’s network, will provide access to Skylo’s expansive network.

The ability to maintain continuous coverage, particularly in applications like container tracking, addresses the challenges posed by the limitations of conventional cellular networks, marking a significant advancement in enabling consistent connectivity. “By incorporating NTN support into our HL78 modules via a straightforward software update, we are enhancing the capabilities of our existing products, providing our customers with a substantial competitive edge,” stated Michael Buonassisi, Director Product Management LPWA modules at Semtech. “This initiative demonstrates our dedication to innovation and our proactive approach to addressing the market’s evolving needs.” “We are thrilled to partner with Semtech to bring the power of Non-Terrestrial Networks to the HL series modules. This collaboration marks a significant milestone in our mission to bridge the connectivity gap, providing reliable, global communication solutions that meet the needs of today’s digital world. Together with Semtech, we are setting a new standard for connectivity, ensuring that no device is left unconnected, no matter where it is located on the globe,” said Dr. Andrew Nuttal, CTO and Co-Founder of Skylo.

By pairing with AirVantage® Smart Connectivity, customers can take advantage of one global SIM as well as a single point of access to both device and SIM lifecycle management. This compatibility underscores Semtech’s commitment to providing comprehensive connectivity solutions, from device to cloud, that cater to a wide range of customer needs. “As the communication industry evolves towards more integrated and versatile solutions, Semtech continues to lead the way, driving innovation and delivering technologies that connect the world,” added Nicolas Damour, Senior Director of Strategic Partnerships at Semtech.

The trend of using family money for down payments has doubled in recent years due to soaring home prices. Financial challenges like lower wages, student debt, and inflation make homeownership difficult for young adults without family support. Positive None. Negative None. Economist The trend of young Americans relying on family assistance for home down payments is indicative of broader economic challenges. Housing affordability has become a significant issue, particularly for Gen Zers and millennials. This demographic is grappling with a stagnation in real wage growth relative to the cost of living, exacerbated by student debt and inflation. The reliance on family wealth for property acquisition not only reflects the stratification of economic opportunity but also raises concerns about the perpetuation of wealth inequality.From an economic perspective, this shift could lead to a reinforcement of existing wealth disparities, as those without familial financial support may find it increasingly difficult to enter the housing market. This could, in turn, affect future consumer spending patterns and savings rates among young adults. The long-term implications may include a delay in wealth accumulation for a significant portion of the population, potentially impacting their financial stability and the broader economy. Market Research Analyst The data presented suggests a change in the dynamics of the housing market. The increase in young homebuyers relying on family support, from 18% in 2019 to 36% recently, points to a market shift where familial wealth plays a more significant role in home purchasing. This could influence the real estate market, potentially leading to increased demand for homes in certain price brackets or areas that are perceived as more family-friendly investments.Additionally, this trend may have implications for the types of services and products that real estate companies and financial institutions offer. We might see an uptick in products tailored to multi-generational financial planning or down payment assistance programs that cater to those without access to family funds. Understanding these market shifts is important for businesses operating within the real estate and financial sectors to stay competitive and address the evolving needs of homebuyers. Social Scientist The reliance on family for financial assistance in home purchasing is not just an economic issue but also a social phenomenon. It underscores the changing landscape of family dynamics and intergenerational wealth transfer. This trend may lead to a deeper investigation into the social fabric of American society, where family support systems become integral to achieving certain milestones, such as homeownership, which has traditionally been seen as a marker of individual success.The term 'nepo-homebuyers' coined by Redfin's Chief Economist captures the essence of this social shift. It suggests that social capital—the networks and relationships that can be converted into economic gain—is becoming as significant as financial capital. The impact on social mobility and the concept of the American Dream, where success is ostensibly attainable through individual effort, is profound. This phenomenon warrants further research into its long-term effects on societal values and aspirations. 03/27/2024 - 10:27 AM Young Americans who have the means are turning to family for help with down payments as housing costs soar. SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- (NASDAQ: RDFN)—More than one-third (36%) of Gen Zers and millennials who plan to buy a home soon expect to receive a cash gift from family to help fund their down payment, according to a new report from Redfin (redfin.com), the technology-powered real estate brokerage. Young homebuyers are also receiving help from family members in other ways. Roughly one in six (16%) Gen Zers and millennials say they’ll use an inheritance to help fund their down payment, and 13% plan to live with their parents or other family members to save money for down payments. Working to earn money is the most common way for young buyers to fund down payments: 60% report they’ll save directly from paychecks, and 39% are likely to work a second job, the most common responses to this question. That’s based on a Redfin-commissioned survey conducted by Qualtrics in February 2024. The nationally representative survey was fielded to roughly 3,000 U.S. homeowners and renters. Young homebuyers are twice as likely to use family money for down payment than they were 5 years ago Just 18% of millennials used a cash gift from family to help fund their down payment in 2019, according to a Redfin survey from that time, and the share had only increased to 23% by 2023. Note that the 2019 and 2023 survey results noted here are for millennials only, while the results in this report are for millennials combined with Gen Zers. Young Americans are increasingly turning to family to help fund down payments largely because it’s increasingly expensive to purchase a home. U.S. home prices are up nearly 40% from before the pandemic, and they rose 7% in the last year alone, with low inventory propping up prices despite dwindling demand. In many ways, Gen Zers and millennials face a more difficult financial landscape than their parents did at the same age: Their wages are lower than their parents’ wages were, they have more student loan debt, and inflation has pushed up the cost of nearly everything, including housing. The fact that so many young Americans rely on help from family to afford a down payment is emblematic of the fact that housing is simply too expensive. A recent Redfin analysis found that starter homes are getting much more difficult to afford, pricing many Americans out of the starter-home market altogether. People without financial help from family are at a major disadvantage when it comes to purchasing a home. “Nepo-homebuyers have a growing advantage over first-generation homebuyers. Because housing costs have soared so much, many young adults with family money get help from Mom and Dad even when they have jobs and earn a perfectly respectable income,” said Redfin Chief Economist Daryl Fairweather. “The bigger problem is that young Americans who don’t have family money are often shut out of homeownership. Many of them earn a perfectly good income, too, but they aren’t able to afford a home because they’re at a generational disadvantage; they don’t have a pot of family money to dip into. This contributes to wealth inequality and often prevents young people from gaining economic ground on their peers who come from more privileged backgrounds. The American Dream is just as much about class mobility as it is the home with a white-picket fence, and the housing affordability crisis has made both elements of the dream harder to attain.” Survey results show that lack of affordability is biggest barrier to homeownership for young Americans Among the young Americans who aren’t likely to buy a home in the near future, lack of affordability is the biggest barrier. Nearly half (43%) of Gen Zers and millennials say they’re unlikely to purchase a home soon because the homes on the market are too expensive, the most common response. Roughly one-third (34%) say their ability to save for a down payment is a barrier to buying a home, the next most common response, followed by ability to afford mortgage payments (29%) and high mortgage rates (29%). Of the Gen Zers and millennials who aren’t planning to buy a home in the near future, 16% cited lack of financial support from family or friends as a reason. More than one in 10 (12%) young Americans said they need to pay off student loans before they would be able to purchase a home.
