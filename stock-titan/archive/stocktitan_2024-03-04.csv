Positive None. Negative None. 03/04/2024 - 05:00 AM VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / March 4, 2024 / Q Battery Metals Corp. (""Q Battery Metals"" or the ""Company) (CSE:QMET) is pleased to announce that the Company is currently in discussion with a Diamond Drilling Contractor to undertake drilling on the company's properties in 2024. The company expects to sign an agreement with the contractor in the near future. The agreement as discussed to date includes beneficial terms that are favorable to both Q Metals and the drilling contractor. In the duration, the company will continue to receive statements of interest from other drillers. Diamond drilling is being planned for the La Corne South and McKenzie East projects.At the La Corne South, exploration to date has identified potential for lithium mineralization, as well as Volcanic Massive Sulphide (VMS) mineralization. The best lithium value of 622 ppm was obtained from blocks of rock found at surface on the margin of a ridge of outcrop. Two samples were taken from these blocks, both of which returned elevated Li, along with Cs, Al and Be, all indicators for pegmatite that can potentially be lithium bearing. The float blocks are interpreted as having been derived from a nearby source (see news releases dated October 15, 2023).A number of surface outcrops and diamond drilling intercepts containing massive sulphide have been documented on the La Corne South property (see news releases dated July 28, 2020, and January 24, 2021). Historic trenching has uncovered a series of massive sulphide bodies on the property that were sampled primarily for gold content. Diamond drilling in 1971, 1972, 1978, 1987, and 2004 by Exploration Louphior, Sullico Mines, Hudbay Mining, and Noranda Inc intercepted massive sulphide bodies, only some of which were assayed for base metals. Noranda drill hole FIE-04-02 intercepted 2.2m of massive sulphide at 125m depth, assaying 0.7% Cu, 18gpt Ag, 0.2 gpt Au and 0.3% Zn. Sullico Mines Ltd 1971 hole F 71-1 intercepted 5.5 m of massive sulphide returning 0.2% Cu and 0.29% Zn. Q Battery completed deep-penetrating Time Domain Electromagnetic (TDEM) surveying and identified of a group of strong EM anomalies. They are located between 10 m and 130 m below surface with depth extensions of 75 m to 350 m trending north-south through the property, interpreted as potential sulphide bodies.An Induced Polarization survey on the La Corne South is planned for Spring 2024. The ground surveys (IP chargeability and resistivity) will add to the geophysical data obtained from the previously completed drone-supported magnetics and ground TDEM surveys to provide more definition for eventual diamond drilling of both lithium and VMS targets.At the McKenzie East, Q Battery Metals plans to continue expanding from the positive results obtained from its previous exploration. A proposed drill program is currently in the process of permitting to test and expand upon results obtained from the 2021- Phase 1 drilling that included 1.185 grams per tonne gold (g/t Au) over one metre from hole MKE-21-01 as well as intercepts of greater than 0.5 g/t from holes MKE-21-03, MKE-21-06 and MKE-21-08. Hole MKE-21-03 showed the most promise from the drilling campaign, where geologist observations indicated a section of core that contained a visible gold grain of approximate one mm by two mm size, as well as veining, alterations and associated sulphide minerals over a wide interval (see Q Metals news release dated July 13, 2021).Q Metals is also planning to expand exploration into the southern claim block of the McKenzie East property in order to test for gold-silver quartz veins similar to those exposed within adjoining claims at the Maruska showing. At the Maruska, in 2023, Q Battery Metals obtained a rock sample that included chips from a number of the exposed quartz-pyrite veins. The sample was analyzed for gold by fire assay and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, with a further 48 elements (including silver) by ME-MS61L (four-acid digestion). The sample returned 3.41 grams per tonne gold and 2.58 grams per tonne silver, confirming the presence of precious metals in the Maruska vein system (see Q Battery Metals news release dated Nov. 28, 2023). Q Metals is very interested in this documented gold showing due to its location very near to the south block of the company's McKenzie East claims. However, the reader is warned that results obtained from adjoining properties are not direct indications for potential on the Q Battery Metals claims.The La Corne South and McKenzie East projects area within 5 km of each other, both easily accessed by Highway 397, 25 Km north of Val d'Or, Quebec.Q BATTERY METALS CORPQ Battery Metals exploration programs undertaken in Quebec are supervised by Dr. Mathieu Piché, OGQ, with office located north of Val d'Or. He is also a Q Battery Metals company director. The company has 100% interest in mineral claims within Quebec, targeting critical and precious metals. Projects include the La Corne South lithium and VMS property, the McKenzie East Gold property, the Lorrain Ni-Co-PGE property, and the recently acquired Versant rare earth elements (REE) property.Perry Grunenberg, P.Geo, a ""Qualified Person"" as that term is defined under NI 43-101, has reviewed and approved the technical information in this news release.Cautionary StatementThis press release contains forward-looking statements based on assumptions as of that date.

Positive None. Negative None. 03/03/2024 - 09:47 PM CORAL GABLES, Fla., March 03, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Coral Gables, FL, March 3, 2024. MSP Recovery, Inc. d/b/a LifeWallet (NASDAQ: LIFW) (“LifeWallet” or “the Company”) announces a comprehensive settlement with 28 affiliated property and casualty insurers (“P&C Insurers”) that, in addition to settling existing claims, establishes a going-forward process to collaboratively and timely resolve future claims, as well as share important historical data that is expected to enhance LifeWallet’s claims reconciliation capabilities, benefiting its Medicare clients across the mainland U.S. and Puerto Rico. The settlement includes: The P&C Insurers’ agreement to provide ten years of historical data (identifying all claims processed from January 1, 2014, through the present) and data sharing of future claims, extending out for one year, assisting LifeWallet in reconciling its current and future assigned Medicare claims;The P&C Insurers’ Implementation of LifeWallet’s coordination of benefits clearinghouse solution; A 5-year agreement to resolve cooperatively, or through binding mediation, relevant Medicare claims (liens) that LifeWallet owns today and in the future; The P&C Insurers’ agreement that they are primary payers for any unreimbursed Medicare lien that LifeWallet identifies from data sharing, and the P&C Insurers’ agreement to assign all rights to collect against other third parties that either failed to pay liens or collected twice from Medicare funds and the P&C Insurers; andA cash payment from the P&C Insurers to LifeWallet to settle existing historical claims (amount subject to confidentiality). Settlement Significance This settlement agreement is the result of LifeWallet’s more than ten-year commitment to revolutionize the fragmented healthcare reimbursement system with data-driven solutions, utilizing its extensive legal infrastructure to enforce Primary Payer1 obligations (from mostly property and casualty insurers), through years of federal and state litigation. The settlement creates an environment where Secondary Payers,2 such as health insurance plans and healthcare providers, discover Medicare liens owed to them and recover conditional payments from responsible primary plans, such as property and casualty insurers. As described by a federal appellate judge, when Secondary Payers “recover efficiently from Primary Payers, the Medicare Trust Fund does achieve cost savings.”3 LifeWallet is of the opinion the settlement demonstrates proof of concept that can potentially be replicated with other Primary Payers. However, LifeWallet notes that this settlement is not a guarantee that LifeWallet’s portfolio of assigned claims (owed by other Primary Payers) can be settled with the same or similar terms. The settlement value is a combination of monetary and non-monetary considerations, with the non-monetary considerations involving LifeWallet obtaining data on all the claims that were processed and paid by the P&C Insurers, and the P&C Insurers’ assignment of rights to collect against other responsible parties. This will enhance LifeWallet’s ability to discover liens and recover payments owed, more quickly than through litigation. It also enables LifeWallet to pursue a diversified number of entities that failed to pay liens or collected twice for the same bills, both from the insurer and LifeWallet’s assignor clients. LifeWallet Founder and CEO, John H. Ruiz, commented, “Today’s news shows LifeWallet’s significant progress in implementing our business model and commitment to achieving positive outcomes for healthcare entities across the country.” LifeWallet Co-Founder and Chief Legal Officer, Frank C. Quesada, added, “We are hopeful these collaborative efforts will pave the way for similar resolutions with other property and casualty insurers, including those currently in negotiations with LifeWallet. This benefits all stakeholders willing to work together to address issues that have plagued the healthcare industry for decades and be part of the solution to improve the healthcare system for insurers, providers, and patients alike.” ________________________1 Primary Plans” or “Primary Payers,” when used in the Medicare Secondary Payer context, means “any entity that is or was required or responsible to make payment with respect to an item or service (or any portion thereof) under a primary plan. These entities include, but are not limited to, insurers or self-insurers, third party administrators, and all employers that sponsor or contribute to group health plans or large group health plans.” 42 C.F.R. § 411.21.2 “Secondary Payers” includes Medicare Part C plans, as well as downstream entities. MSP Recovery Claims, Series LLC v. ACE Am. Ins. Co., 974 F.3d 1305, 1316 (11th Cir. 2020).3 In re Avandia Mktg., Sales Pracs. & Prod. Liab. Litig., 685 F.3d 353, 365 (3d Cir. 2012). Solving An Industry Problem The failure to follow the Medicare Secondary Payer Act (“MSP Act”) is costing taxpayers billions of dollars. The law serves to protect original Medicare, Medicare Advantage plans, and downstream entities. Medicare loses money because it “pays in the dark” and relies on Primary Payers to report information to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”).4 Primary Payers, however, often do not have the tools and resources in place to identify every reportable event. LifeWallet’s data matching initiatives have created transparency, enabling LifeWallet’s Secondary Payer clients to discover when a Medicare beneficiary is insured through other sources and recover reimbursements. Historical reconciliation, assignment of P&C Insurers’ rights, and 5-year agreement to resolve unreimbursed Medicare liens, without the need for litigation This settlement is a crucial step in addressing the systemic problems arising from incomplete reporting because the settlement requires the P&C Insurers to share ten years of historical data on first and third-party claims. The P&C Insurers have agreed that for each unreimbursed Medicare lien that LifeWallet identifies from the historical data, they will assign to LifeWallet any rights they have to collect against those third parties that either failed to pay liens or collected twice from LifeWallet’s clients (that paid with Medicare funds) and the P&C Insurer. This process further enhances LifeWallet’s ability to discover liens owed by P&C Insurers and any other third parties that had payment responsibility, and to collect on its portfolio of current claim rights. Furthermore, the settlement sets up a five-year agreement whereby the P&C Insurers agree to either resolve cooperatively, or through binding mediation, any future rights to unreimbursed liens, providing a structured process to work through lien repayment on a timely basis, without the need for costly and inefficient litigation. This applies to current and future LifeWallet clients. Working towards real-time payer-based identification through LifeWallet’s coordination of benefits clearinghouse Utilizing LifeWallet’s unique payer-based knowledge, artificial intelligence (“AI”) and blockchain-based LifeChain integrations, LifeWallet has developed a comprehensive coordination of benefits clearinghouse. This builds upon the Company’s previously announced initiatives: “MSP Recovery and Palantir to Transform Connectivity Across the U.S. Healthcare System” and “LifeWallet Announces Significant Enhancements to LifeWallet Health with Advanced Tools for Providers and Patients.”5 Through the seamless convergence of information technology and direct Application Programming Interface (“API”) and/or similar data transfer protocols, LifeWallet’s clients and Primary Payers can efficiently coordinate benefits. This integrated offering creates transparency and efficiency in claims reconciliation. Traditional methods that rely on Primary Payers to report to Medicare are flawed because Primary Payers often lack the necessary tools, resources, and data points to comply with the stringent data field requirements imposed by CMS. A direct data connection allows for more efficient communication of payments and coordination of recovery efforts when conditional payments are made. This technology creates a substantial advancement in benefits management, coordination of insurance coverage, and claims resolution between parties. LifeWallet’s ability to identify and coordinate benefits for medical claims will give its clients a significant payment reconciliation advantage over the rest of the industry. This also allows patients to gain access (with proper security protocols) to their claims data, which will provide clarity into what was billed, who originated the bill, and which payer(s) made payment(s). David Simmons, who has held several MSP policy roles at CMS and founded healthcare consulting firm, Ten One Strategies, commented on the LifeWallet coordination of benefits clearinghouse, saying, “Having all parties coordinate early in the process demonstrates that payer coordination can be an efficient and proactive partnership.” ________________________4 United States v. Baxter Int’l, Inc., 345 F.3d 866, 901 (11th Cir. 2003) (“When Medicare pays, therefore, it is paying ‘in the dark’—it does not know, and cannot know, whether someone else will pay.).5 October 11, 2021 Press Release re: MSP Recovery, now LifeWallet (NASDAQ: LIFW) and Palantir Technologies Inc., April 5, 2023 Press Release re: LifeWallet (NASDAQ: LIFW) LifeWallet’s Business Model Since its founding in 2014 as MSP Recovery, LifeWallet has aimed to disrupt the antiquated healthcare reimbursement system with data-driven solutions, utilizing advanced technology and extensive legal expertise to recover reimbursements for Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial entities. LifeWallet Founder and CEO, John H. Ruiz, who worked with LifeWallet’s counsel, Charlie Whorton, to achieve this settlement resolution, said, “This settlement encompasses the two most important concepts that LifeWallet set out to resolve — discover conditional payments and recover reimbursement from primary payers. While some insurers have failed to follow the law and been uncooperative, we commend those insurers that have stepped up to the plate to do what is required.” Ruiz continued, “Our goal has been to create a more compliant and transparent environment, where secondary payers and primary plans are coordinating and sharing information. Such an environment ultimately serves to preserve the Medicare Trust Funds.” Forward Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

(NASDAQ: SKYW) announces a new flying agreement with United Airlines to add 20 partner-financed E175s to its fleet by 2024. The company is set to operate a total of 278 E175 aircraft by the end of 2026, strengthening its partnership with major airlines. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The new agreement between SkyWest and United Airlines to place 20 partner-financed E175s under a four-year contract represents a significant development in the regional aviation sector. The financial arrangement, with aircraft being partner-financed rather than owned by SkyWest, may indicate a strategic move to maintain liquidity and reduce capital expenditure. It is essential to assess the impact of this agreement on SkyWest's balance sheet and cash flow statements, particularly the liabilities section, as partner financing could lead to different financial obligations compared to direct ownership.Further, the addition of these aircraft is likely to increase SkyWest's operational capacity, potentially leading to higher revenues. However, it's crucial to monitor the company's load factors and route profitability to ensure that the expanded fleet translates into improved financial performance. The four-year duration of the contract also provides a medium-term visibility into SkyWest's revenue streams from United Airlines, which is positive for forecasting and valuation purposes. Market Research Analyst This strategic partnership with United Airlines could enhance SkyWest's competitive position in the regional airline market. The E175 is a popular aircraft for its fuel efficiency and passenger comfort, which may allow SkyWest to secure more favorable routes and time slots. It is important to analyze market trends and the demand for regional flights to predict how this expansion might affect SkyWest's market share and bargaining power with other major airlines and partners.Additionally, the timing of the deliveries aligns with a broader industry recovery from the impacts of the pandemic, suggesting that SkyWest is anticipating an increase in travel demand. The phased delivery schedule through 2026 also allows for flexibility in operations and fleet management, which is a prudent approach given the volatile nature of the airline industry. Aerospace Industry Analyst The announcement underscores the continuing industry trend towards newer, more efficient regional jets like the E175, which are favored by airlines for their operational cost savings and ability to service short to mid-range routes. For stakeholders in the aerospace sector, this deal reaffirms the E175's market position and may influence the stock performance of its manufacturer, Embraer. It's important to analyze how this order might affect Embraer's production schedules and backlog, as well as the broader supply chain dynamics within the aerospace industry.Moreover, the partner-financed aspect of the deal may reflect innovative financing structures that are emerging in the aerospace industry, which could set precedents for future aircraft orders and deliveries. Understanding these financial mechanisms is crucial for stakeholders to evaluate the risks and benefits associated with such agreements. 03/03/2024 - 04:00 PM Partner-financed aircraft scheduled for deliveries this year ST.

We are excited the STARLIGHT Phase 3 clinical studies are underway, bringing us one step closer to making this novel, nonhormonal treatment option available in Japan for women experiencing VMS associated with menopause."" Dosing for the STARLIGHT Phase 3 clinical studies was determined based on available global data, including the STARLIGHT Phase 2b study (NCT05034042) that enrolled 147 patients and completed in 2022. Primary results of STARLIGHT Phase 2b were presented at the Annual Meeting of the Japan Society for Menopause and Women's Health on Dec. 3, 2023. About STARLIGHT 2STARLIGHT 2 (NCT06206408) is a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter clinical study to evaluate the superiority of fezolinetant versus placebo and assess the safety of fezolinetant in Japanese women experiencing VMS associated with menopause. Approximately 390 participants will be randomized to this study with 130 participants per treatment arm (fezolinetant low dose, fezolinetant high dose or placebo). The primary endpoint is mean change in the frequency of VMS from baseline to week 8, with total treatment duration of 12 weeks.

VMS are also known as hot flashes or night sweats. Fezolinetant works by blocking neurokinin B (NKB) binding on the kisspeptin/neurokinin/dynorphin (KNDy) neuron, helping restore the balance in the brain's temperature control center (the hypothalamus) to reduce the number and intensity of hot flashes and night sweats.7,8,9 There is no guarantee the agent will receive regulatory approval in Japan or become commercially available for the uses being investigated.

Positive None. Negative None. 03/04/2024 - 05:00 AM BEIJING, March 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Quhuo Limited (NASDAQ: QH) (""Quhuo"" or the ""Company""), a leading gig economy platform focusing on local life services in China, has recently made significant strides in the homestay industry with its Chengtu Home (""Chengtu"") division. Chengtu announced the launch of a new rural homestay collaboration project, expanding its presence in the sector. This initiative involves the establishment of an independent brand dedicated to rural homestays, aptly named ""Chengtu Rural Residence."" The project will begin in Wuqing District of Tianjin City and Beidaihe Village in Qinhuangdao, encompassing nearly 40 homes. ""Chengtu Rural Residence"" is Quhuo's response to the growing issue of rural-urban migration and the increasing number of vacant rural homes due to rapid urbanization. Through this venture, Chengtu plans to utilize its extensive operational expertise to revamp and market these unoccupied homes for both long-term and short-term rentals, ultimately boosting the income of local villagers. This effort aligns with the broader goal of fostering integrated urban-rural development and revitalizing rural communities. With the introduction of this brand, Chengtu is now present in four major domestic tourist cities, managing nearly 120 rural homestay properties. In Tianjin's Wuqing District, Chengtu has formed partnerships with three villages in Hexi Township. The company is seeking co-builders to renovate 20 to 30 rural homes into charming homestays, offering these co-builders a 20-year operational lease. This model guarantees a stable rental income for the villagers and presents a long-term investment opportunity for the co-builders. The Beidaihe Village project in Qinhuangdao marks Chengtu's inaugural venture into house design. The plan is to transform 14 rural homes into publicly operated homestays. Located near the sea, these properties are part of a cultural industry park that blends culture, agriculture, and tourism, making them highly valuable for both cultural and tourist purposes. The design phase in this cooperation was completed at the end of January this year and co-builders were invited to visit the model house. These rural residences will also be promoted on Chengtu's online homestay rental platform. Chengtu's rural homestay selection process is rigorous, focusing on locations that reflect local customs and geographical convenience. The homes chosen must have clear property rights, sturdy foundations, and accompanying farmland and courtyards to offer an authentic pastoral experience. Chengtu also sets high standards for its homestays, establishing a uniform system for rural accommodations and providing comprehensive training to staff. The company ensures that everything from the bedding to daily utensils adheres to star-rated hotel quality. Ji Tong, the General Manager of Chengtu, remarked on the company's strategy: ""Chengtu's strategic expansion and the launch of 'Chengtu Rural Residence' underscore the potential and market prospects of rural homestays in China. Our latest projects are not just significant for Chengtu's deeper involvement in this sector but also align with the national policy of rural revitalization."" Leslie Yu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Quhuo, expressed his outlook on the rural homestay market: ""With the increasing demand for high-quality pastoral lifestyles, the rural tourism market is poised for growth. Quhuo intends to continue its strategic expansion in this area, using our operational expertise and technological edge to foster the ongoing development of rural homestays. This initiative will inject new energy into rural economic growth and cultural tourism.""

LP, along with partner Brigade Capital Management, has proposed an increased all-cash acquisition of Macy's at $24.00 per share, representing a 51.3% premium to the company's share price on Nov. 30, 2023, and a 33.3% premium to the closing share price on March 1, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The offer to acquire Macy's at a 51.3% premium to its share price on November 30, 2023 and a 33.3% premium to the closing price on March 1, 2024, by Arkhouse Management Co. LP and Brigade Capital Management, is indicative of a strategic move to capitalize on Macy's current market valuation. Such premiums are substantial and suggest that the acquiring parties perceive intrinsic value in Macy's that the market has not fully recognized. The involvement of Fortress Investment Group and One Investment Management US as additional equity capital partners adds financial robustness to the proposal.From a financial perspective, the market will likely react positively in the short term to the news of the acquisition proposal, as it provides immediate value to shareholders. However, the long-term impact will depend on the integration strategy and realization of synergies post-acquisition. If the transaction is successful, it could lead to operational restructuring aimed at enhancing Macy's profitability and market position, which may involve store closures, layoffs, or strategic pivots.It is important to note that such an acquisition could also lead to changes in the competitive landscape of the retail sector, potentially affecting other players in the market. The premium offered could set a precedent for future acquisitions within the industry. Market Research Analyst The acquisition proposal for Macy's must be evaluated against the backdrop of the current retail industry, which is undergoing significant transformation due to e-commerce growth and changing consumer behaviors. The acquirers' willingness to pay a premium suggests confidence in Macy's brand equity and its physical store footprint as a valuable asset in an omnichannel retail strategy.Investors and stakeholders should consider the potential for Macy's to leverage its real estate assets more effectively, perhaps through sale-leaseback transactions or redevelopment into mixed-use spaces, which could unlock additional value. The role of Fortress Investment Group and One Investment Management US could suggest a strategic direction focused on real estate optimization.Additionally, the acquisition could lead to a reevaluation of Macy's digital strategy, which is crucial in maintaining competitiveness. The new ownership structure might accelerate digital transformation initiatives to better align with consumer expectations and enhance the overall customer experience. Legal Expert The acquisition proposal's legal implications must be carefully scrutinized. The significant premium offered requires thorough due diligence to ensure that it reflects the fair value of Macy's and that the interests of all shareholders are being considered. The board of Macy's has a fiduciary duty to its shareholders to engage in constructive discussions and negotiate the best possible terms.Should the acquisition move forward, it will be subject to regulatory approval, including antitrust considerations. Given the size of the transaction and the involvement of multiple investment groups, there will be an extensive review process to ensure compliance with securities and antitrust laws. The legal framework surrounding such a deal will also dictate the timeline and complexity of the transaction.It is imperative for the board and shareholders to evaluate the proposal's terms, including any contingencies and break fees, which could have significant financial implications if the deal encounters obstacles or fails to close. 03/03/2024 - 06:00 PM Increased Purchase Price Represents a 51.3% Premium to Company’s Share Price on Nov. 30, 2023, and a 33.3% Premium to Closing Share Price on March 1, 2024 Fortress Investment Group and One Investment Management US Identified as Additional Equity Capital Partners in Proposed Transaction Arkhouse Urges Macy’s Board to Enter into Constructive Discussions to Reach a Mutually Agreeable Transaction at a Significant Premium NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Arkhouse Management Co. LP (together with its affiliates, “Arkhouse”, “we” or “us”), today announced it has submitted an increased all-cash proposal to acquire Macy’s (“Macy’s”, or the “Company”) (NYSE: M) for $24.00 per share along with its partner, Brigade Capital Management (“Brigade”). Arkhouse and Brigade have also disclosed additional information about their financing, including identifying Fortress Investment Group LLC (“Fortress”) and One Investment Management US (“OneIM”) as equity capital partners for the proposed transaction. The revised offer represents: A 51.3% premium to Macy’s unaffected share price on Nov. 30, 2023, the day prior to Arkhouse and Brigade submitting their original proposal on Dec. 1, 2023; A 33.3% premium to where the Company’s shares closed on March 1, 2024; and An increase of 14.3% from Arkhouse and Brigade’s previous offer of $21.00 per share that was submitted to the Company on Dec. 1, 2023. Gavriel Kahane and Jonathon Blackwell, Arkhouse Managing Partners, said: “We remain frustrated by the delay tactics adopted by Macy’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) and its continued refusal to engage with our credible buyer group. Nonetheless, we are steadfast in our commitment to execute this transaction. In recent months, Macy’s has introduced two restructurings and a dividend hike. The stock price selloff following these announcements is a strong indication of shareholder concern about maintaining the status quo. We continue to offer the Company an attractive alternative solution through a sale of the Company at a substantial premium. This would provide Macy’s stockholders with significant value and immediate liquidity. While the restructuring plan Macy’s unveiled last week failed to inspire investors, the fourth quarter earnings and year-end results have given us further confidence in the long-term prospects of the Company if redirected as a private company. After coordinating with our financing sources, we have increased our offer to $24.00 per share in cash. We remain open to increasing the purchase price further subject to the customary due diligence. The notion that the plan we are proposing is not actionable is simply not true. We have tried repeatedly to address the concerns raised by the Company. We clarified the 50% equity contribution we laid out three months ago and disclosed our partnership with two highly regarded investors – Fortress and OneIM. With the help of our advisors, we have identified large global institutional financing sources for each debt component of the transaction with strong interest in finalizing commitments during a customary diligence process.

Commerce Resources Announces Significant Advancements and Simplification of the Ashram Deposit’s Process Flowsheet,2024-03-04T08:05:00.000Z,Low,Very Positive,Analysis in progress...,"Commerce Resources Announces Significant Advancements and Simplification of the Ashram Deposit’s Process Flowsheet Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Analysis in progress... Positive None. Negative None. 03/04/2024 - 03:05 AM VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / March 4, 2024 / Commerce Resources Corp. (TSXV:CCE)(FSE:D7H0)(OTCQX:CMRZF) (the ""Company"" or ""Commerce"") is pleased to announce that it has made significant advancements in the mineral processing and hydrometallurgical flowsheets for the Ashram Rare Earth and Fluorspar Deposit (the ""Ashram Deposit""). The Ashram Deposit, wholly owned by the Company and located in Quebec, Canada, is one of the largest undeveloped monazite dominant rare earth deposits in the world. This rare earth mineralogy results in significant NdPr distributions (>20%).The Company is pleased to report a significant simplification and optimization of the Ashram Deposit's front-end mineral processing flowsheet whereby 30-35+% REO monazite mineral concentrates at strong recovery (between 60-70%) are produced using only flotation. This testwork has been completed at bench scale, is demonstrated repeatable, and has been scaled up successfully from ~1 kg to 10 kg floats using conventional mechanical flotation cells. The recent testwork, which uses readily available reagents, has been carried out by SGS Canada in Lakefield, Ontario (""SGS""), and builds upon the beneficiation testwork carried out by CanmetMINING, a branch of Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) (see news release dated May 13, 2020). This new flowsheet is a significant simplification, with comparable performance, to the prior flotation-leach-magnetic separation flowsheet. The recent results represent some of the best grade/recovery performance for bench scale tests on material from the Ashram Deposit. Further optimization testing is pending, including Locked-Cycle Testing (LCT) to confirm closed circuit recoveries, and variability testing on nine (9) samples prepared from drill core spatially distributed throughout the deposit.In addition to the mineral processing developments, a streamlined hydrometallurgical flowsheet has also been developed and demonstrated at bench scale for the downstream processing of the monazite flotation concentrate produced by SGS. The hydrometallurgical flowsheet uses a standard acid bake - water leach process followed by thorium removal and direct rare earth element (""REE"") precipitation (Figure 1). This downstream testwork has been carried out by Trois-Rivieres-based L3 Process Development (""L3"").Company President Chris Grove states ""We are very excited by these results confirming our expectations of positive beneficiation from our Ashram Deposit with its very attractive mineralogy and geology. We look forward to announcing additional developments as we continue to advance this excellent asset.""This streamlined hydrometallurgical flowsheet developed and demonstrated by L3 on the SGS monazite concentrates achieved an overall recovery into solution for NdPr above 95% and TbDy above 82% while significantly reducing sulfuric acid consumption. The thorium was fully removed from the water leach solution using a three-stage solvent extraction process. The REEs were then precipitated using oxalic acid and converted to carbonates using a 1-step metathesis process, achieving an overall recovery (deposit material to marketable mixed rare earth elements product) of over 62% NdPr. In addition to the oxalate and carbonate REE precipitates, the downstream flowsheet is amenable to producing a mixed rare earth oxide (""mixed REO""), thereby providing significant flexibility in end-user offtake preferences and shipping optimization.The Ashram Deposit ranks as one of the largest REE deposits globally, consisting of a monazite dominated, single mineralized body outcropping at surface, and has a footprint approximately 700 m along strike, over 300 m across, and 600 m deep, remaining open in several directions. Therefore, the deposit is envisioned to be an open-pit extraction operation at production, with a very low strip ratio. Coupled with a monazite rare earth mineralogy and strong NdPr distributions, these attributes allow for the company to have significant flexibility in flowsheet design, whereby a 60+% overall recovery of the NdPr into saleable product is significant. The new mineral processing flowsheet will permit an operator to leverage the size of the deposit and optimize mining for effective recovery into a high-grade monazite concentrate in order to significantly simplify and thereby reduce project mineral processing and downstream hydromet CAPEX and OPEX.Figure 1: Simplified block diagram of the downstream hydrometallurgical flowsheet developed by L3 for the monazite concentrates produced at SGS Canada.About the Ashram DepositThe Ashram Deposit ranks as one of the largest REE (and fluorspar) deposits globally, consisting of a monazite dominated, single mineralized body outcropping at surface, and has a footprint approximately 700 m along strike, over 300 m across, and 600 m deep, remaining open in several directions. The deposit hosts a measured resource of 1.6 million tonnes (Mt) at 1.77% rare earth oxide (REO) and 3.8% F, an indicated resource of 27.7 Mt at 1.90% REO and 2.9% F, and an inferred resource of 219.8 Mt at 1.88% REO and 2.2% F, at a cut-off grade of 1.25% REO (Effective Date July 5th, 2012).

This follows the successful 2023 sonic drilling campaign which saw the ""tripling"" of BHL's Inferred and Indicated MRE at Basin. This six-hole program will build upon Bradda Head's 1.085MT Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (LCE) by drilling holes an additional 1.2 kilometers towards the north on newly permitted drill holes. The objective of this program is to add a minimum of 1.5MT LCE, surpassing the benchmark of 2.5MT LCE which will trigger the final US$3 million royalty payment from Lithium Royalty Company (LRC) to Bradda Head. The drilling program is anticipated to finish towards the end of April, 2024.Program Summary:Six-hole core drilling program of approximately 8,800 feet (2,680m) plannedProgram anticipated to expand LCE from 1.085MT to >2.5MTStep-out drill holes at 500 to 700m spacing to maintain Inferred category of MREOne hole will be drilled into Precambrian basement in center of gravity lowGravity low may represent extensively thick clays both in the Upper, Lower, and Basal Red-BedsHoles will test Lower Clay to expand tonnage potential and thicker sequence correlative with gravity low which also has the potential for exceptional lithium gradesIan Stalker, Executive Chairperson, commented:""After we completed the MRE in September 2023, we quickly realised the unbridled potential to continue expansion of this important lithium-in-clay resource in Arizona. Our geologists developed a plan, designed a new drilling program and promptly engaged the BLM for an expansion of our Basin North permit. We thank the BLM for delivering a positive decision and look forward to embarking on this exciting drill program.Not only are we hoping for sizeable expansion of this resource, but are estimating the resource will grow from the current 1.085 MT of LCE to over 2.5 MT, which will trigger an important US$3 million royalty payment from LRC. We are confident this will be a successful programme, and, with the royalty payment, the Company will be in an excellent position for the remainder of 2024 during the current softened lithium market.""General BackgroundThe Company is building upon the 2023 MRE and NI-43-101 complaint report completed by SRK Consulting (UK) Ltd and reported on 28 September, 2023. In this prior PR, the Company reported the following in Table 1 below:Table 1.ClassificationDomainTonnesMean GradeContained MetalMtLi (ppm)K (%)LCE (kt)K (kt)IndicatedUpper Clay117203.542380Upper Clay HG613503.243190Lower Clay-----SubTotal179403.485570InferredUpper Clay1437902.76003,800Upper Clay HG4812903.13301,500Lower Clay196902.870530SubTotal2109002.81,0005,800 Mineral Resource statement has an effective date of 1 September 2023.The Mineral Resource is reported using a cut-off grade of 550 ppm Li and is constrained to an optimised open pit shell, which was generated using the following assumptions: lithium carbonate metal prices of 22,000 USD/tLCE; State of Arizona royalty (selling cost) of 6%; operating costs of 40 USD/ tore; Li recovery of 72%; mining dilution and recovery of 0% and 100%; and pit slope angle of 45°.Tonnages are reported in metric units.Rounding as required by reporting guidelines may result in apparent summation differences between tonnes, grade and contained metal content which are not considered material.Conversion factor of Li metal to lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) = 5.323The figures above are reported on a gross basis given Bradda's 100% interest in the propertyThis new programme is targeting significantly thicker clay sequences, consistent if not higher lithium grades and thicker lower clay sequence, with the potential to also discover new clays within the nearly 2km2 gravity low.Bradda Head Lithium received an affirmative decision from the BLM on February 28th with confirmation that it could conduct exploration drilling on the Basin North notice of intent (NOI) amendment and based on a reclamation bond increase with permission to proceed on 3.8 acres of surface disturbance. Earth moving equipment was mobilized to prepare drill sites and experienced core drilling contractors brought in to conduct the drilling.Like previous drilling programs conducted at Basin, drill holes will be vertical, but when clay horizons are encountered the Company's plan is to convert to a triple tube core capture technique which ensures high recovery and provides the Company with many options for sampling, density measurements, and geotechnical data for future studies.Figure 1.

Geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological grade (or quality) continuity. It is based on exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings, and drill holes. An Inferred Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to an Indicated Mineral Resource and must not be converted to an Ore Reserve. It is reasonably expected that the majority of Inferred Mineral Resources could be upgraded to Indicated Mineral Resources with continued exploration.Indicated Mineral ResourceThat part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade (or quality), densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with sufficient confidence to allow the application of Modifying Factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from adequately detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings, and drill holes, and is sufficient to assume geological and grade (or quality) continuity between points of observation where data and samples are gathered.MREMineral Resource EstimateForward-Looking StatementsNeither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.

Positive None. Negative None. 03/04/2024 - 03:00 AM Discovery Hole had over One Oz/Tonne Combined Platinum and Palladium over 7.75 Metres TORONTO, March 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Power Nickel Inc. (the ""Company"" or ""Power Nickel"") (TSXV: PNPN) (OTCBB: PNPNF) (Frankfurt: IVVI) is pleased to announce that hole PN-24-047 of the drill program aiming at following up on the Wildcat high-grade PGM intersection has intersected the anticipated mineralized zone some 40 meters to East of the discovery hole. Along with PN-24-044 (Feb 22nd, 2024), this makes it the third intersection similar to the discovery hole announced May 10th, 2023. An EM anomaly was also tested some 225 m further East (PN-24-045) but did not visually intersect significant mineralization. As previously stated (Feb 22nd, 2024), PN-24-044 successfully intersected the chalcopyrite-rich zone approximately 100 m downdip the initial Hole PN-23-031A (Figure 1). Confirmation of the zone presence at depth was part of a strategy to systematically drill a series of EM targets that are lining up with the tonalite-ultramafics contact at surface. Given the triple amount of massive chalcopyrite observed in hole PN-24-044 compared to PN-23-031A, the focus of the Wildcat drilling program has now shifted to defining the extent of the mineralized zone. The remaining EM anomalies shall be tested later. A series of off-section drillholes were planned on a 50 m grid to start defining the volume of the high-grade PGM mineralized zone. The current hole PN-24-047, planned to test the lateral continuity of the zone to the east, encountered the anticipated zone at a downhole depth of approximately 150 m (Figure 2). ""We are even more encouraged to extend what appears to be a very high-grade PGM rich zone laterally from the initial discovery. We still need assay results to confirm, but it certainly looks better and better. Subsequent holes will continue testing the east and west extensions. I've already alluded to this, but this PGM discovery adds an exciting and valuable dimension to the Nisk Project,"" commented Power Nickel CEO, Terry Lynch. ""PN-24-047 is the first lateral hit that provides us with an initial geometry and volume of the zone. It also was the first hole where we can see Nickel-bearing pentlandite in the massive sulfide…making a very interesting mix. Can't wait to see the assays on this one! We like what we see so we will be aggressively attacking the zone, starting with closely spaced drillholes and later with more distant step-out holes."" stated Kenneth Williamson, Power Nickel VP Exploration. Qualified PersonKenneth Williamson, Géo, M.Sc., VP Exploration at Power Nickel, is the qualified person who has reviewed and approved the technical disclosure contained in this news release. About Power Nickel Inc.Power Nickel is a Canadian junior exploration company focusing on developing the High-Grade Nisk project into Canada's first Carbon Neutral Nickel mine. On February 1, 2021, Power Nickel (then called Chilean Metals) completed the acquisition of its option to acquire up to 80% of the Nisk project from Critical Elements Lithium Corp. (CRE: TSXV). Subsequently, Power Nickel has exercised its option to acquire 50% of the Nisk Project and delivered notice to Critical Elements that it intends to exercise its second option to bring its ownership to 80%. The last remaining commitment to exercise the option was the delivery of a NI-43-101 Technical report which has now occurred. Power Nickel expects to complete the acquisition in February. The NISK property comprises a significant land position (20 kilometers of strike length) with numerous high-grade intercepts. Power Nickel is focused on expanding the historical high-grade nickel-copper PGE mineralization with a series of drill programs designed to test the initial Nisk discovery zone and to explore the land package for adjacent potential Nickel deposits. In addition to the Nisk project, Power Nickel owns significant land packages in British Colombia and Chile. Power Nickel is expected to reorganize these assets in a related vehicle through a plan of arrangement. Power Nickel announced on June 8, 2021, that an agreement had been made to complete the 100% acquisition of its Golden Ivan project in the heart of the Golden Triangle. The Golden Triangle has reported mineral resources (past production and current resources) in 130 million ounces of gold, 800 million ounces of silver, and 40 billion pounds of copper (Resource World). This property hosts two known mineral showings (gold ore and Magee) and a portion of the past-producing Silverado mine, reportedly exploited between 1921 and 1939. These mineral showings are Polymetallic veins containing quantities of silver, lead, zinc, plus/minus gold, and plus/minus copper. Power Nickel is also 100 percent owner of five properties comprising over 50,000 acres strategically located in the prolific iron-oxide-copper-gold belt of northern Chile. It also owns a 3-per-cent NSR royalty interest on any future production from the Copaquire copper-molybdenum deposit sold to a subsidiary of Teck Resources Inc. Under the terms of the sale agreement, Teck has the right to acquire one-third of the 3-per-cent NSR for $3 million at any time. The Copaquire property borders Teck's producing Quebrada Blanca copper mine in Chile's first region.

(“Rupert” or the “Company”) reports follow-up assay results from its Heinä South satellite target (located 1km from Ikkari). The results confirm evidence of broader mineralised zones than previously seen at Heinä South. New assays are also published from drilling at Ikkari demonstrating that mineralisation remains open down plunge to the west with both wide and high-grade intercepts achieved.

Schematic structural interpretation of Ikkari and surrounding high-priority exploration targets showing the location of the new drilling at Heinä South. Black box shows the location of more detailed plan map, Figure 2 Highlights #124019 – intersected 25m at 16.5 g/t Au from 83m including 1m at 363g/t Au and 2m at 10.8g/t Au. The hole also intersected multiple other intercepts including 1m at 256g/t Au from 25m, 1m at 48.3g/t Au from 146m and 14m at 1.2g/t Au from 201m. Drilling continues and results from seven further drill holes in Heinä South are pending. #124014 tested extensions of mineralisation along the shallow plunge at depth in the west of Ikkari. The drillhole yielded multiple intercepts including both wider intercepts (23.70m at 1.7g/t Au from 602m, including 1m at 16.6g/t Au) and higher-grade intercepts (5m at 5.2g/t Au from 633m, including 1m at 19.8g/t Au and 3m at 32.7g/t Au from 655m, including 1m at 93.8g/t Au) in the target area demonstrating that mineralisation at Ikkari remains open to the west at depth. James Withall, CEO of Rupert Resources commented “The initial results from #124019 are confirmation of more continuous mineralisation at Heinä South which, along with extensional drilling at Ikkari, remains the current focus of our winter drilling campaign. During this drilling season we will continue to test a number of the targets at shallow depths which have the potential to become satellite deposits to the 4Moz1 Ikkari deposit alongside the works to advance project engineering and permitting.” Heinä South Ongoing drilling at Heinä South target continues to identify a broader style of mineralisation at the target than was in evidence from drilling undertaken in previous years. #124019, reported today, returned 25.0m at 16.5g/t Au including 1.0m at 363g/t Au with wider mineralised intervals hosted in sulphide rich breccia units. #124019 is an 80m step-out to the east from previously reported #124001 (24.5m at 1.1g/t Au). The high-grade potential of the Heinä South target area is further evidenced by the high-grade intercept of 558g/t Au over 2m in 124006, located a further 250m to the east, see press release dated 8th of February 2024). Drilling has now confirmed a strike of more than 1000m at Heinä South with mineralisation across a 200m wide corridor. Current drilling is focussed on the previously sparsely tested western strike extent where mineralisation is distinct from that further to the east and greater widths of mineralisation are encountered. Ikkari extension #124014 is the first hole to be reported from Ikkari from the winter 2023/24 program. results show multiple mineralised intercepts with the main target area yielding both wider (23.70m at 1.7g/t Au from 602m, including 1m at 16.6g/t Au) and higher grade (5m at 5.2g/t Au from 633m, including 1m at 19.8g/t Au and 3m at 32.7g/t Au from 655m, including 1m at 93.8g/t Au) intercepts. These intercepts provide further evidence for the shallow western plunge interpreted in this portion of the deposit where mineralisation remains open to the west. The intercepts from #124014 represent a 75m step-out along plunge from previously released #123026, 88.70m at 1.3g/t Au from 487.30m including 13m at 3.1g/t Au from 495m (see release dated May, 23 2023) that was included in the November 2023 MRE for Ikkari. Geological interpretation of Ikkari Ikkari was discovered using systematic regional exploration that initially focused on geochemical sampling of the bedrock/till interface through glacial till deposits of 5m to 40m thickness. No outcrop is present, and topography is dominated by low-lying swamp areas. The Ikkari deposit occurs within rocks that have been regionally mapped as 2.05-2.15 billion years (“Ga”) old Savukoski group greenschist-metamorphosed mafic-ultramafic volcanic rocks, part of the Central Lapland Greenstone Belt (“CLGB”). Gold mineralisation is largely confined to the structurally modified unconformity at a significant domain boundary. Younger sedimentary lithologies are complexly interleaved, with intensely altered ultramafic rocks, and the mineralized zone is bounded to the north by a steeply N-dipping cataclastic zone. Within the mineralised zone lithologies, alteration and structure appear to be sub-vertical in contrast to wider Area 1 where lithologies generally dipping at a moderated angle to the north. The main mineralized zone is strongly altered and characterised by intense veining and foliation that pervasively overprints original textures. An early phase of finely laminated grey ankerite/dolomite veins is overprinted by stockwork-like irregular siderite ± quartz ± chlorite ± sulphide veins. These vein arrays are often deformed with shear-related boudinage and in situ brecciation. Magnetite and/or haematite are common, in association with pyrite. Hydrothermal alteration commonly comprises quartz-dolomite-chlorite-magnetite (±haematite). Gold is hosted by disseminated and vein-related pyrite. Multi-phase breccias are well developed within the mineralised zone, with early silicified cataclastic phases overprinted by late, carbonate- iron-oxide- rich, hydrothermal breccias which display a subvertical control. All breccias frequently host disseminated pyrite, and are often associated with higher gold grades, particularly where magnetite or haematite is prevalent. In the sedimentary lithologies, albite alteration is intense and pervasive, with pyrite-magnetite (± gold) hosted in veinlets in brittle fracture zones. Geological interpretation of Heinä South The Heina South target was reappraised based on results from a new higher resolution geophysical survey flown in later 2023 which identified a south-west extension which had been untested in previous years due to a lack of base of till anomalism. Gold mineralisation in the west of Heinä South is associated with multi-phase sulphide mineralisation consisting of pyrite+-pyrrhotite+-chalcopyrite, principally occurring as the matrix to an earlier brecciated (iron)-carbonate phase. The earlier veins occur primarily within altered carbonaceous sediments folded between more homogenous gabbroic units. Gold mineralisation in the east of Heinä South is hosted within quartz-pyrite and massive pyrite veins and as lenses, as part of a stockwork of quartz-carbonate veins. Zones of massive pyrite contain the highest grades (>10g/t Au) with disseminated sulphide zone containing anomalous (<0.5g/t) gold. Early quartz-carbonate veins are overprinted by extensional veins that include coarse-grained pyrite and form sub-parallel trends, broadly related to lithological contacts between sediments and mafic-intermediate intrusives, although mineralisation also occurs within both lithologies. Further drilling is required to allow a resource to be published for the occurrence. Review by Qualified Person, Quality Control and Reports Craig Hartshorne, a Chartered Geologist and a Fellow of the Geological Society of London, is the Qualified Person, as defined by National Instrument 43-101, responsible for the accuracy of scientific and technical information in this news release. The majority of samples are prepared by ALS Finland in either Sodankylä or Outokumpu. Fire assays are subsequently completed at ALS Romania whilst multielement analysis is completed in ALS Ireland or Sweden. A minority of samples are prepared by Eurofins Laboratory in Sodankylä and Fire Assay is carried out on site. A pulverised sub-sample is then sent to ALS Ireland for multi-element analysis. All samples are under watch from the drill site to the storage facility. Samples at both laboratories are assayed using 50g fire assay method with aqua regia digest and analysis by AAS for gold. Over limit analysis (>100 ppm Au) are conducted using fire assay and gravimetric finish. For multi-element assays, Ultra Trace Level Method by 4-Acid digest (HF-HNO3-HClO4 acid digestion, HCl leach) and a combination of ICP-MS and ICP-AES are used. The Company’s QA/QC program includes the regular insertion of blanks and standards into the sample shipments, as well as instructions for duplication. Standards, blanks and duplicates are inserted at appropriate intervals. Approximately five percent (5%) of samples have the pulp reject resubmitted for check assaying at a second laboratory. Results presented for Hole 124019 include results from screen fire assay as indicted in Table 2. Screen fire assays were requested due to the presence of coarse gold in the drill core and were performed by ALS Romania. Screen fire assays involve the screening of 1kg at 106 microns to separate the sample into a coarse fraction (>106μm) and a fine fraction (<106μm). After screening, two 50g sub-samples of the fine fraction are analysed using the normal 50g fire assay method with aqua regia digest and analysis by AAS for gold. The entire coarse fraction is assayed to determine the contribution of the coarse gold using fire assay and gravimetric finish. The “total” gold calculation for the 1kg sample is based on the weighted average of the coarse and fine fractions and is reported for the indicated samples. Base of till samples are prepared in ALS Sodankylä by dry-sieving method prep-41 and assayed for gold by fire assay with ICP-AES finish. Multi-elements are assayed in ALS laboratories in either of Ireland, Romania or Sweden by aqua regia with ICP-MS finish. Rupert maintains a strict chain of custody procedure to manage the handling of all samples. The Company’s QA/QC program includes the regular insertion of blanks and standards into the sample shipments, as well as instructions for duplication and external check assays.

The Mineral Resource Estimate for the Ikkari project has been prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 and following the requirements of Form 43-101F1. The methodology used to determine the Mineral Resource Estimate is consistent with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves Best Practices Guidelines (November 2019) and was classified following CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources & Mineral Reserves (May 2014). Readers are cautioned that Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves, and do not demonstrate economic viability. There is no certainty that all, or any part, of this Mineral Resource will be converted into Mineral Reserve. Inferred Mineral Resources are considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as Mineral Reserves. Numbers may be affected by rounding. The QP for the Ikkari Mineral Resource estimate is Mr. Brian Thomas, P.Geo., an independent QP, as defined under NI43-101 and an employee of WSP Canada Inc. based in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. The effective date of the 2023 Mineral Resource Estimate for Ikkari is 24th October 2023. The Mineral Resource Estimate at Ikkari is interpolated using Ordinary Kriging (OK) and is reported both within a Whittle optimized open pit shell and as a potential underground operation outside that. Underground mineral resources are constrained within the estimation domains to meet the RPEEE criteria for UG mining. The Mineral Resource Estimate at Ikkari is reported using a cutoff grade of 0.4g/t Au for mineralisation potentially mineable by open pit methods and 0.9g/t Au for mineralisation potentially extractable by underground methods. The open pit and underground cut off-grades are calculated using a gold price at $1700 per ounce; 95% Au Metallurgical recovery; open pit mining costs at $2.9/t; underground mining cost at $29/t; process costs at $11.3/t; G&A, Rehab and Closure $4.8/t and a royalty of 0.75%. The calculated cutoff grade is rounded up to 0.4g/t for reporting. The calculated underground cutoff grade is rounded up to 0.9g/t. APPENDIX Table 1.

Positive None. Negative None. 03/04/2024 - 05:00 AM CytoMed diversifies into regenerative medicineSINGAPORE, March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CytoMed Therapeutics Limited (NASDAQ: GDTC) (“CytoMed” or “Company”), a Singapore-based biopharmaceutical company focused on harnessing its proprietary technologies to develop novel donor-derived cell-based allogeneic therapies for the treatment of various cancers and aging-related diseases, today announced that it has entered into a Research Collaboration Agreement (“RCA”) with Sengkang General Hospital Pte Ltd (“SKH”), a public hospital in Singapore and a member of the SingHealth group to establish proof-of-concept use of an injectable cartilage regeneration therapy that has been developed with donor-sourced, (allogeneic) umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (“UC-MSCs”) to treat cartilage injury. This injectable therapy will be implemented in vivo to support the application and commencement of a proposed Phase 1 clinical trial in Singapore, and is anticipated to complete within two years. The use of MSC as a potential treatment for tissue regeneration, inflammatory and regenerative diseases has been the subject of increasing interest in the global scientific community. Osteoarthritis of the knee is a debilitating disease affecting Singapore’s aging population and the clinical trial will pioneer stem cell use for regenerative medicine in Singapore. UC-MSCs are a type of adult stem cells that can be isolated from the umbilical cord tissue after childbirth. These cells possess unique properties that have demonstrated to be promising for various therapeutic applications, especially when these cells are freshly harvested and isolated from the umbilical cord, as compared to MSCs derived from frozen tissues, of which the yield and quality may potentially suffer. UC-MSCs are considered multipotent and are able to differentiate into different cell types, including bone, cartilage, fat, and muscle cells. They also exhibit immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties, making them attractive for regenerative medicine and immune-related disorders. ""Our collaboration with CytoMed marks a significant step in advancing research on allogeneic in-vivo UC-MSC for cartilage repair, including osteoarthritis of the knee. Through our commitment to the Investigator Initiated Trial (IIT), we aim to gather crucial safety and efficacy data and evidence to make this intervention more accessible to patients,"" said Assistant Professor Francis Wong, Director of Research at SKH. “The unique advantages of UC-MSCs include their abundant supply, compared to cord blood-derived MSCs or adult stem cell sources like bone marrow-derived MSCs. Freshly harvested UC-MSCs are believed to possess higher proliferation capacity and greater differentiation potential. Additionally, UC-MSCs have been shown to exhibit lower immunogenicity and are less likely to be rejected by the recipient’s immune system, which opens the possibility for allogeneic (donor-to-recipient) transplantation. Therefore, UC-MSC would serve as an ideal source of regenerative cells for treating osteoarthritis of the knee. This hypothesis has also been supported by many international published clinical papers. We are excited to embark on this collaboration, which would potentially be the first stem cell trial in Singapore,” added Dr Tan Wee Kiat, co-CEO and Chief Operating Officer of CytoMed. Under the RCA, CytoMed will provide the allogeneic UC-MSC, processed and expanded in its own state-of-the-art GMP laboratory while SKH will provide the infrastructure, manpower and scientific data analysis. CytoMed is focused on cancer immunotherapies. The RCA has been established within a year of approval of CytoMed’s Phase 1 IIT with the National University Hospital of Singapore, which sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CytoMed’s novel allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (“CAR-T”), which is the first home-grown CAR-T therapy in Singapore, for the treatment of liquid and solid cancers. For more information about the Company's services, latest news, and ongoing initiatives, please visit www.cytomed.sg. About CytoMed Therapeutics Limited (CytoMed)Incorporated in 2018, CytoMed was spun off from the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore’s leading research and development agency in the public sector. It is a biopharmaceutical company focused on harnessing its licensed proprietary technologies, namely gamma delta T cell and iPSC-derived gamma delta Natural Killer T cell, to create novel cell-based allogeneic immunotherapies for the treatment of human cancers. The development of novel technologies has been inspired by the clinical success of existing CAR-T therapies in treating haematological malignancies, as well as the current clinical limitations and commercial challenges in extrapolating the CAR-T principle into the treatment of solid tumors.

Positive None. Negative None. 03/04/2024 - 03:15 AM Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - March 4, 2024) - Defence Therapeutics Inc. (CSE: DTC) (OTCQB: DTCFF) (FSE: DTC) (""Defence"" or the ""Company""), a Canadian biopharmaceutical company developing novel immune-oncology therapeutics and drug delivery technologies, is pleased to announce the granting of US patent no. 11,890,350 ('350) by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), broadly covering its breakthrough AccuTOX® technology. The '350 patent, which includes valuable composition-of-matter claims covering a portfolio of therapeutically-active molecules making up the AccuTOX® platform, provides Defence with potential market exclusivity until late 2042.The AccuTOX® platform is based on the discovery that certain bile acid-peptide conjugates, in their free forms, induce cancer cell death by triggering heightened metabolic stress and the production of reactive oxygen species. The '350 patent demonstrates that the bile acid-peptide conjugates, when used past cytotoxic threshold concentrations, can potently induce cell death in multiple tumor cells in vitro, including lung, breast, colon, melanoma, and lymphoma cancer cells, and can dramatically reduce lymphoma tumor volumes and enhance survival in vivo in treated mice compared to controls.Defence's '350 patent was issued with broad claims encompassing a plurality of AccuTOX® molecules having cytotoxic or cytostatic activity, either as a monotherapy or in combination with other therapeutics. The granted claims also cover AccuTOX® molecules releasably conjugated to a variety of carrier molecules, such as cancer-specific antibodies, where AccuTOX® effectively plays the role of a cytotoxic drug, thereby pioneering a potentially new class of next-generation antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs).Stemming from the data published in the '350 patent, pre-clinical and GLP studies for AccuTOX®, either alone or in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1 and anti-LAG3, were undergone, and have shown that the compound is safe and well tolerated using both rodents and canine animal models, and have also demonstrated significant solid tumor growth reductions. Subsequently, Defence has now received FDA approval to commence its Phase I clinical trial to evaluate the effect of intratumoral administration of AccuTOX® as a monotherapy, as well as in combination with Opdualag (fixed IV doses), in patients with unresectable stage IIIB to IV melanoma refractory to or relapse from standard therapy. ""The rapid granting of the broad '350 patent by the USPTO affirms the innovative and groundbreaking potential of AccuTOX® as a leading cancer therapeutic, and also importantly provides a long patent runway and period of market exclusivity for Defence to fully explore the commercial potential of the AccuTOX® platform and maximize the benefit to our partners and investors,"" says Mr. Plouffe, CEO and president of Defence.This patent marks the fourth granted US patent in Defence's ever-growing patent portfolio, which currently includes seven published patent families.About Defence:Defence Therapeutics is a publicly-traded biotechnology company working on engineering the next generation vaccines and ADC products using its proprietary platform. The core of Defence Therapeutics platform is the ACCUM® technology, which enables precision delivery of vaccine antigens or ADCs in their intact form to target cells. As a result, increased efficacy and potency can be reached against catastrophic illness such as cancer and infectious diseases.For further information:Sebastien Plouffe, President, CEO and DirectorP: (514) 947-2272Splouffe@defencetherapeutics.com www.defencetherapeutics.comCautionary Statement Regarding ""Forward-Looking"" InformationThis release includes certain statements that may be deemed ""forward-looking statements"".

Positive None. Negative None. 03/04/2024 - 02:00 AM (NYSE AMERICAN: CMCL; AIM: CMCL; VFEX: CMCL)ST HELIER, Jersey, March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Caledonia Mining Corporation Plc (“Caledonia” or “the Company”) provides the following trading update for the year ended December 31, 2023. Caledonia reports that Blanket Mine has continued to perform well since the end of the quarter ended September 30, 2023 with full year production for 2023 of 75,416 ounces. As a result, the Company expects to report revenue for the full year in line with market expectations. However, increased operating costs for 2023 and several significant one-off, non-operating costs in the final quarter of the year have resulted in reduced profit for the full year. The increase in operating costs comprises of higher than expected overtime payments and power costs at Blanket Mine. In relation to non-operating costs, general and administrative costs rose with global inflation and these also included higher than expected staff termination costs. The Company also encountered higher financing costs, including hedging, interest, and foreign exchange losses and a one-off impairment charge in relation to a VAT refund claim at the Blanket Mine solar project. As a result of the above, the Company now expects to report an adjusted profit before tax for the year ended December 31, 2023 materially below market expectations. Further information on the increase in costs will be provided in the operating and financial results for the quarter ended December, 31 2023. Reassuringly, a significant proportion of these cost increases are not expected to be carried through into 2024. Specifically, costs associated with Bilboes are now reduced to care and maintenance only and the project was cash neutral in the fourth quarter of 2023. Production and costs at Blanket in 2024 to-date is also within expectations of full year guidance, and the Company is introducing measures aimed at reducing electricity costs over the medium term. At December 31, 2023, the Company had cash on hand of $6.7 million and overdrafts and term loans of $17.7 million. Notice of ResultsThe Company announces that its operating and financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 will be published on or before March 28, 2024. Mark Learmonth, Chief Executive Officer, commented: “It is regrettable that, at a group level, we have been adversely affected by a series of higher-than-expected costs in the second half of 2023 which have had a negative effect on the full year profitability. The performance of Blanket Mine remains strong and, notwithstanding some unforeseen overtime and power cost issues in the second half, has met guidance and produced a robust performance for the second half of 2023. “A number of the other cost items are not anticipated to be recurring, whereas others have arisen from our decisions to invest in the business, most notably around personnel and advancing the Bilboes sulphide project. I am confident that many of these will not recur in 2024 which has started positively and I look forward to the future with optimism as we pursue our goal of becoming a multi-asset production company.” Caledonia Mining Corporation PlcMark LearmonthCamilla HorsfallTel: +44 1534 679 802Tel: +44 7817 841793 Cavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nomad and Joint Broker)Adrian HaddenPearl KellieTel: +44 207 397 1965Tel: +44 131 220 9775 Liberum Capital Limited (Joint Broker)Scott Mathieson/ Matt HoggTel: +44 20 3100 2000 Camarco, Financial PR (UK) Gordon PooleJulia TilleyElfie KentTel: +44 20 3757 4980 3PPB (Financial PR, North America)Patrick ChidleyPaul DurhamTel: +1 917 991 7701Tel: +1 203 940 2538 Curate Public Relations (Zimbabwe)Debra TatendaTel: +263 77802131 IH Securities (Private) Limited (VFEX Sponsor – Zimbabwe)Lloyd MlotshwaTel: +263 (242) 745 119/33/39 Note: The information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information under the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 (“MAR”) as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and is disclosed in accordance with the Company's obligations under Article 17 of MAR.

Positive None. Negative None. 03/04/2024 - 02:34 AM FREMONT, Calif., March 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- AERKOMM Inc. (Euronext: AKOM, OTCQX: AKOM), an innovative satellite communication technology company providing solutions to both public and private sectors, announces the acceleration of negotiations in the merger discussions with EJECTT Inc. (3089.TWO). Following the signing of a Letter of Intent (LOI) for a merger between the company's subsidiary, AERKOMM Taiwan Inc., and EJECTT Inc. in July 2023, the Board of Directors authorized the management on February 22, 2024, to expedite negotiations on the terms of the merger to capitalize on the rapid growth of the SatCom business in the Taiwan market. In the months ahead, active discussions will be conducted on key merger details. With EJECTT as AERKOMM Taiwan Inc.'s exclusive agent in Taiwan, the accelerated merger aims to seamlessly integrate resources in both entities, with the goals of pursuing opportunities in the deployment of global military-grade communication systems, as well as satellite communication opportunities in 6G, which are the key trends highlighted at the 2024 Mobile World Congress (MWC). The satellite communication market in Taiwan is currently experiencing robust growth, driven by integration applications in government-related satellite communications. EJECTT has successfully secured several contracts since 2021, with projects spanning multiple years. As global satellite constellation operators expand their presence, there will be a strong demand for continued end-to-end system integrations for Low Earth Orbit (LEO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), and Geostationary Orbit (GEO), alongside advanced HTS semiconductor antennas, software-defined radio modems, and waveforms, which are unique strengths of AERKOMM Taiwan and EJECTT. Moving forward, the contracts obtained by EJECTT are set to transition from successful completion of military-grade operational tests and evaluations to real-world applications across various sectors. With EJECTT having secured AVL (Approved Vendor List) qualification, the market for its services can now be further expanded from aviation to the mobility sector. And AERKOMM is actively exploring opportunities in the global military communication system arena. Furthermore, in the transition to 6G as defined by 3GPP, the Non-Territorial Network (NTN) plays a major role in communication standards, particularly in utilizing satellites and High-Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS) to extend coverage to the sky, sea, space, and other locations not currently covered by mobile communication systems. Moreover, satellite communication remains a prominent topic in 6G discussions at the 2024 Mobile World Congress (MWC) held in February. And on February 26, the Governments of the United States, Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Sweden, and the United Kingdom jointly announced a statement endorsing principles for 6G. These shared principles aim to foster collaboration in promoting open, free, global, interoperable, reliable, resilient, and secure connectivity. In the era of 6G, AERKOMM is endeavoring to seize business opportunities within the 6G ecosystem, collaborating closely with global telecom operators, telecommunications equipment providers, and solution providers. AERKOMM remains committed to developing and integrating satellite communication technology and solutions. In addition to fostering partnerships and strong engagement with major global players, the company is continuously pursuing its goal of guiding the future of satellite communication for a better-connected world.

Total quarterly APA were 0.3 million, a decrease of 14% year-over-year and 25% quarter-over-quarter.

Recent Development Sohu today announced that on March 2, 2024, its board of directors authorized an increase in Sohu's previously-announced share repurchase from up to US$80 million to up to US$150 million of the outstanding ADSs of Sohu. As previously announced, the ADSs may be purchased from time to time over a two-year period commencing November 11, 2023 at Sohu's management's discretion at prevailing market prices in accordance with Rule 10b‑18 and Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Sohu's management will continue to determine the timing and amount of any purchases of ADSs based on their evaluation of market conditions, the trading price of ADSs and other factors. The share repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Sohu plans to continue to fund repurchases from its existing cash balance. As of February 29, 2024, Sohu had repurchased 1,276,457 ADSs under the share repurchase program for an aggregate cost of approximately US$12 million. Business Outlook For the first quarter of 2024, Sohu estimates: Brand advertising revenues to be between US$15 million and US$17 million; this implies an annual decrease of 25% to 33%, and a sequential decrease of 16% to 26%.Online game revenues to be between US$110 million and US$120 million; this implies an annual decrease of 7% to 15%, and a sequential decrease of 4% to a sequential increase of 5%. Non-GAAP net loss attributable to Sohu.com Limited to be between US$23 million and US$33 million; and GAAP net loss attributable to Sohu.com Limited to be between US$26 million and US$36 million.For the first quarter 2024 guidance, the Company has adopted a presumed exchange rate of RMB7.10=US$1.00, as compared with the actual exchange rate of approximately RMB6.84=US$1.00 for the first quarter of 2023, and RMB7.15=US$1.00 for the fourth quarter of 2023. This forecast reflects Sohu's management's current and preliminary view, which is subject to substantial uncertainty. Non-GAAP Disclosure To supplement the unaudited consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP""), Sohu's management uses non-GAAP measures of gross profit, operating profit, net income, net income attributable to Sohu.com Limited and diluted net income attributable to Sohu.com Limited per ADS, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude the impact of share-based compensation expense; changes in fair value recognized in the Company's consolidated statements of operations with respect to the Company's investments; the impact of income tax related to changes in the fair value of the Company's investments; and interest expense recognized in connection with the Toll Charge imposed by the U.S. TCJA. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. Sohu's management believes excluding share-based compensation expense; changes in fair value recognized in the Company's consolidated statements of operations with respect to the Company's investments; the impact of income tax related to changes in the fair value of the Company's investments; and interest expense recognized in connection with the Toll Charge from its non-GAAP financial measure is useful for itself and investors. Further, the impact of share-based compensation expense; changes in fair value recognized in the Company's consolidated statements of operations with respect to the Company's investments; the impact of income tax related to changes in the fair value of the Company's investments; and interest expense recognized in connection with the Toll Charge cannot be anticipated by management and business line leaders and these expenses were not built into the annual budgets and quarterly forecasts that have been the basis for information Sohu provides to analysts and investors as guidance for future operating performance. As share-based compensation expense and changes in fair value recognized in the Company's consolidated statements of operations with respect to the Company's investments, and the impact of income tax related to changes in the fair value of the Company's investments do not involve subsequent cash outflow or are reflected in the cash flows at the equity transaction level, Sohu does not factor in their impact when evaluating and approving expenditures or when determining the allocation of its resources to its business segments. As a result, in general, the monthly financial results for internal reporting and any performance measures for commissions and bonuses are based on non-GAAP financial measures that exclude share-based compensation expense, changes in fair value recognized in the Company's consolidated statements of operations with respect to the Company's investments, the impact of income tax related to changes in the fair value of the Company's investments, and also excluded the interest expense recognized in connection with the Toll Charge. The non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of Sohu's current financial performance and prospects for the future. A limitation of using non-GAAP gross profit, operating profit, net income, net income attributable to Sohu.com Limited, and diluted net income attributable to Sohu.com Limited per ADS excluding share-based compensation expense and interest expense recognized in connection with the Toll Charge is that share-based compensation expense and interest expense recognized in connection with the Toll Charge have been and can be expected to continue to be significant recurring expenses in Sohu's business. It is also possible that changes in fair value recognized in the Company's consolidated statements of operations with respect to the Company's investments, and the impact of income tax related to changes in the fair value of the Company's investments will recur in the future. In order to mitigate these limitations Sohu has provided specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from each non-GAAP measure. The accompanying tables include details on the reconciliation between the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to the non-GAAP financial measures that have been presented. Notes to Financial Information Financial information in this press release other than the information indicated as being non-GAAP is derived from Sohu's unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Positive None. Negative None. 03/04/2024 - 02:00 AM Parallel applications based on TROPION-Lung01 and TROPION-Breast01 phase 3 trial results demonstrating Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca’s datopotamab deruxtecan significantly improved progression-free survival versus chemotherapy in two types of cancer TOKYO & MUNICH--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has validated two marketing authorization applications (MAAs) for Daiichi Sankyo (TSE: 4568) and AstraZeneca’s (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN) datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) in two types of cancer. One MAA is for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who require systemic therapy following prior treatment. The other MAA is for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic hormone receptor (HR) positive, HER2 negative (IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-) breast cancer who have progressed on and are not suitable for endocrine therapy and received at least one additional systemic therapy. Datopotamab deruxtecan is a specifically engineered TROP2 directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC) discovered by Daiichi Sankyo and being jointly developed by Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca. The validations confirm the completion of the applications and commence the scientific review process by the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. The applications are based on data from the pivotal TROPION-Lung01 and TROPION-Breast01 phase 3 trials presented during two Presidential Symposia at the European Society for Medical Oncology (#ESMO23) 2023 Congress. “The EMA validation is an important first step toward bringing this TROP2 directed antibody drug conjugate to eligible patients in Europe with nonsquamous lung cancer and HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer,” said Ken Takeshita, MD, Global Head, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “This news builds on our recent regulatory progress in the U.S., where our lung cancer application has been accepted and our breast cancer application is underway, underscoring our commitment to changing the standard of care by developing new medicines to help as many patients worldwide as possible.” “Our ambition is for datopotamab deruxtecan to improve upon and replace conventional chemotherapy in the treatment of multiple cancer types,” said Susan Galbraith, MBBChir, PhD, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca. “Today’s dual validation of our applications in lung and breast cancers brings this potential medicine a meaningful step closer to redefining treatment expectations for patients with two of the most common cancers in Europe.” Additional regulatory submissions for datopotamab deruxtecan in lung cancer and breast cancer are underway in the U.S. and globally. About TROPION-Lung01 TROPION-Lung01 is a global, randomized, multicenter, open-label phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of datopotamab deruxtecan versus docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with and without actionable genomic alterations who require systemic therapy following prior treatment. Patients with actionable genomic alterations were previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and an approved targeted therapy. Patients without known actionable genomic alterations were previously treated, either in combination or sequentially, with platinum-based chemotherapy and a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. The dual primary endpoints of TROPION-Lung01 are progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) and overall survival (OS). Key secondary endpoints include investigator-assessed PFS, objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR), time to response, disease control rate (DCR) as assessed by both BICR and investigator, and safety. TROPION-Lung01 enrolled approximately 600 patients in Asia, Europe, North America and South America. For more information visit ClinicalTrials.gov. About TROPION-Breast01 TROPION-Breast01 is a global, randomized, multicenter, open-label phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of datopotamab deruxtecan versus investigator’s choice of single-agent chemotherapy (eribulin, capecitabine, vinorelbine or gemcitabine) in patients with unresectable or metastatic HR positive, HER2 negative (IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-) breast cancer who have progressed on and are not suitable for endocrine therapy per investigator assessment and have received at least one additional systemic therapy for unresectable or metastatic disease. The dual primary endpoints of TROPION-Breast01 are PFS as assessed by BICR and OS. Key secondary endpoints include ORR, DoR, investigator-assessed PFS, DCR, time to first subsequent therapy and safety. TROPION-Breast01 enrolled more than 700 patients in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and South America. For more information visit ClinicalTrials.gov. About Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Nearly 500,000 lung cancer cases were diagnosed in Europe in 2022.1 NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for about 80% of cases.1 Approximately 70% and 30% of NSCLC tumors are of nonsquamous or squamous histology, respectively.2 While immunotherapy and targeted therapies have improved outcomes in the first-line setting, most patients eventually experience disease progression and receive chemotherapy.3,4,5 For decades, chemotherapy has been the last treatment available for patients with advanced NSCLC, despite limited effectiveness and known side effects.3,4,5 About Hormone Receptor Positive, HER2 Negative Breast Cancer More than 500,000 breast cancer cases were diagnosed in Europe in 2022.6 HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer is the most common subtype, accounting for more than 65% of diagnosed cases.7 Breast cancer is considered HR positive, HER2 negative when tumors test positive for estrogen and/or progesterone hormone receptors and negative for HER2 (measured as HER2 score of IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-).7,8 Standard initial treatment for this subtype of breast cancer is endocrine therapy but most patients with advanced disease will develop resistance, underscoring the need for additional options.9,10 About TROP2 TROP2 is a protein broadly expressed in several solid tumors, including the majority of NSCLC and HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer cases.11,12 High TROP2 expression is associated with increased tumor progression and poor survival.12,13 There is currently no TROP2 directed ADC approved for the treatment of lung cancer.14,15 About Datopotamab Deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) is an investigational TROP2 directed ADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, datopotamab deruxtecan is one of six DXd ADCs in the oncology pipeline of Daiichi Sankyo, and one of the most advanced programs in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform. Datopotamab deruxtecan is comprised of a humanized anti-TROP2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody, developed in collaboration with Sapporo Medical University, attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide-based cleavable linkers. A comprehensive development program called TROPION is underway globally with more than 14 trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of datopotamab deruxtecan across multiple cancers, including NSCLC, triple negative breast cancer and HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer. Beyond the TROPION program, datopotamab deruxtecan also is being evaluated in novel combinations in several ongoing trials. About the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan in July 2020, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of ENHERTU and datopotamab deruxtecan. About the DXd ADC Portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo The DXd ADC portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo currently consists of six ADCs in clinical development across multiple types of cancer. ENHERTU, a HER2 directed ADC, and datopotamab deruxtecan, a TROP2 directed ADC, are being jointly developed and commercialized globally with AstraZeneca. Patritumab deruxtecan (HER3-DXd), a HER3 directed ADC, ifinatamab deruxtecan (I-DXd), a B7-H3 directed ADC, and raludotatug deruxtecan (R-DXd), a CDH6 directed ADC, are being jointly developed and commercialized globally with Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, N.J. USA. DS-3939, a TA-MUC1 directed ADC, is being developed by Daiichi Sankyo. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology to target and deliver a cytotoxic payload inside cancer cells that express a specific cell surface antigen, each ADC consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide-based cleavable linkers. Datopotamab deruxtecan, ifinatamab deruxtecan, patritumab deruxtecan, raludotatug deruxtecan and DS-3939 are investigational medicines that have not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

Provides Update on VIVIAD Phase 2b Study of Varoglutamstat in Early Alzheimer’s Disease VIVIAD Phase 2b study did not meet its primary and key secondary endpointsVaroglutamstat was generally well tolerated with low discontinuation rates due to adverse events and no evidence of symptomatic ARIAs in the clinical settingVIVIAD is a comprehensive, diligently designed and high-quality study; baseline demographics in the study were highly representative of early AD patient populationCompany is conducting an in-depth analysis of the results, including analyses of additional pre-specified and exploratory endpointsFurther update expected to be provided no later than with publication of Company’s full year 2023 financial results Halle (Saale) / Munich, Germany, March 4, 2024 – Vivoryon Therapeutics N.V. (Euronext Amsterdam: VVY; NL00150002Q7) (Vivoryon), a clinical stage company focused on the discovery and development of small molecule medicines to modulate the activity and stability of pathologically altered proteins, today announced topline results from its Phase 2b European VIVIAD study of varoglutamstat (PQ912), an investigational oral glutaminyl cyclase (QPCT) inhibitor in development for the treatment of early Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The VIVIAD study did not meet its primary endpoint and did not show a statistically significant difference in change over time on cognition, as measured by a combined score (Z-score) of the Detection test, the Identification test and the ‘One Back’ test (attention and working memory domains) of the Cogstate neuropsychological test battery (NTB), called “Cogstate 3-item scale”. Additionally, the study did not meet key secondary endpoints measuring cognition (Cogstate Brief Battery, CBB, and complete Cogstate NTB), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire (A-IADL-Q) and electroencephalogram (EEG) global theta power. Varoglutamstat was generally well tolerated and showed rates similar to placebo of serious and severe treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs), low discontinuation rates due to adverse events and no evidence of symptomatic ARIAs (amyloid-related imaging abnormalities) in the clinical setting. The Company is conducting an in-depth analysis of the results, including analyses of additional pre-specified exploratory endpoints (e.g. WAIS-IV coding test, executive function and episodic memory domains, Winterlight Labs speech assessment, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and additional EEG analysis) and distinct patient cohorts as defined in the statistical analysis plan, including ApoE4 status, tau level, dose level and pre-treatment. “We are profoundly disappointed by the outcome of the VIVIAD Phase 2b study of varoglutamstat in the early AD patient population given the huge unmet need for new safe and effective oral therapies,” said Frank Weber, M.D., CEO of Vivoryon. “I would like to express our gratitude to the patients, their families and caregivers, as well as the investigators for participating in the VIVIAD study, and to our incredible team at Vivoryon for their tireless efforts. While these results are not what we had hoped for, VIVIAD is a comprehensive, diligently designed and high-quality study and we are doing all we can to fully analyze the dataset as quickly as possible to gain insights into key findings that might influence varoglutamstat clinical development and help advance the science and understanding of this devastating disease.” A further update is expected to be provided no later than with the publication of the Company’s full year 2023 financial results which are expected in mid to late April 2024. ### About VaroglutamstatVaroglutamstat (PQ912) is a differentiated oral small-molecule targeting the toxic Abeta species N3pE which is being developed as disease-modifying therapy and is designed to target AD pathology upstream of Abeta-antibody focused approaches. Varoglutamstat blocks the enzyme glutaminyl cyclase (QPCT) and its isoenzyme QPCTL. QPCT catalyzes the formation of N3pE amyloid, a particularly neurotoxic variant of Abeta peptides, which is only found in patients with AD and not present in the brains of healthy individuals. N3pE amyloid in the brain acts as a seeding element for Abeta aggregation, thus providing a starting point for plaque formation. It has been described to correlate with the cognitive ability of patients with AD. Beyond Abeta pathology, varoglutamstat has also been shown to impact synaptic impairment. Through a second mode of action, the inhibition of full CCL2 maturation via QPCTL, varoglutamstat modulates pro-inflammatory signaling and tau pathology, thereby simultaneously addressing multiple hallmarks of AD. Vivoryon has received Fast Track designation for varoglutamstat in early AD by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is being investigated in two Phase 2 clinical studies, one in Europe (VIVIAD, NCT04498650) and one in the U.S. (VIVA-MIND, NCT03919162). Varoglutamstat has not yet been approved by any regulatory authority and the safety and efficacy have not yet been established. About VIVIAD VIVIAD is a state-of-the-art Phase 2b study conducted in Europe and designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of varoglutamstat in 259 participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild AD (collectively referred to as “early AD”). The primary endpoint is the change over time on working memory and attention as measured by a combined score (Z-score) of the Detection test, the Identification test and the ‘One Back’ test (attention and working memory domains) of the Cogstate neuropsychological test battery (NTB), called “Cogstate 3-item scale”. Key secondary efficacy endpoints include in hierarchical order: Cogstate Brief Battery (CBB, 4-item scale), the complete Cogstate NTB (8-item scale), the Amsterdam Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire (A-IADL-Q), and electroencephalogram (EEG) global theta power. About Vivoryon Therapeutics N.V.Vivoryon is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on developing innovative small molecule-based medicines. Driven by our passion for ground-breaking science and innovation, we strive to change the lives of patients in need suffering from severe diseases. We leverage our in-depth expertise in understanding post-translational modifications to develop medicines that modulate the activity and stability of proteins which are altered in disease settings. Beyond our lead program, varoglutamstat, which is in Phase 2 clinical development to treat Alzheimer’s disease, we have established a solid pipeline of orally available small molecule inhibitors for various indications including cancer, inflammatory diseases and fibrosis. www.vivoryon.com Vivoryon Forward Looking StatementsThis press release includes forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding the business strategy, management plans and objectives for future operations of the Vivoryon Therapeutics N.V.

About BioVie Inc.BioVie Inc. (NASDAQ: BIVI) is a clinical-stage company developing innovative drug therapies for the treatment of neurological and neurodegenerative disorders and advanced liver disease. In neurodegenerative disease, the Company’s drug candidate NE3107 inhibits inflammatory activation of ERK and NFkB (e.g., TNF signaling) that leads to neuroinflammation and insulin resistance, but not their homeostatic functions (e.g., insulin signaling and neuron growth and survival). Both are drivers of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. The Company conducted and reported efficacy data on its randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study to evaluate NE3107 in patients who have mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease (NCT04669028). Results of a Phase 2 investigator-initiated trial (NCT05227820) showing NE3107-treated patients experienced improved cognition and biomarker levels were presented at the Clinical Trial in Alzheimer’s Disease annual conference in December 2022. An estimated six million Americans suffer from Alzheimer’s. A Phase 2 study of NE3107 in Parkinson’s disease (NCT05083260) has completed, and data presented at the International Conference on Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Disease and Related Neurological Disorders conference in Gothenburg, Sweden in March 2023 showed significant improvements in “morning on” symptoms and clinically meaningful improvement in motor control in patients treated with a combination of NE3107 and levodopa vs. patients treated with levodopa alone, and no drug-related adverse events. In liver disease, the Company’s Orphan drug candidate BIV201 (continuous infusion terlipressin), with U.S Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) Fast Track status, is being evaluated and discussed with guidance received from the FDA regarding the design of Phase 3 clinical testing of BIV201 for the treatment of ascites due to chronic liver cirrhosis. The active agent is approved in the U.S. and in about 40 countries for related complications of advanced liver cirrhosis. For more information, visit http://www.bioviepharma.com/.
