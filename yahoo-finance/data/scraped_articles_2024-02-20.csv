Motley Fool,Super Micro Computer Fell Again Today -- Is This an Opportunity to Buy 2024's Most Explosive AI Stock?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/super-micro-computer-fell-again-214043885.html,"Despite recent sell-offs, Super Micro Computer stock is up 175% in 2024 and 757% over the last year.","Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) stock slipped in Tuesday's trading. The company's share price closed out the daily session down 6.8%, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Notably, it had been down as much as 11.7% earlier in the day's trading, but it bounced back as some investors bought into the sell-off.While there wasn't any business-specific news pushing Supermicro stock lower today, the server-and-storage technology company's share price lost ground as Wall Street weighed potential macroeconomic risks. The trend impacted many high-profile artificial intelligence (AI) stocks with growth-dependent valuations, including Nvidia and AMD.Before the market opened this morning, Home Depot published its fourth-quarter earnings results and set a bearish backdrop for the broader market. While the retailer may not seem to have much connection to AI stocks, the company's performance and guidance is a bellwether for the U.S. economy.Notably, Home Depot's management said that persistent inflation was continuing to impact its performance. The home improvement retail giant indicated that headwinds could continue throughout the year. If inflation continues to run hot, the Federal Reserve will likely delay the interest rate cuts that investors have been anxiously awaiting. If so, that could be bad news for Super Micro Computer and other growth stocks.Is Supermicro stock's recent pullback a buying opportunity?Even with recent sell-offs for the stock, Supermicro is still up 177% in 2024's trading. Over the last year, the company's share price has risen an incredible 757%.SMCI PE Ratio (Forward) ChartEven with dramatic improvements for the company's performance outlook, explosive stock gains have had the effect of pushing the company's valuation up to far more growth-dependent levels. Shares now trade at 26.5 times this year's expected earnings and approximately 36 times next year's expected profits.Story continuesSupermicro's recent business momentum seems to support its current valuation, but investors should understand that macroeconomic headwinds could hurt the stock. Additionally, it remains to be seen whether the business will be able to sustain such rapid sales and earnings growth -- or if demand for its high-performance rack servers is experiencing a more cyclical upswing.If you're bullish on the long-term outlook for the AI space and demand trends for high-end servers, Supermicro stock looks like a worthwhile portfolio addition. With Nvidia scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings results after the market closes tomorrow, it's possible that today's valuation pullback for AI stocks will quickly be reversed.Should you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?Before you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Why Bloom Energy Stock Keeps Going Down,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-bloom-energy-stock-keeps-212628472.html,Not all of the news about Bloom Energy is bad.,"By now you've probably heard the bad news about Bloom Energy (NYSE: BE). On Thursday, the hydrogen fuel cell pioneer announced a big revenue miss and a 23% decline in revenue year over year for its fiscal fourth quarter of 2023. The CFO announced he's leaving the company, and investors seemed inclined to do likewise, selling off Bloom stock by 17.5%.On Tuesday, the selling continued, with Bloom stock losing a further 9.1% through 3:05 p.m. ET -- and Bank of America may be the reason.A late downgrade from BofAFriday, as you can imagine, wasn't a lot of fun for Bloom Energy investors, as their stock sold off after earnings. Earnings came out Thursday evening, and Friday morning was mostly dominated by news of various analysts cutting price targets and downgrading the stock -- hence the falling stock price.What you may not know is that at the very end of Friday -- after trading was done for the day and at the start of a three-day weekend in which no new trading could begin -- Bank of America also decided to downgrade Bloom Energy. Analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith lowered BofA's price target on Bloom stock to $9 a share -- the lowest price target of any analyst commenting on Bloom on Friday.Not only upset by the miss on sales, Dumoulin-Smith pointed out that new order activity was weak in December, leading to weak guidance for this coming year. Accordingly, the analyst is continuing to recommend that investors sell Bloom stock.Is Bloom Energy stock a sell?Is that really fair, though? Because as it turns out, Bloom's guidance wasn't exactly horrible. Bloom says 2024 sales will range from $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, up 12.5% from 2023. Furthermore, non-GAAP operating profit is estimated to be anywhere from $75 million to $100 million -- up several times from the $19 million in non-GAAP operating profit reported in 2023.True, management didn't promise any GAAP profit in 2024. And 12.5% probably isn't as great as what growth investors are looking for. But it's at least better than Bloom promising another revenue decline.Story continuesLast week, Bloom basically confirmed analyst predictions that it's going to turn non-GAAP profitable this year, which implies that analysts might be right about the company finally turning GAAP profitable in 2025 as well. Investors who are selling Bloom stock today could be selling just before the news about it starts to improve.Should you invest $1,000 in Bloom Energy right now?Before you buy stock in Bloom Energy, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bloom Energy wasn’t one of them.

Its revenue is expected to be buoyed by soaring demand in its data center business. AI should remain strong, especially with Meta Platforms Inc. and Tesla Inc. continuing to load up on graphics processing units, Susquehanna said.To Matt Maley at Miller Tabak + Co., while bets are that Nvidia will report solid earnings and forecasts, one thing to keep in mind is that the stock has not always responded well to fabulous results.“Sometimes their expectations are SO high that we get a ‘sell the news’ reaction, Maley said. “We don’t know which reaction we’ll get this week, so we wouldn’t be surprised if investor and traders sit on their hands until they report this Wednesday evening.”In the run-up to its results, Nvidia sank over 5%, leading losses in megacaps. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 dropped 1%, while the S&P 500 fell below 5,000. A gauge of chipmakers slid 2%. Walmart Inc. rallied after reporting strong earnings. Treasury 10-year yields declined three basis points to 4.25%. The dollar retreated.Story continuesWhile the AI frenzy has boosted tech stocks that have been linked to the technology, Nvidia is one of the few firms to have demonstrated significant revenue growth from AI.This year’s rally briefly placed the giant chipmaker’s market capitalization ahead of the values of both Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. While other big tech shares have hardly performed badly in 2024, juxtaposed with Nvidia’s rally they appear to be relegated to the slow lane.Beyond the company’s raw results, investors will be particularly keen to see how Nvidia’s chief Jensen Huang sees demand developing across the rest of the year, according to Matthew Weller at Forex.com and City Index.“Any signs that the AI boom may be slowing could lead to a big bearish reversal in the stock, so traders are justifiably on tenterhooks ahead of the release,” Weller said.Corporate Highlights:Walmart Inc. also said it agreed to buy smart-TV maker Vizio Holding Corp. for about $2.3 billion.Macy’s Inc. said it received nine nominations to its board from Arkhouse Management Co., the activist investor leading an effort to acquire the department-store company.Home Depot Inc. reported a fifth straight comparable sales decline, underscoring a drop in demand for house improvement due to high mortgage rates and a slowdown in construction.The Biden administration is in talks to confer more than $10 billion in subsidies to Intel Corp., people familiar with the matter said, in what would be the largest award yet under a plan to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to US soil.The US plans to award $1.5 billion to GlobalFoundries Inc., the largest domestic maker of made-to-order semiconductors, as part of the Biden administration’s effort to strengthen the nation’s chip production.Capital One Financial Corp. agreed to buy Discover Financial Services in a $35 billion all-stock deal to create the largest US credit card company by loan volume, giving the combined entity a stronger foothold to compete with Wall Street’s behemoths.Barclays Plc said it will go on a major cost-cutting drive, re-organize its reporting structure and return at least £10 billion to shareholders in the coming years, ending months of speculation about the future direction of one of Europe’s largest investment banks.Bayer AG plans to slash its dividend by 95% in an effort to dig itself out of a hole created by the acquisition of Monsanto Co. that saddled the German company with massive debt and waves of litigation.Key Events This Week:Eurozone consumer confidence, WednesdayNvidia, HSBC earnings, WednesdayFederal Reserve releases minutes from its January meeting, WednesdayAtlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic speaks, WednesdayEurozone S&P Global Services PMI, S&P Global Manufacturing PMI, CPI, ThursdayUS initial jobless claims, US existing home sales, ThursdayECB issues account of January meeting, ThursdayFed Governor Lisa Cook and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari speak, ThursdayChina property prices, FridayGermany IFO business climate, GDP, FridayECB publishes 1- and 3-Year inflation expectations survey, FridaySome of the main moves in markets:StocksThe S&P 500 fell 0.5% as of 11:07 a.m. New York timeThe Nasdaq 100 fell 1%The Dow Jones Industrial Average was little changedThe Stoxx Europe 600 was little changedThe MSCI World index fell 0.3%CurrenciesThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.2%The euro rose 0.4% to $1.0818The British pound rose 0.4% to $1.2650The Japanese yen rose 0.2% to 149.83 per dollarCryptocurrenciesBitcoin fell 0.3% to $51,755.97Ether fell 1.3% to $2,930.29BondsThe yield on 10-year Treasuries declined three basis points to 4.25%Germany’s 10-year yield declined four basis points to 2.37%Britain’s 10-year yield declined six basis points to 4.05%CommoditiesWest Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.7% to $78.64 a barrelSpot gold rose 0.5% to $2,026.53 an ounceThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekGene Therapy Makers Struggle to Find Patients for Miracle CuresHow Paramount Became a Cautionary Tale of the Streaming WarsPursuing ‘American Dynamism,’ Andreessen Horowitz Ups Its Game in DCHow Uber Beat the Skeptics and Became ProfitableToday’s Satellite Boom Was Foretold in Busts of Yesteryear©2024 Bloomberg L.P."

""We don't think there's incremental pressure nor do we think that we're quite ready for a hockey stick recovery.""Home Depot stock was about 0.2% in afternoon trade on Tuesday.The retailer said Tuesday that its fourth-quarter sales declined 3% to $34.8 billion from the year-earlier period. It expects sales growth of 1% in its fiscal year 2024.“We have a housing market in the US that is largely in a state of paralysis. There’s just not much happening right now. Lower rates will help unlock that paralysis and serve as a better driver in better sales for Home Depot,"" Oppenheimer managing director Brian Nagel told Yahoo Finance Live Tuesday morning.Existing home sales slumped last year given rising interest rates, limited housing inventory, and lower affordability, which in turn led to some softness around home improvement spending as turnover in the housing market slowed.And with the odds of imminent rate cut from the Federal Reserve falling, Decker expects to see an extension of this moderation in home spending through the first half of this year.""[Home Depot CFO Richard McPhail] has been talking for some time [about] the Fed's stance of higher for longer,"" Decker added. ""I think we now we have an appreciation that longer is going to go through the first half of this year.""Comments that echo what others in the housing industry have said of late.""But the inflation numbers, if they continue to stay persistently higher, then, that calls into question whether or not the Fed is going to cut three times, maybe they only cut two, and then when do they cut?"" NAHB CEO Jim Tobin told Yahoo Finance Live last week.""This idea that they're going to cut in the spring seems to be off the table now.""Tue, February 20, 2024 at 11:44 AM PSTBrian SozziBefore Those Nvidia Earnings....It's almost Nvidia (NVDA) earnings day!I hope you have pre-ordered your food delivery for tomorrow night so you can place full attention on CEO Jensen Huang's earnings call. For to miss Huang's comments could mean not good things for your broader portfolio of tech stocks if he says something bad (and the opposite if he really delivers an effortless earnings call).But before that call, below are some impactful new stats from the strategy team over Goldman Sachs.I think they go a long way to explaining why Nvidia and the Magnificent 7 has become such an important driver of stock prices.""If Nvidia reports estimates in line with consensus [for the quarter], the Magnificent 7 will have grown sales by 15% year/year and lifted margins by 582 basis points year/year, leading to earnings growth of 58%. In contrast, the remaining 493 stocks in the S&P 500 grew sales by 3% year/year while margins contracted by 56 basis points and earnings fell by 2%.""""The strength of the Magnificent 7’s results has caused analysts to lift their expectations for 2024. During the past 3 months, Magnificent 7 earnings estimates have been revised upwards by 7% and margins have been revised upwards by 86 basis points. This compares with a 3% downward revision to earnings and 30 basis point downward revision to margins for the remaining 493 stocks. The Magnificent 7 accounted for 11% of total 2023 S&P 500 sales and 18% of earnings, and consensus expects the stocks to grow EPS by 20% in 2024.""Tue, February 20, 2024 at 10:53 AM PST Josh SchaferWall Street strategist see even more upside for the S&P 500 in 2024The high-water mark for Wall Street's S&P 500 (^GSPC) predictions has moved up yet again.The S&P 500 has hit new record highs to kick-off 2024.The surge in stocks put the benchmark average above the average Wall Street strategist year-end target less than two months into the year. And now, several of those strategists are boosting their projections for how far stocks can run in 2024.On Friday, Goldman Sachs boosted its year-end target from 5,100 to 5,200. Three days later, UBS also boosted its target. The UBS Investment Bank equity strategy team led by Jonathan Golub now sees the S&P 500 ending this year at 5,400, up from a prior call for 5,100. This reflects nearly an eight percent increase from Monday's opening price.""Despite our bullish outlook, it appears we were not bullish enough,"" Golub wrote.Both Goldman Sachs and UBS expressed a more upbeat outlook for corporate earnings this year, than previously forecasted when describing why they see further upside in stocks. To Goldman, an increased earnings and profit outlook for the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks is likely to drive a lion's share of the gains.Meanwhile, UBS points out that recent readings on stickier-than-expected inflation, might not be as troublesome for stocks as initially feared.""Earnings benefit from higher inflation,"" UBS Investment Bank Chief US Equity Strategist Jonathan Golub wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.He added: ""Returns and profits are measured in nominal dollars,"" Golub wrote. ""Put differently, higher inflation tends to be a positive for stock prices. While the market sold off on more robust [Consumer Price Index] and [Producer Price Index] reports last week, our work indicates that these demand-driven readings are constructive for future returns.""A graph from UBS Investment Bank shows that ""earnings benefit from higher inflation.""

The moves come just ahead of its quarterly results on Wednesday.Nvidia, which has greatly benefitted from the AI boom, is expected to report Q4 revenue of $20.4 billion, up 236% year-over-year, with earnings per share estimated to clock in at $4.60, an increase of 422% compared to the year-ago period.Super Micro Computer (SMCI): The company's stock fell another 10% on Tuesday following a Friday reversal after shares tripled its value in less than a month. SMCI has seen shares surge amid AI optimism with investors beginning to weigh frothiness in the market. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), another AI darling, also saw shares fall on Tuesday, declining about 6%.But analysts say there's more room to run. On Tuesday, Rosenblatt Securities increased its price target on SMCI shares to $1,300 from $700. The stock has soared nearly 700% since last year.Walmart (WMT): Shares climbed about 3% after the retailer reported another strong quarter of sales growth while also confirming plans to buy budget TV maker Vizio. Same-store sales climbed 4% in the quarter, driven by more shoppers going to the store more frequently.Discover Financial Services (DFS): Shares surged about 15% after Warren Buffett-backed Capital One confirmed plans to acquire Discover in a $35.3 billion deal. The agreement, which is expected to receive increased antitrust scrutiny, would form the sixth-largest US bank by assets.Tue, February 20, 2024 at 9:27 AM PSTAlexandra CanalNasdaq leads stock market declines US stocks took another leg down by mid-afternoon trading on Tuesday.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the day's declines, dropping more than 1.5%.

To put that expectation into perspective, its total 2022 revenue was $27 billion. Earnings per share are expected to clock in at $4.60, an increase of 422% compared to the year-ago period.Still, the stock dropped about 6% on Tuesday — on track for its largest percent decrease since May 2023 as it shed about $100 billion off of its market cap.Nvidia has been one company that's greatly benefitted from the AI boom.Despite Tuesday's losses, the company boasts a current market cap of just under $1.7 trillion. That's the third-highest market cap in the world, behind only Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT).Shares are up nearly 40% since the start of the year and have soared about 220% since last year.Wednesday's report will not only be important for shares, but will also be a critical for markets. ""If Nvidia misses or just fails to hit a home run ... that can have a gravitational effect on the whole market,"" Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick told Yahoo Finance's Madison Mills.Tue, February 20, 2024 at 8:00 AM PSTAlexandra CanalWalmart CFO: Retailer won't enter media biz — despite Vizio dealWalmart (WMT) might have just confirmed plans to acquire TV maker Vizio — but don't expect the retailer to be a content generator.While speaking in an interview with Yahoo Finance Live on Tuesday, Walmart CFO John David Rainey revealed the company has no plans to enter the crowded media business.""That's arguably a red sea of competition and I'm not sure that that's really what we need to be focused on,"" Rainey said.""I think we can provide better value on focusing some of the basics that our customers expect from us,"" he continued, adding improving its delivery and e-commerce capabilities remain top priorities.In other words, Walmart doesn't seem to want to compete in the original content and streaming space, which competitor Amazon (AMZN) has certainly leaned into over the past several years after the tech giant completed its acquisition of MGM in 2022.""We want to focus on the basics,"" Rainey reiterated.Watch the full interview here.

As Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports, the rise was driven by more shoppers going to the store more frequently. However, a slight drop in the average ticket signaled they added less to their basket.Read the full earnings breakdown here.Home Depot: Shares dipped about 1.5% after the company's guidance disappointed investors. Home Depot said it expects 1% sales growth in fiscal 2024. Wall Street was expecting closer to 1.6%.Still, the home improvement giant beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines, despite quarterly sales declining nearly 3% compared to the year-ago period.Tue, February 20, 2024 at 6:35 AM PSTAlexandra CanalStocks slide to kick off shortened trading week US stocks fell on Tuesday to kick off a shortened holiday trading week.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the early morning losses, dropping roughly 0.4%.

Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) is set to report earnings on Wednesday.Tue, February 20, 2024 at 5:47 AM PSTBrian SozziDecoding Walmart’s $2.3 Billion Deal for TV Maker VizioYours truly and the Yahoo Finance Live team are sitting down with Walmart (WMT) CFO John David Rainey today at 9:30 a.m. ET — so we plan to drill into the company’s play for Vizio (VZIO) revealed this morning, along with earnings.At first, you would think this deal is all about selling more TVs at Walmart during the Super Bowl or Christmas. Vizio, after all, relies on Walmart for about 50% of its annual sales.But there is so much more to this deal beneath the surface, which Walmart alluded to in its press release:This is a big data play: Walmart will gain impressive access to consumer behavior via Vizio’s Inscape measuring system. More on that process here.This is a big advertising play: Amazon (AMZN) has been making bank on ad sales for some time, and so has Walmart under the radar. In the fourth quarter, Walmart delivered double-digit percentage ad sales growth in its US division, Sam’s Club, and International division. This will now be turbocharged for Walmart via access to Vizio’s Smartcast operating system.Ultimately, this deal is bad news for Roku (ROKU). Shares are down 6% on the news after getting hit on deal speculation a couple of weeks back. Trade Desk (TTD) is also being sent lower by 3% — but I need to do more work on their business before saying there is a bad impact on them.No real movement in shares of Best Buy (BBY) on the news, though Citi did reiterate a Sell rating on the stock this morning into earnings later this month.Vizio shares are up 16%.Before you go, a look back at Yahoo Finance's coverage of Vizio's IPO in 2021 via a chat with their CFO Adam Townsend.Tue, February 20, 2024 at 4:57 AM PSTBrian SozziCapital One's $35.3 billion Discover deal is unwelcome news for Visa, Mastercard, and AmexI could tell you who is probably having a busy morning: top execs at Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), and American Express (AXP) following Capital One’s (COF) $35.3 billion deal for Discover (DFS).I suspect they will be fielding calls from investors who will be curious about their thoughts on what this transaction could mean for the future of competition in the payments space (notice I say could, because in this regulatory climate and ahead of an election, a consumer credit card deal will be very closely scrutinized by regulators).Some initial talking points for what this combined company will look like:A total asset base of $630 billionBroken down as follows:$254 billion in credit card receivables$90 billion in commercial loans$85 billion in consumer loans$10 billion in student loans$145 billion of other earning assetsAbout $2.7 billion in pre-tax synergiesThe vibe on the Street this morning is that the deal makes strong sense for Capital One and is the right move even if the price tag is stiff (said price tag is hitting Capital One’s stock to the tune of over 3%).But it’s the commentary around the implications for Visa, Mastercard, and Amex that has captured most of my attention this morning(note: shares of Visa, Mastercard, and Amex are all lower).For your review:""According to The Nilson Report, Capital One issued debit and credit cards generated ~$600 billion in purchase volume in 2022 (3% of V/MA global volume), making it the third largest domestic issuer of V/MA credit cards (~60% of its credit card portfolio being with Mastercard according to Nilson, ~40% Visa) and the twelfth largest debit card issuer (primarily Mastercard, we believe). We expect any transition away from V/MA would likely be slow (Mastercard renewed its network partnership with Capital One in 1Q22, Visa in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2022) and portfolio by-portfolio (V/MA have a ~40% larger global acceptance network). Acknowledging Discover’s network is much smaller generating 2% the volume as V/MA globally, it gives Capital One the optionality to negotiate away from (or price-down) the global networks over time, in our view."" -JPMorgan analyst Tien-tsin Huang""We believe the combination of COF and DFS should be strategically compelling from a competitive perspective vs. V/MA. At a high level, the risk to the networks is simple—can COF monetize DFS’s network capabilities, which historically have not gained much market share vs. the networks? COF’s strong card and banking presence could prove to be the combo platter that starts a more competitive environment vs. V/MA and AMEX. Obviously, V/MA do not underwrite credit and therefore must rely on their card issuing bank relationships for direction and non-anonymized data, but in an environment of AI, whereby large 'specific' data assets are becoming more valuable, the combination of Capital One and Discover becomes more compelling, in our view. All else equal, we believe the combination could prove to be more competitive for V/MA and thus worth watching."" -RBC analyst Daniel Perlin"

Meanwhile, Nvidia was down 4.4%, and AMD was down 4.9%.After the market closed on Friday, Bloomberg reported that Intel could receive up to $10 billion in additional grants and loans to support its chip fabrication business -- funding allocated to boost the American semiconductor industry as part of the CHIPS Act. Because the market was closed Monday for Presidents Day, investors' positive reactions to the news had to wait until Tuesday.Intel is gaining despite macroeconomic concernsAI stocks with growth-dependent valuations are broadly losing ground Tuesday as investors weigh inflationary risks. Home Depot published its earnings results before the market opened, and management stated that the continued impacts of inflation were causing customers to be more cautious with their spending. Those comments have left investors more concerned that the Federal Reserve may opt to wait longer before cutting benchmark interest rates.Despite the uptick in perceived macroeconomic risks, Intel stock gained significant ground. It had been up by as much as 3.8% earlier in the day's trading, but lost some ground as inflation concerns started to play a bigger role in moving the broader market.Intel could deliver big news this weekIntel is scheduled to host a conference Wednesday during which it will provide updates on its foundry business. As the leading U.S.-based manufacturer of semiconductors, the company's economic and geopolitical importance is on the rise.Right now, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is the world's leading manufacturer of the high-performance semiconductors used for artificial intelligence and other accelerated computing applications. But China has indicated that it could move to exert greater influence over Taiwan in the near future, and that poses major economic and security risks to the U.S. and other Western countries.Story continuesAs a result of this dynamic, the U.S. and other nations are working to increase their domestic chip production capabilities -- and Intel aims to make semiconductor fabrication a much bigger part of its business. Investors could get some major updates on the company's evolving fab business Wednesday.Should you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?Before you buy stock in Intel, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Nintendo Stock Drops as Investors Fear the Switch 2 Won't Launch Until Next Year,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nintendo-stock-drops-investors-fear-202446948.html,Management likely sees a little more life in its current product offering.,"Shares of Japanese video game company Nintendo (OTC: NTDOY) fell on Tuesday after a Bloomberg report said that the company would delay the release of its new hardware device, the Switch 2. The report came out Friday evening after the market closed.And since the market was closed over the weekend, as well as Monday, investors couldn't react until today. As of 1:50 p.m. ET, Nintendo stock was down 5%.What's going on with the Switch 2?First, investors should understand that the Switch 2 console hasn't even been announced yet by notoriously tight-lipped Nintendo.Nintendo launched its latest console, the Nintendo Switch, seven years ago, and it's sold 139 million units as of December 2023. It's been an impressive run for the Nintendo Switch. But after this much time, investors and analysts alike were expecting a new console in 2024.According to anonymous sources for Bloomberg, Nintendo is telling video game publishers not to expect a new console until after March 2025.This is only a few months later than when analysts had expected a new console from Nintendo, which sounds like a minor detail to shrug off. But March falls after the important holiday shopping season, which is why the market is reacting so negatively to this news.What should investors do now?Even though it's not offering much commentary, I believe it's logical to assume that Nintendo is working on its next-generation video game console. But I wouldn't assume that the company is running into problems with its development. It's trying to make the Switch last as long as possible.Nintendo's management says this in its press releases. It recently said that its ""objective is to continually release new offerings so more consumers keep playing Nintendo Switch even longer, and we can maximize hardware sales.""Considering its sales are still strong and profits are high, Nintendo likely sees a little more life in its current Switch console and will release its successor when it believes the time is right. That could lead to slower growth in the coming year. But I don't believe it's a reason for long-term concern.Story continuesShould you invest $1,000 in Nintendo right now?Before you buy stock in Nintendo, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nintendo wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Why AMD Stock Is Falling Today,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-amd-stock-falling-today-201719053.html,"Inflation concerns are weighing on AMD, but the stock is still up 110% over the last year.","AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) stock is falling in Tuesday's trading. The semiconductor company's share price was down 5.4% as of 10:15 a.m. ET, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index was down 0.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.3%.The broader market is seeing negative momentum in conjunction with rising macroeconomic concerns. Wall Street seems to be worried that inflation may not be under control yet, and Home Depot's recent earnings report intensified those concerns.What do Home Depot's results have to do with AMD?Home Depot reported quarterly results before the market opened this morning and reported a 3.5% decrease in same-store sales. The retail giant is viewed as a bellwether for the economy at large, and the company's management specifically stated that persistent inflation was causing customers to be more cautious. Why is this bad news for AMD stock?On the heels of 110% gains over the last year, AMD's valuation has been pushed up to a much more growth-dependent valuation. If inflation continues to come in significantly above the Federal Reserve's target level of 2%, the central banking authority's pivot to cutting interest rates could be pushed further out. If so, that would be bad news for AMD and other stocks with growth-dependent valuations.What comes next for AMD stock?Investors broadly expect that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates this year. Some analysts had been hoping that the Fed would begin reducing rates in March, but that no longer appears to be in the cards. According to a recent Reuters poll, a slim majority of economists now expect the first cut to happen in June.The stock market, and growth stocks in particular, could see bearish sentiment increase if expectations for the arrival of rate cuts shift further out. The interest rate outlook will play a key role in AMD's stock performance this year, but a different catalyst could soon wind up shaping its valuation.Story continuesAMD stock has skyrocketed over the last year thanks to excitement surrounding artificial intelligence, and its share price will likely make moves in conjunction with Nvidia's upcoming fourth-quarter report. Nvidia will report earnings after the market closes tomorrow.Just as Home Depot is a bellwether for the retail space and broader U.S. economy, Nvidia is a key bellwether for AI -- and its Q4 report can be expected to have a significant impact on the overall stock market's near-term performance. While Nvidia is a key competitor, AMD shareholders should actually be hoping that the rival AI player's fourth-quarter report knocks it out of the park.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

""We don't think there's incremental pressure nor do we think that we're quite ready for a hockey stick recovery.""","A soft housing market has weighed on the home improvement sector over the past year, and signs of a turnaround could remain elusive in 2024, according to the country's biggest home improvement retailer.""I'd say we have a neutral look on housing for 2024,"" Home Depot (HD) CEO Edward Decker said on the company's fourth quarter earnings call Tuesday. ""We don't think there's incremental pressure nor do we think that we're quite ready for a hockey stick recovery.""The retailer said that its fourth-quarter sales declined 3% to $34.8 billion from the year-earlier period. It expects sales growth of 1% in its fiscal year 2024.Home Depot stock was up about 0.2% in afternoon trade on Tuesday.Existing home sales slumped last year given rising interest rates, limited housing inventory, and lower affordability, which in turn led to some softness around home improvement spending as turnover in the housing market slowed.And with the odds of imminent rate cut from the Federal Reserve falling, Decker expects to see an extension of this moderation in home spending through the first half of this year.EL CERRITO, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 21: In an aerial view, a sign is seen posted on the exterior of a Home Depot store on February 21, 2023 in El Cerrito, California. Home improvement retailer Home Depot announced plans to spend an estimated $1 billion to raise pay and benefits for hourly workers at its stores.

""I think we now we have an appreciation that longer is going to go through the first half of this year.""The comments echoed what others in the housing industry have said of late.""But the inflation numbers, if they continue to stay persistently higher, then, that calls into question whether or not the Fed is going to cut three times, maybe they only cut two, and then when do they cut?"" NAHB CEO Jim Tobin told Yahoo Finance Live last week.""This idea that they're going to cut in the spring seems to be off the table now.""While the exact timing of Fed rate cuts is up for debate, an eventual reduction in rates should help Home Depot, Oppenheimer managing director Brian Nagel told Yahoo Finance Live Tuesday morning.Story continues“We have a housing market in the US that is largely in a state of paralysis. There’s just not much happening right now. Lower rates will help unlock that paralysis and serve as a better driver in better sales for Home Depot,"" Nagel said.Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Schaeffer's Investment Research,Fastly Stock Could Stage a Quick Rebound,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fastly-stock-could-stage-quick-200859831.html,"FSLY has pulled back to its 320-day moving average, a historically bullish trendline","Still stinging from its Feb. 15 post-earnings drop of 30.6%, Fastly Inc (NYSE:FSLY) was last seen starting the holiday-shortened week down 5.5% at $14.92. Only a week removed from its Feb. 12 two-year high of $25.87, the stock is now trading at its lowest levels since October.For those looking to buy in on the dip, however, the recent pullback has FSLY within one standard deviation of its 320-day moving average, a trendline with historically bullish implications. According to Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, the equity has seen three similar signals in the past three years, after which it was higher one month later each time, averaging an impressive 20% gain.FSLY Feb20Fastly stock's 14-day relative strength index (RSI) of 34.3 is nearing ""oversold"" territory, which is typically indicative of a short-term bounce. Plus, short interest represents 6.5% of the stock's available float, and would take three days to cover at FSLY's average pace of trading.Calls look like a good way to go. The security's Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) of 59% ranks in the low 9th percentile of its annual range, meaning premium is cheap at the moment."
Schaeffer's Investment Research,Why Albemarle Stock Could Go From Bad to Worse,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-albemarle-stock-could-bad-194236838.html,A partnership with BMW Group isn't helping the shares,"Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) stock was last seen down 6.4% at $114.79, despite today announcing a multi-year agreement with the BMW Group for lithium for hydroxide supplies. The shares are down 55.2% over the last 12 months, and last week ran into resistance from a trendline that has historically generated headwinds.Albemarle stock is within one standard deviation of its 80-day moving average. Per Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White's data, the equity saw five similar signals in the last three years, defined for this study as having traded south of this trendline 80% of the time over the last two months, and in eight of the last 10 trading days. ALB 80 Day Just one month later after 80% of those instances, the security was lower, averaging a 12% dip. A comparable move from its current perch would place ALB just over $100 for the first time since November 2020. Those looking to speculate on ALB's next moves should consider options. The stock's Schaeffer's Volatility Scorecard (SVS) of 97 out of 100 means that the equity usually outperforms volatility expectations."
