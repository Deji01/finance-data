Yahoo Finance,Stock market today: S&P 500 slides for 5th straight day,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-today-sp-500-slides-for-5th-straight-day-200158049.html,"Investors are counting down to earnings from Netflix, the first of the ""Magnificent"" group of companies to report.","US stocks finished largely in the red Thursday as April's doldrums lingered in the market and investors braced for Netflix (NFLX) to kick earnings season into high gear.The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.2% to notch its fifth-straight session of declines, its longest losing streak of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) hovered just above the flat line, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped 0.5%, extending tech's recent slump.Stocks have struggled amid concerns inflation is no longer cooling and the Federal Reserve could ease back on interest rate cuts. Fed officials fueled those worries on Thursday with Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic reiterating that he doesn’t expect to lower rates until the end of the year.That has put corporate earnings center stage as investors watch closely how well reports match up with high expectations. TSMC's (TSM) latest quarterly results were a mixed bag: The Taiwanese chip giant cautioned on its growth outlook this year outside of its memory chips business, sending the stock over 5% lower. The company, however, flagged ""insatiable"" appetite for AI as it posted a quarterly profit beat.The earnings spotlight now shifts to Netflix, the first of the megacap tech companies to report. The streaming leader's financial update is seen by some as the first real test for stocks this earnings season, given the megacaps are still playing a big part in pushing markets higher.US bond yields, a recent headwind for stocks, picked up again on Thursday. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) was up, trading near 4.65%.Live11 updatesThu, April 18, 2024 at 12:30 PM PDTAlexandra CanalHere comes Netflix earnings...Netflix (NFLX) is set to report its fiscal first quarter earnings on Thursday after market close — but the streamer will have a high bar to overcome as expectations remain elevated while the stock's valuation has surged in recent months.""We believe the [increase] in Netflix's stock price over the past 18 months makes for a tricky set up into Thursday's earnings report,"" Deutsche Bank wrote in a note on Monday. Shares are up more than 155% over the past year and a half, with the stock currently trading near the high end of its 52-week range.""We believe that in order for the stock to appreciate further, consensus estimates for 2024 to 2025 will need to be revised higher, as we believe a lot is already priced in at these valuation levels,"" the bank said.Investors will continue to assess the company's revenue initiatives, like its crackdown on password sharing and ad-supported tier, in addition to last year's price hikes on certain subscription plans.Those initiatives should help boost metrics like free cash flow, operating margins, and average revenue per member, or ARM.Here's what Wall Street expects, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates:Revenue: $9.27 billion (Netflix's guidance: $9.24 billion) vs. $8.16 billion in Q1 2023Earnings per share (EPS): $4.52 (Netflix's guidance: $4.49) vs. $2.88 in Q1 2023Net subscriber additions: 4.8 million vs. 1.7 million in Q1 2023Thu, April 18, 2024 at 12:20 PM PDT Josh SchaferTrending tickers on Thursday afternoonTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) led the Yahoo Finance trending tickers page on Thursday afternoon as shares fell about 5%. The Taiwanese chip giant cautioned on its growth outlook this year outside of its memory chips business, sending the stock over 5% lower.Meanwhile, Tesla (TSLA) shares slipped more than 3% after the company was downgraded by Deutsche Bank to Hold from Buy amid fears the automaker's expected low-cost vehicle option will launch later than hoped.Thu, April 18, 2024 at 11:20 AM PDT Josh SchaferOne chart shows why higher for longer has been bad for small capsMany stock strategists began the year harping for a rebound in small-cap performance as consensus believed the Federal Reserve would begin reducing interest rates in the first half of 2024. Now, with the market scaling back its hopes for interest rate cuts this year, the small-cap Russell 2000 Index (^RUT) is down nearly 3% year to date, underperforming the S&P 500's more than 5% gain this year.""We think the Russell 2000 could be a bit challenged in the near term until we get to kind of greater confirmation of inflation slowing and greater confirmation that, OK, the Fed is going to be able to start cutting rates,"" Bank of America head of US small- and mid-cap strategy Jill Carey Hall told Yahoo Finance.After recent conversations with investors, Hall said the main catalyst for small caps to move higher is more clarity on the Federal Reserve's interest rate path.Market consensus has shifted to projecting two rate cuts this year from seven rate cuts in early January, per Bloomberg data. The move has put a significant damper on the rally in small caps to close 2023, while large-cap stocks have clung to gains this year despite the shifting Fed narrative.The key difference is the companies' debt structures. Small caps have more than 40% of their debt exposed to higher rates either in the form of floating-rate loans or short-term debt that may need to be refinanced amid the higher rate environment. This compares to the roughly 75% of S&P 500 companies, which have long-term fixed-rate debt, per Bank of America's research team.Add in that large-cap companies often have more cash that could benefit from higher rates and that the Fed not cutting rates is simply more costly for smaller companies than larger companies.""The [Russell 2000] index is very sensitive to credit and rates,"" Hall said. ""Refinancing risk is a key risk for these companies given that large caps were able to lock in a lot of long-dated fixed-rate debt ...the longer rates stay high, that becomes a bigger and bigger risk to earnings for these [smaller cap] companies.""Thu, April 18, 2024 at 10:24 AM PDT Josh SchaferStocks turn lower in afternoon tradeFor the fourth straight day, the S&P 500 traded in the green to start the day and then reversed lower.The moves came as several Fed officials noted they don't see any ""urgency"" to cut interest rates. US bond yields, a recent headwind for stocks, rose after the comments The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) was up 6 basis points, trading near 4.64%Thu, April 18, 2024 at 9:19 AM PDTInes FerréGas prices: Why one US region will see 'stiff increases' this weekGasoline prices have been on the rise nationally, with the West Coast seeing the largest increases over the past month. Now, drivers in New England states are likely to see an outsized spike at the pump.This week, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and other Northeastern states switched to a more expensive summer blend of gasoline, sending wholesale prices $0.30 to $0.32 per gallon higher, said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at OPIS.""These increases will make their way to the street in the remainder of the week,"" Kloza told Yahoo Finance. ""This region will see lots of stiff increases that take consumers by surprise.""On Thursday, the national average for gasoline sat at $3.67 per gallon, roughly a penny less than a year ago, according to AAA data.Meanwhile, oil prices slipped on Thursday, adding to three straight sessions of declines. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures traded below $83 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, hovered around $87 per barrel.Read more here.Thu, April 18, 2024 at 8:35 AM PDTInes FerréFed's Williams doesn't see any 'urgency' to cut ratesYahoo Finance's Jen Schonberger reports: New York Fed president John Williams said Thursday he doesn’t see any ""urgency"" to cut interest rates, becoming the latest central bank official to dial back the timing of any easing in monetary policy.Rates will need to come down at some point, he added, but that will be driven by the economy.""I think we've got interest rates in a place that is moving us gradually to our goals,"" Williams said during a Semafor conference in Washington, D.C.Investors have increasingly pushed back their rate cut expectations, pricing in the first cut in September with dwindling odds of a second rate cut this year.Read more here. Thu, April 18, 2024 at 8:10 AM PDTInes FerréS&P 500, Nasdaq rebound led by gains in Meta and Nvidia The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose roughly 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively, as they looked to recover from four straight days of declines.Shares of Meta (META) gained more than 3%, while Nvidia (NVDA) rose more than 1%, following the chipmaker's 4% slide in the prior session.The Nasdaq Composite seesawed earlier on Thursday but gained its footing during late morning trading.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.8%, led by gains in industrials and financials.Thu, April 18, 2024 at 7:14 AM PDTInes FerréTesla shares slide to 52-week lowTesla (TSLA) dropped more than 3% in early trading on Thursday as shares of the EV giant continued their downward trend. Tesla stock is down roughly 40% year to date, hitting its lowest intraday level since January 2023.The stock weighed on the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), which struggled to stay in green territory after sliding more than 1% in the prior session.Thu, April 18, 2024 at 6:32 AM PDTInes FerréS&P 500 tries to snap four-day losing streakStocks rose on Thursday morning, led by gains on all three major averages.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added 0.1% after tech stocks ended over 1% lower on Wednesday.In each of the prior sessions this week, the S&P 500 opened higher but was not able to sustain those gains throughout the day. The broader benchmark has closed lower for the past four sessions.All eyes will be on Netflix (NFLX) this afternoon when the streaming giant reports its quarterly results after the closing bell.Netflix shares are up more than 25% year to date.Thu, April 18, 2024 at 5:29 AM PDTBrian SozziThe debate over Tesla carries onOne of the fun things in a business newsroom: the banter on a battleground stock when it gets put through the wringer.That battleground stock today is none other than Tesla (TSLA), which has had an awful 2024 for numerous reasons. The stock is down 11% in the past five trading sessions despite the company's new round of cost-cutting. Shares are nearing a 40% year-to-date decline.The banter today from the Yahoo Finance newsroom premarket has been how slow most on the Street have been in reversing course on the stock. Some analysts have moved their ratings, but the holdouts are holding out.Director of Yahoo Finance Live Valentina Caval and reporter Madison Mills crunched the numbers on this one, and here's where things stand.While over 60% of analysts had a Buy rating on Tesla just last year, only 32% of analysts now have that same rating on the stock. About 44% have a Hold rating, while 23% sport a Sell.Thu, April 18, 2024 at 3:28 AM PDTBrian SozziAnd the US debt warnings continue — Bank of America's CEO weighs inThe IMF has been making waves this week at its spring meetings in D.C. with its warnings on the high levels of US debt ($34 trillion and counting).Amid those warnings, we have seen rates on the 2-year and 10-year Treasurys move higher and the air come out of momentum stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA).Bank of America chair and CEO Brian Moynihan is entering the conversation on US debt via a new interview with yours truly.“So you really have to let the debt run at the right levels. And it's fine now, but it's something we have to be concerned about,” Moynihan told me on Yahoo Finance. ""It's not something you raise the alarm on and say we have got to stop everything tomorrow. It's something you have to manage over the next decade because a little bit done every year adds up to a lot at the end of the decade.""You can watch our chat on other issues, such as the state of US consumers, below. And there's more analysis on the company's earnings this week here.View comments"

Blame Climate Change, Not Cloud SeedingSingapore Loses ‘World’s Best Airport’ Crown to QatarRed Lobster Considers Bankruptcy to Deal With Leases and Labor CostsTrump Media & Technology Group Corp. issued instructions on how “long-term shareholders who believe in the company’s future” can prevent brokerages from lending their shares to investors who bet against the stock by selling it short.The parent of Truth Social, in an online FAQ about short selling, put out a form letter investors can use to opt out of any securities lending programs.A spokesperson for Trump Media suggested the guidance was in response to investor inquiries, writing in an email, “TMTG believes it has a responsibility to provide factual information in response to the questions its shareholders are asking.”Short selling doesn’t necessarily cause share-price declines, but it can weigh on the price if there are enough contrarian traders betting against a stock.Skepticism about Trump Media’s business prospects is widespread, as the firm reported just $4 million in revenue last year and a loss of more than $50 million. That and a valuation north of $9 billion sparked a wave of bets against the stock.Some 16% of Trump Media’s public float is sold short, according to data from S3 Partners. Fees for new shorts sellers are between 135% and 215% of the stock’s price — one of the highest on Wall Street.Short sellers have long had a dark image in the popular mind, a view that painted Wall Street actors as out for profit at the expense of American companies and their employees. This portrayal played a prominent role in the meme-stock craze of 2021, particularly around GameStop Corp. There, followers of Reddit Inc.’s Wall Street Bets board powered a rally in the video-game retailer with the express intent of forcing losses onto prominent short sellers.Gabe Plotkin’s Melvin Capital Management was famously bludgeoned in the episode and the hedge fund later shut down.The Trump Media FAQ Wednesday appeared to lean into that negative imagining of short sellers, suggesting the practice was a tussle between the “retail investor” and “sophisticated and institutional investors.”Story continues“If the price of the stock in fact decreases, then the brokerage firm and the sophisticated and institutional investors will have made a profit, while the ultimate retail investor has not,” the filing said.Julian Klymochko of Accelerate Financial Technologies called the situation unusual and said Trump Media trading bore the hallmarks of less experienced daytraders.“The shares are held, and traded rapidly, by unsophisticated retail speculators who are looking for fast gambling action in the latest meme stock craze,” he said. “As opposed to fundamental analysts, DJT speculators are more akin to conspiracy theorists, blaming every share price decline on non-existent short sellers.”While it’s true that short sellers will profit if the target stock falls, the lender profits no matter what happens to the short bet, simply by collecting interest. Brokerages, such as Fidelity and Schwab, have programs where clients can opt in to earn income by loaning securities.Trump Media also suggested other ways retail investors could prevent having their shares borrowed, including moving shares into a cash account from a margin account, moving them to Odyssey Transfer and Trust Company — the company’s transfer agent — or moving shares to a bank and holding them in a retirement account.“It’s understandable why a heavily shorted company would like to defeat those who are betting against it,” said Steve Sosnick at Interactive Brokers. “But over time, the best way for a company to do that is to deliver on the bottom line.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWhat Really Happens When You Trade In an iPhone at the Apple StoreAging Copper Mines Are Turning Into Money Pits Despite DemandRents Are the Fed’s ‘Biggest Stumbling Block’ in Taming US InflationFor Multinationals, Africa’s Allure Is FadingThe AI Chatbot That Could Transform Business School Accreditation©2024 Bloomberg L.P.View comments"

Street Estimates: Which Offers The Best Opportunity?Ninety-six percent, or 480 out of the 500 companies comprising the S&P 500 index, are trading at lower market values compared to Wall Street analysts’ price targets, signaling abundant potential profit opportunities for investors.Thus far, April has marked the bleakest month for the U.S. stock market since September 2023, with the S&P 500 index, tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), falling by 3.7%.Across all 11 sectors constituting the index, only the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLE) has managed to evade losses. The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLRE) emerged as the month’s weakest performer, experiencing a 10% downturn.Higher-than-expected inflation figures have placed downward pressure on stocks, leading to reduced expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts. As of April 18, investors expect fewer than two rate cuts, down from over three anticipated at the beginning of the month.Simultaneously, mounting geopolitical risks stemming from the ongoing Middle East crisis have amplified market uncertainties.However, this phase of increased volatility has subdued the once prevalent bullish sentiment that persisted until the end of March, uncovering attractive opportunities for investors who favor buying the dips of undervalued stocks.Presented herein are the top 5 contrarian stocks within the S&P 500 index exhibiting the most pronounced relative gap between current market prices and median price targets.5. Carnival CorporationCarnival Corp. (NYSE:CCL) has experienced a noticeable downturn, dropping by 11.54% this month and 22.03% year-to-date.Analysts, however, have maintained consistency in their price forecasts. At the beginning of the year, the median target was $20.78, which has since held steady at $22.This suggests a substantial 52.20% potential upside from the current trading price of $14.46 per share.4. Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE:BIO) has witnessed an 18.81% decline in price this month and a 13.03% decrease year-to-date.Despite market fluctuations, the median price target has remained unchanged at $436.70 since the beginning of 2024.Presently trading at $280.81 per share, this implies that analysts see a potential upside of 55.51% if the stock price converges with the target.3. Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) has declined 5.27% this month and by a substantial 27.33% year-to-date.Analysts have downwardly adjusted their price targets for WBD shares, reducing the median level from $16.64 at the beginning of the year to $13 presently.Story continuesDespite these downward revisions, the current share price of $8.27 still provides some margin of safety to investors, indicating a potential 57.19% upside if it converges with analysts’ targets.2. Caesars Entertainment Inc.Caesars Entertainment Inc. (NYSE:CZR) has declined by 11.25% month-to-date and a more substantial 17.19% year-to-date.However, despite these negative trends, analysts have made minimal adjustments to their price targets for the casino-related company.With the current trading price at $38.32, the median price target of $62.50 suggests a significant profit potential of 61% if the current price aligns with analysts’ expectations.1.

Blame Climate Change, Not Cloud SeedingRed Lobster Considers Bankruptcy to Deal With Leases and Labor CostsTreasuries fell across the US curve — with two-year yields once again approaching the 5% mark. When asked about the possibility of hiking, Fed Bank of New York President John Williams said — it is “not” his baseline expectation — but added that it’s possible, if warranted. Equities dropped for a fifth straight session — the longest losing run since October.Read: TIPS Auction Stops Through at Decade’s Second-Highest Yield“Most of the data this week show the economy is still firing on all cylinders,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. “That’s going to be a challenge for the Fed’s rate-cutting plans.”Treasury 10-year yields rose five basis points to 4.64%. The S&P 500 fell to around 5,010, with its most influential group — technology — leading declines. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. scaled back its outlook for a chip market expansion. Netflix Inc. is due to report results after the close.In addition to remarks from Fed’s Williams, his Atlanta counterpart Raphael Bostic said he’s comfortable keeping interest rates steady, reiterating he doesn’t think it will be appropriate to lower borrowing costs until toward the end of the year.“Fedspeak is making us increasingly nervous,” said Andrew Brenner at NatAlliance Securities. “Two statements from Fed governors just add to the fray.”Brenner said that if the two-year US yield breaks 5%, the next level to watch would be 5.2%.Jobless claims remained subdued, consistent with a healthy job market. Separately, the Philadelphia Fed factory index topped estimates. While existing-home sales fell, the pace was roughly in line with the median forecast of economists.Market-implied expectations for Fed rate cuts — which have collapsed in the past two weeks — declined further this week after Chair Jerome Powell signaled policymakers will wait longer than previously anticipated to ease policy. An initial quarter-point reduction remains priced in for November.Read: Less Dovish Fed Comes Into Line With MarketThe Fed may not cut interest rates at all this year with inflation remaining high, said JPMorgan Chase & Co. President Daniel Pinto.Story continues“It may take a bit longer until they can cut rates,” Pinto said at a Semafor event in Washington, adding that the likelihood of a rate hike is “very, very low” amid widespread skepticism that inflation will ease any time soon. The Fed isn’t in any hurry, as a rate cut that comes too early would be “painful” and probably cause a recession, he said.The market’s biggest worry right now is inflation, which is re-accelerating and throwing cold water on the idea of any rate cuts in 2024, let alone one or two, according to Michael Landsberg, chief investment officer at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management.“We are firmly in the camp of no rate cuts in 2024,” he said. “We believe investors should prepare for a higher for longer regime when it comes to both inflation and interest rates and that investment portfolios should be positioned for these dynamics for the foreseeable future.”“With rate cuts delayed, rather than canceled, in our view, we still expect the yield on the 10-year US Treasury to end the year around 3.85%, said Mark Haefele at UBS Global Wealth Management. “Once the Fed begins cutting rates this year, the bond market will likely continue to price a sequence of further cuts into 2025 and beyond.”While timing the market is hard, investors can more confidently add duration exposure, according to Bank of America Corp. strategists led by Mark Cabana, who recommend “going long” five-year Treasuries.The trade is supported by “Fed unlikely to hike, risk asset sensitivity to rates and cleaner duration positioning,” they noted.Corporate Highlights:Infosys Ltd. forecast tepid sales growth for the year, a sign that overseas clients are limiting tech spending until the global economy picks up speed.D.R.

Blame Climate Change, Not Cloud SeedingRed Lobster Considers Bankruptcy to Deal With Leases and Labor CostsAmerican economic strength was a major factor in the IMF upgrading its global economic growth outlook slightly for 2024, Georgieva said Thursday in an interview with Bloomberg Television.She said earlier that it’s now time for the US and others to focus on budget tightening in order to rebuild fiscal buffers in a world where crises just keep on coming.The IMF and World Bank are this week hosting spring meetings of finance and central bank chiefs from around the world. Among the other key subjects are discussions about advancing debt relief for distressed nations and — among Western powers — talks on the scope to step up efforts to aid Ukraine and punish Russia for its invasion of that country.(All times Washington, DC, GMT -4)Georgieva Still Optimistic Fed to Be Able to Cut Rates in 2024 (9:20 a.m.)“The Fed is doing the right thing” by standing pat with its monetary stance for now, Georgieva said in an interview Thursday with Bloomberg Television. “The Fed is not yet prepared, and rightly so, to cut.”A key question at the meetings in Washington has been “how long will the Fed be stuck with higher interest rates,” she said. “That’s what I hear from countries.”“All eyes are on the US,” she said. With regard to the strength in the dollar, she said that “of course it is concerning.” So far, “the business environment in the United States has not reacted very firmly to the interest rates being high — but we see a little softening underneath.”Georgieva said that “we still remain optimistic that, within this year, conditions in the United States would allow the Fed to start cutting.” -Jonathan Ferro and Christopher CondonECB’s Knot Plays Down Oil Price Risk to European Inflation (9:02 a.m.A jump in energy prices would pose a less acute danger to inflation in Europe than the gyrations in commodities markets seen in recent years, according to European Central Bank Governing Council member Klaas Knot.Describing current risks to consumer prices as “becoming more balanced,” the Dutch official told Bloomberg Television’s Lisa Abramowicz and Annmarie Hordern that inflation is subsiding toward 2% across the 20-nation euro area.Story continues“Now, if we have an oil shock, it will be against a backdrop of general disinflation in all other factors,” he said Thursday in Washington. “The likelihood of significant second-round effects, I would argue, is smaller but it is clearly something to monitor.” -Mark Schroers and Alexander WeberIMF’S Georgieva Urges Fiscal Tightening to Prep for Next Shock (8:41 a.m.)Georgieva called on major economies to tighten their fiscal policies after a mass ramp-up of debt in recent years to cope with the pandemic crisis.“Countries must urgently build fiscal resilience for the next shock” in a world where crises keep on coming, Georgieva said in a press conference Thursday in Washington. It’s important to be “rebuilding fiscal buffers.”Central banks fighting inflation also “can use some help from the fiscal side,” she said. -Eric Martin and Philip AldrickMost Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekAging Copper Mines Are Turning Into Money Pits Despite DemandWhat Really Happens When You Trade In an iPhone at the Apple StoreFor Multinationals, Africa’s Allure Is FadingRents Are the Fed’s ‘Biggest Stumbling Block’ in Taming US InflationThe AI Chatbot That Could Transform Business School Accreditation©2024 Bloomberg L.P.View comments"

Few had foreseen yields approaching levels that could destabilize the market.Yet, Vanguard's head of international rates Ales Koutny offered a stark warning: “We are in a danger zone right now.” Koutny believed that surpassing the 4.75% yield threshold could trigger a severe sell-off, potentially driving rates to or beyond 5%.As recently reported by Bloomberg, investors flocked to Treasuries late last year, anticipating a quick easing of Federal Reserve policies. However, resilient economic data from the U.S. has dampened these expectations, turning the tide against market optimists.Koutny revealed, “We still think that there's a residual long position left over.” The lack of orderly adjustment in these positions could precipitate a chaotic market selloff, risking a yield spike to critical levels.Despite the prevailing negative market sentiment, the current high yields have attracted some opportunistic buying.The latest data from JPMorgan Chase & Co. indicates a significant shift in investor positioning towards Treasuries, marking the first net long stance since March. The robust demand was further evidenced by a successful 20-year Treasury auction, closing at yields slightly lower than anticipated, suggesting underlying market confidence in Treasury securities despite broader concerns.Read Now: Fund Managers Are The Most Optimistic Since 2022: ‘Bull Sentiment Not Quite At Close-Your-Eyes-And-Sell Levels’Photo: ShutterstockStory continues""ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON"" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 ""news & everything else"" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!Get the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?This article Treasury Yields Head To 'Danger Zone': Analyst Forecasts Potential Spike To 5%, Disorderly Sell-Off For Markets originally appeared on Benzinga.com© 2024 Benzinga.com.

Motley Fool,Why Meta Platforms Stock Was Moving Higher Today,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-meta-platforms-stock-moving-181755987.html,News about TikTok and an AI update helped lift the social media stock.,"Shares of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) were gaining today. The social media giant seemed to benefit from expected legislation against TikTok and launched the newest version of its Llama large language model (LLM), updating its Meta AI assistant as well.As of 1:24 p.m. ET, the stock was up 2% on the news after climbing as much as 3.7% earlier in the session.Image source: Getty Images.Meta gains an advantageFor several months now, social media stocks like Meta have moved on news about a possible ban or forced divestiture of TikTok, the popular China-based social media app, but that legislation now looks like more of a reality than ever before.House Speaker Mike Johnson is reportedly planning to include legislation in a bill to give aid to Ukraine and Israel that would ban TikTok or force owner ByteDance to sell its U.S. ownership.Separately, Meta also introduced several new artificial intelligence (AI) products, showing it will remain a contender in generative AI. The company released Llama 3, its latest LLM, and an image generator that updates images in real time. Those tools will be included in Meta AI, its free AI assistant available in Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger.Can Meta keep gaining?The TikTok development is complicated and the issue could spend years in the courts even if a ban is passed, but Meta could certainly see some benefit from legislation as TikTok is arguably its closest competitor now. Meta has invested heavily in Reels, its TikTok competitor, to increase engagement on platforms like Facebook and Instagram.Additionally, any improvement to its AI capabilities is likely to elicit cheers from investors. Though Meta doesn't have a direct way to monetize its generative AI efforts, if they encourage users to spend more time on the platform, then that should increase ad revenue and improve its competitive position. Expect Meta to continue to invest in AI as the new technology is only just starting.Should you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

TechCrunch,"Ibotta’s IPO opens sharply higher, hinting at warming public-market interest in tech shares",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ibotta-ipo-opens-sharply-higher-181627718.html,"Ibotta began it’s path as a public company on Thursday by opening at $117 per share, a big increase from its IPO price of $88, itself an increase from its proposed range of $76 to $84 per share.  The company left money on the table “for investors who are very bullish on it [expanding] its third-party platform beyond just Walmart,” which has become a key partner for Ibotta and represents much of its current revenue, said Nicholas Smith, a senior research analyst at pre-IPO research company Renaissance Capital.

Given that its started trading far above its IPO price today, some critics may argue that it left too much money on the table, and could have raised more for itself.Its successful debut marks the third major tech IPO in the United States this year, and is the third in a row to price well and immediately trade higher. It is also the first half of a pair of technology offerings that will list this month, with data management and security company Rubrik expected to list its own shares next week. The two companies follow Reddit and Astera Labs out of the private markets, after both the social media company and datacenter connectivity hardware play continue to trade above their IPO prices.Investor eagerness for Ibotta indicates that “there is an increasing appetite for IPOs again” Smith said, “particularly in the tech space.”Don’t pop the champagne yet for the tech IPO market coming roaring back, however. Ibotta pivoted to business sales over a direct-to-consumer model, which helped it reach profitability in recent periods. Classic tech IPOs tend to feature tech companies still in growth mode and deeply in the red.Rubrik could be a better test of IPO appetite. Its products are in the data management and security worlds, and the company is deeply unprofitable and growing more slowly than Ibotta. That said, it does have a strong cloud revenue story to tell. If its debut goes well, we could see more yet-unprofitable unicorns try a shot at the public markets. Smith agrees, calling the upcoming Rubrik IPO “an even bigger test” for tech debuts “given its weaker current financial picture.”We’ll find out next week.View comments"
