The fund's performance saw a 3.44% increase for the month and a 9.56% year-to-date growth, with total net assets at $2,014.4 million. Sector breakdown reveals a focus on Financials and Information Technology, while new holdings include Humana, Inc. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The Liberty All-Star Equity Fund's March update provides a snapshot into the fund's strategy and performance, which can serve as a barometer for broader market behavior. The fund's large-cap core style, combining value and growth managers, reflects a balanced approach that many diversified portfolios aim for. The increase in NAV and market price, alongside a decreased discount rate, suggests positive investor sentiment and potential undervaluation at the beginning of the month.From a sector perspective, the significant holdings in Information Technology and Financials align with broader market trends favoring these sectors. However, the modest representation in Energy and Real Estate could be a strategic choice born of current market conditions or a potential area of growth if these sectors were to rebound. It's essential to monitor sector allocations as they can significantly impact fund performance relative to market indices. Financial Analyst Analyzing the Liberty All-Star Equity Fund's performance figures, a discerning eye would notice the healthy month-over-month and year-to-date returns, which appear robust compared to industry averages. The reduction in the discount to NAV from the beginning to the end of the month indicates that the fund's market price is converging closer to its NAV, which typically signals increasing investor confidence in the fund's management or the anticipation of strong future performance.It's also noteworthy to examine the fund's distribution components. The mention of potential return of capital could imply that some part of the distributions may not be from earned income, such as dividends or capital gains, but from the paid-in capital. Investors should be cautious, as consistent returns of capital could erode the fund's asset base over time, affecting long-term performance. 04/12/2024 - 07:53 PM BOSTON, April 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Below is the March 2024 Monthly Update for the Liberty All-Star Equity Fund.

However, the Fund also has a market price; the value at which it trades on an exchange. If the market price is above the NAV the Fund is trading at a premium. If the market price is below the NAV the Fund is trading at a discount. Performance returns for the Fund are total returns, which includes dividends, and are net of management fees and other Fund expenses. Returns are calculated assuming that a shareholder reinvested all distributions. Past performance cannot predict future investment results. Performance will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data shown. Performance information shown does not reflect the deduction of taxes that shareholders would pay on Fund distributions or the sale of Fund shares. Shareholders must be willing to tolerate significant fluctuations in the value of their investment. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including loss of principal. Sources of distributions to shareholders may include ordinary dividends, long-term capital gains and return of capital. The final determination of the source of all distributions in 2024 for tax reporting purposes will be made after year end. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Based on current estimates a portion of the distributions consist of a return of capital. These estimates may not match the final tax characterization (for the full year's distributions) contained in shareholder 1099-DIV forms after the end of the year.

The jury found one patent claim invalid but ruled in favor of Continuous Composites on another claim. Markforged plans to challenge the verdict through post-trial motions and appeals.","Markforged Announces Jury Verdict in Patent Case Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Markforged Holding (NYSE: MKFG) announced a jury verdict in a patent case against Continuous Composites Inc., resulting in a $17.34 million verdict against Markforged, Inc. The jury found one patent claim invalid but ruled in favor of Continuous Composites on another claim. Markforged plans to challenge the verdict through post-trial motions and appeals. Positive None. Negative None. Legal Expert The recent jury verdict in the ongoing patent lawsuit between Markforged and Continuous Composites holds substantial implications for Markforged's financial and operational future. The award of $17.34 million in damages is a significant sum, which may spur a negative reaction in the stock market, reflecting concerns over potential hits to the company's earnings and cash flow. Given the company's indication of a strong balance sheet, they may be capable of absorbing the immediate financial impact without jeopardizing short-term operations.However, the prospect of post-trial motions for royalties on future revenue is particularly concerning for long-term forecasting. Such additional costs could disrupt the company's pricing strategy, competitiveness and profitability. Furthermore, if Markforged’s appeal process extends over a long period, legal expenses could mount, alongside the potential for accruing interest on unpaid damages, affecting future financial results.The company's intent to seek to overturn the verdict suggests a protracted legal battle that could generate uncertainty among investors and customers. Additionally, the invalidation and non-infringement finding on one of the patent claims provides some legal leverage, albeit limited, which the company can capitalize on during their planned appeal. Financial Analyst An immediate financial assessment after such a jury verdict would scrutinize the solidity of Markforged's balance sheet. The claimed effective cost controls and innovation in product lines could be pivotal in mitigating the verdict's impact. Investors will look for reassurances that the company can sustain its R&D investments and market competitiveness in the wake of this financial setback.The impact on stock prices may reflect investor sentiment on the company's ability to handle the litigation outcome and potential future royalties. Key financial ratios, including the current ratio and debt-to-equity, as well as cash reserves, will be scrutinized to assess the company's short-term liquidity and long-term solvency.Lastly, this litigation result may prompt investors to weigh the intangible impacts, such as reputational harm and its effect on customer trust and market share. The company's response strategy and communication effectiveness in the following days will be critical to counteract potential negative market reactions. Market Research Analyst This legal development could serve as an indicator of the broader risks associated with intellectual property (IP) in technology and manufacturing sectors. Market observers may take this opportunity to re-evaluate the IP risk profiles for other companies in the sector, potentially adjusting their market projections and investment recommendations. Moreover, Markforged's experience may catalyze a shift in how companies approach patent strategy, potentially increasing investment in patent portfolio development and defensive tactics. The verdict may also influence partnership dynamics within the industry, with companies becoming more cautious in their collaborations to avoid similar legal entanglements. The perceived strength of Markforged's new product line also suggests resilience and potential for recovery. Should the innovation surpass existing market offerings, the company may offset the negative impact of this verdict through increased market share and customer loyalty. The long-term effect will heavily depend on the company's ability to continue innovating and outpacing competitive pressures while managing the legal challenges. 04/12/2024 - 07:44 PM WALTHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Markforged Holding Corporation (NYSE: MKFG) (the “Company”), the company strengthening manufacturing resiliency by enabling industrial production at the point of need, today announced that on April 11, 2024, the jury in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware reached a verdict in the Company’s ongoing patent lawsuit with Continuous Composites Inc. (“Continuous Composites”). The jury returned a verdict against Markforged, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, in the amount of $17.34 million. As previously disclosed, in July 2021, Continuous Composites, a company based out of Idaho, filed a patent-infringement lawsuit against the Company. The jury found one of the two patent claims Continuous Composites asserted at trial against the Company to be invalid and not infringed. However, the jury found that the Company had infringed the other patent claim and awarded monetary damages. While the Company cannot predict what additional action Continuous Composites may take, it is possible that they may seek additional relief through post-trial motions for royalty payments on future revenue, which could materially impact the Company’s business and operations.

The proceeds will be used to repay borrowings under its revolving credit facility. The offering is expected to close on April 17, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The pricing of Delek Logistics Partners' offering of an additional $200 million of 8.625% senior notes due 2029 provides a noteworthy moment for stakeholders. The choice of pricing at 101.250% of face value indicates confidence that investors will accept a slight premium over par value, suggesting underlying strength in the issuer's creditworthiness.Moreover, the use of proceeds to repay outstanding borrowings under a revolving credit facility is a strategic move to optimize the capital structure. It indicates a focus on managing interest expenses and reducing reliance on variable-rate debt, which could be beneficial amid fluctuating interest rate environments. Investors should monitor how this decision affects Delek's leverage ratios and interest coverage metrics, as these are fundamental indicators of financial health in the energy logistics sector. Debt Market Analyst Issuing additional notes under the same indenture as the existing notes suggests a streamlined strategy for Delek Logistics to tap into its current investor base who are already familiar with the terms of the existing notes. This can reduce the complexity and potentially lower the cost of issuing new debt. However, the high interest rate of 8.625% reflects a relatively expensive cost of capital, which investors should weigh against the company's operational cash flow and long-term growth prospects within the energy sector.It's important to consider the market's current appetite for high-yield debt, as this issuance may indicate broader trends in investor sentiment and risk tolerance. The exemption from registration targets sophisticated institutional investors and highlights the regulatory landscape impacting the accessibility and liquidity of the notes for the average investor. 04/12/2024 - 06:09 PM BRENTWOOD, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Delek Logistics Partners, LP (NYSE: DKL) (“Delek Logistics”) announced today that it, along with Delek Logistics Finance Corp., a subsidiary of Delek Logistics (together with Delek Logistics, the “Issuers”), priced an offering of $200 million in aggregate principal amount of additional 8.625% senior notes due 2029 (the “Additional Notes”) at an offering price equal to 101.250% of their face value, plus accrued interest from March 13, 2024.

Financial Analyst Rackspace Technology's recent announcement regarding the final results of their exchange offer reflects a strategic move that aims to optimize the company's capital structure. This transaction illustrates how companies manage their debt profile by offering a mix of securities and cash to handle existing obligations. The participation rate of 75.9% suggests a positive reception from the holders of the Existing Secured Notes, which may lead to a reduction in the company's interest expenses and potential extension of debt maturities. It's important for investors to assess how these changes could influence Rackspace's financial flexibility and creditworthiness going forward.The exchange of Existing Secured Notes for new securities or cash could be seen as an effort to streamline the company's debt under a common subsidiary, which might simplify corporate financial management. However, the exchange does not change the interest rate, which remains at 3.50%. This could indicate that the company is not seeking to reduce its cost of capital but rather to improve other terms and conditions of its debt. Investors should evaluate the implications on Rackspace's balance sheet, its ability to generate free cash flow and whether this could affect the company's investment in growth initiatives. Market Research Analyst The exchange offer by Rackspace Technology highlights the company's proactive approach to managing its liabilities in a way that aligns with market expectations and investor sentiment. Rackspace operates in the competitive tech industry, where companies need to maintain healthy balance sheets to navigate rapidly changing market conditions. The high uptake of the offer by existing note holders points to a level of confidence in Rackspace's management and future prospects.An important aspect for investors to consider is how these financial maneuvers can signal the company's operational health and strategic priorities. By effectively managing its debt through such offers, Rackspace might be trying to convey a message of financial prudence to the market. It's also noteworthy that these moves occur within the context of interest rates and industry-specific financial trends. Investors would benefit from examining how Rackspace's decision compares with its peers' financial strategies and the overall sector's performance. 04/12/2024 - 07:09 PM SAN ANTONIO, April 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rackspace Technology® (NASDAQ: RXT) (“Rackspace” or the “Company”), a leading end-to-end hybrid, multicloud, and AI technology solutions company, today announced the final results of the previously announced offer by its indirect subsidiary Rackspace Finance, LLC (the “New Issuer”), to eligible holders in respect of any and all of the 3.50% First-Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the “Existing Secured Notes”) issued by its indirect subsidiary Rackspace Technology Global, Inc., to (i) (A) exchange certain of those Existing Secured Notes for new 3.50% FLSO Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the “Exchange Notes”) issued by the New Issuer and (B) have purchased for cancellation certain of those Existing Secured Notes by the New Issuer for cash (collectively, the “Exchange Offer”), and (ii) fund (the “Funding Offer” and, together with the Exchange Offer, the “Offers”) new senior secured first lien first out term loans of the New Issuer, in each case, subject to the terms and conditions of the offering memorandum dated March 14, 2024 (as amended by the Company’s press release dated March 29, 2024, the “Offering Memorandum”).

Millicom currently holds 766,703 treasury shares as of April 12, 2024. The total number of shares outstanding in Millicom is 172,096,305. Negative None. Financial Analyst Share repurchase programs are often implemented by companies aiming to return value to shareholders, signaling that the management believes the shares are undervalued. Millicom's recent activity indicates a strategic decision to invest in its own equity, possibly reflecting confidence in the company's intrinsic value and future performance. Analyzing the transaction details, such as the average price paid and the number of shares repurchased, investors can gauge the company's market sentiment. Moreover, the repurchase activity affects the outstanding shares, potentially leading to earnings per share (EPS) accretion. From a financial perspective, the impact on the company’s cash reserves and balance sheet is a key point of interest. Executed under the Safe Harbour Regulation, the buybacks also underscore compliance with market abuse regulations, implying a level of diligence in the transaction execution. Market Research Analyst The market's response to share buybacks can be diverse, with potential short-term price increases as supply of shares is reduced, indicating a bullish sentiment from the company's management. It's important to consider the volume of shares repurchased relative to the total number of shares outstanding to understand the magnitude of such buybacks. In the case of Millicom, the number of treasury shares held post-transaction represents a small fraction of the total shares, suggesting a relatively modest impact on the market. However, it is pertinent to assess how this activity aligns with the company’s historical buyback patterns and its overall capital allocation strategy. This information can provide deeper insight into Millicom's long-term financial health and strategic priorities. 04/12/2024 - 05:30 PM Millicom (Tigo) share repurchase activity Luxembourg, April 12, 2024 – Pursuant to the share repurchase program announced on December 15, 2023, Millicom repurchased 32,853 of its Swedish Depository Receipts (SDRs) between April 8, 2024 and April 12, 2024, as detailed in the table below.

Brandywine Realty Trust Announces Closing of $400 Million Offering of 8.875% Guaranteed Notes Due 2029,2024-04-12T17:44:00.000Z,Low,Negative,Brandywine Realty Trust (BDN) closes $400 million public offering of 8.875% guaranteed notes due 2029 to repurchase existing debt and for general corporate purposes.,"Brandywine Realty Trust Announces Closing of $400 Million Offering of 8.875% Guaranteed Notes Due 2029 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Brandywine Realty Trust (BDN) closes $400 million public offering of 8.875% guaranteed notes due 2029 to repurchase existing debt and for general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Brandywine Realty Trust regarding the closing of its $400 million public offering of 8.875% guaranteed notes due 2029 warrants a detailed financial analysis. It's clear that the company is maneuvering to manage its debt portfolio, aiming to mitigate the imminent repayment obligations of its 4.10% notes maturing in October 2024 with an aggregate principal amount of $335.1 million. This shift from lower to higher interest rates, despite increasing the interest burden, suggests a strategic move to elongate the debt maturity profile and avoid short-term liquidity pressure. From an investor's perspective, the increase in interest rates from 4.10% to 8.875% signals potentially higher financing costs, which could impact the company's net interest margin and overall profitability. However, it's vital to acknowledge that real estate investment trusts (REITs) like Brandywine often carry more significant debt levels due to their capital-intensive nature. Thus, this transaction could be viewed favorably if it strengthens the balance sheet and aligns with sustainable growth objectives. Nevertheless, stakeholders should monitor subsequent earnings calls and financial statements to assess the impact of these higher interest obligations on the company's cash flows and dividend payouts. Market Research Analyst The real estate market, where Brandywine Realty Trust operates, can be sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, especially those concerning long-term debt instruments. With the company securing a fixed rate of 8.875% for the notes maturing in 2029, one can interpret this as a defensive move against a backdrop of a volatile interest rate environment. Moreover, the use of a shelf registration statement indicates a pre-planned financing strategy that allows for timely capital raising. This demonstrates Brandywine's proactive approach to capital management, which could be reassuring to investors. The choice to direct the proceeds towards retiring existing debt before maturity suggests a deliberate liability management strategy. It's a step that can lead to a more favorable debt profile with extended maturities, possibly making the company more resilient against future economic downturns. Moving forward, investors should keep an eye on the company's leverage metrics and coverage ratios, as these will be important indicators of its ability to service the newly undertaken debt while maintaining operational efficiency and asset development. Legal Expert The legal implications of Brandywine Realty Trust's recent notes offering need to be dissected to evaluate the transaction's compliance and strategic foresight. The offering's adherence to the Securities and Exchange Commission's regulations, via an effective shelf registration statement and prospectus filings, shows due diligence on the company's part in following securities law procedures. This compliance provides a layer of assurance to investors regarding the legality of the offering. It is also prudent to mention the company's clear communication that the press release is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy securities, as well as the restriction of sales in jurisdictions where it would be unlawful. This caution indicates a risk-aware legal strategy, potentially minimizing litigation risks associated with securities transactions. While these considerations may not directly influence stock performance, they are indicative of a company that prioritizes legal prudence – a quality that discerning investors might find attractive. 04/12/2024 - 01:44 PM PHILADELPHIA, April 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Brandywine Realty Trust (the “Company”) (NYSE: BDN) announced today that its operating partnership, Brandywine Operating Partnership, L.P.

The company bought a total of 975,000 shares across different trading venues at varying prices. Citigroup Global Markets will oversee the trading decisions independently until April 26, 2024, in line with regulatory requirements. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Share buyback programs, such as the one recently executed by Shell plc, have a direct impact on the company's capital structure and consequently, on its stock performance. By reducing the number of shares available in the market, the company is likely to see an earnings per share (EPS) increase due to the fewer number of shares amongst which profits are distributed. This can result in a positive signal to investors, as it may indicate the company's confidence in its financial health and future performance.Investors should observe the volume of shares repurchased and at what price range these transactions occurred. The purchase of 499,000 shares on the LSE at a volume weighted average price of £29.2001 and 476,000 shares on XAMS at €34.3812, may imply management's perspective that the stock is undervalued. It's also worth noting the currency exchange component as purchases were made in both GBP and EUR, which could have additional financial implications based on currency fluctuations. Financial Analyst From a financial standpoint, Shell's share repurchase executed through both on-market and off-market channels signifies a substantial cash outflow that could have alternatively been invested in the business or distributed as dividends. While this approach can create shareholder value in the short-term, the long-term impact largely depends on the price paid for these shares compared to the intrinsic value of the company.It is important to consider the company's net debt position and the overall strategy to ensure that the buyback program aligns with long-term growth prospects and does not merely serve as a short-term stock price booster at the expense of future capital needs. The selected broker, Citigroup Global Markets Limited, operating independently from the company, provides an additional layer of scrutiny to the process, which can reassure stakeholders of the buyback's objectivity and compliance with market regulations. Legal Expert The adherence to regulations such as the EU Market Abuse Regulation and the Financial Services Act is critical for maintaining investor confidence and ensuring the integrity of the financial markets. Shell's compliance with these regulations, as detailed in the announcement, is intended to prevent market manipulation and abuses. Observing the rigorous framework that encompasses the share buyback program, including the UK MAR and the EU MAR Delegated Regulation, is fundamental for stakeholders to understand the procedural legitimacy of the transaction.Investors and regulators scrutinize the execution of such programs under the current regulatory environment, where transparency and fair market practices are of utmost importance. This is even more pertinent considering the Brexit context, which has led to the 'onshoring' of certain EU regulations to UK law, necessitating a keen understanding of any shifts in the regulatory landscape that might affect the execution of such financial activities. 04/12/2024 - 01:33 PM Transaction in Own Shares 12 April, 2024 • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • Shell plc (the ‘Company’) announces that on 12 April 2024 it purchased the following number of Shares for cancellation.

Negative None. 04/12/2024 - 01:30 PM NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / April 12, 2024 / Trane Technologies, a global climate innovator, reinforced the essential need to decarbonize and transform the commercial transport industry and cold chain and called for quick action and greater collaboration at the GCCA European Cold Chain Conference in Brussels to ensure widespread adoption of technologies that reduce carbon emissions and improve efficiency.""We believe that our industry can make a significant impact on global greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in the areas of heating and cooling and food loss,"" said Claudio Zanframundo, president, Thermo King EMEA, Trane Technologies. ""Decarbonization and transformation of the commercial transport industry and cold chain is possible, and it requires all of us to act together, to adopt the new technologies, including electrification and energy recovery solutions, to radically reduce emissions for a better planet for future generations.""Trane Technologies' Thermo King® brand is the leading provider of connected active temperature-controlled transport solutions in the cold chain industry. With a focus on precision cooling and digital advancements, Thermo King® is driving the shift toward electric refrigeration and energy recovery solutions in commercial transport. In November 2023, the company announced it fulfilled its August 2021 commitment to deliver fully electric, zero direct emission refrigeration solutions for every segment of the cold chain in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region by 2023.Examples of these solutions include the E-Series, an innovative and future-proof electric refrigeration unit designed for sustainable operations in urban and inner-city areas. The E-Series is connected and powered directly by the vehicle's battery, delivering optimal temperature-control performance with reduced energy consumption.Another example is AxlePower, a revolutionary fully electric trailer refrigeration and energy recovery solution that eliminates the need for fuel consumption and increases uptime. The AxlePower energy recovery solution operates by harnessing the kinetic energy from the vehicle's movement, such as braking and coasting, and stores it in a high-voltage battery. It can be used with both fully electric and hybrid vehicles and has been extensively tested and adopted by customers worldwide, with successful implementations from Belgium to South Africa.Thermo King® recognizes the need to keep investing in innovation for the cold chain because of the potential to reduce emissions, but also because it plays a critical role in feeding society. Roughly 30% of the food produced worldwide is lost every year, before reaching consumers, largely due to uncontrolled environments and disruptions in the cold chain. Partnering with retailers, non-profits and the European Commission to reduce food waste, we recently co-developed a roundtable at the European Parliament to help accelerate progress and get more people taking action. The session was aligned to the EU's commitment of meeting SDG 12.3 of halving per capita global food loss and waste by 2030.Through bold, industry-leading action, Trane Technologies is advancing its 2030 Sustainability Commitments, including the Gigaton Challenge - a pledge to reduce customer greenhouse gas emissions by 1 billion metric tons (or, one gigaton) - and its pledge to be net-zero by 2050. In 2014, the company set its first science-based 2020 Climate Commitments - accelerating innovation to achieve them two years ahead of schedule. The company is first in its industry with near and long-term emissions reduction targets externally validated by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi).###About Trane Technologies Trane Technologies is a global climate innovator.

The redemption price for each series will be 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest, with payment through The Depository Trust Company. Bank of America is a leading global financial institution with a wide range of banking, investing, and asset management services, serving millions of clients worldwide. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The redemption of both Floating Rate Senior Notes and Fixed/Floating Rate Senior Notes by Bank of America ahead of the maturity date indicates a strategic financial decision, possibly reflecting an adjustment in the bank's capital structure or debt management practices. One primary consideration for the early redemption could be the current interest rate environment which might allow the bank to refinance the debt at a lower rate, thus reducing interest expense and potentially improving net interest margin (NIM).Furthermore, the redemption at 100% of the principal amount, along with accrued interest, suggests that the bank's liquidity position is solid, enabling it to cover this significant payout without strain. This move may be viewed favorably by investors as it can signal both financial strength and a proactive approach to liability management. However, stakeholders should consider the impact on the bank's leverage ratios and whether the capital used for redemption could have been otherwise deployed for growth opportunities or return on equity enhancements. Debt Market Analyst Bank of America's decision to redeem these notes can impact the secondary market for similar debt instruments. Given that the redemption is at par value, investors holding these notes will not benefit from a premium, but they will be made whole on their principal investment. This may lead to a neutral or slightly positive reaction in the market, as it removes uncertainty regarding the redemption of these instruments.However, there could be a downside for investors seeking similar credit and risk profiles, as the redemption removes a set of fixed income products from the market. Consequently, investors may have to look for alternative options, which could affect the demand dynamics for Bank of America's future debt issuances or comparable financial instruments from other issuers. 04/12/2024 - 04:15 PM CHARLOTTE, N.C., April 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Bank of America Corporation announced today that it will redeem on April 22, 2024 all $600,000,000 principal amount outstanding of its Floating Rate Senior Notes, due April 2025 (CUSIP No. 06051GJU4) (the ""Floating Rate Notes""), and all $2,250,000,000 principal amount outstanding of its 0.976% Fixed/Floating Rate Senior Notes, due April 2025 (CUSIP No. 06051GJR1) (the ""Fixed/Floating Rate Notes"" and, together with the Floating Rate Notes, the ""Notes"").

Market Research Analyst The initial public offering (IPO) of Mobile-health Network Solutions, which operates in the burgeoning telehealth industry, represents a significant milestone for the company. The successful closing of its IPO adds substantial capital to the company's balance sheet, which can be allocated towards expanding its product offerings, technological infrastructure and market reach.Considering the global telehealth market is expected to grow substantially in the coming years, the entrance of MNDR on the NASDAQ provides investors with a fresh opportunity to capitalize on this trend. However, the IPO pricing and the company's subsequent performance will be critical in determining the long-term shareholder value. Furthermore, MNDR's ability to leverage the IPO proceeds to scale operations and navigate regulatory environments will be key to its success.Investors and analysts should monitor the deployment of the raised funds and any strategic moves MNDR makes post-IPO. The company's first few quarters as a public entity will provide valuable insights into its operational efficiency and market position against competitors. Financial Analyst With Mobile-health Network Solutions pricing their Class A Ordinary Shares at $4.00, gathering $9.0 million in gross proceeds suggests a modest but strategic entry into the market. Considering the offering size and price, the company’s implied valuation needs to be scrutinized against its financial health, projected earnings and growth potential within the telehealth sector.Investors should examine the use of proceeds statement in the final prospectus for details on how MNDR plans to address capital allocation. The underwriting discounts and offering expenses will also be pertinent as they impact the net proceeds available to the company.The choice of Network 1 Financial Securities as the sole book-running manager and the involvement of multiple legal firms in different jurisdictions may also signal MNDR's commitment to compliance and international expansion. However, the performance of the stock in the secondary market post-IPO would be influenced by investor confidence in the company's growth trajectory and how effectively it can capitalize on industry trends. 04/12/2024 - 07:28 PM SINGAPORE, April 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mobile-health Network Solutions (“MNDR” or “the Company”), a leading telehealth solutions provider in Singapore, today announced the closing of its previously announced initial public offering of an aggregate 2,250,000 Class A Ordinary Shares (“the Offering”) at a price of $4.00 per share (“the Offering Price”) to the public, for a total of US$9.0 million of gross proceeds to the Company, before deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses.

Operating expenditures Operating expenditures were $6.4 million in Q2 2024, compared to $6.3 million the previous quarter, a 1.5% increase after excluding a one-time non-cash charge of $0.3M during Q2 2024 relating to the recognition of deferred financing costs from the ATM program. Included in operating expenditures in Q2 2024 were $0.5 million in non-recurring consulting fees related to our cost containment measures. Operating expenses decreased 27.0% during Q2 2024 compared to $9.2 million during Q2 2023. In the quarter, the Company continued its cost containment initiatives to refocus support on revenue-producing activities and profitability. Operational Highlights Numinus Wellness Clinic Network Wellness clinics generated revenue of $4.3 million during Q2 2024, a 9.5% decrease compared to $4.7 million during Q2 2023. The decline in clinic network revenues during Q2 2024 is due to the winding down of operations at the Company's Phoenix, Arizona, location and the contraction of the number of appointments scheduled during the same comparative periods from cost containment procedures while focusing on appointment profitability across wellness clinics. 17,661 clinical appointments in Q2 2024, compared to 19,961 in Q1 2024Average of 299.3 appointments per operating day in Q2 2024, compared to 316.8 in Q1 20245.8% of appointments during Q2 2024 were made by new clients18.3% of appointments during Q2 2024 were KAT or Ketamine/Spravato medicine-related6.4% of appointments during Q2 2024 were for TMS servicesNuminus Clinical Research Revenues from CCR during Q2 2024 were $0.7 million, a decrease of 27.1% from $1.0 million during Q1 2024 and a 21.0% increase compared to Q2 2023. The sequential quarter decrease is due to a reduction in high-value clinical trials being completed and the winding down of its research center in Phoenix, AZ. CCR is currently conducting two psychedelic drug candidate clinical trials, with four further expected to commence in Q3 2024, as well as other non-psychedelic studies. Since Q3 2023, CCR has facilitated 26 clinical trials. Numinus Clinical Training The Company has built a fulsome certification program to train practitioners in ketamine, 3,4-Methyl enedioxy methamphetamine (""MDMA""), and psilocybin-assisted therapy (""Numinus Training Program"") that leverages its expertise in clinic-based treatment and clinical research. The program is accredited by major regulatory bodies in Canada and the U.S. and provided in a blended learning format to optimize adult learning. As of March 2024, over 1,400 learners have enrolled in Numinus Training ProgramsSince the introduction of its free Introduction to Psychedelics training course, over 30 learners have gone on to take more advanced training with NuminusNuminus Training has diversified its offering to support leading research institutions to train research providers in evidence-based practices for supporting clients in psychedelic clinical trialsNuminus Training has been working diligently on the Oregon Health Authority audit to meet the legislative and competency requirements for psychedelic facilitators in that stateCorporate Updates On February 14, 2024, Rick Doblin, PhD, the Founder and President of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (""MAPS""), was appointed as an unpaid, non-exclusive strategic adviser of Numinus On March 12, 2024, the Company announced Edwin Garner's retirement from its Board of Directors and the appointment of Donna Wilson and Donna Wong as directors. Both directors bring decades of experience in corporate strategy, corporate finance, corporate governance, and people management. On March 12, 2024, the Company announced the appointment of Melony Valleau as its interim CFO, effective March 28, 2024, upon the resignation of Nikhil Handa. Ms. Valleau brings U.S. corporate finance and capital markets experience to Numinus, which aligns with the Company's plans to increase its presence with U.S.-based patients and investors. On April 11, 2024, the Company announced that Dr. Reid Robison, the Company's Chief Clinical Officer, will leave his position to focus on his role as lead principal investigator at Numinus and return to private practice. Dr. Paul Thielking, Numinus' Chief Science Officer overseeing the company's research activities, has also assumed the leadership of the Company's clinical function as Chief Medical Officer. The Company's annual general meeting will be held on May 31, 2024. Balance Sheet and Liquidity Numinus ended the quarter with a total cash balance of $6.6 million and working capital of $6.4 million. Numinus' unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the three months ended February 29, 2024, and related management's discussion and analysis are available on Numinus' Investor Relations website at www.investors.numinus.com and under the Company's profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca. These documents were prepared in accordance with IFRS. Outlook As an integrated mental healthcare provider, Numinus is building the critical infrastructure of clinical research support, practitioner training, and patient therapy to serve the expected demand for psychedelic-assisted therapy (""PAT""). To take advantage of what it sees as a significant growth opportunity, the Company has focused on optimizing its operations and controlling costs since the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The Company expects significant growth from the sector as acceptance of PAT as an effective treatment for serious mental health conditions increases and psychedelic drug candidates advance through the drug approval process. According to the newsletter Psychedelic Alpha1, there are currently over 90 potential psychedelic drugs in the preclinical to phase 3 clinical trial stages of drug development. This includes the FDA's acceptance of MDMA as a new drug application with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (""PDUFA"") target action date of August 11, 2024. It is the Company's view that these trends indicate the beginning of a period when psychedelic treatments for serious mental health conditions may become increasingly available to the public and provide opportunities for continued growth across the three areas of its sector focus. As a leading provider of clinical research support, Numinus' Cedar Clinical Research (CCR) anticipates that it will continue working directly with drug developers to provide research sites for drug candidates in phase 2 and 3 trial stages. In the last 12 months, CCR has facilitated 26 clinical trials and has established relationships with both psychedelic and non-psychedelic drug developers, which positions it to secure further contracts.A component of many psychedelic drug treatments is therapy to guide patients through their transformation. Numinus hopes to leverage its clinic footprint, treatment expertise in multiple psychedelics and first-mover advantage in PAT to become the provider of choice.To meet the demand for trained practitioners to administer therapies for approved treatments, Numinus has established a comprehensive program. Accreditation is available through major regulatory bodies in Canada and the U.S. after completing the course, which has proven to attract learners and serve as validation for their future clients. The program has demonstrated scalability, doubling enrollment over the past six months. The Company is also in the early stages of launching therapist training programs for drug developers to facilitate clinical research trials.To prepare the Company for the growth expected from the psychedelic sector, Numinus launched two critical initiatives: cost containment and strategic realignment. A focus on profitable operations in the U.S.: With psychedelic therapy treatment expected to be approved in the U.S. before other jurisdictions, the Company chose to discontinue its unprofitable clinic in Phoenix, Arizona. With the consolidation of operations at its successful Utah clinics, Numinus is optimizing its patient experience and care model, improving efficiencies, and establishing best practices to be deployed in future expansion.Reducing headcount: Since Q2 2023, Numinus has reduced its headcount by 60% by eliminating non-revenue roles and aligned all remaining employees on growth-oriented initiatives and activities. The resulting leaner and more efficient organization will drive profitable growth.With the initiatives in place and positive trends in the psychedelic sector, the Company believes it is well-positioned for growth in the quarters to come. ___________________________________ 1 Psychedelic Alpha.

March 2024 Monthly Update provides insights into the fund's investment approach, top 20 holdings, monthly performance, net assets, sector breakdown, new holdings, and liquidated holdings. The fund combines three growth style investment managers with a focus on small-, mid-, and large-cap companies. The top 20 holdings include companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Visa. The fund's performance for the month and year-to-date is positive, with a net asset value of $362.8 million and a sector breakdown dominated by Information Technology and Health Care. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The monthly update from Liberty All-Star Growth Fund, Inc. sheds light on several key aspects that are pertinent to investors and stakeholders. The reported Net Asset Value (NAV) discount widening from -9.1% to -9.7% could signal a market sentiment that is more bearish than the intrinsic valuation of the fund's assets. Such a scenario might encourage investors to consider whether the fund is undervalued and represents a buying opportunity or if the increasing discount reflects underlying concerns about the fund's holdings or management strategy.With a year-to-date performance of 7.90% at NAV, the fund appears to be navigating the current market conditions effectively. However, it is important to consider that this performance does not account for taxes that shareholders would pay on distributions or the sale of fund shares. This figure, while indicative of the fund’s health, requires further analysis in the broader context of market conditions and comparable funds' performances. Market Research Analyst The sector breakdown provided by the fund is a valuable insight into the portfolio diversification, with significant allocations in Information Technology and Health Care. This composition suggests the fund's strategy to capitalize on growth sectors, which could be a response to market trends favoring innovation and technology. However, potential investors should be aware of the risks associated with sector concentration, as any downturn in these industries could disproportionately affect the fund's performance.Furthermore, the update includes changes in holdings, such as the liquidation of BJ's Wholesale Club Holdings, Inc. and the acquisition of Casey's General Stores, Inc. Such transactions reflect the fund's dynamic approach to portfolio management, though the rationale behind these specific changes is not detailed, making it difficult to assess their strategic value without additional information. Economist The distribution of returns, which includes dividends and long-term capital gains, points towards the fund's approach to provide shareholder value. However, the mention that a portion of the distributions consists of a return of capital is worth noting, as this could indicate that some payouts are not solely from earned income. This could be a red flag for investors seeking funds that generate steady income from investments rather than returning principal, which could potentially dilute long-term growth prospects.Investors should also consider the economic and regulatory environment when evaluating the performance data. The fund's performance and strategy must be analyzed in the context of interest rate trends, inflation rates, geopolitical events and shifts in consumer behavior, all of which can have profound impacts on the market segments the fund is invested in. 04/12/2024 - 07:53 PM BOSTON, April 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Below is the March 2024 Monthly Update for the Liberty All-Star Growth Fund, Inc.

Performance will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data shown. Performance information shown does not reflect the deduction of taxes that shareholders would pay on Fund distributions or the sale of Fund shares. Shareholders must be willing to tolerate significant fluctuations in the value of their investment. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including loss of principal. Sources of distributions to shareholders may include ordinary dividends, long-term capital gains and return of capital. The final determination of the source of all distributions in 2024 for tax reporting purposes will be made after year end. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Based on current estimates a portion of the distributions consist of a return of capital. These estimates may not match the final tax characterization (for the full year's distributions) contained in shareholder 1099-DIV forms after the end of the year.

NEXA RESOURCES ANNOUNCES EARLY TENDER EXPIRATION AND RESULTS OF ITS OFFER TO PURCHASE A PORTION OF ITS NOTES DUE IN 2028,2024-04-12T23:51:00.000Z,Low,Negative,"Nexa Resources announces early tender expiration and results of its offer to purchase a portion of its notes due in 2028. The company offered to purchase its 2027 and 2028 notes for cash, with a prorated acceptance of the 2028 notes due to oversubscription. The total consideration for the 2028 notes is $1,020 per $1,000 principal amount tendered.","NEXA RESOURCES ANNOUNCES EARLY TENDER EXPIRATION AND RESULTS OF ITS OFFER TO PURCHASE A PORTION OF ITS NOTES DUE IN 2028 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Nexa Resources announces early tender expiration and results of its offer to purchase a portion of its notes due in 2028. The company offered to purchase its 2027 and 2028 notes for cash, with a prorated acceptance of the 2028 notes due to oversubscription. The total consideration for the 2028 notes is $1,020 per $1,000 principal amount tendered. Positive None. Negative None. Debt Market Analyst The managed reduction of Nexa Resources' outstanding notes due in 2028 has the potential to positively influence the company's debt profile. By repurchasing a significant portion of these notes using cash, Nexa could potentially achieve a lower long-term interest expense. Given the tender offer included a premium over the par value, it is plausible to assume a proactive approach to debt management. This may enhance investor confidence in the firm's financial strategies and possibly affect its credit ratings positively.Analyzing the offer's acceptance level, which reached over 50%, indicates robust interest from note holders, reflecting the attractiveness of the offer or a possible inclination of note holders to liquidate their positions in the current economic environment. This high participation rate could also suggest market anticipation of interest rate fluctuations or assessments of the company's future cash flows.Despite the apparent merits, the transaction might also suggest that Nexa Resources is harboring surplus cash reserves or a preference for equity over debt in its capital structure. This could signal underlying strategic shifts in the company's operations or investment activities that stakeholders should monitor closely. Financial Risk Analyst The prorated acceptance of the tendered 2028 Notes indicates a disciplined financial strategy, as it allows Nexa Resources to avoid exceeding its Maximum Payment Amount threshold. Such fiscal restraint is reassuring to investors concerned about the risk of over-leveraging. The success of the tender offer before its expiration date could suggest that the market views the company's securities favorably, which may diminish liquidity risk for these notes.It is important to note, however, that the reduction in outstanding debt through a tender offer could also denote an attempt to manipulate the company's leverage ratios prior to future financing activities or in anticipation of changing market conditions. A critical assessment of the company's balance sheet post-transaction may reveal whether such strategic debt repurchase was necessary for maintaining its debt covenant compliance or was a purely opportunistic financial maneuver. Investment Strategist Engaging renowned Dealer Managers for the tender offer suggests a strategic move by Nexa Resources to ensure the offer's success and reflects positively on the company's governance practices. It may also be a play to consolidate future dealings and negotiations with these financial institutions.From an investment strategy perspective, the timing of this transaction and the decision to use cash reserves for debt repurchase rather than for other investments or shareholder returns warrant attention. Shareholders should evaluate the opportunity cost of this tender offer, considering alternative investments the company could have pursued with the deployed capital. The acceptance of the tender offer could also impact the supply-demand dynamics of the remaining notes, potentially influencing their market valuation and yield spread.Lastly, stakeholders should consider the broader industry and economic context within which this offer has been made, as the metals and mining sector to which Nexa belongs may be experiencing shifts in commodity prices, regulatory changes, or other macroeconomic factors that can impact corporate financing strategies and investor decisions. 04/12/2024 - 07:51 PM LUXEMBOURG, April 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Nexa Resources S.A. (""Nexa Resources"", ""Nexa"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE Symbol: ""NEXA"") announces today the early tender expiration and results of its previously announced offer to purchase for cash (the ""2028 Tender Offer""). Pursuant to the offer to purchase dated April 1, 2024 (the ""Offer to Purchase""), Nexa Resources offered to purchase for cash (i) any and all of its 5.375% senior unsecured guaranteed notes due 2027 (the ""2027 Notes"") and (ii) up to a Maximum Payment Amount (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) of its outstanding 6.500% Notes due 2028 unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by the Guarantors (the ""2028 Notes""). On April 5, 2024, Nexa announced the results of the tender offer for its 2027 Notes and on April 10, 2024, Nexa purchased 69.2% of the outstanding principal amount of its 2027 Notes.

King & Co., Inc., the information and tender agent for the 2028 Tender Offer, (the ""Tender and Information Agent""), US$247,185,000.00 of the principal amount outstanding of 2028 Notes were validly tendered, and not validly withdrawn. As of 5:00pm (New York City time), on April 12, 2024 (the ""2028 Notes Withdrawal Deadline""), 2028 Notes validly tendered in the 2028 Tender Offer may no longer be withdrawn except in certain limited circumstances where additional withdrawal rights are required by law. Because the aggregate purchase price of the 2028 Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn on or prior to the 2028 Early Tender Date (including Accrued Interest, as defined below) is expected to exceed the Maximum Payment Amount, Nexa Resources expects to accept the validly tendered 2028 Notes on a prorated basis according to the principal amount of such 2028 Notes, such that Nexa Resources spends no more than the Maximum Payment Amount (including Accrued Interest). The principal amount of 2028 Notes tendered by a holder of 2028 Notes will be multiplied by the proration rate indicated below and then rounded down to the nearest US$1,000.00 increment. The Maximum Payment Amount to be spent by Nexa in the purchase of the 2028 Notes (including principal, premium and accrued interest) is US$103,051,943.46, which is (1) US$600.00 million less (2) the aggregate amount that holders of the 2027 Notes received for the 2027 Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the 2027 Tender Offer, including the payment of any premiums, accrued interest and costs and expenses incurred in connection the tender offers. The following table sets forth certain information relating to the 2028 Tender Offer, including the principal amount of 2028 Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn and accepted for purchase in the 2028 Tender Offer.

Although the 2028 Tender Offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00pm (New York City time), on April 29, 2024 (such date and time, as may be extended or earlier terminated by Nexa Resources), because the 2028 Tender Offer was fully subscribed as of the 2028 Early Tender Date, Nexa Resources does not expect to accept for purchase any 2028 Notes tendered after the 2028 Early Tender Date. The settlement date of the 2028 Tender Offer will occur within one business day following the 2028 Early Expiration Date, on April 15, 2024, or as promptly as practicable thereafter (the ""2028 Early Settlement Date"").

All 2028 Notes accepted for purchase in the 2028 Tender Offer will cease to accrue interest on the applicable 2028 Early Settlement Date, unless Nexa Resources defaults in the payment of amounts payable pursuant to the 2028 Tender Offer.

The company expands its sales force for the nine months in fiscal 2024, indicating growth and market penetration. Positive clinical data for InFoods IBS will be presented at the upcoming Digestive Disease Week 2024 Conference, highlighting the company's advancements in medical diagnostics. Biomerica is in discussions with key clinical lab customers for the use of its FDA-cleared Hp Detect™ Test, targeting a significant portion of the U.S. population infected with H. pylori bacteria. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reduction in loss per share to $0.27 from $0.40 is indicative of Biomerica's improved financial performance over the nine-month period. This suggests that the company has managed to exert fiscal discipline despite the costs associated with expanding its sales force. Investors might look positively upon this development, considering it may reflect better cost management and potential for reduced cash burn rate. Additionally, any improvement in the bottom line is critical for the company's long-term sustainability, particularly if it can be maintained or further improved upon.However, one must consider that narrowing losses does not equal profitability. For a company like Biomerica, which operates in the competitive medical diagnostics and therapeutic products sector, ongoing investment in research and market expansion is vital. The sales force expansion indicates an investment in growth, but the true efficacy of this strategy will be evaluated based on future revenue growth and market penetration. Medical Research Analyst The upcoming presentation of the InFoods IBS clinical trial data at DDW 2024 represents a significant milestone for Biomerica. Clinical data is a strong driver of both clinical adoption and investor confidence. Positive results can lead to increased interest from healthcare providers and could catalyze partnerships or sales agreements. The potential market impact is magnified by the prevalence of IBS, which affects a substantial portion of the population and the current lack of effective diagnostic tools for this condition. Therefore, the success of InFoods IBS could significantly enhance Biomerica's market position.Furthermore, the company's discussions with key clinical lab customers regarding its FDA 510(k) cleared Hp Detect™ Test Product is promising. The detection of H. pylori, a major risk factor for gastric cancer, has profound public health implications.

The Company's products are designed to enhance the health and well-being of people, while reducing total healthcare costs. Biomerica's primary focus is on gastrointestinal and inflammatory diseases where the Company has multiple diagnostic and therapeutic products in development. About inFoods® The inFoods IBS test is designed to assess a patient’s above normal immunoreactivity to specific foods utilizing a simple finger prick blood sample. Instead of difficult to manage broad dietary restrictions, physicians can now use the InFoods IBS information to make targeted, patient-specific recommendations about specific foods that, when removed from the diet, may alleviate IBS symptoms such as pain, bloating, diarrhea and constipation. The inFoods IBS test and clinical outcomes were studied at several prominent centers including Mayo Clinic, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Inc. - a Harvard Medical School Teaching Hospital, Houston Methodist Hospital, and the University of Michigan. The clinical results for improvement in the Abdominal Pain Intensity (API) responder endpoint of >30% reduction in pain, for IBS patients in the treatment diet arm was greater than patients in the placebo diet arm (p-value of 0.0246). The improvement for patients in the treatment arm versus the placebo arm is considered clinically significant and for certain endpoints is similar and, in some cases, better than the current drugs in the market.

Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Better Choice Company, Inc. reported strong financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023, with significant improvements in gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, and EPS. The company focused on operational discipline, strategic pricing initiatives, and profitability. Despite a decline in topline due to strategic shifts, Better Choice remains optimistic about future growth and brand equity enhancement. Positive Gross margin improved by 300 basis points to 31% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 30% year-over-year. EPS increased by 45% year-over-year. Operating loss improved by 47% year-over-year to $(12.7) million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Net loss improved by 40% year-over-year to $(14.7) million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Full-year 2023 financial highlights include a 45% improvement in operating loss, a 42% improvement in net loss, and a 32% improvement in adjusted EBITDA. Better Choice Company Inc. reported a net loss per share of $(32.29) for the full year 2023. The company's strategic pivot in digital and marketing investment allocation aims to drive brand growth and discoverability in 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported growth in Adjusted EBITDA and EPS, alongside improvements in gross margin, indicate a strengthening operational efficiency within Better Choice Company. These metrics are important for investor confidence, especially in a sector where the cost of goods and operational expenses can significantly influence profitability. The shift towards higher-margin products and the streamlining of operations to reduce cash burn are positive signs that the management is effectively executing its turnaround strategy.However, investors must consider the company's operating loss and net loss improvements in the context of a topline decline. This could suggest that while the company is becoming more efficient, it may also be facing challenges in growing or maintaining its sales revenue, potentially impacting future profitability and market share. Furthermore, the decline in topline could be symptomatic of deeper market penetration issues or competitive pressures. The strategic pivot in digital and marketing investment strategies will be key to monitoring as they are intended to drive brand growth and discoverability. Market Research Analyst The reported strategic exits from unprofitable accounts and the brand migration from TruDog to Halo indicate a shift in the company's market approach. This could lead to a short-term contraction in sales volume but potentially improve long-term profitability if the Halo brand gains traction. The pet health and wellness industry is competitive and driven by brand loyalty; therefore, brand perception and market acceptance of Halo will be pivotal. The pivot to enhanced digital and marketing strategies may also suggest a realignment towards e-commerce, which has been growing significantly in the pet industry.The emphasis on product quality and continuous improvement initiatives hints at a long-term strategy aimed at establishing a solid competitive position. It will be important to evaluate customer reception to these initiatives and how they translate into sustained sales momentum. Economist The overall economic landscape and consumer spending patterns can greatly impact the pet industry's performance. An improvement in operational discipline and a focus on profitability are commendable, yet it is vital to assess whether the topline decline reflects a broader economic downturn or sector-specific trends. If the latter, the company's efforts to realign its strategy could buffer it against such headwinds. It's essential to monitor if the brand equity built can lead to stronger pricing power in a marketplace where consumers are often willing to spend more on premium pet products.Moreover, the supply chain adjustments and improved input cost management that contributed to the gross margin expansion are reflective of adaptive operational strategies. These strategies may yield further benefits if input cost pressures subside in the future, which is often subject to market dynamics and global supply chain conditions. 04/12/2024 - 04:39 PM Gross Margin Improved 300 basis points to 31% Year-Over-Year Adjusted EBITDA Grew 30% Year-Over-Year EPS Grew 45% Year-Over-Year TAMPA, Fla., April 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Better Choice Company Inc. (NYSE American: BTTR) (the “Company” or “Better Choice”), a pet health and wellness company, today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. Kent Cunningham, CEO of Better Choice, stated, “In 2023, we realized significant gross margin improvement to 31%, fueled by strategic pricing initiatives and a 3% YOY improvement of input costs - a reflection of operational discipline and unlocking profit through high production supply volumes. Our further continued focus on financial discipline and a path to profitability is reflected in the 29% adjusted EBITDA growth and significant improvement in cash burn during the year. The topline decline was a primary result of normalizing stock levels in our International markets, purposefully exiting unprofitable accounts, and attrition related to the late 2022 migration of the former TruDog brand to the Halo brand umbrella in our digital channels. Significant strategic shifts were purposefully made across channels to ensure recoverability and long-term viability of the Halo brand. Our 2024 annual operating plan includes a strategic pivot in our digital and marketing investment allocation strategies to drive brand growth and discoverability. Looking forward, we are focused on accelerating topline momentum, keeping product quality at the forefront, and continuous improvement initiatives to fuel our future growth trajectory. We closed the year with a solid footing to build upon brand equity and enhanced profitability further in 2024.” FOURTH QUARTER 2023 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Operating loss improved 47% YOY to $(12.7) millionOperating margin improved 3,800 basis points (“bps”) YOY to (-223%)Net loss improved 40% YOY to $(14.7) millionEarnings (loss) per share (“EPS”) improved 40% YOY to ($20.84)Adjusted EBITDA improved 30% YOY to $(3.4) million1 FULL YEAR 2023 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Gross margin improved 300 bps YOY to 31%Operating loss improved 45% YOY to $(21.2) millionOperating margin improved 1,600 bps YOY to (-55%)Net loss improved 42% YOY to $(22.8) millionEPS improved 45% YOY to ($32.29)Adjusted EBITDA improved 32% YOY to $(8.0) million1 Better Choice Company Inc.Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022Net sales$38,592 $54,660 Cost of goods sold 26,795 39,399 Gross profit 11,797 15,261 Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative 24,444 35,430 Impairment of goodwill — 18,614 Impairment of intangible assets 8,532 Total operating expenses 32,976 54,044 Loss from operations (21,179) (38,783)Other expenses: Interest expense, net (1,353) (551)Change in fair value of warrant liability (236) — Total other expense, net (1,589) (551)Net loss before income taxes (22,768) (39,334)Income tax expense (benefit) 2 (18)Net loss available to common stockholders$(27,770) $(39,316)Weighted average number of shares outstanding, basic 705,185 667,114 Weighted average number of shares outstanding, diluted 705,185 667,114 Net loss per share available to common stockholders, basic$(32.29) $(58.93)Net loss per share available to common stockholders, diluted$(32.29) $(58.93) All share and per share amounts related to the Company's common stock for all periods presented herein have been retroactively adjusted, where applicable, to reflect the Reverse Stock Split.

Adjusted EBITDA is determined by adding the following items to net (loss) income: interest expense, tax expense, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, loss on disposal of assets, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, change in fair value of warrant liabilities, strategic branding initiatives and product launch expenses, co-manufacturing partner transition, and other non-recurring expenses. We present Adjusted EBITDA as it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. We believe that the disclosure of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors as this non-GAAP measure forms the basis of how our management team reviews and considers our operating results. By disclosing this non-GAAP measure, we believe that we create for investors a greater understanding of and an enhanced level of transparency into the means by which our management team operates our company. We also believe this measure can assist investors in comparing our performance to that of other companies on a consistent basis without regard to certain items that do not directly affect our ongoing operating performance or cash flows. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net (loss) income, gross margin, and our other GAAP results. The following table presents a reconciliation of net loss, the closest GAAP financial measure, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated (in thousands): Reconciliation of Net Loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA(Dollars in thousands) Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022Net loss available to common stockholders$(14,701) $(24,362) $(22,770) $(39,316)Interest expense, net 433 227 1,353 551 Income tax expense 2 (22) 2 (18)Depreciation and amortization 417 425 1,678 1,690 EBITDA (13,849)) (23,732) (19,737) (37,093)Non-cash share-based compensation (a) 157 515 1,775 2,969 Impairment of goodwill — 18,614 — 18,614 Impairment of intangible assets 8,532 — 8,532 — Change in fair value of warrant liabilities 1,575 — 236 — Loss on disposal of assets 1 3 12 29 Strategic branding initiatives and product launches (b) 44 (480) 128 1,046 Transaction related (c) 137 — 935 — Other single occurrence expenses (d) 46 264 149 2,654 Adjusted EBITDA$(3,359) $(4,819) $(7,973) $(11,781)(a) Non-cash expenses related to equity compensation awards.

Market Research Analyst The substantial year-over-year revenue increase reported by KULR Technology Group suggests a robust expansion in its operations, particularly within the energy storage, battery transportation and recycling sectors. The 47% growth in billed customers indicates successful market penetration and could hint at rising demand for KULR's products. However, the significantly higher net loss and reduced cash balance raise questions about the company's current burn rate and the sustainability of its growth trajectory without additional financing. Financial Analyst The increased investment in research and development, as well as higher labor costs, point to KULR's strategic focus on innovation and scaling up capacity. This is a potential indicator of future revenue streams but must be weighed against the 21% rise in SG&A expenses. The critical market takeaway here would be the balance between aggressive growth strategies and the management's ability to control operational costs to avoid eroding the bottom line further. Sustainability and Compliance Expert Securing new special permits from the United States Department of Transportation for the transportation of DDR batteries is a strategic win for KULR. It positions them favorably in a niche, yet increasingly important market segment concerned with battery safety and sustainability. The alignment with EASA safety protocols through the integration of KULR's Thermal Runaway Shield with H55's EPS exemplifies compliance with stringent regulatory standards, potentially opening doors to European markets and enhancing brand credibility. 04/12/2024 - 04:15 PM Full-Year 2023 Revenue Up 146% Year-Over-Year SAN DIEGO, April 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- KULR Technology Group, Inc.

These additions reflect management’s commitment to build new customer relationships through a growing pool of referrals and business development leads. Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses: SG&A expenses increased to $19,882,402 in 2023 from $16,453,776 in 2022. The 21% increase was primarily due to increases in labor costs, and depreciation and amortization expenses due to expansion of our facility and equipment placed in service during 2023.

While the program is already underway, upon achieving anticipated milestones, both KULR and its partner anticipate follow-on orders supporting a significant increase in the frequency and scale of planned space missions.Secured new special permits from the United States Department of Transportation related to its patented SafeX product suite, including SafeCASE™ and SafeSLEEVE™.

Announces Initial Closing of Public Offering of Common Stock and Pre-Funded Warrants Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Ascent Solar Technologies, Inc. announces the initial closing of a public offering of common stock and pre-funded warrants, raising $3.09 million. The offering includes 12,629,460 shares of common stock and 9,426,570 pre-funded warrants. The net proceeds will be used for various purposes, including retiring outstanding cash payable and canceling warrants with a current exercise price. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The capital raise by Ascent Solar Technologies through a public offering of common stock and pre-funded warrants is a strategic financial maneuver to strengthen the company's balance sheet. By securing $3.09 million in gross proceeds, the company plans to retire a portion of its debt related to previously issued secured notes and repurchase warrants. These actions suggest a focus on managing their capital structure and reducing potential dilution from outstanding warrants.An immediate implication for investors is the potential anti-dilutive effect of repurchasing warrants, which may enhance shareholder value. The financial structure of the pre-funded warrants, exercisable at $0.0001 per share, is quite favorable and indicates a high level of confidence from investors willing to commit capital with a negligible exercise price, likely in anticipation of future growth. However, this needs to be weighed against the dilutive impact of newly issued shares in the short term.The transaction's timeframe, with a closing window that ends on April 26, demonstrates an urgency to secure funding quickly. This may reflect a pressing need for capital to sustain operations and strategic projects. Investors should monitor the deployment of the acquired funds towards the stated purposes, as well as the company's subsequent financial health and stock performance. Securities Legal Expert The offering is conducted on a 'best efforts' basis, meaning that the placement agent, Dawson James Securities, Inc., is not obligated to purchase any unsold shares. The legal representation by Carroll Legal, LLC and ArentFox Schiff LLP underscores the importance of regulatory compliance in such capital market transactions, particularly given the involvement of an effective registration statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).For stakeholders, the adherence to SEC regulations and the provision of a final prospectus is important for transparency and informed decision-making. It is important for current and potential investors to review the prospectus to understand the risks and terms of the offering, as it contains essential information about the company's financial status and the specifics of the securities being offered.As the offering does not constitute an actual sale in any jurisdiction where it might be unlawful, the legal framework ensures that only qualified investors in appropriate jurisdictions are able to participate, thereby minimizing legal risks associated with the offering. Market Research Analyst Ascent Solar Technologies operates in the renewable energy sector, specifically focusing on thin-film photovoltaic (PV) solutions, which is a highly competitive and innovation-driven market. The capital secured through this offering could provide Ascent Solar with the means to invest in research and development, potentially leading to advancements in their PV technology.Assessing the industry's trajectory and the company's position within it, the investment into R&D could be a differentiating factor in the long-term, potentially enabling Ascent Solar to capitalize on the growing demand for renewable energy solutions. On the flip side, such investments carry inherent risks and the returns are not guaranteed. Stakeholders should evaluate the company's track record in innovation and market adoption of its products when considering the long-term implications of this fundraising event.Additionally, the move to retire debt and purchase warrants may indicate a strategic pivot towards a more sustainable financial model, which could be perceived positively by the market. However, the effectiveness of these actions in improving the company's market competitiveness and financial robustness will be a key factor to watch in the upcoming financial quarters. 04/12/2024 - 05:00 PM THORNTON, Colo., April 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ascent Solar Technologies, Inc.

The acquisition aims to define the future of secure, multicloud networking by integrating Isovalent's innovative technologies into Cisco's Security Cloud vision. Isovalent's contributions to eBPF, Cilium, and Tetragon will enhance networking capabilities and visibility in cloud native environments. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The completion of Cisco's acquisition of Isovalent represents a strategic move to bolster Cisco's portfolio in the realms of multicloud networking and security. This acquisition aligns with the burgeoning demand for cloud-native technologies as enterprises accelerate digital transformation. It positions Cisco favorably within a competitive landscape, where differentiation often hinges on comprehensive and innovative security solutions. Isovalent's expertise in eBPF and the development of Cilium and Tetragon can be expected to enrich Cisco's Security Cloud vision, potentially translating into increased market share and customer trust in Cisco's security offerings.From a market perspective, the integration of Isovalent's technologies into Cisco's security platform is likely to enhance Cisco's value proposition in multicloud environments. In the long term, this could lead to an expanded customer base as organizations increasingly seek out robust security solutions that can seamlessly operate across diverse cloud architectures. By staying at the forefront of cloud-native security solutions, Cisco may also see an uplift in brand perception as a leader in an area of growing importance within IT infrastructure. Financial Analyst Financially, the acquisition of Isovalent by Cisco is a significant investment in the future of multicloud security, which is a rapidly expanding segment due to the shift towards distributed computing environments. While the immediate financial impact may include acquisition costs and integration expenses, this move is expected to pay dividends in the form of future revenue streams. Investors should monitor how effectively Cisco integrates Isovalent's technologies and leverages its expertise to capture more of the security market share.Additionally, the market will be watching closely for Cisco's ability to maintain and contribute to the open source projects that Isovalent has been known for. The stewardship of these projects is important as it can influence both the developer community's support and the broader adoption of Cisco's solutions in the market. By extension, investors should consider the potential for Cisco's Security Cloud to emerge as an industry standard, which would bode well for sustained growth and profitability. Cybersecurity Expert The acquisition of Isovalent by Cisco signals a leap forward in the cybersecurity industry, particularly in the protection of multicloud environments. The emphasis on Isovalent's contributions to eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) and its cloud-native solutions like Cilium and Tetragon is noteworthy. These technologies enable more fine-grained security policies and advanced monitoring capabilities, which are essential in modern, dynamic cloud environments. The ability to achieve this at scale could provide Cisco with a distinct competitive advantage.For organizations, the promise of leading-edge protection for every workload across any cloud is an attractive proposition, as it simplifies the security management of their diverse cloud services. In an industry where threats are ever-evolving and the perimeter is increasingly hard to define, a solution that integrates seamlessly into an organization's existing multicloud strategy can be a game-changer. This acquisition could therefore represent a substantial leap in Cisco's capabilities, contributing to a more secure and resilient digital infrastructure. 04/12/2024 - 06:35 PM News Summary: Cisco has completed the acquisition of Isovalent, Inc., a leader in open source cloud native networking and securityTogether, Cisco and Isovalent will build leading edge protection for every workload on every cloudCisco is committed to nurturing and supporting eBPF, Cilium, Tetragon, and cloud native open source communitiesSAN JOSE, Calif., April 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) today announced the completion of the acquisition of Isovalent, a leader in open source cloud native networking and security.

(CISS) has agreed to acquire the Bulk Carrier Eco Spitfire for $16.19 million from Brave Maritime, an affiliated company. The vessel, built in 2012, has a cargo capacity of 33,664 dwt and is currently under a time charter. Payment terms include 10% upfront and the balance by April 2025. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The acquisition of the Eco Spitfire bulk carrier by C3is Inc. reflects a strategic capital expenditure that has clear implications for the company's asset base and operational capabilities. The transaction size of $16.19 million places it in a mid-range investment tier, given the scale of maritime assets. From a financial analysis perspective, the staggered payment structure, with only 10% due upfront, provides C3is with cash flow flexibility in the short-term while committing to a significant outlay by April 2025.The vessel's age, being built in 2012, suggests a depreciation factor that must be considered when assessing the long-term return on investment. This also raises questions about the potential maintenance and operational costs that could impact the company's financials. Investors should monitor the utilization of this vessel post-acquisition, as it will directly impact revenue generation capabilities. Maritime Market Analyst C3is's move to acquire a handysize bulk carrier is indicative of the current demand for maritime shipping, particularly for vessels that offer flexibility in cargo carrying capacity. Handysize carriers like the Eco Spitfire are versatile for a variety of cargo, making them valuable in the bulk shipping sector. The vessel's registration in the Marshall Islands is a common flag of convenience, which may lead to cost savings in terms of registration fees, taxes and compliance with maritime regulations.Furthermore, the time charter set to expire in May 2024 presents an upcoming decision point for C3is regarding the vessel’s employment strategy. The current market rates for time charters and the overall shipping market trends will greatly influence the profitability of this acquisition. Analysts and investors will be closely watching the terms of the new charter agreement or alternative employment for the vessel to gauge potential earnings. 04/12/2024 - 04:10 PM ATHENS, Greece, April 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- C3is Inc. (Nasdaq: CISS) (the “Company”) announced today that it has entered into an agreement to acquire the Bulk Carrier Eco Spitfire for $16.19 million from Brave Maritime, an affiliated company. Eco Spitfire, a Marshall Islands registered vessel, was built at a Japanese ship yard in 2012, and has a cargo carrying capacity of approximately 33,664 dwt.

"Herbalife Completes $1.6 Billion Senior Secured Refinancing, Includes $1.2 Billion Senior Secured Debt and $400 Million Revolver",2024-04-12T20:09:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Herbalife completes a $1.6 billion senior secured refinancing, including $1.2 billion in senior secured debt and a $400 million revolver. The company aims to strengthen its balance sheet and reduce its Total Leverage Ratio to 3.0x by the end of 2025.","Herbalife Completes $1.6 Billion Senior Secured Refinancing, Includes $1.2 Billion Senior Secured Debt and $400 Million Revolver Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Herbalife completes a $1.6 billion senior secured refinancing, including $1.2 billion in senior secured debt and a $400 million revolver. The company aims to strengthen its balance sheet and reduce its Total Leverage Ratio to 3.0x by the end of 2025. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The refinancing initiative by Herbalife presents a multifaceted financial scenario. From a balance sheet perspective, replacing short-term debt with longer-term obligations can ease immediate liquidity pressures. The selected interest rates, notably the 12.25% for the 2029 Secured Notes, substantially exceed current rates for investment-grade corporate debt, indicating either a strategic premium for flexibility or an adjustment for perceived risk. Investors should monitor the Total Leverage Ratio trajectory, as it is a critical determinant of financial health. Herbalife's interest expenses will rise considering the high coupon rate on the new debt, which could impact net income and possibly dividend distributions. Additionally, the nature of the debt being senior secured implies that new creditors have priority claims over certain assets, possibly limiting future borrowing capacity or affecting terms for unsecured debt holders. Debt Market Analyst The conditions surrounding the issuance of Herbalife's 2029 Secured Notes, particularly the below-par price and high-interest rate, reflect market skepticism and potentially the company's creditworthiness. The non-callable period of two years affords the company a window where they are shielded from early redemption pressures, a small respite for executing turnaround strategies or improving operational efficiencies. Analyzing the SOFR-based interest rate for the Amended Term Loan B and Revolving Credit Facility, the spread above SOFR is indicative of the risk premium demanded by lenders. The fluctuation of interest rates based on the Total Leverage Ratio introduces a performance-based element to the cost of capital, incentivizing management to maintain or reduce leverage. Credit Risk Analyst Herbalife's debt refinancing terms, including the covenants, are critical for understanding potential future risk exposures. The covenants set boundaries on leverage and liquidity, functioning as early warning systems for stakeholders. A breach of these covenants could trigger default scenarios or necessitate renegotiation of terms, which could further affect Herbalife's financial flexibility. Furthermore, the minimum liquidity coverage stipulates a conservative approach to cash management, but it may restrict the company's ability to invest in growth opportunities. Stakeholders should assess the impact of the financial covenants on Herbalife's operational agility. 04/12/2024 - 04:09 PM LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE: HLF) (the “Company”), a premier health and wellness company, community and platform, today announced the closing of the previously announced private offering by HLF Financing SaRL, LLC and Herbalife International, Inc., each a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, of $800 million aggregate principal amount of 12.25% senior secured notes due in April 2029 (“2029 Secured Notes”).

The Company will use the proceeds from these transactions to repay all amounts outstanding under its 2018 Term Loan A, 2018 Term Loan B and 2018 Revolving Credit Facility, to redeem $300 million of the $600 million aggregate principal amount of its 7.875% Senior Notes due 2025 at a price of 101.969% and pay related fees and expenses. Any remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. The 2029 Secured Notes were issued at a price to the public of 97.298% of par and are non-callable for two years.

The Amended Term Loan B bears interest at a per annum rate equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus 6.75% and was issued at a price of 93% of the face amount. The Amended Term Loan B requires quarterly payments equal to 5.0% per annum, commencing in September 2024. The Amended Revolving Credit Facility will initially bear interest at a per annum rate equal to SOFR plus 6.25% and will fluctuate depending on the Company’s Total Leverage Ratio at a spread ranging from SOFR plus 5.5% to SOFR plus 6.5%. Total Leverage Ratio is defined as consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDA as calculated under the amended credit facility. The Amended Revolving Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a maximum Total Leverage Ratio of 4.50x through December 31, 2024, stepping down to 4.25x at March 31, 2025 and 4.00x at September 30, 2025. The financial covenants also include a maximum first lien net leverage ratio of 2.5x, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.0x, and a minimum liquidity coverage of $200 million of revolver availability and accessible cash.

This press release is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy the 2029 Secured Notes, nor shall there be any sale of the 2029 Secured Notes in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.

The offering included 34,285,715 shares of common stock at $0.35 per share, with warrants to purchase up to the same number of shares. The warrants are exercisable at $0.35 per share and expire five years after issuance. A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners acted as the sole placement agent for the offering. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The closing of Velo3D's public offering is a significant event that suggests a strategic move to strengthen the company's balance sheet. In the context of additive manufacturing, such a cash infusion can be pivotal for advancing technology development, scaling operations, or even funding further research. Moreover, the issuance of additional shares can dilute current shareholders but may also attract new investors looking for entry points into innovative manufacturing spaces.Investors and analysts must weigh the potential for technological breakthroughs against the risk of share dilution. Given the competitive landscape of additive manufacturing, Velo3D's capital raise could be a necessary step to maintain its edge. Stakeholders should keep an eye on how effectively this new capital is deployed and whether it translates into increased market share or technological advancements. Financial Analyst The exercise price of the warrants being equal to the offering price indicates Velo3D's assessment of its value proposition. It's important for potential investors to analyze the use of proceeds, as this could be telling of the company's future growth plans. The financing route through a public offering, as opposed to private placement or debt, suggests Velo3D seeks to maintain a specific capital structure, possibly to avoid additional interest obligations or to bring on a broader investor base.When examining such financial moves, one should scrutinize the after-effect of the offering's expenses on the net proceeds, further evaluating how this aligns with the company's projected cash burn rate and runway. Stakeholders must keep a close watch on the subsequent quarterly results to understand the impact of this offering on the company's financial health, especially in terms of earnings per share and return on equity. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the completion of the offering in accordance with the SEC’s regulations is crucial; it signals compliance and transparency, factors that are inherently reassuring for investors. Since the offering was conducted under an effective shelf registration statement, it indicates that Velo3D is positioned to take advantage of fundraising opportunities swiftly. This legal agility can be an advantage in fast-moving markets.Investors should be aware of the regulatory environment surrounding such offerings, including the limitations and disclosures required. Understanding these legal intricacies can provide insight into the company's governance quality and its management’s foresight in navigating the complex landscape of securities law. 04/12/2024 - 04:05 PM FREMONT, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Velo3D, Inc.

About Velo3D: Velo3D is a metal 3D printing technology company. 3D printing—also known as additive manufacturing (AM)—has a unique ability to improve the way high-value metal parts are built. However, legacy metal AM has been greatly limited in its capabilities since its invention almost 30 years ago. This has prevented the technology from being used to create the most valuable and impactful parts, restricting its use to specific niches where the limitations were acceptable. Velo3D has overcome these limitations so engineers can design and print the parts they want. The company’s solution unlocks a wide breadth of design freedom and enables customers in space exploration, aviation, power generation, energy, and semiconductor to innovate the future in their respective industries. Using Velo3D, these customers can now build mission-critical metal parts that were previously impossible to manufacture. The fully integrated solution includes the Flow print preparation software, the Sapphire family of printers, and the Assure quality control system—all of which are powered by Velo3D’s Intelligent Fusion manufacturing process. The company delivered its first Sapphire system in 2018 and has been a strategic partner to innovators such as SpaceX, Honeywell, Honda, Chromalloy, and Lam Research.

Eagle Pharmaceuticals Announces Receipt of Notification of Deficiency from Nasdaq Regarding Requirement to Timely File Annual Report on Form 10-K,2024-04-12T20:05:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Eagle Pharmaceuticals, Inc. received a deficiency notice from Nasdaq for failing to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K, risking delisting.

The company previously failed to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, leading to an extension until May 13, 2024, to regain compliance. Positive None. Negative Risk of delisting from Nasdaq due to failure to file required periodic reports with the SEC. Uncertainty regarding the company's ability to regain compliance with Nasdaq's listing requirements. Potential negative impact on the company's stock performance and investor confidence. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, Eagle Pharmaceuticals' delay in filing its annual Form 10-K and its earlier Form 10-Q represents a significant breach of Nasdaq's Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). This requirement is foundational to ensure transparency and timely access to financial information, which investors rely on to make informed decisions. The Notice of Deficiency is more than a procedural hiccup; it points to potential underlying issues within the company's financial reporting processes, internal controls, or even operational challenges that could be affecting its ability to meet reporting deadlines.Such situations often lead to increased scrutiny from the SEC as well as from investors and analysts. The company's admission that it is unlikely to meet the extended filing deadline exacerbates the situation. Should Eagle Pharmaceuticals fail to satisfy Nasdaq's requirements, a delisting would severely limit the stock's liquidity and accessibility, often leading to a loss in investor confidence and a decline in stock value. The option to request a hearing might buy time, but the uncertainty it introduces can be detrimental to shareholder value in the interim. Market Research Analyst Eagle Pharmaceuticals' situation has direct implications on market perception and investor sentiment. Typically, when a publicly traded company fails to file obligatory financial documents on time, it raises red flags about the reliability of its management and the integrity of its operations. Market participants may speculate about the severity of the undisclosed financial statements, leading to increased volatility in the company's stock price.Historically, companies that receive delisting notices tend to underperform in the market due to the negative signal it sends. Investors might anticipate the worst, such as financial distress or governance issues and adjust their portfolios accordingly. Eagle Pharmaceuticals will need to engage in a delicate balancing act, reassuring stakeholders of its commitment to resolving these issues while being transparent about the challenges it faces. If the company's securities are delisted, the stock would likely be relegated to over-the-counter transactions, which could result in reduced investor interest and diminished stock value. Financial Analyst Analyzing the financial implications of Eagle Pharmaceuticals' filing delay, it's clear that the delay is materially significant. In financial markets, delays in filing can often lead to speculation of restatements or worse, accounting irregularities. This can have a tangible impact on a company's credit standing and may lead to wider bid-ask spreads as market makers price in higher risks associated with the stock.Investors and creditors may become warier, potentially leading to higher borrowing costs or difficulty in securing future financing. For ongoing operations, this can translate into a more challenging environment for sustaining and growing the business, especially if capital expenditures or research and development activities depend on external funding. Moreover, if the issues leading to the filing delay are systemic, the company may face a long road to recovery that extends beyond the final filing of its financial reports. 04/12/2024 - 04:05 PM WOODCLIFF LAKE, N.J., April 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eagle Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: EGRX) (the “Company”) today announced that it received a notice (the “Notice”) on April 8, 2024 from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) advising the Company that due to the Company’s failure to timely file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the “Form 10-K”), with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) (the “Rule”), which requires the timely filing of all required periodic reports with the SEC. As previously disclosed, on November 27, 2023, the Company received a separate delinquency notification (the “Initial Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq advising the Company that due to the failure to timely file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 (the “Form 10-Q”), the Company is not in compliance with the Rule. In the Initial Notice, Nasdaq provided the Company 60 days, or until January 26, 2024, to submit to Nasdaq a plan to regain compliance with the Rule (the “Plan”). On February 8, 2024, following timely submission of the Plan, Nasdaq notified the Company that it was granted an extension of 180 calendar days from the due date of the Form 10-Q, or until May 13, 2024, to regain compliance with the Rule. The Company must submit an update to the Plan by April 23, 2024, to include the Company’s plans to file the Form 10-K, and the Company plans to include in such update that the Company believes it is unlikely that it will file the Form 10-Q or the Form 10-K by the May 13, 2024, extension deadline. Pursuant to the Initial Notice, if the Company fails to regain compliance prior to the expiration of such extension period, Nasdaq would provide written notification that the Company’s securities would be subject to delisting. However, in response to the Company’s updated Plan, Nasdaq may determine that the Company will not be able to become current in its filing obligations by the May 13, 2024, extension deadline and could accelerate the issuance of a delisting notice. In the event the Company receives such a delisting notice, the Company may request a hearing before an independent Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”). The hearing request would automatically stay any suspension or delisting action for 22 calendar days from the date of the delisting notification. In connection with the hearing request, the Company may request that the stay be extended through the conclusion of the hearings process and the expiration of any additional extension period granted by the Panel following the hearing. There can be no assurance that any hearing would be successful, that an extended stay or additional extension would be granted, that the Company will be able to regain compliance with the Rule or maintain compliance with the other continued listing requirements set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rules or that the Company will be able to continue its listing on Nasdaq.

Announces Notification to New York Stock Exchange of Intention to Voluntarily Delist Common Stock and Units Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Direct Selling Acquisition Corp. (DSAQ) has announced its intention to voluntarily delist its Common Stock and Units from the NYSE and transfer them to the Nasdaq Global Market. The Company has notified the NYSE of its decision and plans to file a Form 25 with the SEC for the delisting process. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The decision by Direct Selling Acquisition Corp. to delist from the NYSE in favor of a Nasdaq listing reflects a strategic move often associated with a desire for increased visibility among technology-centric and growth-oriented investors. Nasdaq is historically known for hosting companies in these sectors and is perceived to have a more entrepreneurial image compared to the NYSE.Transferring to Nasdaq could potentially lower listing costs and offer a set of listing requirements that are more aligned with the company's operational structure and growth phase. However, investors should be aware that such transitions can also introduce volatility in the short term as the market adjusts to the new exchange platform.In the longer run, the success of this move should be evaluated based on the liquidity of the stock, the shareholder base evolution and any changes in analyst coverage. If the company leverages Nasdaq's reputation effectively, it might enjoy enhanced visibility which could impact its stock performance positively. Market Research Analyst The shift to Nasdaq by Direct Selling Acquisition Corp. must be examined within the broader context of the company's market position and competitive strategy. This move can be indicative of the company's growth trajectory and its alignment with innovation-driven investors.One of the potential benefits of this move is the association with Nasdaq's global brand, which emphasizes technological prowess and future-facing businesses. This listing could help in branding the company as a forward-thinking player in the direct selling space, potentially attracting a new demographic of investors interested in businesses with a technological edge. 04/12/2024 - 04:15 PM Application Pending to Transfer Shares to Nasdaq Global Market PLANO, Texas, April 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Direct Selling Acquisition Corp. (NYSE: DSAQ) (the ""Company"") today announced its intention to voluntarily delist its Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the ""Common Stock"") and units, each consisting of one share of Class A common stock and one-half of one redeemable warrant (the ""Units"" and together with the Common Stock, the ""Securities"") from The New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE"") and, as previously announced, the Company has made an application to have its Securities quoted on the Nasdaq Global Market (""Nasdaq""). The Company provided notice of the voluntary delisting to NYSE on April 12, 2024, and intends to timely file a Form 25 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") to effect the delisting of its Securities on or about April 23, 2024. The Company anticipates thereafter filing a Form 8-A with the SEC to register its Common Stock and Units on an accelerated basis on Nasdaq. Although the timing of the Company's decision was driven in part by the determination it could soon fall out of compliance with NYSE listing standards, the Company has been evaluating its listing options for some time and has concluded that, for the Company, the management attention required to maintain compliance with NYSE listing standards, outweighs the benefits of being listed on NYSE. Eliminating the effort required to maintain compliance with NYSE listing standards will better enable the Company to focus on completing a business combination with Hunch Technologies Limited, a private limited company incorporated in Ireland with registered number 607449 (""PubCo""). The Company has applied to have its Common Stock and Units quoted on Nasdaq and expects that the Common Stock will be quoted on Nasdaq under the ticker symbols ""DSAQ"" and the Units will be quoted on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ""DSAQU"" on or about April 24, 2024, subject to the approval of Nasdaq. The Common Stock and Units will continue to trade on NYSE until that time under the ticker symbols ""DSAQ"" and ""DSAQ.U"", respectively. The Company expects that transferring its Common Stock and Units to Nasdaq will enable its investors to hold and trade its Securities without interruption. The Company will remain subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, following the delisting of its Securities from NYSE. Shareholders of the Company will not be required to exchange any Securities, and the Company expects electronic trading to be available without any material disruption. Ultimately, the Company's board of directors determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to voluntarily delist the Company's Securities from NYSE and move to the Nasdaq at this time.

MPT retains a 25% interest in the joint venture with an investment fund purchasing a 75% interest for $886 million. Underwritten lease base of $1.2 billion is validated through the sale transactions. Proceeds expected to be used for debt reduction and general corporate purposes. MPT's capital allocation strategy is on track to exceed the initial $2.0 billion target in liquidity transactions by 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst The transaction of Medical Properties Trust divesting the majority interest in Utah hospitals represents a significant liquidity event, netting a substantial $1.1 billion. This development profoundly impacts the company’s balance sheet, reducing leverage through the planned payoff of a $300 million Australian term loan and other credit facilities. Key financial ratios such as debt-to-equity will likely improve post-transaction, potentially leading to a more favorable credit rating and lower borrowing costs. However, investors should monitor whether the dilution of earnings from the sale could impact future dividends. Real Estate Investment Analyst By retaining a 25% stake in the new joint venture, Medical Properties Trust maintains exposure to the underlying real estate assets, which could be beneficial if the properties appreciate in value. However, the transaction terms with the institutional asset manager underline the importance of due diligence in real estate investments. The $886 million sale price corroborates MPT’s valuation, but the structure of the deal, including the lessee's purchase option and limited preferences granted to the Fund, introduces a complexity that requires a closer examination of future revenue streams and potential exit strategies for MPT. Market Strategist The strategic move by MPT to accelerate capital allocation indicates an aggressive approach to managing its asset portfolio, which could be interpreted positively by the market as a proactive management decision. However, there may be concerns regarding the sustainability of growth if significant portions of assets are divested. Investors should consider the implications of such liquidity transactions on the long-term asset base and revenue generation capabilities of MPT, especially in the evolving healthcare real estate market where asset values and lease terms could fluctuate. 04/12/2024 - 04:05 PM Generates Approximately $1.1 Billion of Total Cash Proceeds to MPT Brings Total Liquidity Transactions Year-to-Date to $1.6 Billion, or 80% of MPT’s Initial FY 2024 Target BIRMINGHAM, Ala.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Medical Properties Trust, Inc. (the “Company” or “MPT”) (NYSE: MPW) today announced that it has sold its interests in five Utah hospitals to a newly formed joint venture (the “Venture”) with an investment fund (the “Fund”) affiliated with a leading multi-strategy, multi-billion dollar institutional asset manager with a proven track record in real estate investments. MPT has retained an approximate 25% interest in the Venture and the Fund purchased an approximate 75% interest for $886 million, fully validating MPT’s underwritten lease base of approximately $1.2 billion. Simultaneous with the closing of this sale transaction, the Venture placed new non-recourse secured financing, providing $190 million of additional cash to MPT based on its share of the proceeds and further confirming underwritten asset values. Together, the two transactions delivered approximately $1.1 billion of immediate cash proceeds to MPT, before costs and reserves. The proceeds are expected to be used to reduce outstanding debt – including payment in full of the approximate $300 million Australian term loan due 2024 and repayment of borrowings under its revolving credit facility – and for general corporate purposes. Edward K. Aldag, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer said, “MPT’s approach to underwriting hospital real estate has once again been validated by highly sophisticated third-party participants in a broadening private market for real hospital assets. Our primary focus remains on accelerating our capital allocation strategy, and we are now confident that we will exceed our initial target of $2.0 billion in liquidity transactions in 2024 based on the valuations achieved on recent transactions and the terms we are actively negotiating for additional transactions.” As previously reported, the Utah lessee (an affiliate of CommonSpirit Health) may acquire the leased real estate at a price equal to the greater of fair market value and the approximate $1.2 billion lease base at the fifth or tenth anniversary of the 2023 master lease commencement. MPT granted certain limited and conditional preferences to the Fund based on the possible exercise price of the lessee’s purchase option.

Allego Announces Receipt of NYSE Notice of Non-Compliance With Continued Listing Standards,2024-04-12T20:05:00.000Z,Low,Negative,"Allego N.V.

(NYSE: ALLG) received a notice of non-compliance from the NYSE due to its share price falling below $1.00 for a consecutive 30 trading-day period. The company has six months to regain compliance by increasing its share price. If not met, the NYSE may initiate delisting procedures. Allego intends to address the deficiency and is exploring options, including a reverse share split. Positive None. Negative Allego received a notice of non-compliance from the NYSE due to its share price falling below $1.00, which could lead to delisting if not rectified within six months. Financial Analyst Allego's notification from the NYSE regarding non-compliance with listing standards due to its share price falling below $1 signifies a critical juncture for the company's financial health. It is well-established that maintaining a stock price above this threshold is important not only for compliance but also for investor confidence. A sub-dollar share price often triggers a negative perception, signaling possible underlying financial weaknesses or uncertainties in the company's future prospects.In analyzing the company's situation, the six-month cure period granted is a standard procedural lifeline, which provides Allego with some time to rectify the situation. The contemplation of a reverse share split is a common strategy under such circumstances, effectively reducing the number of shares in circulation to boost the share price. However, this approach is not without risk as it can be perceived as a cosmetic fix absent underlying business improvements and it often dilutes shareholder value. The market's reaction to the announcement and the subsequent steps taken by Allego will be important in determining the short-term stock performance. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Allego's position as a leading electric vehicle charging network in Europe is pivotal. The EV sector has been experiencing rapid growth, driven by environmental concerns and policies encouraging a shift away from fossil fuels. However, the market for EV infrastructure is highly competitive and capital intensive. Allego's current share price woes could reflect market apprehension about the company's ability to sustain capital expenditures and attain profitability amidst stiff competition.Investors typically seek stable investments and the NYSE's notice could potentially alarm institutional and retail investors alike, influencing trading behaviors. There are also implications for Allego's ability to attract future capital at favorable terms. An in-depth market analysis would reveal the competitive landscape and potential investor sentiment shifts. This, combined with the company's strategic response, could provide an indication of Allego's resilience and long-term market positioning. 04/12/2024 - 04:05 PM ARNHEM, Netherlands--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Allego N.V. (“Allego” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ALLG), a leading pan-European public electric vehicle fast and ultra-fast charging network, today announced that it has received written notice dated March 14, 2024 from the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) indicating that the Company is not in compliance with Section 802.01C of the NYSE’s continued listing standards because the average closing price of Allego’s ordinary shares was less than US$1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period. Under the NYSE’s rules, the Company has six months following receipt of the notice to regain compliance with the minimum share price requirement. The Company can regain compliance at any time during the cure period if on the last trading day of any calendar month during the cure period the Company has a closing share price of at least US$1.00 and an average closing share price of at least US$1.00 over the 30 trading-day period ending on the last trading day of that month. In the event that at the expiration of the six-month cure period, both a US$1.00 closing share price on the last trading day of the cure period and a US$1.00 average closing share price over the 30 trading-day period ending on the last trading day of the cure period are not attained, the NYSE will commence suspension and delisting procedures. Allego has advised the NYSE of its intention to cure the deficiency within the applicable cure period and is considering all available options in this regard, which may include, if necessary, effecting a reverse share split, subject to board and shareholder approval. The NYSE notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s ordinary shares on the NYSE, subject to the Company’s compliance with the NYSE’s other continued listing requirements, and does not affect the Company’s ongoing business operations or its reporting obligations under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. About Allego Allego is a leading provider of electric vehicle charging solutions, dedicated to accelerating the transition to electric mobility with 100% renewable energy.

Rothman will retire in August 2024 or at the 2024 annual meeting. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent activities of Quantum Corporation, specifically the sale of service inventory assets and the reduction of their outstanding debt, signal a strategic move to bolster their financial position. By liquidating certain assets and using the proceeds to pay down debt, they have effectively reduced their interest expense obligations and improved liquidity. This action should positively influence their creditworthiness and potentially benefit stock valuations, as markets generally react favorably to stronger balance sheets and proactive debt management.The implementation of a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system represents a substantial long-term investment in operational efficiency. Though the initial capital expenditures were undoubtedly significant, the anticipated reduction in future capital expenditures and the promise of operational efficiencies could lead to margin improvements and a more streamlined workflow. The impacts of such systems are typically observed over several quarters, if not years, so investors should monitor the company's future earnings reports for evidence of the system's effectiveness. Legal Expert The stay of suspension granted by Nasdaq following Quantum's delisting notice is a procedural development with potential legal and financial ramifications. The outcome of the scheduled hearing could affect Quantum's ability to attract new capital and maintain investor confidence. If the Nasdaq Hearings Panel grants an extension and Quantum ultimately regains compliance, it could restore investor trust in the company's governance and regulatory adherence. Conversely, failure to meet listing criteria could lead to delisting, adversely impacting the stock's liquidity and the company's public perception. Market Research Analyst Quantum's transition, as indicated by the departure of a long-serving board member and the search for a new independent director, introduces a variable in corporate governance that may influence the company's strategic direction. While board transitions are a natural aspect of corporate evolution, they can also reflect deeper shifts in company strategy and investor expectations. The market will be watching closely to see how this change plays out regarding Quantum's focus on new products and operations, which could signal a pivot or intensification of their core business strategy. 04/12/2024 - 04:05 PM SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Quantum Corporation (Nasdaq: QMCO), a leader in solutions for AI and unstructured data, provided additional updates on its business. Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2024 Liquidity Update Quantum’s unaudited cash and long-term debt balances as of March 31, 2024, are provided below: Cash and cash equivalents were $26.1 million. Outstanding term loan debt was $87.9 million, Outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility was $26.6 million, Total interest expense for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, was $4.1 million. Quantum has not completed preparation of its financial statements for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. The unaudited financials presented in this press release for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, are based on preliminary estimates and are subject to adjustment. Improving Working Capital and Debt Reduction Subsequent to the Fiscal Fourth Quarter end, on April 2, 2024, Quantum completed a transaction with a partner to provide turnkey, third-party logistics, and asset management for its Global Services operations. As part of this arrangement, Quantum sold certain service inventory assets for an approximate payment of $15 million. Quantum used proceeds from the disposition of these assets to improve its financial flexibility, including paying down approximately $12.3 million of its existing debt. This transaction is consistent with the Company’s broader efforts to prioritize certain financial and business projects targeting improvements to working capital, acceleration of new products and a more focused business. This transaction is not reflected in our Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2024 liquidity update provided earlier. New ERP System Implemented After a three-year process, Quantum has completed implementation of its new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, and as a result, expects to see a material reduction in associated capital expenditures in the future. The new ERP system is also expected to result in future operational efficiencies throughout the organization. Nasdaq Update Following the Company’s prior announcement on March 25, 2024, The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (Nasdaq) granted Quantum’s request to stay the suspension of delisting of its common stock pending a scheduled hearing on May 14, 2024, with the Nasdaq Hearings Panel.

The land package comprises of exploration licenses (EL) and exploration license applications (ELA). It includes both early-stage and advanced-stage exploration targets with high-grade epithermal vein and porphyry-style mineralisation present. The Arau Project consists of two exploration licenses, located in the Kainantu region, and includes the Mt. Victor Prospect, where previous drilling found a multiple phase intrusion complex hosting copper and gold mineralisation. The Wild Dog Project consists of one granted exploration license, EL 2761, and one exploration license application, ELA 2516, located on the island of New Britain and about 50 km southwest of Rabaul and Kokopo, PNG. The Kesar Creek Project consists of one exploration license, EL 2711, and is contiguous with the K92 Mining Inc. tenements. In Australia, Great Pacific Gold began with two, 100% owned, high-grade gold projects called the Lauriston and Golden Mountain Projects, and has since acquired a large area of granted and application tenements containing further epizonal (low-temperature) high-grade gold mineralisation and associated intrusion-related gold mineralization all in the state of Victoria, Australia. The Great Pacific Gold land package, assembled over a multi-year period, notably includes the Lauriston Project which is a 535 sq. km property immediately to the south of and within the same geological framework that hosts Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd’s Fosterville Gold Mine and associated exploration tenements. The Golden Mountain Project is an intrusion-related gold project on the edge of the Strathbogie granite and occurs at the northern end of the Walhalla Gold Belt. The acquired projects include the epizonal gold Providence Project containing the Reedy Creek goldfield which adjoins the Southern Cross Gold’s Sunday Creek exploration project and a large group of recently consolidated granted tenements called the Walhalla Gold Belt Project, which contain a variety of epizonal and intrusion related style gold mineralisation. Additionally, Great Pacific Gold has another gold-focused project called the Moormbool project which has epizonal style gold mineralisation and associated potential intrusion-related gold mineralisation, as well as the Beechworth Project occurs in the northeast of the state and contains intrusion related and mesozonal gold mineralization.

Negative Net income per share (diluted) for the first quarter of 2024 decreased by 19% compared to the same period in 2023. Core net income per share (diluted) for the first quarter of 2024 decreased by 61% over the same period in 2023. Non-interest-bearing deposits declined by 8% from March 31, 2023. The efficiency ratio increased to 77.24% for the first quarter of 2024, compared to 45.96% for the same period last year. Financial Analyst Examining Hingham Savings' reported earnings, a notable 19% dip in diluted net income per share and a significant 61% fall in core net income per share for Q1 2024 relative to the prior year stands out. These declines highlight potential margin pressures and could signal headwinds in maintaining profitability, which is a concern for investors. The drop in core net income, which excludes variable gains from equity securities, may be indicative of the bank's underlying earning capacity and is a red flag. As interest rates have risen, the Bank's increased cost of wholesale funding sources seems to be a contributing factor to the reduced net interest margin, which is a critical metric in the banking industry. The bank's focus on recruiting and operational efficiency could be viewed as strategic moves to strengthen their market position and manage expenses in a challenging interest rate environment. Market Research Analyst The strategic expansion into new markets, such as San Francisco, coupled with increased loan origination activities in the multifamily commercial real estate sector, points to Hingham Savings' growth-oriented trajectory. However, the mix of growth and decline in different deposit categories suggests a shifting customer base or changes in customer preferences. The efforts in hiring new relationship managers and marketing adjustments could be seen as proactive steps to enhance customer relations and deposit growth. The Bank's balance sheet stability and adherence to the Massachusetts Depositors Insurance Fund may offer peace of mind to stakeholders during volatile economic periods and could be a competitive advantage in attracting and retaining customers. Banking Industry Analyst The Bank's modest asset growth and the performance of its loan portfolio, particularly in the housing sector, are noteworthy. Solid asset quality, as reflected by the low percentage of non-performing assets, suggests that Hingham Savings is maintaining strong credit risk management practices. The growth in book value per share is a positive sign, yet the lack of a special dividend in 2023 and the drop in regular dividends may alter shareholder sentiment, potentially affecting the stock's attractiveness. The operational performance metrics such as the efficiency ratio indicate a trend towards increased operational costs in relation to net income; understanding how this will be managed going forward is key for evaluating the bank's long-term operational sustainability. 04/12/2024 - 04:01 PM HINGHAM, Mass., April 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HINGHAM INSTITUTION FOR SAVINGS (NASDAQ: HIFS), Hingham, Massachusetts announced results for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. Earnings Net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 was $6,868,000 or $3.17 per share basic and $3.13 per share diluted, as compared to $8,510,000 or $3.96 per share basic and $3.87 per share diluted for the same period last year. The Bank’s annualized return on average equity for the first quarter of 2024 was 6.63%, and the annualized return on average assets was 0.63%, as compared to 8.67% and 0.82% for the same period last year. Net income per share (diluted) for the first quarter of 2024 decreased by 19% compared to the same period in 2023. Core net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, which represents net income excluding the after-tax gains on equity securities, both realized and unrealized, was $2,213,000 or $1.02 per share basic and $1.01 per share diluted, as compared to $5,744,000 or $2.67 per share basic and $2.61 per share diluted for the same period last year. The Bank’s annualized core return on average equity for the first quarter of 2024 was 2.14% and the annualized core return on average assets was 0.20%, as compared to 5.85% and 0.56% for the same period last year. Core net income per share (diluted) for the first quarter of 2024 decreased by 61% over the same period in 2023. See Page 9 for a Non-GAAP reconciliation between Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) net income and core net income. In calculating core net income, the Bank did not make any adjustments other than those relating to after-tax gains on equity securities, realized and unrealized. In the first quarter of 2024, both net income and core net income were positively impacted by lower income tax expense driven by excess tax benefit associated with the exercise of stock options and the revision of income tax estimates. Balance Sheet Total assets increased to $4.529 billion at March 31, 2024, representing 4% annualized growth year-to-date and 8% growth from March 31, 2023. Net loans increased to $3.938 billion at March 31, 2024, representing 2% annualized growth year-to-date and 7% growth from March 31, 2023. Origination activity was concentrated in the Boston and Washington D.C. markets and remained focused on stabilized multifamily commercial real estate and multifamily construction. The Bank continues to evaluate new opportunities in the San Francisco market, where interest in acquisitions and refinancing activity from the Bank’s customers began to pick up in early 2024. As noted below, asset quality remained strong. Retail and business deposits were $1.893 billion at March 31, 2024, representing 7% annualized growth year-to-date and a 5% decline from March 31, 2023. Non-interest-bearing deposits, included in retail and business deposits, were $347.4 million at March 31, 2024, representing 10% annualized growth year-to-date and an 8% decline from March 31, 2023. Growth in non-interest bearing and money market balances reflected the Bank’s focus on developing and deepening deposit relationships with new and existing commercial and non-profit customers. Investments in new relationship managers in late 2023, combined with changes to our marketing approach, began to show some initial results. The Bank also added a new relationship manager in its Specialized Deposit Group in San Francisco during the quarter, as well as a specialist that supports the delivery of cash management services to our commercial customers. The Bank continues to recruit actively for talented retail and commercial bankers in Boston, Washington, and San Francisco, particularly as respected competitors have exited these markets or merged with larger regional banks. The stability of the Bank’s balance sheet, as well as full and unlimited deposit insurance through the Bank’s participation in the Massachusetts Depositors Insurance Fund, continues to be appealing to customers in times of uncertainty. Wholesale funds, which includes Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, brokered deposits, and listing service deposits were $2.185 billion at March 31, 2024, representing 1% annualized growth year-to-date and 22% growth from March 31, 2023, as the Bank continued to manage its wholesale funding mix to optimize the cost of funds while adding duration where appropriate. Wholesale deposits, which include brokered and listing service time deposits, were $500.4 million at March 31, 2024, representing 10% annualized growth year-to-date and a 6% decline from March 31, 2023. Borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank totaled $1.685 billion at March 31, 2024, representing a 2% annualized decline from December 31, 2023, and 33% growth from March 31, 2023. As of March 31, 2024, the Bank maintained an additional $677.8 million in immediately available borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston and the Federal Reserve Bank, in addition to $373.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. Book value per share was $190.07 as of March 31, 2024, representing a 3% annualized growth year-to-date and 4% growth from March 31, 2023. In addition to the increase in book value per share, the Bank declared $2.52 in dividends per share since March 31, 2023. On March 27, 2024, the Bank declared a regular cash dividend of $0.63 per share. This dividend will be paid on May 15, 2024 to stockholders of record as of May 6, 2024. This was the Bank’s 121st consecutive quarterly dividend. The Bank has also generally declared special cash dividends in each of the last twenty-nine years, typically in the fourth quarter, but did not declare a special dividend in 2023. The Bank sets the level of the special dividend based on the Bank’s capital requirements and the prospective return on other capital allocation options, particularly the incremental return on capital from new loan originations. This may result in special dividends, if any, significantly above or below the regular quarterly dividend. Future regular and special dividends will be considered by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. Operational Performance Metrics The net interest margin for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 decreased 4 basis points to 0.85%, as compared to 0.89% in the quarter ended December 31, 2023. It was stable on a monthly basis throughout the quarter. This was primarily the result of an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, driven primarily by an increase in the cost of the Bank’s wholesale funding sources and higher rates on the Bank’s retail and commercial deposits, partially offset by an increase in the yield on loans from the prior quarter. The increase in the yield on loans was driven by both new loan originations at higher rates and the repricing of existing adjustable rate loans. The pace of net interest margin compression slowed substantially as compared to prior quarters. The net interest margin appears to be stabilizing at this point, as short-term market rates have remained stable, the pace of increase in the Bank’s deposit costs has slowed or reversed in some products, and asset yields continue to climb slowly and sustainably. The net interest margin for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 decreased 61 basis points to 0.85%, as compared to 1.46% for the same period last year. The Bank experienced a substantial increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities when compared to the prior year. This was driven primarily by the repricing of the Bank’s funding sources. During this period, the increase in the cost of funds was partially offset by a higher yield on interest-earning assets, driven primarily by an increase in the interest on reserves held at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, a higher Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston stock dividend and an increase in the yield on loans. Key credit and operational metrics remained strong in the first quarter. At March 31, 2024, non-performing assets totaled 0.04% of total assets, compared to 0.03% at December 31, 2023 and 0.01% at March 31, 2023. Non-performing loans as a percentage of the total loan portfolio totaled 0.04% at March 31, 2024, compared to 0.04% at December 31, 2023 and 0.01% at March 31, 2023. The Bank did not record any charge-offs in the first three months of 2024 or 2023. All non-performing assets and loans cited above were and are residential, owner-occupant loans. The Bank did not have any delinquent or non-performing commercial real estate loans as of March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, or March 31, 2023. The Bank did not own any foreclosed property at March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 or March 31, 2023. The efficiency ratio, as defined on page 5 below, increased to 77.24% for the first quarter of 2024, as compared to 45.96% for the same period last year. Operating expenses as a percentage of average assets fell to 0.67% for the first quarter of 2024, as compared to 0.68% for the same period last year. As the efficiency ratio can be significantly influenced by the level of net interest income, the Bank utilizes these paired figures together to assess its operational efficiency over time. During periods of significant net interest income volatility, the efficiency ratio in isolation may over or understate the underlying operational efficiency of the Bank. The Bank remains focused on reducing waste through an ongoing process of continuous improvement and standard work that supports operational leverage. Chairman Robert H. Gaughen Jr. stated, “Returns on equity and assets in the first quarter of 2024 were significantly lower than our long-term performance, reflecting the challenge from the increase in short-term interest rates over the last twenty-four months and a historically long and deep inversion of the yield curve. These conditions have posed a significant - albeit temporary - challenge to our business model. Our core business has been particularly challenged during this period and our investment operations have been critical to sustaining growth in book value per share in this environment. We are cautiously optimistic that this challenge will fade over this year. To the extent we can capitalize on the inverted yield curve and reduce liability sensitivity slightly via our wholesale funding activities, we will do so. This normalization of the yield curve will eventually allow us to achieve more satisfactory returns as we obtain higher rates on new and adjusting loans and incremental funding pressure abates. While the current market environment has been extraordinarily challenging, the Bank’s business model has been built over time to compound shareholder capital over an economic cycle. During all such periods, we remain focused on careful capital allocation, defensive underwriting and disciplined cost control - the building blocks for compounding shareholder capital through all stages of the economic cycle. These remain constant, regardless of the macroeconomic environment in which we operate. I believe that over the past twenty-four months we have retained this focus.” The Bank’s quarterly financial results are summarized in this earnings release, but shareholders are encouraged to read the Bank’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which is generally available several weeks after the earnings release. The Bank expects to file Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) on or about May 8, 2024.

Since February 28, 2024, the company has bought back a total of 21,103,441 shares for €534,386,526.50, holding 4.05% of the total issued share capital as of April 11, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Observing Stellantis N.V.'s share buyback initiative, it's pivotal to assess the implications on shareholder value. The repurchase of shares can often lead to an elevation in earnings per share (EPS) due to the reduced share count, potentially bumping up the stock price as well. However, it's essential to balance this view by considering the company's opportunity cost of investing the €534 million elsewhere. Given the scale of the buyback, this strategic move could posit confidence in Stellantis' internal valuation, possibly hinting at the management's belief that the stock is undervalued.Moreover, one might probe into the company's capital allocation strategy. The sizable treasury holding after the buyback, at 4.05% of the total issued share capital, might serve as a buffer for future strategic actions, such as mergers and acquisitions (M&A), financial flexibility in downturns, or to offset the dilutive effect of stock options. The exact motivations can only be speculated, but the financial health of Stellantis, along with broader automotive industry trends, will be the guiding light for investors interpreting this action. Market Research Analyst Digging into the automotive sector's recent performance, a share buyback of this magnitude by Stellantis could reflect broader industry dynamics. It's essential to contextualize this activity within the sector's current headwinds, like supply chain disruptions and the transition to electric vehicles (EVs). If peers are also engaging in buybacks or showing similar patterns of strong balance sheets and cash flow, it could signal a sector-wide bullish sentiment, which might affect the market's perception of future growth prospects.It’s also intriguing to see the distribution of repurchases across different trading venues, hinting at a meticulous execution strategy to minimize market impact. These details may not always capture headlines but can offer insights into how well a company's financial team is managing market operations, which could ultimately influence investor sentiment. 04/12/2024 - 02:08 PM Weekly Report (April 5-11, 2024) on the First Tranche of Stellantis 2024 Share Buyback Program AMSTERDAM, April 12, 2024 - Stellantis N.V.

(NASDAQ: AQST) (the “Company” or “Aquestive”), a pharmaceutical company advancing medicines to bring meaningful improvement to patients' lives through innovative science and delivery technologies, today announced a poster presentation highlighting the crossover study for the Company’s product candidate, Libervant™ (diazepam) Buccal Film for treatment of children with epilepsy aged two to five, will be presented at the 76th Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) in Denver from April 13 to 18, offering both in-person attendance and live online participation in a hybrid format. “This study underscores our ongoing dedication to enhancing the well-being of individuals battling epilepsy,” said Dan Barber, Aquestive President and Chief Executive Officer. “When it comes to the treatment of seizure clusters in pediatric patients with epilepsy between ages two to five, we believe Libervant, as an oral alternative to existing device-based products, will be well-received by this patient population.” Poster Title: Crossover Study Evaluating the Effect of Seizures on the Absorption of Diazepam From a Buccal Film Formulation in Children With EpilepsyPoster Session 9: Epilepsy/Clinical Neurophysiology (EEG): Anti-seizure Medications: Mechanisms, Pharmacokinetics, and Urgent ApplicationsPresentation Time: Wednesday, April 17, from 8:00 AM - 9:00 AM.Lead Author: Gary Slatko, MD, Steve Wargacki, PhD, Michael A. Rogawski, MD, PhD The abstract is available online at American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting, as well on the Company’s website at the following Link. About Libervant Libervant is a buccally, or inside of the cheek, administered film formulation of diazepam, a benzodiazepine intended for the acute treatment of intermittent, stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity (i.e., seizure clusters, acute repetitive seizures) that are distinct from a patient’s usual seizure pattern. Aquestive developed Libervant as an alternative to the device-based products currently available for patients with refractory epilepsy, including a rectal gel and nasal spray products. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted tentative approval for Libervant for treatment of these epilepsy patients 12 years of age and older, with U.S. market access for Libervant for this age group of patients subject to the expiration of the existing orphan drug market exclusivity of a previously FDA approved drug scheduled to expire in January 2027. The FDA accepted Aquestive's New Drug Application (NDA) for Libervant (diazepam) Buccal Film for the acute treatment of intermittent, stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity (i.e., seizure clusters, acute repetitive seizures) in patients between two and five years of age in September 2023. Diastat (diazepam) Rectal Gel is the only FDA approved treatment currently available to this pediatric patient population for this indication. Based on the latest information available to the Company, the review of the Libervant NDA for pediatric patients aged two to five remains on track and there are currently no outstanding information requests from the FDA. The NDA for Libervant was assigned a PDUFA target action date of April 28, 2024. About Aquestive TherapeuticsAquestive is a pharmaceutical company advancing medicines to bring meaningful improvement to patients' lives through innovative science and delivery technologies. We are developing orally administered products to deliver complex molecules, providing novel alternatives to invasive and inconvenient standard of care therapies.

U. S. Steel Stockholders Approve Transaction with Nippon Steel Corporation (NSC),2024-04-12T17:45:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"United States Steel  (NYSE: X) stockholders approve merger with Nippon Steel , creating 'Best Steelmaker with World-Leading Capabilities'. Over 98% of shares voted in favor, representing a significant step towards completion of the transaction.","U. S. Steel Stockholders Approve Transaction with Nippon Steel Corporation (NSC) Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary United States Steel (NYSE: X) stockholders approve merger with Nippon Steel , creating 'Best Steelmaker with World-Leading Capabilities'. Over 98% of shares voted in favor, representing a significant step towards completion of the transaction. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The merger between United States Steel Corporation and Nippon Steel Corporation marks a significant event within the steel industry. The sector is traditionally cyclical, often directly linked to broader economic trends, such as construction and automotive demand. A merger of this scale is poised to reshape market dynamics by potentially altering the competitive landscape, supply chains and pricing power.From a market standpoint, the combined entity aims to create a more robust competitive force, particularly against unfair competition cited from regions like China. Strengthened capabilities and technological innovation could also position the new company as a front-runner in the production of greener steel—a growing segment due to increased environmental regulations and a shift towards sustainable practices. The potential for enhanced efficiency and cost-savings through economies of scale is substantial.However, investors and stakeholders should monitor integration risks and the possible impact on pricing and supply within the North American market and globally. The consolidation of two large players could invite regulatory scrutiny, particularly concerning antitrust laws and this process could impact the timeline and finalization of the merger. Financial Analyst With over 98% of voting shares backing the merger, this signals a strong consensus among U. S. Steel stockholders that the merger is expected to yield positive financial outcomes. The anticipation of these synergies may spark investor optimism, potentially affecting the stock's performance in the short to medium term.It’s important to contextualize this merger within the steel industry's fundamental financial metrics, such as EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) margins and CapEx (Capital Expenditures) requirements. Given U. S. Steel's commitment to invest in greener steel and the potential cost advantages of the merger, there could be positive implications for the company’s long-term financial health, including margin improvement and better capital allocation.However, the cost and complexity of such a transaction should not be underestimated. Investors should consider the one-time costs of the merger, potential financing requirements and the long-term debt profile of the combined company. Transparency in the final voting results and subsequent regulatory filings will be key for evaluating the full financial impact. Legal Expert In transactions of this magnitude, the legal framework surrounding both antitrust and cross-border consolidation will be areas of close examination. The commitment to maintain the U. S. Steel name and its Pittsburgh headquarters suggests a strategy to appease potential domestic regulatory concerns about preserving American industry and jobs. However, the international component introduces a layer of complexity, as both U.S. and Japanese regulations, as well as potentially other jurisdictions, come into play.The involvement of top-tier legal advisors like Milbank LLP and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz indicates a proactive approach to navigating the legal intricacies of this deal. Stakeholders should anticipate a thorough regulatory review, which will assess the transaction's implications on competition and market health. The approval of the merger by the stockholders is just one step in a multi-stage process that includes regulatory compliance and may influence the operational aspects and finalization timeline of the deal. 04/12/2024 - 01:45 PM Combination Will Create “Best Steelmaker with World-Leading Capabilities” Stockholders’ Approval Represents Key Milestone Toward Completion of Transaction PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Following the special meeting of stockholders (the “Special Meeting”) held earlier today, United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) (“U. S. Steel”) announced that, based on the preliminary vote count, U. S. Steel stockholders overwhelmingly voted to approve the proposed merger with Nippon Steel Corporation (NSC) (TSE: 5401). More than 98% of the shares voted at the Special Meeting, representing approximately 71% of the shares of U. S. Steel common stock issued and outstanding as of the record date for the Special Meeting, were voted in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. David B. Burritt, President & Chief Executive Officer of U. S. Steel commented on the vote, “The overwhelming support from our stockholders is a clear endorsement that they recognize the compelling rationale for our transaction with NSC. This is an important milestone as we progress toward completing the transaction. We are one step closer to bringing together the best of our companies and moving forward together as the ‘Best Steelmaker with World-Leading Capabilities.’ This transaction truly represents the best path forward for all of U. S. Steel’s stakeholders – union and non-union employees, customers, communities and stockholders – and for the United States and our home in Pennsylvania. By creating the best steelmaker in the world, we will have a stronger company to sustain our talented employees and fulfill all commitments to them, including all of the obligations under the agreements in place with our unions.

The breach exposed sensitive data including usernames, hashed passwords, names, contact details, partial social security numbers, dates of birth, and secret questions and answers. This incident raises concerns about the security measures in place and the potential repercussions for affected customers and the company's reputation. Positive The press release highlights a critical issue affecting a vast number of customers, which could prompt Comcast to enhance their security measures. Negative The data breach of over 35.8 million customers exposes sensitive information, potentially leading to identity theft and other forms of fraud. This incident could significantly damage Comcast's reputation, leading to a loss of customer trust and potentially affecting subscriber numbers and revenue. The breach may result in legal actions and regulatory scrutiny that could impose financial liabilities and necessitate costly security upgrades. Cybersecurity Analyst The data breach at Comcast's Xfinity service represents a significant event with potential repercussions for both the company and its stakeholders. In terms of customer trust and retention, this breach could lead to a decline as users may feel their data is not safe, thereby impacting future revenue. Moreover, there might be substantial costs associated with remediation efforts, legal fees and potential fines that could affect Comcast's financial position.Another aspect to consider is the regulatory impact. With data protection laws such as GDPR in Europe and various state laws in the U.S., Comcast could face regulatory action including hefty fines. This incident also emphasizes the increasing importance of investing in robust cybersecurity measures, which has become a critical factor for investors when evaluating a company's long-term prospects. Financial Analyst From a financial standpoint, the breach might have a tangential impact on Comcast's stock price due to anticipated costs and potential loss of customers. Investors are often sensitive to such news as it can signal underlying issues in a company's risk management practices. While it's difficult to predict the exact financial impact, historical data from similar incidents suggests that there might be a temporary dip in stock value followed by a gradual recovery as the company implements corrective measures.Long-term effects depend on the effectiveness of Comcast's response and its ability to restore consumer confidence. Swift and transparent action can mitigate some negative impacts, however, if customers perceive the response as inadequate, the damage to the brand could have lingering effects on its market performance. Legal Expert In light of the breach, Comcast may face class-action lawsuits which can be costly and damage the company's reputation. It is essential to analyze the legal implications and the adequacy of Comcast's data protection measures prior to the breach. If found lacking, they could be deemed negligent, leading to further legal troubles.Comcast will also need to navigate the intricate landscape of state and federal data breach regulations. They must ensure they are compliant with breach notification laws, which vary by jurisdiction and can affect the company's legal standing. The breach will likely result in increased scrutiny from both regulators and the public, necessitating a careful legal strategy moving forward. 04/12/2024 - 12:15 PM NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / April 12, 2024 / Xfinity/Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) recently suffered a massive data breach affecting more than 35.8 million Xfinity customers.

The LTI 2024, linked to performance relative to peers, will vest at the end of a three-year period. Positive The increase in management's share ownership through equity awards can strengthen alignment between management's incentives and shareholder interests, potentially leading to more focused leadership on company performance. The detailed and structured award plans (STI, Project Awards, Special Awards, LTI) indicate a clear strategy to incentivize key executives, which might enhance their commitment to achieving the company's goals. The LTI plan is performance-based, specifically tied to the company's relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) against its peer group, which could foster a competitive and performance-oriented culture within the company. Negative The issuance of a large number of shares for management compensation might lead to shareholder dilution, potentially affecting the stock price negatively. The dependency on relative TSR for the LTI plan introduces significant risk, as failing to outperform the peer group could result in non-vesting of the awards, which might not effectively motivate the intended long-term value creation. Compensation Consultant The announcement by VEON Ltd. regarding increased management ownership through equity incentive-based compensation reflects an influential trend within corporate governance aiming to strengthen the alignment between management's interests and shareholder value. This approach is commonly adopted to incentivize executives, potentially improving company performance and positively influencing stock price, as incentivized management might be more driven to meet performance targets. The award details reveal significant share allocations, particularly to top executives, which could enhance their commitment to the company's long-term success. However, investors should observe that such incentive programs could dilute existing shares, albeit this effect might be offset if the incentivized performance leads to value creation surpassing the dilution impact. Additionally, the linkage of Long-Term Incentives to relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) is a practice that provides a performance-based reward system, connecting executive compensation to shareholder gains directly. Corporate Governance Analyst In scrutinizing VEON's use of equity awards from a corporate governance perspective, the requirement for the Group Executive Committee (GEC) to hold a minimum level of shares aligns their financial interests with those of long-term investors. Such policies can be seen as a measure to prevent short-termism in management decisions. The two-year holding period for the Short-Term Incentive (STI) and the one-year holding for the Project Award further reinforce this objective, suggesting a commitment to sustained company performance.However, the effectiveness of these corporate governance mechanisms depends on the fair determination of performance metrics and the transparency of their assessment. The relative TSR as a vesting condition for the LTI is one such metric that can be tricky to evaluate, as it requires a comparative analysis to a peer group. This peer group should be carefully selected to accurately reflect the competitive environment in which VEON operates. Ensuring the peer group is relevant and the performance metrics are stringent are essential to safeguard the interests of shareholders and prevent potential windfall gains to executives. Financial Analyst From a financial analysis standpoint, the share awards system employed by VEON indicates a forward-looking investment in management that could potentially result in heightened operational efficiency and strategic decision-making. The STI and LTI award allocations need to be factored into the company’s expense forecasts, as they represent a form of non-cash compensation that will be reflected in the company’s financial statements. Investors often look favorably upon companies that demonstrate a strong culture of performance-based incentives, as this can be indicative of robust future earnings potential. Nonetheless, it is critical to monitor the company's performance over the vesting period to ensure that these incentive programs are indeed translating into tangible value creation for shareholders. 04/12/2024 - 12:15 PM Amsterdam, 12 April 2024 – VEON Ltd. (NASDAQ: VEON, Euronext Amsterdam: VEON), a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services, today announces an increase in management’s ownership of VEON shares through awards under its existing equity incentive-based compensation plans.

The research agenda covers interconnectedness of ESG factors, workforce disruption, emerging markets' just transition, and global health concerns. Positive None. Negative None. Sustainability and ESG Analyst The exploration of ESG criteria in the investment landscape has become a pivotal component in assessing corporate risk and opportunity. The integration of environmental, social and governance factors has shifted from a niche interest to a core strategy for institutional investors seeking to align financial performance with societal outcomes. The article's emphasis on interconnectedness underscores the complexity of ESG considerations, which can no longer be siloed into discrete categories. Climate change, for example, has far-reaching implications beyond environmental impact, influencing everything from human rights to financial stability.Considering biodiversity, it's essential to understand nature-related financing and its potential for reshaping investment strategies. The focus on water scarcity and pollution exemplifies the intricate relationship between natural resources and economic viability. The United Nations Environment Programme's estimation of the financial needs for adaptation in developing countries suggests that ESG-focused investments could be both a moral imperative and a lucrative opportunity. However, the feasibility and effectiveness of mechanisms like debt-for-nature swaps in promoting sustainable development merit rigorous analysis to ensure they align with both investor interests and conservation goals.Moving to the social aspect, the disruption of the workforce by factors such as aging demographics, deglobalization and technological advancements like generative AI, introduces both risks and rewards for investors. The challenge lies in discerning which companies will adeptly navigate these changes and seize the opportunities to foster an inclusive, efficient and ethical working environment. The rise in collective actions and unionization is a critical indicator of shifting labor dynamics, which could have profound implications for long-term corporate performance and investor relations.The intersection of ESG issues in emerging markets further complicates the investment landscape. The concept of a 'just transition' speaks to the delicate balance needed between economic development and environmental stewardship. A structured approach towards assessing just-transition risks and sovereign sustainability is indispensable for investors eyeing emerging-market debt. It offers a more objective lens through which investors can navigate the nuances of investing in these regions amidst the volatility of their economies and political landscapes.Lastly, the mention of the health of humanity as an investment concern reinforces the notion that public health and economic health are inextricably linked. The COVID-19 pandemic's impact on global markets has heightened awareness of the financial implications of health crises. This acknowledgment serves as a warning and an opportunity for investors to factor in the resilience and adaptability of companies and countries to health-related shocks in their investment decisions. Financial Analyst The discussion on ESG presents an opportunity for financial analysis to extend beyond traditional metrics and incorporate a broader understanding of risk. The financial implications of ESG factors are becoming increasingly quantifiable, allowing analysts to integrate them into valuation models. Investors are particularly attuned to how companies manage climate risks, labor dynamics and governance issues, as these can materially affect a company's bottom line and stock performance.As the article suggests, innovative financial structures like blended finance and debt-for-nature swaps are emerging to meet the capital demands of sustainable development. These structures promise to lower financing costs and credit risk while channeling capital toward environmental protection. They could play a significant role in reshaping the bond markets and offer a new asset class to investors seeking both impact and returns. However, these investments come with caveats—complexity, lack of standardization and execution risk—that must be diligently assessed.Moreover, the integration of generative AI into the workforce signifies potential shifts in productivity and cost structures for companies. Businesses at the forefront of integrating AI while mitigating its social and environmental impacts could gain a competitive edge. Investors would do well to monitor the progress of these companies closely, as their ability to harness this technology responsibly could lead to significant outperformance.Emerging markets present a double-edged sword for investors, offering high growth potential but accompanied by higher risks. The frameworks for assessing just-transition risks and sovereign sustainability are vital tools in discerning these risks and unearthing value. Analysts who can adeptly interpret these frameworks and understand the political and economic currents shaping these markets, will add immense value to investment decisions.Health, both as a sector and a societal issue, presents a complex interplay of investment risk and opportunity. With public health's clear links to economic stability, investors will increasingly scrutinize how companies manage health risks—both in terms of their workforce and their potential exposure to health-related market disruptions. Market Research Analyst ESG factors are shaping the investment landscape profoundly, influencing investor behavior and corporate strategies. The rise of responsible investing has prompted companies to demonstrate their commitment to ESG principles, not merely as a compliance exercise but as a strategic imperative that affects brand reputation, customer loyalty and access to capital.The article's focus on biodiversity and just transition opens up significant areas for market research. There is a growing pool of investors and consumers who prioritize sustainability, potentially influencing market trends and the success of certain products and sectors. Companies that excel in ESG areas can tap into new markets and customer segments, driving growth and innovation.The workforce transformation due to generative AI and other technological advancements presents an area rich with market research opportunities. Understanding consumer sentiment and the societal impact of these changes will be critical in forecasting market trends and consumer behavior. Companies that align their strategies with these shifts can position themselves advantageously in the market.For emerging markets, market research can provide valuable insights into consumer preferences, regulatory changes and market dynamics that are critical for investors to understand. The insights from this research can help investors make more informed decisions about where and how to allocate their resources for maximum impact and return.The health sector, as highlighted in the article, deserves attention from market researchers. The pandemic has altered consumer health behaviors, accelerated telehealth adoption and heightened interest in health and wellness. Market research can track these trends, providing investors with actionable insights into which companies and sectors are well-positioned to capitalize on these changes. 04/12/2024 - 11:45 AM NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / April 12, 2024 / Erin Bigley, CFA| Chief Responsibility OfficerFrom biodiversity and blended finance to a just transition and the cost of drugs, we preview the key ESG issues we're targeting through research.It used to seem simple. The early days of responsible investing were mainly characterized by avoidance of so-called sin stocks, such as tobacco. Since then, responsible investing has evolved into a much more sophisticated and robust understanding of the environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues affecting investment risks and opportunities. Every year seems to bring new insights, as well as new challenges for investors.At AllianceBernstein, our research agenda aims to bring rigor and clarity to responsible investing. Below are four themes we're covering closely in 2024 through our research and partnerships. We think investors should pay close attention too.1. The interconnectedness of all things.Responsible investing research must take into account the complexities of relationships, not only within and across intuitively related areas of study-such as the effects of climate change on biodiversity and vice versa-but also between what have historically been viewed as the silos of E, S and G factors.For instance, climate change is one of the most urgent challenges of our time-one that's often seen as strictly an environmental concern. But it's also a human rights issue. Neglecting to account for climate-related modern slavery threats may present material financial risks to investors.To that end, we've recently published research in partnership with Walk Free, an international human rights group, on the intersection of climate change with modern slavery. Our work explores how physical climate risks such as typhoons and droughts make populations more vulnerable to forced migration, human trafficking, forced labor and debt bondage. It also details the tools we've developed to help investors assess, disclose and manage climate-related modern slavery risks.Another area of focus for our ESG research-and another highly complex system that intersects with climate change and involves every kind of ecosystem service-is biodiversity. Investors are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of biodiversity and the urgency of preserving our planet's natural capital-the stock of natural resources that underpin our economy and society.One aspect of biodiversity in particular-water-will be at the forefront of investors' minds, and ours as well, over the next few years as communities, companies and countries cope with risks around water scarcity, water pollution and sustainable water management.Our research into biodiversity and nature-related financing aims to help investors understand, analyze and manage biodiversity risks and opportunities, as well as get a handle on investing solutions such as so-called debt-for-nature swaps.These structures require careful evaluation but may help indebted developing countries protect their vulnerable ecosystems. Debt-for-nature swaps are a type of blended finance structure that brings together emerging-market governments, developed-market governments and private investors to lower the cost of financing for the issuer and the credit risk for the investor, and to increase the flow of capital for sustainable investment.The United Nations Environment Programme estimates that developing countries will need up to US$366 billion annually in adaptation financing such as blended finance structures. Carbon markets, too, are becoming more universally endorsed as a critical step toward decarbonization.2. Workforce disruption and transformation.As responsible investing evolves to reflect real-world complexities, our understanding of social factors is also deepening. One such area of focus is transformation of the labor force. We want to understand the implications of aging demographics and deglobalization; the benefits of a more diverse and inclusive workforce; and the impact of disruptive technologies such as generative artificial intelligence (AI).Generative AI offers tremendous opportunity for investors and for society-for how we work, study and live. But it also comes with significant social risks. For example, AI may accelerate trends in automation; as much as 30% of working hours in the US could be lost to automation by 2030. Generative AI is also an energy hog, owing to its computational power requirements. Companies that help solve this energy conundrum could enable a sustainable future for this burgeoning technology-and create opportunities for investors.We're developing insights into how companies can navigate and leverage AI responsibly, as well as how investors can incorporate these considerations into the investment process.Another workforce issue we're researching that could have material implications for investors involves a secular shift in the psychological contract between employers and employees, with an increased focus on worker expectations and a rise in collective actions and unionization. This shift in the balance of power between labor and capital goes hand in hand with the decline in working-age populations in many countries and the fragmentation of the labor force via deglobalization.Lastly, diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) is an important consideration for investors and may be a competitive advantage for companies. For instance, there's growing evidence of a positive correlation between female corporate leadership and corporate performance.3. Emerging markets in the spotlight.Nowhere is the intersection between environmental and social issues more prevalent than in emerging markets, which are occupying a major share of our research efforts. Take, for example, the ""just transition,"" in which countries transition away from fossil fuels and associated greenhouse gases in a way that avoids disrupting economies and social fabrics.This is important to investors, because a mismanaged transition may pose serious long-term credit risks for sovereign issuers-through fiscal risks, debt risk, economic deprivation, rising inequality and even potentially civil unrest. And while the just transition is a global subject, these risks are biggest for developing nations. We've developed a systematic framework for measuring and monitoring these just-transition risks.We've also developed a framework for assessing emerging-market sovereign sustainability. From an ESG perspective, investing in sovereign emerging-market debt can feel messy. Most investors feel just familiar enough with individual countries to fall prey to subjective judgments when making comparisons. The market tends to overreact to news-good news, bad news and often both at once. And huge, complex data sets bog down analyses and muddy the view.To solve these problems of subjectivity, reactivity and obscurity, we've identified six concrete metrics that help identify potential value and provide guidance for both emerging-market issuers and sustainable investors.4. The health of humanity.The COVID-19 pandemic underscored just how critical health is to the world's economy, as well as to companies and investors. In fact, poor health is estimated to cost the world US$12 trillion a year-equal to about 15% of annual global GDP. As the world's population climbs toward 10 billion by 2050, access to medicine may become even more challenged. This year, we're intensifying our research around the cost of medicine and drug pricing.Pointing Our Research Lens Where It's Most NeededWhile our current research is heavily focused on the issues we've described above, we're also still moving the needle on responsible investing classics such as physical climate risks, governance concerns, sustainable investment technology and more.

Flex LNG - Time Charter for Flex Endeavour extended to 2032,2024-04-12T15:44:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Flex LNG,  announces the extension of the Time Charter for Flex Endeavour by 500 days, with a potential further extension to 2033. CEO Øystein Kalleklev highlights the positive reception of their services by charterers.","Flex LNG - Time Charter for Flex Endeavour extended to 2032 Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Flex LNG, announces the extension of the Time Charter for Flex Endeavour by 500 days, with a potential further extension to 2033. CEO Øystein Kalleklev highlights the positive reception of their services by charterers. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Market Analyst Extending the Time Charter period for Flex LNG's vessel, Flex Endeavour, represents a signal of stability in revenue streams for the company. In the volatile energy sector, long-term contracts are a haven for companies like Flex LNG, especially when considering the operational costs associated with running a fleet of LNG carriers. This extension not only guarantees cash flow well into the end of the next decade but also reflects positively on Flex LNG's customer service and reliability, which are key competitive metrics in the industry.From an investment perspective, such news might be reassuring for shareholders as consistency in the company's earnings can translate into steadier share prices. Moreover, the option for an additional year's extension could potentially spell further revenue stability beyond 2032. However, investors should also consider the market conditions for LNG transportation closer to the extension period, as shifts in demand for LNG, changes in shipping rates and regulatory changes could affect the profitability of the extended charter. Financial Analyst The exercise of the 500-day extension option translates into a better-than-expected operational certainty for Flex LNG, which can then be leveraged in financial planning and forecasts. This kind of development is typically well-received by the market as it reduces uncertainty and improves visibility into the company's future earnings. In turn, it can lead to a positive reassessment of Flex LNG's valuation metrics, like the price-to-earnings ratio, by reflecting a lower risk profile.While the immediate stock market reaction to this announcement could be positive, assessing the deal's financial impact requires understanding the terms of the charter extension, such as the day rate compared to current and forecasted market rates. It's also essential to keep an eye on the counterparty risk associated with the charterer, particularly if they account for a significant portion of Flex LNG's revenue. Energy Sector Risk Analyst An aspect that should not be overlooked is the risk profile of the LNG transportation sector, which is subject to geopolitical tensions, environmental regulations and the cyclical nature of the commodity markets. The extension of the charter period may mitigate some operational risks by providing long-term employment for the vessel; however, it also exposes Flex LNG to potential market changes that could impact the attractiveness of the terms in the future.For instance, if the LNG market faces an oversupply and charter rates decrease, Flex LNG will still benefit from a locked-in rate, which could be above-market at that point. On the flip side, if rates were to significantly increase, the company could potentially miss out on higher earnings unless the contract includes provisions to renegotiate the rates. 04/12/2024 - 11:44 AM HAMILTON, Bermuda, April 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Flex LNG, Ltd. (""Flex LNG"" or the ""Company"") (OSE/NYSE: FLNG) is pleased to announce that the charterer of Flex Endeavour has exercised an option to extend the firm period of the Time Charter by 500 days, from the third quarter 2030 to the first quarter of 2032. As announced on November 23, 2022, in connection with the extension of three ships, the charterer has one further option to extend the Time Charter period by one additional year to 2033. Øystein Kalleklev, CEO of Flex LNG Management AS, commented: ""We are glad to share another contract extension, bringing the total to three so far this year and evidencing the fact that our charterers like the service we provide. We have so far added about 4.4 years of additional firm backlog while we have been consuming about 3.6 years of backlog, thus putting us at a slight surplus in terms of contract backlog. With this extension, our total firm backlog stands at a solid 51 years, which may increase to 69 years in the event charterers are utilizing all their extension options."" About FLEX LNG Flex LNG is a shipping company focused on the growing market for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). Our fleet consists of thirteen LNG carriers on the water and all of our vessels are state-of-the-art ships with the latest generation two-stroke propulsion (MEGI and X-DF). These modern ships offer significant improvements in fuel efficiency and thus also carbon footprint compared to the older steam and four-stroke propelled ships. We have built up a significant contract backlog, having 11 of our 13 vessels on long term fixed rate charter contracts and one vessel on variable hire time charter.

(NASDAQ: AKAN) announces plans to enter the blockchain and artificial intelligence sector of the cannabis industry to enhance supply chain transparency and product authenticity. The Company aims to utilize blockchain technology for certifying genetics, plants, and products, catering to various stakeholders in the cannabis industry.","Akanda Announces Plans to Enter Blockchain and AI Technology Sector Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags AI Rhea-AI Summary Akanda Corp. (NASDAQ: AKAN) announces plans to enter the blockchain and artificial intelligence sector of the cannabis industry to enhance supply chain transparency and product authenticity. The Company aims to utilize blockchain technology for certifying genetics, plants, and products, catering to various stakeholders in the cannabis industry. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The decision by Akanda Corp to integrate blockchain and artificial intelligence into their medical cannabis operations represents a strategic pivot with the potential to redefine the company's position within the industry. The adoption of blockchain technology can streamline the supply chain, ensuring greater transparency and traceability. This move could resonate with investors who are increasingly looking for companies with a tech-forward approach, especially in sectors where product authenticity and quality control are paramount.Blockchain's application in certifying clones and baby plants is a sophisticated solution to a prevalent issue in the cannabis industry: product verification. By creating an immutable ledger for genetic and batch information, Akanda is addressing concerns around authenticity and potentially reducing instances of counterfeit products. This is not only beneficial for consumer safety but also elevates the brand's reputation for quality assurance. However, the initial investment and ongoing costs associated with implementing these technologies must be weighed against the long-term ROI and market demand. Financial Analyst The announcement by Akanda Corp to enter the blockchain and AI space within the cannabis industry may have implications for the company's financial health and stock performance. Introducing advanced technologies could lead to operational efficiencies and cost savings over time. For instance, smart contracts could automate payments and transactions, reducing the need for intermediaries and potentially lowering transaction costs.However, investors should be aware of the risks associated with such a transition. There is the matter of the initial capital outlay for technology development or acquisition and the uncertainty of market acceptance. Moreover, the company's performance must be monitored to ensure that these technological investments translate into tangible financial benefits, such as increased sales or margins, which would justify the stock's valuation in the long run. Legal Expert The integration of blockchain technology into the medical cannabis industry, as proposed by Akanda Corp, could have significant legal implications. The use of blockchain for certification purposes aligns with the global trend towards stricter regulatory compliance and product safety standards. It demonstrates proactive compliance with potential future regulations that may demand higher levels of traceability and transparency in the cannabis industry. The legal landscape for cannabis is complex and varies by jurisdiction, so the use of blockchain could provide a robust framework to navigate these challenges.However, this adoption of technology also necessitates a thorough examination of data privacy laws, especially in the context of consumer data on the blockchain. Companies like Akanda must ensure that their use of AI and blockchain adheres to all applicable data protection regulations, which can vary significantly across different regions. 04/12/2024 - 11:00 AM London, United Kingdom--(Newsfile Corp. - April 12, 2024) - Akanda Corp. (NASDAQ: AKAN) (""Akanda"" or the ""Company""), an international medical cannabis company, announces its plans to enter the blockchain and artificial intelligence sector of the cannabis industry. With an increasingly complex and global supply chain for the international cannabis industry, the Company believes companies and consumers will turn to blockchain and smart contracts to verify the authenticity of genetics, plants, and products alike. There are numerous advantageous applications of this technology such as harnessing blockchain capabilities to certify all clones, or baby plants, with a batch certificate. Cannabis nurseries specialize in plant genetics, producing clones and baby plants and seeds for the purpose of wholesale distribution. Interim CEO and Director Katie Field commented, ""Everyone from consumers, to growers, to manufacturers, to retailers care very much about the stages of production from seed to sale. We believe this technology can be used to verify the authenticity clones and genetic lineage."" The Company believes other applications of blockchain include ""track and trace"" software for inventory and lab testing results. By utilizing this technology Certificate of Analyses (COAs) will be available at the end customer's fingertips to trace results back to the original laboratory. Blockchain technology provides traceability. Akanda believes Blockchain solutions will complement the artificial intelligence capability being developed at Canmart. Presently Canmart plans to partner with a platform developed by its directors to make medical cannabis more accessible to UK patients both with social shopping trends and tailored products. Access Kaneh utilizes an AI algorithm that analyzes DNA vis a vis products in the UK market. EndoDNA is a breakthrough test that matches patients with solutions for an individualized wellness journey. The Company believes there are additional applications of artificial intelligence to augment the cannabis industry. Manufacturers are developing automated processes that allow extraction cycles to be completed with minimal human input or quality control of flower and collect efficiency data from the process as well. Akanda is evaluating less capital intensive applications too such as enhancing consumer education and responsible consumption of the product and a feedback loop to personalize research and development and ultimately strains that are grown locally.Ms. Field commented, ""Akanda is competing in brave new world of global cannabis and we intend to stay at the forefront of it by evaluating the technological solutions that can be leveraged in the business and scaled for our customers and end users. We are excited at the prospect to adopt cutting-edge technology that is a game-changer for companies and consumers alike.""This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the Company's securities, nor shall there be any sale of such securities in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction.

(CSE: AION) (""Aion Therapeutic"" or the ""Company"") and its water filtration subsidiary, Toppen Health, Inc. (""Toppen"" or ""Toppen Health""), are excited to share that on April 10, 2024, the Biden-Harris Administration in the United States has issued a groundbreaking and first-ever national, legally enforceable drinking water standard to protect communities from exposure to harmful per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (""PFAS""), also known as ""forever chemicals."" According to the April 10 release, the Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") is also announcing nearly $1 billion in funding to help states and territories implement PFAS testing and treatment at public water systems and to help owners of private wells address PFAS contamination. Toppen Health, a recent Aion acquisition, is a pioneering force in the field of water filtration. Its flagship product, the UltraSafe series with its proprietary MicronGuard™, is a three-stage water filtration system designed and independently certified to eliminate 99.99% of the forever chemicals—along with an extensive range of contaminants, including bacteria, viruses, cysts, spores, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and heavy metals—in our drinking water, while also retaining the necessary nutrients and minerals that make it healthy as well as safe. ""These legally enforceable water standards reinforce the need and viability of Toppen Health's proprietary water filtration technology and systems,"" said Graham Simmonds, CEO of Aion Therapeutic. ""With large-scale municipal applications, to in-home, and even personal water filtration solutions, Toppen Health is one of few companies with filtration technology tested and certified to remove PFAS, while not removing all the minerals that make drinking water healthy.""The newly available funding is ""part of a $9 billion investment through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to help communities with drinking water impacted by PFAS and other emerging contaminants – the largest-ever investment in tackling PFAS pollution. An additional $12 billion is available through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for general drinking water improvements, including addressing emerging contaminants like PFAS,"" the release reads.Also according to the release, the new standards and safety levels announced will be achievable using a range of available technologies and approaches including granular activated carbon, reverse osmosis, and ion exchange systems. ""While tech like reverse osmosis (""RO"") can be very effective at removing PFAS, RO systems put PFAS back into the environment via discharge water, ultimately recirculating the PFAS back into the environment,"" says Owen Boyd, CEO of Toppen Health. ""Toppen's water filtration technology neutralizes and blocks all contaminants, but retains them, and prevents redistribution back into the environment via wastewater or other means."" The EPA estimates that ""between about 6% and 10% of the 66,000 public drinking water systems subject to this rule may have to take action to reduce PFAS to meet these new standards. All public water systems have three years to complete their initial monitoring for these chemicals. They must inform the public of the level of PFAS measured in their drinking water. Where PFAS is found at levels that exceed these standards, systems must implement solutions to reduce PFAS in their drinking water within five years.""About Toppen Health Inc.Toppen, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aion Therapeutic, is a US-based innovative health and wellness company, dedicated to delivering state-of-the-art water filtration solutions. With a focus on innovation, affordability, and sustainability, Toppen's water filtration solutions are designed to meet the diverse needs of consumers, businesses, and industries around the world access clean and safe water.About Aion Therapeutic Inc.Aion Therapeutic is a forward-thinking business within the health and wellness sector with a diverse portfolio of intellectual property.

The new national drinking water standard aims to protect communities from harmful chemicals like PFAS. Toppen Health's water filtration technology, particularly the UltraSafe series, is designed to eliminate 99.99% of forever chemicals while preserving essential minerals. How does Toppen Health's water filtration technology address PFAS contamination? Toppen Health's water filtration technology utilizes a three-stage system with MicronGuard™ to remove PFAS and a range of contaminants from drinking water, ensuring the retention of necessary nutrients and minerals. What funding has been allocated to help address PFAS contamination in public water systems? The Biden-Harris Administration has allocated nearly $1 billion for PFAS testing and treatment in public water systems, as part of a $9 billion investment through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to tackle PFAS pollution. Which technologies can be used to achieve the new drinking water standards according to the EPA? The EPA mentions granular activated carbon, reverse osmosis, and ion exchange systems as viable technologies to meet the new drinking water standards. However, technologies like reverse osmosis may reintroduce PFAS into the environment via discharge water. How does Toppen Health's water filtration technology differ from reverse osmosis systems in addressing PFAS contamination? Toppen Health's water filtration technology neutralizes and blocks contaminants like PFAS without reintroducing them into the environment, unlike reverse osmosis systems that may recirculate PFAS back into the environment."

(WISH) announces that 97% of shares have voted in favor of the proposed asset sale transaction to Qoo10 Pte. Approximately 500,000 additional votes are needed for the transaction to proceed. The special meeting has been adjourned to reconvene on April 18, 2024. Stockholders are urged to vote 'FOR' the transaction to safeguard their investment in ContextLogic, ensuring the company's future as a publicly traded entity with significant net operating loss carryforwards. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the asset sale transaction between ContextLogic and Qoo10 is a significant event that could reshape the company's financial structure. Holding approximately $2.7 billion in net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) is a strategic tax asset that can offset future taxable income. The urgency expressed in securing the remaining votes suggests a high confidence level in the transaction's potential to enhance shareholder value. However, the emphasis on immediate action raises questions about liquidity concerns and the potential risks of delay, such as diminishing post-closing cash reserves.Investors should note the potential for the transaction to unlock value through strategic realignment and the preservation of NOLs. However, it's also important to consider the implications of the asset sale on the company's core business operations and future growth prospects. Any reduction in cash reserves could impact the company's ability to invest in growth or weather economic downturns. Corporate Governance Advisor The call to action for shareholders to vote 'FOR' the transaction today is a reflection of the company's governance practices, emphasizing the importance of shareholder participation in corporate decisions. The fact that a failure to vote equates to a vote against the transaction is a important detail that underscores the importance of each shareholder's voice in the approval process. The board's proactive communication strategy and the use of a proxy solicitor to assist in voting procedures demonstrate a commitment to facilitating shareholder engagement.However, the need for additional votes to reach the majority threshold suggests a potential disconnect between the board's strategic vision and shareholder consensus. Shareholders should carefully assess the transaction's long-term implications for governance and control, especially considering the potential changes in the company's asset composition and strategic direction post-transaction. Market Research Analyst The asset sale's market implications are multifaceted, potentially affecting the competitive landscape within the e-commerce sector. ContextLogic's decision to sell assets to Qoo10 could signal a strategic pivot or consolidation, which might alter market dynamics and competitive positioning. Investors and competitors alike should monitor the transaction's outcome, as it could lead to shifts in market share and consumer behavior.Moreover, the impact on ContextLogic's stock price and investor sentiment should be closely watched. The market typically reacts to uncertainty and potential changes in a company's financial health. The success or failure of this transaction could serve as an indicator of the company's operational efficiency and strategic acumen, potentially influencing investor confidence and stock valuation. 04/12/2024 - 09:20 AM Approximately 97% of Shares Voted have been “FOR” the Transaction; Approximately 500,000 Additional Shares Needed to Vote “FOR” to Complete Transaction Urges ALL Stockholders to Protect the Value of their Investment by Voting “FOR” the Transaction TODAY SAN FRANCISCO, April 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ContextLogic Inc. (d/b/a Wish) (NASDAQ: WISH) (“ContextLogic” or the “Company”) today announced its Special Meeting of Stockholders (the “Special Meeting”) being held today will convene and then adjourn without conducting any business. The Special Meeting will reconvene at 11:30 a.m. Pacific Time on April 18, 2024. The Special Meeting was being held in connection with the Company’s proposed asset sale transaction (the “Asset Sale”) to Qoo10 Pte. Ltd. (“Qoo10”), as described in the Company’s definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 15, 2024. To realize the benefits of this value-maximizing Asset Sale, the holders of a majority of ContextLogic outstanding shares must vote in support of the transaction. Approximately 97% of the shares voted have been “FOR” the Asset Sale. ContextLogic currently needs approximately 500,000 additional shares to vote “FOR” the transaction in order to achieve the necessary threshold. The adjournment will provide time to solicit additional proxies necessary to obtain the requisite approval. Stockholders who have previously submitted their proxy or otherwise voted do not need to take any action. The proxy card included with the previously distributed proxy materials will not be updated to reflect the adjournment and may continue to be used to vote shares in connection with the Special Meeting. VOTING TODAY “FOR” THE TRANSACTION IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND CRITICAL TO THE FUTURE OF YOUR INVESTMENT IN CONTEXTLOGIC Upon closing of the transaction, ContextLogic will continue as a publicly traded company with ~$2.7 billion of net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards. Closing the Asset Sale as soon as possible will also maximize the Company’s post-closing cash. The ContextLogic Board of Directors urges all stockholders to protect the value of your investment, by voting FOR the transaction TODAY. All stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 7, 2024 are entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. Each stockholder’s vote matters and is important no matter how many shares they own. A failure to vote is the same as voting against the transaction. Every day that stockholder approval is delayed will very likely result in materially lower post-closing cash and puts the value of the NOLs at significant risk. How to Vote Your Shares ContextLogic stockholders can vote online or by telephone by following the easy instructions on the previously provided proxy card. To ensure your shares are represented at the Special Meeting, ContextLogic stockholders are urged to vote online or by telephone by following the easy instructions on the previously provided proxy card. The new electronic voting deadline is 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on April 17, 2024. If you are a stockholder of record and have questions or need assistance voting your shares, please contact the Company's proxy solicitor MacKenzie Partners by calling toll-free at (800) 322-2885 or via email at proxy@mackenziepartners.com. Upon receipt of stockholder approval, the Company expects to complete the transaction in the days following.

Flattened cardboard boxes at Coach's (Re)Loved and Repair workshopWe are proud to announce the Coach (Re)Loved & Repair Workshop located in North Bergen, New Jersey has achieved Gold-level TRUE Zero Waste Certification. TRUE Zero Waste Certification is granted to facilities that have met a certain set of stringent waste reduction requirements. Most critically, TRUE Zero Waste certified facilities must demonstrate that they divert at least 90% of the waste generated from landfills through different channels such as recycling, reuse, repair, composting, and more.For over 30 years, the Coach (Re)Loved & Repair Workshop operated as our hub for Coach Repair services in North America. In 2021 we launched Coach (Re)Loved, and have since transformed the facility into its headquarters, bringing together specialized craftspeople, designers and sustainability professionals to accelerate Coach's transition toward a circular economy. The Coach (Re)Loved program includes four key segments - Coach Upcrafted, Coach Remade, Coach Restored and Coach Vintage - that give pre-loved and damaged Coach products a second life. We also have our Coach (Re)Loved Exchange program to enable consumers to trade in eligible pre-loved Coach items for credit so that the cycle can continue for generations more. Since its inception, Coach (Re)Loved has given more than 45,000 products a second life through our four pillars: Upcrafted, Remade, Restored, and Vintage.TRUE Zero Waste Certification, managed by the US Green Building Council, encourages facilities to rethink their whole systems approach, by transforming the way materials flow through our operations and, as a result, lead to zero waste. The Coach (Re)Loved & Repair Workshop in its nature works to maximize the life of our products and minimize waste wherever possible. As a part of the certification process, we partnered with the sustainability team at Recycled Track Systems (RTS) and established some programs and initiatives at our Workshop, including but not limited to:Engaged our Workshop employees by establishing a Zero Waste Leaders working group, consisting of 14 employees that are charged with implementing and maintaining our zero waste culture.Diverted over 5 tons of workshop waste and damaged product from landfill through our partnership with ReCircled, which converts these materials into new raw materials.Updated our pantry, by providing reusable utensils and plates to discourage single-use plastics, and added new waste diversion methods for employee waste, such as composting and K-Cup recycling.Invested in a design plotter technology that allowed us to minimize leather waste, drive efficiency and reduce waste significantlyWe've continued our annual waste audits and monthly diversion reporting through our partnership with RTS.Through designing out single-use and pursuing extended-life materials, the Coach (Re)Loved & Repair Workshop has achieved over 95% landfill diversion rate. The TRUE Zero Waste Certification further validates the work we have been doing to advance the circular economy through Coach (Re)Loved.Tapestry is working toward achieving zero waste at our North America corporate sites, which include our offices and fulfillment centers. We are proud of our achievement at the Coach (Re)Loved & Repair Workshop, and, as a next step, we plan to take these learnings and pursue TRUE Zero Waste Certification at our two fulfillment centers in Jacksonville and Las Vegas.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Tapestry, Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Tapestry, Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/tapestry-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Tapestry, Inc.View the original press release on accesswire.com"

Learn how it answered the call to serve the larger community when a natural disaster struck.NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / April 12, 2024 / Regions Bank By Kim BorgesAn EF-3 tornado ripped a path of destruction and despair six football fields wide across Little Rock, Arkansas, last March 31.The compassion and support that followed the devastation stretched even wider.One year later, we're sharing perspective from a Little Rock nonprofit leader whose team immediately sprang into action to help people and families in their greatest time of need. It's what Our House does - not only when natural disaster strikes, but every day. Learn more about this Regions Bank and Regions Foundation community partner.""It's a universal thing; everyone needs support at some point in their lives.""Ben Goodwin knows. At age 10, his family home burned down. And, in 2009, Goodwin and his wife faced the crisis of their newborn daughter needing significant medical care, bringing their family to Little Rock, and subsequently bringing him to Our House.""I needed flexible work because we spent a lot of time at the hospital,"" he explained. ""I had volunteered at Our House before joining the team as a part-time grant writer. I knew the mission, loved the mission - but the hard time I was going through helped the mission resonate even more for me.""While Goodwin's trials have offered him greater understanding and empathy, the now-executive director of Our House, which provides housing assistance, career services, child education programs and more, is the first to say the personal challenges by no means compare to the challenges their clients face.""In most cases, the families we serve don't have a deep and strong safety net,"" he said. ""We want to be that support network for people when they need it. We work really hard to help them build a cushion to weather the storms in their lives.""Meaning, when the actual storm came, Goodwin and team were ready.""We're always mobilized for things like this,"" he said. ""It felt like a dramatic example of the types of things we deal with every day. We're in the business of helping people who don't have homes.""The Regions Foundation, a nonprofit primarily funded by Regions Bank, provided a $10,000 grant to Our House last April to assist with shelter and childcare services for people impacted by the tornado. Regions Bank in Little Rock recently contributed $5,000 to assist with Our House's operational support and team members also teach financial education classes to the organization's career center clients.""Support from Regions Bank and the Regions Foundation is important because, ultimately, we're all in this together as a community,"" said Goodwin. ""We've worked to build our value proposition at Our House by focusing on what we do best as an organization. Regions Bank and the Regions Foundation care about the community and want to make an impact. There are a lot of deep connections here that mean a lot to us.""Regions Bank and the Regions Foundation care about the community and want to make an impact. There are a lot of deep connections here that mean a lot to us.Those connections also mean a lot to Regions Bank Commercial Banking leader and Little Rock market executive Rodney Abston, who's seen how the organization's work has lifted the community.""Our House has bridged the divide between homelessness and homeownership in Greater Little Rock for more than 35 years,"" said Abston. ""The team offers care in many forms and extends a helping hand to their clients facing crisis moments, so it was natural they extended that same care and helping hand to our larger community impacted by the storm.""While Our House's immediate tornado response resembled the usual measures of checking on personal safety and assessing physical damage, it marked only the beginning of their efforts to help their Little Rock neighbors get back on their feet.""It's our team's job to help our clients navigate resources, so we quickly took on the mantle for the larger community by serving as the go-to resource for sharing what support was available,"" said Goodwin. ""We had our hotline people could call, but we took it a step further with a web-based portal allowing them to learn what support was available such as access to food pantries, clothing, financial assistance, even the schedule when trucks would come by to pick up tree branches from their yard.""And the support didn't end there. Several Our House staff members, some personally impacted by the tornado themselves, stepped up to do even more.""One of our team members went out and bought a chainsaw to help cut tree limbs,"" said Goodwin. ""Another joined someone for breakfast each day to check in and offer emotional support. There's a bunch of stories like that of people banding together, working long hours to do what needed to be done.""Consider it the normal course of business for an organization fielding more than 1,000 calls each month and serving 500 onsite clients daily.""It's always a beehive of humanity here,"" said Goodwin. ""Whatever role you have on our team, if you're part of this work, you're getting to know our clients, you're learning their stories.""The only thing better than learning those stories? Celebrating their clients' successes.""Our House is a home to new beginnings,"" said Goodwin. ""We say, ‘This is your place, this is your chance, this is where everything hopefully aligns to an inflection point in your lives.' We know and see people are capable of great things every day.""Our House will soon have its own new beginning of sorts as well when it opens the doors of its expanded campus in April, allowing the organization to double it housing space and service capacity. The milestone marks quite a journey from Goodwin's part-time grant writing days.""We have a great team that really does the hard work and I'm privileged to lead them,"" he said. ""I feel very fortunate to do this work and be a steward of this organization and the work it does. I see it as the best our community has to offer.""About Regions Foundation Regions Foundation supports community investments that positively impact the communities served by Regions Bank.

(OTCQX: CNBB), the parent company of County National Bank (the ""Bank""), today announced earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Earnings during the first quarter of 2024 totaled $2.7 million, a decrease of $156,000 from the $2.9 million earned during the three months ended March 31, 2023. Basic earnings per share for CNB Community Bancorp, Inc. (the ""Company"") decreased to $1.26 during the three months ended March 31, 2024, down $0.08 from $1.34 during the first quarter of 2023.

Williams, President and Chief Executive Officer of CNB Community Bancorp, Inc. and County National Bank, stated, ""I have noted that since the turmoil of Spring of 2023 that included the failure of multiple banks, our industry has done a remarkable job in recovering from the stigma of those times. Because CNB has a different client base and strategy that focuses on our communities and keeping our deposits working in those communities, we have continued to maintain a strong pipeline for both credit and deposits. However, this interest rate environment has been challenging, and earnings were less than the first quarter of 2023. Furthermore, the market has continued to paint many smaller, essential community institutions with the same brush, which has weighed heavily on the market value of community banks in general. At CNB, we value our shareholders as much as we value our clients and employees, so we have continued to dividend to our shareholders at levels at or above previous dividend levels. I am confident in CNB's ability to continue to build value in our communities and with our shareholders throughout 2024 and beyond.""

Positive None. Negative None. 04/12/2024 - 10:10 AM Annual makeover contest increased prize awards and received record-breaking number of entriesDetroit, April 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DTE Energy (NYSE: DTE) today announced the winners of its annual Energy Efficiency Makeover contest. The contest, previously called Business Pride, was revamped in 2023 with a new name and larger cash awards of $5,000 each to benefit more small businesses as they start their energy efficiency journey and reduce energy use. Businesses that implement energy efficiency improvements often reduce energy use, create more energy efficient operations, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve comfort for employees and customers, and have lower energy bills. The 2023 DTE Energy Efficiency Makeover contest winners are: Penrickton Center for Blind Children in Taylor Dixon & Associates in TrentonIC Countryside Market in Imlay City These Michigan small businesses were selected based on their demonstrated knowledge of and need for energy efficiency improvements. All winners will receive a walk-through energy assessment with a DTE energy expert, including business-specific energy efficiency recommendations and help in coordinating the installation of upgrades with the prize money. Each business will also be featured in an upcoming edition of DTE’s EnergySmarts for Business magazine. “As a small but vital non-profit, upgrading the building for optimal energy efficiency is a gift that will keep on giving for years to come,” said Patricia Obrzut, executive director, Penrickton Center for Blind Children. “Penrickton Center does not receive state or federal funds and there is no charge to the families we serve. Winning this generous award in the makeover contest will enable us to make some needed improvements and truly make a difference in our day-to-day operations.” Penrickton Center for Blind Children is a unique, private non-profit agency, providing five-day residential, day care and consultation/evaluation services to children one through 12 years old who are visually impaired and multi-disabled. “We started improving the energy efficiency of our office by replacing some old tube lights with LEDs,” said Joseph Dixon, president, Dixon & Associates. “The cost of upgrading systems has been a barrier to do more, so this award will really be helpful in making more upgrades that help to reduce our energy use.” Dixon & Associates are financial planners and registered representatives offering securities and advisory services through Independent Financial Group, LLC (IFG), a registered broker-dealer and investment advisor. As small business owners look for ways to improve their operations, energy efficiency upgrades are becoming more top of mind but are often difficult to implement due to lack of funds or expertise. This contest removes barriers of cost and access. DTE also seeks to connect with customers to raise awareness of programs, rebates and services available designed to reduce energy use and costs. “We have made some energy efficiency improvements and wanted to continue with a beer cooler upgrade, but we have limited cash on hand to do this,” said John Guerrero, manager, IC Countryside Market. “We initially received a quote of $11,000 to upgrade the cooler but were able to lower the cost with the rebate DTE offers, so that and the $5,000 prize money will really help us to move forward in making that energy efficiency improvement.” Countryside Market offers groceries, deli selections and beverages. The contest, which closed in November, saw a record-breaking number of entries for a second year in a row. “The response this year is exciting for the winners and our energy efficiency team. These businesses are the foundation of the communities we serve, and we are proud to support them,” said Carmen Welch, director, Energy Efficiency, DTE Energy. “Congratulations to all our Energy Efficiency Makeover contest winners.” DTE offers over 20 energy efficiency programs for residential, small business and commercial and industrial customers and is ranked fifth in the nation for its programing. Since its inception in 2009, more than 7.7 million electric customers and 3.8 million gas customers have directly participated in DTE’s energy efficiency programs.

NioCorp Announces Closing of Financing Agreement,2024-04-12T13:20:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"NioCorp Developments  announces the closing of a private placement of US$8 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes. The company issued warrants to purchase common shares as part of the deal. The private placement was conducted in accordance with TSX regulations and the Securities Act of 1933. The proceeds will be used for general working capital purposes. The notes will mature on December 31, 2024, and holders can convert them into common shares.

The company issued warrants to purchase common shares as part of the deal. The private placement was conducted in accordance with TSX regulations and the Securities Act of 1933. The proceeds will be used for general working capital purposes. The notes will mature on December 31, 2024, and holders can convert them into common shares. The company also entered into a registration rights agreement with Yorkville for the resale of the underlying shares. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The private placement of unsecured notes by NioCorp Developments Ltd. represents a strategic move to strengthen the company's working capital and manage its short-term liquidity needs. From a financial standpoint, the use of unsecured debt instruments like these notes implies that NioCorp is confident in its ability to meet its obligations without the need for collateral, which could be seen as a positive signal to investors regarding the company's creditworthiness.The decision to offer a payment premium on top of the principal repayment is not uncommon in private placements, as it serves as an incentive for investors to provide capital to the company. However, this also increases the cost of borrowing for NioCorp, which could impact their financial statements in the short term. Investors will be closely monitoring the company's cash flow statements in subsequent quarters to assess the impact of these debt repayments on liquidity and overall financial health.Moreover, the provision allowing NioCorp to skip payments if equity conditions are met introduces a variable component to the repayment structure, which could be seen as a flexible approach to debt management but also adds complexity to the debt instrument. The equity conditions hinge on the stock's performance, which ties the company's debt obligations to its market valuation, possibly introducing additional volatility in the company's financial planning. Legal Expert The legal framework surrounding the private placement is critical, as it ensures the transaction's compliance with both U.S. and Canadian securities regulations. The exemption from registration under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as per Section 4(a)(2), is a common route for private placements, which avoids the extensive disclosures and regulatory scrutiny of public offerings.However, the reliance on private placement exemptions necessitates strict adherence to the conditions of these exemptions, such as limitations on the type and number of investors. This can limit the liquidity of the notes and warrants, as they cannot be freely traded on the open market. The registration rights agreement with Yorkville is a step towards addressing this limitation, promising to register the resale of the underlying shares, which could potentially enhance their liquidity post-registration.The contractual obligations and covenants within the Purchase Agreement and Guaranty Agreement are also significant, as they define the relationship between NioCorp and the investors, including Yorkville, which appears to have a substantial role in this transaction. These agreements will govern the use of proceeds, the company's operational limitations and the conditions under which the securities can be converted or redeemed, which are all pivotal to the legal standing and enforceability of the notes and warrants. Market Research Analyst Understanding the market dynamics and investor sentiment towards NioCorp is important in evaluating the potential impact of this private placement. The issuance of warrants alongside the notes can be seen as a strategy to attract investment by offering potential upside through equity participation. The fixed conversion price for the notes and the exercise price for the warrants are set below the current market price, which could be appealing to investors who are bullish on NioCorp's market prospects.However, the market will also consider the dilutive effect of the conversion of notes and exercise of warrants into common shares. While this could be beneficial for the company by reducing debt, it may not be received favorably by existing shareholders due to the potential dilution of their holdings. The market's reaction to this announcement will be reflected in the company's stock performance, which will be closely watched by investors and analysts alike.Additionally, the timing of the maturity of these notes, set for the end of 2024, aligns with a short-term horizon, which suggests that NioCorp is planning for near-term financial stability rather than long-term financing. This could indicate that the company is either anticipating an improved cash flow situation or considering future financial transactions to address longer-term capital needs. 04/12/2024 - 09:20 AM CENTENNIAL, CO / ACCESSWIRE / April 12, 2024 / NioCorp Developments Ltd. (""NioCorp"" or the ""Company"") (Nasdaq:NB)(TSX:NB) today announced that it has closed (the ""Closing"") a private placement (the ""Private Placement"") of US$8,000,000 aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes of NioCorp (the ""Notes""). Pursuant to the terms of the Notes, subject to certain exceptions as described below, on the first day of each calendar month, beginning on June 1, 2024 (excluding August 2024) (the ""Payment Date""), the Company will be required to repay a portion of the outstanding balance of all of the Notes, on a pro-rata basis, in an amount equal to the sum of (i) US$1,400,000 of principal (or the outstanding principal if less than such amount) in the aggregate among all of the outstanding Notes, plus (ii) 8.0% of the principal amount being paid (the ""Payment Premium""), and (iii) accrued and unpaid interest, if any, as of the Payment Date. The Company is required to make payments on each Payment Date until the entire outstanding principal is repaid, but will not have an obligation to make a payment on a Payment Date if the Equity Conditions (as defined below) are satisfied.At the Closing, NioCorp issued to the Purchasers (as defined below), in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of Notes issued to each Purchaser, warrants (the ""Warrants"" and together with the Notes, the ""Securities"") to purchase up to 615,385 common shares (the ""Warrant Shares""), without par value, of NioCorp (""Common Shares""), which is equal to 25% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes issued to the Purchasers divided by US$3.25 (the ""Exercise Price""), subject to any adjustment to give effect to any stock dividend, stock split or recapitalization.The Securities were issued and sold to certain purchasers (the ""Purchasers""), including YA II PN, Ltd. (""Yorkville""), an investment fund managed by Yorkville Advisors Global, LP, pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated April 11, 2024 (the ""Purchase Agreement""), by and between NioCorp and each of the Purchasers. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Purchasers advanced an aggregate of US$6,960,000 to NioCorp in consideration of the issuance by NioCorp to the Purchasers of US$8,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes and the Warrants at the time of Closing.The Private Placement was conducted in accordance with Section 602.1 of the Toronto Stock Exchange (the ""TSX"") Company Manual, which provides that the TSX will not apply its standards to certain transactions involving ""eligible interlisted issuers"" on a recognized exchange, such as The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq""). The Notes, the Warrants and the Underlying Shares (as defined below) were offered and issued, or will be issued, on a private offering basis pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 (the ""Securities Act"") provided by Section 4(a)(2) thereof, in each case, pursuant to the representations and covenants each of the Purchasers made to the Company pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.NioCorp intends to use the proceeds from the Private Placement for general working capital purposes, including for accounts payable, other payables and operating expenses, and to satisfy the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Private Placement.Subject to certain limitations, including those as described below, contained within the Notes, holders of the Notes will be entitled to convert the principal amount of, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and any Payment Premium that has become due and payable on each Note, from time to time over their term, into a number of Common Shares equal to the quotient of the amount being converted divided by a fixed conversion price of US$2.75 per Common Share (the ""Conversion Price"") up to a maximum of 3,141,817 Common Shares (together with the Warrant Shares, the ""Underlying Shares""). The terms of the Notes and the Warrants restrict the conversion of the Notes or exercise of Warrants by a holder if such a conversion or exercise would cause such holder to exceed certain beneficial ownership thresholds in NioCorp.The Notes are the unsecured obligations of NioCorp and will mature on December 31, 2024. The Notes will incur a simple interest rate obligation of 0.0% per annum (which will increase to 18.0% per annum upon the occurrence of an event of default). The outstanding principal amount of, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on, and Payment Premium, if any, on the Notes must be paid by NioCorp in cash when the same becomes due and payable under the terms of the Notes at their stated maturity, upon their redemption or otherwise.As mentioned above, the Company is required to make payments on each Payment Date until the entire outstanding principal is repaid, but will not have an obligation to make a payment on a Payment Date if the Equity Conditions are satisfied. The ""Equity Conditions"" means (i) on each of the five consecutive trading days prior a Payment Date (the ""Measuring Period"") the Underlying Shares Registration Statement (as defined below) is effective and available for the resale by the Purchasers of all Underlying Shares, (ii) the Company has no knowledge of any fact that would cause the Underlying Shares Registration Statement not to be effective and available for the resale of the Underlying Shares, (iii) on each day during the Measuring Period, the Common Shares are designated for quotation on Nasdaq, or on such other market or exchange on which the Common Shares are then listed or traded to the extent such other market or exchange is the principal U.S. trading market for the Common Shares (the ""Principal U.S. Market""), and have not been suspended from trading nor have delisting or suspension of trading been threatened or pending, (iv) during the Measuring Period, an event of default has not occurred, (v) on each trading day during the Measuring Period, the daily U.S. dollar volume-weighted average price (""VWAP"") for a Common Share on the Principal U.S. Market as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets is greater than 120% of the Conversion Price, (vi) on each trading day during the Measuring Period the average daily volume traded exceeded US$500,000, and (vii) there is no limitation on conversion under the terms of Notes. In addition, any Payment Date and the amount payable to the holder of a Note on any such Payment Date may be modified from time to time upon mutual written consent of the Company and such holder.Pursuant to the terms of the Notes, to the extent a holder is a party to the Standby Equity Purchase Agreement, dated March 17, 2023, by and between the Company and Yorkville (the ""SEPA""), for so long as any amount remains outstanding under such holder's Note, the amount of cash received by the Company as payment from such holder in respect of an Advance (as defined in the SEPA) is subject to a right of offset, exercisable in such holder's sole discretion, against an equal amount of principal, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and other amounts that have become due and payable under the Note, not to exceed US$1,512,000 in any calendar month.The Notes may also be redeemed at NioCorp's option at any time and from time to time over their term at a redemption price equal to the principal amount being redeemed, plus the Payment Premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, as of the redemption date.The Notes contain events of default customary for instruments of their type (with customary grace periods, as applicable) and provide that, upon the occurrence of an event of default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to NioCorp, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other type of event of default occurs and is continuing, then any holder may declare all of its Notes to be due and payable immediately.The Warrants will be exercisable, in whole or in part, but not in increments of less than US$50,000 aggregate Exercise Price (unless the remaining aggregate Exercise Price is less than US$50,000), at any time on or before the three-year anniversary of the date the Warrants were issued. Holders of the Warrants may exercise their Warrants, at their election, by paying the Exercise Price in cash or on a cashless exercise basis, if at any time there is no effective registration statement or prospectus available for the resale of the underlying Common Shares or an event of default under the Notes has occurred and is continuing.The Warrants will be subject to adjustment for any stock dividend or other distribution, stock split, reverse stock split or recapitalization.The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, conditions and indemnification obligations by each party. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Purchase Agreement were made only for purposes of the Purchase Agreement and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreement and are subject to certain important limitations.The Purchase Agreement also contains certain covenants that, among other things, limit NioCorp's ability to use the proceeds from the Private Placement to repay related party debt or to enter into any variable rate transaction other than with Yorkville, subject to certain exceptions, and to distribute proceeds from the Private Placement to subsidiaries other than Elk Creek Resources Corporation (""ECRC"") and 0896800 B.C. Ltd. (together with ECRC, the ""Guarantors""), upon the entry by the Guarantors into a global guaranty agreement, dated as of April 11, 2024, among the Guarantors in favor of the Purchasers (the ""Guaranty Agreement""). Pursuant to the Guaranty Agreement, the Guarantors guaranteed the full, prompt and unconditional payment when due (whether at maturity , by acceleration or otherwise), and the performance of all liabilities, agreements and other obligations of NioCorp to the Purchasers contained in the Notes, the Warrants and the Purchase Agreement, to the extent such liabilities, agreements and obligations are payable in cash.On April 11, 2024, in connection with the Purchase Agreement, NioCorp and Yorkville also entered into a registration rights agreement (the ""Registration Rights Agreement"") pursuant to which NioCorp has agreed to file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") a registration statement (the ""Underlying Shares Registration Statement"") registering the resale by the Purchasers of the Underlying Shares under the Securities Act, as soon as practicable but no later than May 15, 2024, and to use its reasonable best efforts to have the Underlying Shares Registration Statement declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof, but in no event later than the 60th calendar day following the filing date thereof.

(TSXV: LTH; OTCQX: LTHCF; FSE: H3N) (“Lithium Ionic” or the “Company”), is pleased to report an updated NI 43-101 compliant mineral resource estimate (“MRE”) for the Bandeira Lithium Project (“Bandeira” or the “Project”), located within the Lithium Valley in Minas Gerais State, Brazil. The Lithium Valley is a unique geological belt that hosts a significant concentration of lithium-bearing pegmatites, which has emerged as a globally significant lithium producer. This new MRE increases the Company’s global mineral resources by 26% to 60.1Mt. The Bandeira property covers only approximately 158 hectares, or 1% of its large 14,182-hectare land package. Two other NI 43-101 compliant lithium MREs have been outlined on the Company’s other regional properties, Salinas and Outro Lado, however the majority of its properties remain largely unexplored and represent significant future mineral growth potential for the Company. Bandeira MRE Highlights: Measured and Indicated (“M&I”) MRE of 23.68 million tonnes (“Mt”) at an average grade of 1.34% Li₂O, with an additional 18.25Mt of Inferred MRE grading 1.37% Li₂O, for a total of 41.93Mt*.The updated Bandeira MRE significantly increases the Company’s consolidated, global mineral resources to 60.1Mt.Significant mineral growth in only ~24months: The MRE estimate is based on 233 drill holes, or 50,760 metres, drilled between April 2022 and March 2024. Planned exploration programs at its existing deposits, Bandeira, Salinas and Outro Lado, as well as other regional targets, are expected to support continued mineral resource growth. *See press release dated April 4, 2024, for details related to the Salinas MRE (effective date of January 4, 2024; QP: Leonardo Soares, P.Geo., M.Sc., of GE21), and the NI 43-101 compliant technical reports related to the Outro Lado deposit titled “Mineral Resource Estimate for Lithium Ionic, Itinga Project” (effective date of June 24, 2023; authored by Maxime Dupéré, B. Sc., P.Geo. and Faisal Sayeed, B. Sc., P.Geo). Blake Hylands, P.Geo., CEO of Lithium Ionic, commented, “Following closely on the heels of our initial resource at Salinas announced last week, this is yet another significant increase to our global mineral resources, highlighting the impressive pace and scale at which we have been able to delineate lithium deposits in this region. I commend our exploration team for their dedication and exceptional effort, which have driven these excellent results. This latest MRE positions us among the largest scale projects in the region, and with a largely untapped land package we expect this growth momentum to continue, aligning with our goal of becoming a major contributor to the global lithium supply chain.” Carlos Costa, P.Geo., Lithium Ionic’s VP of Exploration, commented, “Reflecting on the past two years since we started drilling at Bandeira, I am immensely proud of our team’s accomplishments. Starting with just a few promising rock samples, we have now uncovered a significant mineral deposit and look forward to advancing Bandeira to the next stages of development.” Bandeira Lithium Project – Mineral Resource Update The MRE update for Bandeira was prepared by GE21 Consultoria Mineral Ltda. (“GE21”) in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”). Bandeira is located in the lithium-rich Araçuaí Pegmatite District, in the northern part of the Eastern Brazilian Pegmatite Province, which hosts the largest lithium reserves in Brazil. The updated MRE contains M&I resources of 23.68Mt grading 1.34% Li₂O, containing 783.0 thousand tonnes (“kt”) of Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (“LCE”), the benchmark equivalent raw material used in the lithium industry, along with Inferred resources of 18.25Mt grading 1.37% Li₂O in the Inferred category, or 618.4kt of LCE (see MRE results in Table 1). The MRE is based on 233 diamond drill holes comprising 50,760 metres of drilling completed between April 2022 and March 2024. GE21 collaborated closely with the Company’s geological team to confirm the presence of a series of North-East trending moderately SE dipping pegmatite veins extending up to 1,000 meters along strike and from surface to a vertical depth of approximately 500 meters (see plan view of Bandeira in Figure 1 and an isometric view of the Bandeira deposit in Figure 2). As press released on April 4, 2024, a Feasibility Study for Bandeira is currently being finalized by AtkinsRéalis (formerly SNC-Lavalin) and is scheduled for completion in May 2024. Furthermore, the environmental license for Bandeira is expected to be granted in early Q3 2024. The NI 43-101 technical report related to the Bandeira MRE, will be accessible on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) under the Company’s issuer profile and the Company’s website within 45 days of this news release.

The MRE was prepared using the following geological and resource block modeling parameters which are based on geological interpretations, geostatistical studies, and best practices in mineral estimation. The QP is not aware of any factors or issues that materially affect the MRE other than normal risks faced by mining projects in the province in terms of environmental, permitting, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, and political factors, and additional risk factors regarding inferred resources. The Project geology comprises Neoproterozoic age sedimentary rocks of Araçuaí Orogen intruded by fertile Li-bearing pegmatites originated by fractionation of magmatic fluids from the peraluminous S-type post-tectonic granitoids of Araçuaí Orogen. Lithium mineralization is related to concordant and discordant swarms of spodumene-bearing tabular pegmatites hosted by cordierite-biotite-quartz schists.Drilling conducted by Lithium Ionic included diamond core drilling of NTW (64.2mm diameter).Diamond core has been sampled in intervals of ~ 1 m where possible, otherwise intervals less than 1 m have been selected based on geological boundaries. Geological boundaries have not been crossed by sample intervals. ½ core samples have been collected and submitted for analysis, with regular field duplicate samples collected and submitted for QA/QC analysis.Drill core samples were submitted to SGS Geosol laboratories in Brazil where they were analyzed for a 31-element suite via ICP90A (fusion by sodium peroxide and finish with ICP- MS/ICP-OES). Assay data were composited to 1 m.The MRE was estimated from the diamond drill holes completed by Lithium Ionic from April 2022 until March 2024. Data from a total of 233 drill holes comprising 8,693 assays were included in the mineral resources model.The 3D modelling of lithium Mineral Resources was conducted using a minimum cut-off grade of 0.3% Li2O within a preliminary lithological model.The interpolation was conducted using Krigging methodology with three interpolation passes.The block model was defined by a block size of 12 m long by 12m wide by 4 m thick and covers a strike length of approximately 1,200 m to a maximal vertical depth of 300 m below surface.The MRE was classified as Measured, Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource based on data quality, sample spacing, and pegmatite continuity. The Measured Mineral Resource was defined using a search ellipsoid of 50 m by 50 m by 30 m, and where the continuity and predictability of the mineralized units was reasonable. The Indicated Mineral Resource was defined using a search ellipsoid 100 m by 100 m by 50 m. The Inferred Mineral Resource was assigned to areas where drill hole spacing was greater than 100 m by 100 m by 50 m for all remaining blocks.Classification focused on spatial relation using a minimum of five composites in at least three different drill holes for the Measured and Indicated resources.Validation has proven that the block model fairly reflects the underlying data inputs. Variability over distance is relatively moderate to low for this deposit type therefore the maximum classification level is Indicated.Mineralization at the deposits extends to surface and is expected to be suitable for open cut mining; no minimum mining width was applied; internal mining dilution is limited to internal barren pegmatite and/or host rock intervals within the mineralized pegmatite intervals; based on these assumptions, it is considered that there are no mining factors which are likely to affect the assumption that the deposit has reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction.It is the QP’s opinion that the current classification used is adequate and reliable for this type of mineralization and MRE.The MRE reported is a global estimate with reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction.

The project is part of Countyline Corporate Park Phase IV, with an estimated investment of $42.1 million and a stabilized cap rate of 6.0%. The entire project is expected to consist of 17 buildings totaling 3.5 million square feet and an investment of approximately $511.5 million. Positive None. Negative None. Real Estate Analyst The commencement of construction on Countyline Corporate Park Phase IV Building 31 by Terreno Realty Corporation represents a strategic move in expanding its industrial real estate portfolio. A 100% pre-lease rate, particularly to a national tire distributor, indicates strong demand in the Hialeah, Florida market and provides a stable income forecast for the property. The projected stabilized cap rate of 6.0% offers insight into the expected yield from the property, which is in line with current market trends for industrial assets in similar locations.LEED certification is increasingly sought after in new industrial developments, catering to a growing demand for sustainable and energy-efficient buildings. This could potentially offer long-term cost savings and attract environmentally conscious tenants, providing a competitive edge in the market. The significant investment of $42.1 million for Building 31 and the broader $511.5 million for the entire Phase IV, underscores the scale and potential impact of this development on Terreno's portfolio and the regional industrial real estate market. Sustainability Consultant Terreno Realty Corporation's commitment to achieving LEED certification for Building 31 aligns with broader industry trends prioritizing sustainability. LEED-certified buildings are not only environmentally responsible but also can offer financial benefits such as reduced operating costs and increased asset value. The emphasis on sustainable development is particularly relevant given the industrial sector's traditionally large environmental footprint. By integrating green building practices, Terreno can appeal to a segment of tenants who value corporate social responsibility and may be willing to pay a premium for such features. Financial Analyst Investors often scrutinize pre-lease rates as indicators of a project's financial viability. The fact that Building 31 is fully pre-leased before completion suggests that Terreno Realty Corporation has effectively mitigated vacancy risk, which is a positive sign for cash flow continuity. The long-term lease, expiring in May 2032, provides a clear revenue trajectory, which is important for financial planning and forecasting. However, it is important to consider the potential risks associated with a single-tenant occupancy, such as dependency on the tenant's financial stability and the impact of industry-specific downturns.Moreover, the estimated stabilized cap rate should be compared against the industry average and the specific market to evaluate the investment's attractiveness. A cap rate of 6.0% could be considered favorable in today's market, reflecting a balance between risk and return. The total investment figures and the phased development approach also suggest a calculated expansion strategy, with Phase IV completion expected to significantly enhance Terreno's market presence by 2027. 04/12/2024 - 09:15 AM -Building 100% pre-leased BELLEVUE, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Terreno Realty Corporation (NYSE:TRNO), an acquirer, owner and operator of industrial real estate in six major coastal U.S. markets, announced today that it has commenced construction of Countyline Corporate Park Phase IV Building 31 in Hialeah, Florida.

"Delek Logistics Partners, LP Announces Proposed Offering of $200 Million of Additional 8.625% Senior Notes Due 2029",2024-04-12T13:14:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Delek Logistics Partners, LP (DKL) plans to offer $200 million in additional 8.625% senior notes due 2029 to repay borrowings under its revolving credit facility.

The notes will be offered to qualified institutional buyers and non-U.S. persons, exempt from registration under the Securities Act. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The offering of $200 million in additional senior notes by Delek Logistics Partners is a strategic financial move aimed at optimizing the company's capital structure. The decision to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility using the net proceeds indicates a focus on debt management and interest cost reduction. Given the 8.625% interest rate, which is relatively high in the current market, the company may be signaling a conservative approach to its leverage or reflecting a premium for the perceived risk associated with the energy sector.Investors should note the implications of such a debt issuance on the company's interest coverage ratio and overall debt-to-equity balance. While the immediate effect may be an increase in cash flow due to reduced credit facility borrowings, the long-term impact must be evaluated in terms of interest expense and potential dilution of earnings. Furthermore, the choice of a private placement to qualified institutional buyers suggests a targeted approach in fundraising, possibly due to the complexities and regulations associated with public offerings. Market Research Analyst Delek Logistics' move to issue additional senior notes under the same indenture as the existing notes could indicate a market appetite for high-yield debt within the energy logistics industry. The company's ability to secure funds at an 8.625% interest rate, despite the current low-interest-rate environment, could reflect investor confidence in its operational stability and future cash flows. However, this confidence must be juxtaposed with the inherent volatility of the energy sector. Factors such as fluctuating oil prices, regulatory changes and the transition to renewable energy sources could affect Delek Logistics' financial performance. Investors should assess the company's hedging strategies and its adaptability to market changes to understand the potential risks associated with this investment. Legal Expert The legal framework surrounding the issuance of the Additional Notes, particularly the reliance on Rule 144A and Regulation S, is designed to facilitate capital raising while complying with securities laws. These rules allow for a more expedited process by limiting the offering to qualified institutional buyers and non-U.S. persons, bypassing the more stringent requirements of a public offering. It's important for stakeholders to recognize the regulatory environment's role in shaping such transactions and the limitations it imposes on the liquidity of the notes, as they cannot be sold freely in the public market without registration or an exemption. This could impact the secondary market trading of the notes and, by extension, their pricing and attractiveness to potential investors. 04/12/2024 - 09:14 AM BRENTWOOD, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Delek Logistics Partners, LP (NYSE: DKL) (“Delek Logistics”) announced today that it, along with Delek Logistics Finance Corp., a subsidiary of Delek Logistics (together with Delek Logistics, the “Issuers”), intends to offer $200 million in aggregate principal amount of additional 8.625% senior notes due 2029 (the “Additional Notes”) in a private placement to eligible purchasers, subject to market conditions.

(Nasdaq: BIVI) is a clinical-stage company developing innovative drug therapies for the treatment of neurological and neurodegenerative disorders and advanced liver disease. In neurodegenerative disease, the Company's drug candidate NE3107 inhibits inflammatory activation of ERK and NFkB (e.g., TNF signaling) that leads to neuroinflammation and insulin resistance, but not their homeostatic functions (e.g., insulin signaling and neuron growth and survival). Both are drivers of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The Company conducted and reported efficacy data from its randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study to evaluate NE3107 in patients who have mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (NCT04669028). Results of a Phase 2 investigator-initiated trial (NCT05227820) showing NE3107-treated patients experienced improved cognition and biomarker levels were presented at the Clinical Trial in Alzheimer's Disease (CTAD) annual conference in December 2022. An estimated six million Americans suffer from Alzheimer's. A Phase 2 study of NE3107 in Parkinson's disease (NCT05083260) has completed, and data presented at the International Conference on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease and Related Neurological Disorders conference in Gothenburg, Sweden in March 2023 showed significant improvements in ""morning on"" symptoms and clinically meaningful improvement in motor control in patients treated with a combination of NE3107 and levodopa vs. patients treated with levodopa alone, and no drug-related adverse events. In liver disease, the Company's Orphan drug candidate BIV201 (continuous infusion terlipressin), with U.S. FDA Fast Track status, is being evaluated and discussed with guidance received from the FDA regarding the design of Phase 3 clinical testing of BIV201 for the treatment of ascites due to chronic liver cirrhosis.

Sunshine Biopharma Announces Reverse Stock Split,2024-04-12T13:00:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,"Sunshine Biopharma, Inc. (SBFM) implements a one for one hundred reverse stock split to meet Nasdaq's bid price requirement, effective April 17, 2024.","Sunshine Biopharma Announces Reverse Stock Split Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags stock split Rhea-AI Summary Sunshine Biopharma, Inc. (SBFM) implements a one for one hundred reverse stock split to meet Nasdaq's bid price requirement, effective April 17, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of a reverse stock split by Sunshine Biopharma is a strategic maneuver aimed at addressing the Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement. From a financial perspective, this action consolidates shares and artificially increases the stock price without altering the company's market capitalization. This is often a response to stock price depreciation that places the company at risk of delisting.Investors should note that while the reverse split does not inherently change the value of the company, it can affect market perception. Historically, reverse splits have been met with mixed reactions. Some investors view them as red flags signaling underlying issues, while others see them as necessary steps for a company's recovery plan. It is also important to consider the potential for increased volatility post-split due to a reduced number of shares available for trading. Market Research Analyst Analyzing the market implications of Sunshine Biopharma's reverse stock split, it's essential to consider the broader industry context. Pharmaceutical companies often face significant volatility based on drug development news, regulatory approvals and market competition. A reverse stock split can signal to the market that the company is taking proactive measures to maintain its listing status and improve its appeal to institutional investors who may have policies against investing in stocks below certain price thresholds.However, it's critical to evaluate the company's overall performance and pipeline. If the fundamentals are strong, with promising drug candidates and a clear strategic direction, the reverse split could be seen as a temporary measure while the company strengthens its core business. Conversely, if the company is struggling with its pipeline or facing financial challenges, the reverse split might not be sufficient to instill long-term investor confidence. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, Sunshine Biopharma's reverse stock split must adhere to both corporate governance rules and securities regulations.

The company aims to finalize terms by the end of the second quarter of 2024, exploring trade sale or capital markets options. Illumina may need to fund GRAIL with approximately $1 billion for a capital markets transaction. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The European Commission's approval of Illumina's divestment plan for GRAIL indicates a pivotal regulatory step that could influence the company's strategic direction and financial landscape. The divestment options, including a trade sale or a capital markets transaction, suggest a reshaping of Illumina's asset portfolio and a potential influx of capital, which may be used to fuel further innovation or repay debt. Investors should monitor how this divestment aligns with Illumina's core business objectives and whether it could streamline operations or enhance shareholder value. Financial Analyst The stipulation that GRAIL must be capitalized with an estimated $1 billion for a capital markets transaction underscores the significant financial commitment Illumina has made to GRAIL. This figure provides insight into GRAIL's valuation and operational costs, which are important for investors assessing the potential return on investment. The successful execution of the divestment plan could lead to changes in Illumina's financial statements, impacting liquidity ratios and potentially freeing up resources for other strategic initiatives. The timing of the divestment's finalization by the end of Q2 2024 will be a key factor for financial planning and forecasting. Legal Expert The approval by the European Commission implies that Illumina's divestment plan meets certain regulatory standards, which is essential for mitigating legal and antitrust risks. The divestment process, particularly in the context of stringent antitrust laws in the EU, is complex and requires careful navigation.

CleanSpark's move to upgrade its equipment ahead of this event could position it favorably in the market, increasing its competitive edge as less efficient miners may struggle to maintain profitability. This proactive approach to energy efficiency could be a signal to investors of the company's commitment to long-term sustainability and cost management. Cryptocurrency Market Analyst The enhancement of CleanSpark's mining capabilities through the upgrade to Bitmain S21 Pros and the increase in hashrate is noteworthy for stakeholders. The 17% increase in hashrate implies a direct impact on the company's bitcoin mining capacity and potential revenue generation. As the company asserts its position as a leading bitcoin miner in North America, its ability to produce more bitcoin per exahash than its peers is a key performance indicator.The market implications of the halving event are also critical. Historically, halving has led to increased bitcoin prices due to reduced supply. CleanSpark's strategic upgrade positions it to capitalize on potential price increases while mitigating the impact of reduced mining rewards. This foresight may be positively perceived by investors as a robust strategy to navigate the cyclical nature of cryptocurrency markets.Moreover, CleanSpark's emphasis on efficiency and scale could resonate with environmentally conscious investors, aligning with the growing trend of sustainable investment criteria. Their ability to increase production without additional energy consumption is a testament to their operational effectiveness and could influence investor sentiment and the company's stock performance. 04/12/2024 - 09:00 AM Company negotiates option upgrade to new S21 Pros, increasing the total purchased hashrate by 17%, to 23.4 EH/s The Company reached its new hashrate high as its recently acquired data center in Dalton, GA, goes online LAS VEGAS, April 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- CleanSpark Inc. (Nasdaq: CLSK), America's Bitcoin Miner™, today announced it has exceeded 17 exahashes per second (EH/s) of operating hashrate and has exercised its option to purchase 100,000 Bitmain S21 Pros, or 23.4 EH/s of machines. The machine purchase is an amendment to an existing agreement with Bitmain announced earlier this year. The amendment allowed the Company to purchase the S21 Pro model instead of the S21. The cost per terahash is maintained at the industry low price of $16 per terahash for the more efficient miner. The S21 Pro operates at 15 joules per terahash (J/TH), a 14 percent improvement over the S21 miner which is currently the most efficient miner available on the market at 17.5 J/TH. The improved efficiency of the S21 Pro means that the company will still acquire the same number of machines, but with a 17 percent increase in hashrate, or approximately 3.4 EH/s more hashrate. ""Efficiency is the most important variable as we head into the halving,"" said Zach Bradford, CEO. ""With the upgrade to the new S21 Pro, we expect that we have cemented our lead as the most efficient publicly traded bitcoin miner at scale in North America. Our extraordinary scale has allowed us to make meaningful gains in our bitcoin production without having to increase the energy use of our data centers. This is good not only for CleanSpark and our shareholders, but for the entire bitcoin network. After halving, many old and inefficient machines will go offline, increasing CleanSpark's organic market share while lowering the network's energy consumption. We are well-suited to take advantage of the opportunities that the halving affords and look forward to continuing our unmatched growth."" Under the agreement, the new S21 Pros are scheduled for delivery between June and December 2024. CleanSpark is among the largest publicly traded bitcoin miners in the world, consistently outpacing its peers in terms of bitcoin produced per exahash of operating hashrate, according to publicly available data.

Financial Analyst Bitcoin Depot's announcement of a substantial investment into its Bitcoin ATM kiosks by an outside investment firm represents a strategic move in the fintech sector. The investment in 250 kiosks, with the option for an additional 750, signifies confidence in Bitcoin Depot's business model and its profit-sharing program. This influx of capital is expected to bolster the company's expansion efforts across North America, potentially increasing its market share and competitive edge.From a financial perspective, the deal offers the investment firm a steady stream of passive income through monthly profit splits from the kiosks. Such arrangements are indicative of the growing trend in fintech where investors seek to gain exposure to cryptocurrency-related infrastructure without direct involvement in the day-to-day operations. For Bitcoin Depot, this could enhance liquidity and provide funds for further development or to shore up operational efficiencies.However, investors should consider the volatility of the cryptocurrency market, which could affect the profitability of BTMs. While the current investment indicates optimism, potential regulatory changes and market fluctuations could impact future returns. It's also essential to monitor whether this expansion leads to an increase in Bitcoin Depot's revenue and if the profit-sharing model is sustainable over the long term. Market Research Analyst The strategic investment into Bitcoin Depot's BTM kiosks reflects a broader trend in the adoption of cryptocurrency services. With an increasing number of BTM kiosks, Bitcoin Depot is likely aiming to capture the growing consumer demand for convenient access to digital currencies. The expansion through the profit share program could serve to democratize access to Bitcoin, aligning with the increasing trend of financial services moving towards digital platforms.Market penetration is key in the fintech space and Bitcoin Depot's aggressive growth strategy could position the company as a dominant player in the North American BTM market. The option for the investment firm to further invest in up to 750 additional kiosks suggests a scalable business plan that could be replicated in other regions, subject to market conditions and regulatory environments.One must consider the competitive landscape, as other fintech companies may also ramp up their efforts in response to Bitcoin Depot's expansion. The success of the investment will depend on user adoption rates, the ease of use and accessibility of the kiosks and the overall market sentiment towards cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency Expert The investment in Bitcoin Depot's BTM kiosks underscores the growing institutional interest in cryptocurrency infrastructure. BTMs serve as a physical touchpoint for digital currency transactions, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning crypto economy. This move could be indicative of a maturing market where the infrastructure for cryptocurrency is being taken more seriously by traditional investment firms.It's important to note the role of BTMs in fostering adoption; they simplify the process of purchasing Bitcoin for the average consumer who may not be tech-savvy. This ease of access is a critical factor in driving mainstream adoption. Moreover, the integration with BitAccess software points to a focus on operational excellence and security, which are paramount concerns in the crypto industry.Despite the positive outlook, the sustainability of Bitcoin Depot's growth strategy hinges on the regulatory landscape and the volatility of Bitcoin prices. The company's performance and the investment's return could be significantly impacted by these factors. Stakeholders should closely monitor the evolving regulatory discourse around cryptocurrency and its potential impact on BTM operations. 04/12/2024 - 09:01 AM Sets a New Milestone for the Program with the Largest Investment to Date, Advancing the Company's Ambitious Growth Strategy Throughout North AmericaATLANTA, April 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bitcoin Depot (NASDAQ: BTM), a U.S.-based Bitcoin ATM (“BTM”) operator and leading fintech company, today announced an outside investment firm has committed a multi-million-dollar investment into 250 Bitcoin Depot BTM kiosks as part of the Company’s profit share program. The BTMs, operated by Bitcoin Depot, will provide passive income to the investment fund by paying out a percentage of monthly profits from these 250 kiosks. In addition to the 250 BTMs included in the initial agreement, the Fund has the option to invest in an additional 750 kiosks.

Vertical business model and experienced staff supported efficient operations and financial performance. Integrated strategy ensured timely delivery of school furniture and enhanced customer service. Controlled order-to-cash cycle contributed to strong operating and financial efficiencies. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results from Virco Mfg. Corporation indicate a significant improvement in several key performance metrics, which is indicative of a strong operational year. The increase in net revenue by 16.5% and full year gross margin expansion to 43.1% from 36.9% reflect a solid demand for the company's products and effective cost management. The company's ability to generate a cash flow from operations of $27.0 million, a stark contrast to the negative cash flow in the previous year, suggests a robust recovery post-pandemic and efficient inventory management. From a financial perspective, the company's status as effectively debt-free, barring a small mortgage, provides it with a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. This is particularly important as the company enters the peak summer season, where it expects to utilize its revolving credit facility. The reduction in Selling, General and Administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue also indicates improved operational efficiency. However, the increase in interest expenses, albeit slight, is a reminder of the broader macroeconomic environment of rising interest rates, which could affect future borrowing costs. Investors should monitor this alongside the company's ability to maintain its operational efficiencies and margin improvements in a potentially volatile economic climate. Market Research Analyst Virco's focus on the educational environment, a sector with cyclical demand patterns, requires a nuanced understanding of market dynamics. The company's seasonally adjusted revenue increases and its record 'Shipments plus Backlog' metric suggest a strong market position and an effective anticipation of demand. This is important in an industry where the seasonal nature of school furniture purchases can create significant operational and logistical challenges. The company's vertical business model, which integrates sales, manufacturing and service, appears to be a key differentiator, enabling it to provide enhanced services that now constitute over two-thirds of its revenue. This strategic approach not only ensures customer loyalty but also provides a competitive edge by enabling Virco to respond quickly to market changes and customer needs. Furthermore, the company's long-standing history and experienced workforce contribute to its market stability and reliability. This, combined with the fact that the company is effectively debt-free, positions Virco favorably for both short-term operational execution and long-term strategic initiatives. Operations Management Expert Virco's operational strategy, reflected in its financial results, demonstrates a high degree of efficiency in managing the order-to-cash cycle and balancing post-pandemic inventories. The company's ability to emerge from the pandemic with stronger financials than in 2019 is a testament to its operational resilience and the effectiveness of its vertically integrated business model. The expansion of gross margin is particularly noteworthy as it indicates not just a recovery but an improvement in operational efficiency. The stabilization of raw material costs and the benefits of operating at a higher volume have evidently led to better cost absorption and profitability. The company's seasonal business model, with a significant portion of installations occurring during summer, requires precise management of production and staffing to align with demand cycles. Lastly, the development of proprietary systems over its 74-year history highlights a commitment to continuous improvement and innovation in operational processes. This is critical in ensuring that the company can maintain its service levels and financial performance in the face of potential supply chain disruptions and market fluctuations. 04/12/2024 - 09:00 AM U.S. Factories and experienced staff support broad school recovery and related demand for school furnitureVertical control of order-to-cash cycle generates strong operating and financial efficiencies, with most metrics at historic highs Net Income reaches $21.9 million vs. $16.5 million in prior yearFull Year Gross Margin expands to 43.1% vs. 36.9% in prior yearCash flow from operations reaches $27.0 million vs. $(3.8 million) in prior year due to combined operating income and balancing of post-pandemic inventoriesForward indicator of “Shipments plus Backlog” reaches record $317.6 million vs. $289.6 million last yearCompany is effectively debt-free at year end TORRANCE, Calif., April 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Virco Mfg. Corporation (NASDAQ: VIRC), the leading manufacturer and supplier of moveable furniture and equipment for educational environments in the United States, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year ended January 31, 2024. Net revenue for the full year ended January 31, 2024 increased 16.5% to $269.1 million from $231.1 million in the prior year. For the seasonally light fourth quarter, revenue increased 9.8% to $42.6 million from $38.8 million. For the full year, the Company’s domestically-based vertical business model continued to support timely delivery of highly seasonal school furniture, approximately 50% of which is installed during the summer months of June through August, when schools are out of session. This seasonality creates operational, logistical, and financing challenges for the school furniture market. Virco’s 74-year history of serving public and private schools, along with its experienced workforce—40% of whom have over twenty years’ service with the Company—has resulted in an integrated strategy that combines reliable customer service with good control of the order-to-cash cycle. At fiscal year-end, other than a small mortgage on one of its Conway, Arkansas facilities, the Company was effectively debt-free, having emerged from the pandemic financially stronger than in 2019. Gross margin for the full year improved to 43.1% compared to 36.9% in the prior year. For the seasonally light fourth quarter, gross margin improved to 37.7% vs. 33.5% in the prior year. The improved gross margin was due to stabilizing raw material costs and operating efficiencies generated by higher overall volume. Selling, General, and Administrative expenses for the full year declined to 31.3% of revenue compared to 32.3% in the prior year. Demand for the Company’s PlanSCAPE project-management services continued to grow, along with more traditional full service delivery and installation—all of which are part of Virco’s vertically integrated sales, manufacturing, and service model. The Company estimates that over two-thirds of its revenue now includes some degree of enhanced services, continuing a trajectory that began over twenty years ago. The control offered by this vertical model, which provides better visibility than more fragmented models, allowed the Company to modulate its inventories and borrowings despite the uncertainties and disruptions in the supply chain over the past few years. Operating Income for the full year ended January 31, 2024 was $31.9 million compared to $10.6 million the prior year. Interest expense as a percent of revenue was 1.0% compared to 0.9% the prior year, due to higher interest rates. Overall borrowing under the Company’s seasonal working capital revolver was substantially lower despite the growth in shipments, allowing the Company to completely pay down its credit facility at year end. Other than a small mortgage on one of its Arkansas facilities, Virco was effectively debt-free as of this press release. Management fully expects to utilize its revolving credit facility during the peak summer season, but it also views the Company’s strong financial position as essential to providing continuity of service to schools as well as a balanced portfolio of returns to investors. Total Net Income after taxes for the full year was $21.9 million compared to $16.5 million the prior year. This comparison includes the reversal last year of an $8.5 million valuation allowance for potentially un-recoverable net operating loss (NOL) tax credits. Because of this, Management believes the most accurate comparison of year-over-year operating performance is Net Income before Taxes, which reached $29.2 million in FYE 1.31.24. This compares to $8.0 million in the prior year, a more than three-fold improvement. Looking forward, Management notes that its preferred early-season measure of business velocity: “Shipments + Backlog” exceeded $317.6 million at year end, compared to $289.6 million FYE 1.31.23. Management uses this non-GAAP metric to plan production, staffing, and borrowings ahead of the busy summer delivery season, when the metric, which is heavily weighted toward backlog in the offseason, converts to shipments and receivables. This seasonal transition is of sufficient magnitude to represent an obvious burden on financing, but also on the systems and people who manage it. The Company has developed these systems, many of which are proprietary and not available “off the shelf,” over its continuous 74-year history of serving America’s public and private schools. Commenting on the year’s results, Virco Chairman and CEO Robert Virtue said: “While we are extremely pleased with last year’s results, we’ve been at this long enough to know that markets and competition are always evolving. We have meaningful opportunities and challenges ahead of us, but I feel confident in our ability to address these with the same discipline and optimism that we’ve exhibited over our 74-year history. I also want to thank our loyal investors, whose support made it possible to realize the vision of our long-term strategy. A visit to our factories, or to one the thousands of schools that we furnished last year, will validate the qualitative elements of our strategy. Good jobs and good schools: two things we’re honored to support.” About Virco Mfg. Corporation Founded in 1950, Virco Mfg.

RADICAVA is administered in 28-day cycles by intravenous (IV) infusion. It takes 60 minutes to receive each 60 mg dose. For the initial cycle, the treatment is infused daily for 14 consecutive days, followed by a two-week drug-free period. All cycles thereafter are infused daily for 10 days within a 14-day period, followed by a two-week drug-free period. RADICAVA ORS is taken daily for 14 consecutive days followed by a 14-day drug-free period for the initial treatment cycle. For subsequent treatment cycles, RADICAVA ORS is taken for 10 days within a 14-day period followed by a 14-day drug-free period. RADICAVA ORS should be taken in the morning after overnight fasting. Patients should not eat or drink (except water) within one hour after taking RADICAVA ORS.1 Edaravone was discovered and developed for ALS by Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation (MTPC) and commercialized in the U.S. by Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma America, Inc. (MTPA). The MTPC group companies began researching ALS in 2001 through an iterative clinical platform over a 13-year period. In 2015, edaravone was approved as RADICUT® for the treatment of ALS in Japan and South Korea. Marketing authorizations were subsequently granted in Canada (October 2018), Switzerland (January 2019), Indonesia (July 2020), Thailand (April 2021), Malaysia (December 2021) and Brazil (February 2024). Marketing authorization for RADICAVA® Oral Suspension was granted in Canada (November 2022) and Switzerland (May 2023), and RADICUT® Oral Suspension 2.1% was granted regulatory approval in Japan in December 2022. To date, in the U.S., RADICAVA and RADICAVA ORS have been used to treat over 14,600 people with ALS, with over 1.8-million days of therapy, and have been prescribed by more than 2,300 HCPs.2-4 IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION Hypersensitivity ReactionsRADICAVA (edaravone) and RADICAVA ORS (edaravone) are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to edaravone or any of the inactive ingredients of this product. Hypersensitivity reactions (redness, wheals, and erythema multiforme) and cases of anaphylaxis (urticaria, decreased blood pressure, and dyspnea) have occurred with RADICAVA. Patients should be monitored carefully for hypersensitivity reactions. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue RADICAVA or RADICAVA ORS, treat per standard of care, and monitor until the condition resolves. Sulfite Allergic ReactionsRADICAVA and RADICAVA ORS contain sodium bisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions, including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown but occurs more frequently in asthmatic people. Adverse ReactionsThe most common adverse reactions (≥10%) reported in RADICAVA-treated patients were contusion (15%), gait disturbance (13%), and headache (10%). In an open label study, fatigue was also observed in 7.6% of patients receiving RADICAVA ORS.

Nelnet Renewable Energy Sharpens Focus on Commercial Solar,2024-04-12T12:55:00.000Z,Neutral,Positive,"Nelnet Renewable Energy shifts focus to commercial solar market, discontinues residential operations due to challenging conditions. Company aims to become a leading commercial solar EPC contractor.","Nelnet Renewable Energy Sharpens Focus on Commercial Solar Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Nelnet Renewable Energy shifts focus to commercial solar market, discontinues residential operations due to challenging conditions. Company aims to become a leading commercial solar EPC contractor. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Market Analyst The strategic pivot by Nelnet Renewable Energy to concentrate solely on the commercial solar market reflects a calculated response to the current energy landscape. This sector has demonstrated significant expansion, fueled by government incentives, declining costs of solar technology and an increasing corporate emphasis on sustainability. By channeling resources into this area, Nelnet is positioning itself to capitalize on economies of scale and more complex project scopes that are typical in the commercial versus residential space.Commercial solar projects tend to have higher margins and can be less sensitive to policy changes that often impact residential solar initiatives. This move could improve Nelnet's financial stability and offer a more predictable revenue stream. However, it's important to monitor how this shift will affect the company's market share and customer base, as exiting the residential market could lead to a loss of diversification in their portfolio. Sustainability Analyst Nelnet Renewable Energy's focus on the commercial solar market aligns with broader sustainability trends, where businesses are increasingly investing in clean energy solutions to reduce carbon footprints and meet ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) criteria. This strategic shift may enhance Nelnet's reputation as a sustainability leader and could open doors to partnerships with companies looking to bolster their green credentials.However, the decision to exit the residential market may be seen as a step back in democratizing solar energy access. The long-term impact on the company's sustainability image will depend on how effectively they manage their transition and communicate their ongoing commitment to energy innovation and operational excellence. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, Nelnet Renewable Energy's strategy to focus on commercial solar EPC operations could lead to an improved balance sheet. Commercial projects typically involve larger-scale investments and can lead to larger contracts, potentially resulting in increased revenue and higher profit margins. The decision to discontinue residential solar operations, while potentially reducing short-term revenues, may decrease operational complexities and costs associated with managing smaller-scale, lower-margin projects.Investors should watch for changes in the company's financial metrics, such as profit margins and return on investment, as these will be key indicators of the success of this strategic shift. Additionally, how Nelnet manages the transition, including the handling of warranty and contractual obligations, will be critical in maintaining stakeholder trust and avoiding potential legal or reputational risks. 04/12/2024 - 08:55 AM LINCOLN, Neb., April 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Nelnet Renewable Energy today announced a strategic shift in its solar engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) operations to focus exclusively on the commercial solar market. This decision underscores the company's commitment to leveraging its technical and project management strengths in a market that has shown robust growth potential and aligns with its long-term vision for sustainability, operational excellence, profitability, and energy innovation. ""Nelnet is committed to being an industry leading commercial solar EPC contractor and consultant with resources, knowledge, and people to deliver high quality projects and solutions for our customers,"" said Jim Kruger, Nelnet chief financial officer. In the face of challenging regulatory and economic conditions within the residential solar market and after careful deliberation, Nelnet Renewable Energy has made the difficult decision to discontinue its residential solar operations. Nelnet Renewable Energy will honor its existing warranty and contractual obligations for residential projects installed to date and will proactively communicate with customers and other relevant stakeholders about available service and support. Nelnet Renewable Energy will strive to make the transition as seamless as possible. With its solar financing and Inflation Reduction Act expertise, along with its investments in excellent people, quality workmanship, safety and long-term partnerships, Nelnet Renewable Energy is well-poised for further success in constructing and developing commercial solar projects, especially in the Midwest and New York. Nelnet Renewable Energy has approximately 15 projects under construction with an average size of 4 megawatts. ""We look forward to strengthening our position in the commercial solar market, driving innovation and contributing to a cleaner, more sustainable future for all,"" said Kruger. ""With a strong foundation in construction and solar experience, we are set to deliver projects that exceed expectations in quality and efficiency with meticulous execution. We thank our customers, partners, and stakeholders for their continued support and trust.""

Positive None. Negative III announces a decrease in revenue for the third quarter, signaling potential financial challenges ahead. 04/12/2024 - 09:00 AM Firms become more careful about transformation projects due to economic worries, need for ROI, ISG Provider Lens™ report says STAMFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Many SAP customers in the U.S. continue to pursue SAP S/4HANA transformation, but at a more deliberate pace amid current macroeconomic conditions, according to a new research report published today by Information Services Group (ISG) (Nasdaq: III), a leading global technology research and advisory firm. The 2024 ISG Provider Lens™ SAP Ecosystem report for the U.S. finds that S/4HANA transformation initiatives grew by between 10 percent and 12 percent in 2023, down slightly from earlier forecasts. Uncertain macroeconomic conditions have caused organizations to reassess such transformations, carefully evaluating subscription terms as they focus more sharply on IT return on investment. “A wait-and-watch approach by many companies has slowed adoption of S/4HANA, despite its potential benefits,” said Bill Huber, ISG partner, Digital Platforms and Solutions. “Enterprises face long implementation times, uncertain ROI, and often complex negotiations.” A majority of S/4HANA projects in the U.S. are greenfield initiatives, but there was an exponential growth in so-called bluefield implementations, in which organizations create a new S/4HANA instance and selectively migrate processes and data over time, the report says. This approach is most popular among large enterprises, where it has delivered greater business value. RISE with SAP, the company’s managed cloud offering for SAP ERP migration, is most popular among midmarket organizations. The average S/4HANA implementation time, though still several months long, decreased by four to five weeks in 2023, thanks to the increasing use of industry-specific solutions and automation tools by service providers, which increase productivity, ISG says. Manufacturing, healthcare, pharmaceutical and consumer packaged goods companies continued to lead in adoption of S/4HANA, motivated by the need to streamline production, optimize processes and improve customer experience through digital transformation of functions such as sales and customer service, the report says. Many financial services, retail, telecommunications and public-sector organizations remained skeptical of the benefits of the platform. As enterprises sought SAP outsourcing experts to help them overcome the challenges of migration to S/4HANA, managed cloud services grew in popularity for the second year in a row, ISG says. Services and solutions around SAP SuccessFactors, including employee experience management and payroll transformation services, are also gaining momentum. “Many organizations need to modernize HR functions as work modes change, and providers can help them do this in a unified way,” said Jan Erik Aase, partner and global leader, ISG Provider Lens Research. The report also explores other trends affecting the SAP ecosystem in the U.S., including rising provider investment in AI and generative AI (GenAI) and the growing importance of partnerships between service providers and hyperscale cloud companies.

The Fund's Ex-Dividend Date is 4-19-2024, Record Date is 4-22-2024, and Payable Date is 4-30-2024. Positive The Fund, MEGI, declared monthly distributions for April 2024 at $0.1250 per common share.

Investors will receive a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by MainStay CBRE Global Infrastructure Megatrends Term Fund (MEGI) regarding its monthly distributions is a key piece of information for current and potential investors. The distribution rate of 12.35% based on the closing price and 10.90% based on the closing NAV, is considerably higher than the average dividend yield for equity investments, which typically hovers around 2-4%. This high yield could be indicative of the fund's strong cash flow generation abilities, possibly stemming from investments in infrastructure assets that often provide stable, long-term cash flows.However, high yields can also signal potential risks. It is not uncommon for high distribution rates to be unsustainable or a sign that the market is pricing in some form of risk, such as underlying asset volatility or management's aggressive payout policies. Investors should analyze the fund's portfolio and performance to assess the sustainability of these distributions. The notice also indicates that the actual amounts and sources for tax purposes are estimates, suggesting that investors should be cautious about the reliability of the distribution's composition until finalized tax documents are provided. Tax Advisor From a taxation perspective, the notice provided by the Fund is a prelude to the tax implications that investors will face. The distinction between the distribution rate based on the closing price versus the NAV is important for investors to understand. The Fund's emphasis on the estimated nature of the distributions for tax reporting purposes implies that there could be adjustments to the character of the distributions, such as ordinary income, capital gains, or return of capital, which can affect an investor's tax liability.Investors should be aware that infrastructure funds, like MEGI, may have different tax treatment compared to other types of investments due to the nature of their underlying assets. The form 1099-DIV, which will be sent out, is important for investors to accurately report income and understand their tax obligations. Tax efficiency is an important aspect of investment returns and the fund's ability to manage this can have a significant impact on after-tax returns for investors. Market Research Analyst The infrastructure sector, which is the focus of the MainStay CBRE Global Infrastructure Megatrends Term Fund, is typically influenced by long-term trends such as urbanization, renewable energy expansion and government spending on public works. The fund's performance and distribution rates are likely reflective of these macroeconomic factors. The sector is known for its resilience during economic downturns due to the essential nature of infrastructure services, which can make it an attractive option for investors seeking stability.Investors should examine the fund's strategy in capitalizing on infrastructure megatrends, as well as its asset allocation and management's expertise in this area. The ability of the fund to maintain its distribution rate amidst economic cycles will be a test of its investment thesis. Market trends such as interest rate changes, regulatory developments and technological advancements in the infrastructure space can all have significant implications for the fund's performance and, by extension, its distribution payouts. 04/12/2024 - 09:00 AM NEW YORK, April 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- MainStay CBRE Global Infrastructure Megatrends Term Fund (the ""Fund"") (NYSE: MEGI) today announced the Fund's monthly distributions for April 2024 of $0.1250 per common share. The Fund's current annualized distribution rate is 12.35% based upon the closing price of $12.15 on April 10, 2024, and 10.90% based upon the Fund's closing NAV of $13.76 as of the same date. Dividend Distribution Schedule: Ex-Dividend Date Record Date Payable Date April 4-19-2024 4-22-2024 4-30-2024 The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this Notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. You should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the Fund's Distribution Policy. Future earnings of the Fund cannot be guaranteed, and the Fund's distribution policy is subject to change. For more information on the Fund, please visit the Fund's website here. The Fund's monthly distribution is set by its Board of Trustees. The Board reviews the Fund's distribution on a quarterly basis in view of its net investment income, realized and unrealized gains, and other net unrealized appreciation or income expected during the remainder of the year. The Fund strives to establish a level monthly distribution that, over the course of the year, will serve to distribute an amount closely approximating the Fund's net investment income and net realized capital gains during the year. The following table sets forth the estimated sources of income of the current distribution, and the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year to date from the following sources: net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains, net realized long-term capital gains and return of capital or other capital source. All amounts are expressed on a per share of common stock basis and as a percentage of the distribution amount.

You should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of its distribution to shareholders. Any distributions in excess of the Fund's current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated first, as a tax-deferred return of capital, which is applied against and will reduce the adjusted tax basis of shares and, after such adjusted basis is reduced to zero, will generally constitute capital gains. A return of capital distribution may lower a shareholder's basis in the Fund, causing a potential future tax consequence in connection with the sale of Fund shares, even if such shares are sold at a loss to the shareholder's initial investments. Any amounts and sources of distributions are only estimated and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of income of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend on the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will advise how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.

CMS sets final lump-sum purchase fee schedule amount, providing clarity for physicians and patients. Positive None. Negative None. Healthcare Policy Analyst The finalized Medicare reimbursement for personal exoskeletons represents a significant development in the intersection of healthcare policy and medical technology. The inclusion of a specific reimbursement rate under the DMEPOS Fee Schedule provides a clear financial framework for the distribution and adoption of these devices. This decision by CMS acknowledges the therapeutic benefits and necessity of exoskeleton technology for individuals with mobility impairments.From a policy standpoint, the 'gap filling' process used to determine the reimbursement rate indicates that CMS recognizes the innovative nature of exoskeletons and their lack of comparability to existing medical devices. The established rate of $91,032 sets a precedent for the valuation of similar future technologies. This move could potentially lead to increased research and development within the field, as manufacturers perceive a viable reimbursement pathway for cutting-edge medical devices.However, the impact on the overall Medicare budget and implications for premiums and deductibles for beneficiaries must be considered. While this policy enhances access to advanced medical technology, it also adds to the growing cost of Medicare, which could have long-term sustainability implications for the program. Medical Device Industry Analyst The CMS decision to set a reimbursement rate for personal exoskeletons is a pivotal moment for companies like Lifeward operating in the medical device sector. It effectively expands the market for these devices by enabling access to a broader patient population. For Lifeward, this development could lead to increased sales volumes, as physicians are more likely to prescribe devices with an established Medicare reimbursement pathway.By setting a price range with a ceiling of $109,238 and a floor of $81,929, CMS is also indirectly influencing the pricing strategies of exoskeleton manufacturers. Companies will need to consider this range when setting the commercial prices for their devices to ensure they are competitive within the Medicare framework.It is important to monitor the response from private insurers, as they often take cues from CMS decisions. If private insurers follow suit, the potential market for personal exoskeletons could grow significantly, impacting the stock performance of companies like Lifeward. Conversely, if insurers set lower reimbursement rates or impose stricter eligibility criteria, the market expansion could be less than expected. Rehabilitation Specialist The Medicare reimbursement for personal exoskeletons is likely to have a transformative effect on patient care within the realm of physical rehabilitation. Exoskeletons offer a novel approach to mobility assistance, providing a means for individuals with severe walking impairments to engage in ambulation activities. This can lead to improved health outcomes, such as enhanced cardiovascular health, reduced risk of secondary complications and improved quality of life.However, the adoption of this technology in clinical practice will require training for healthcare providers and adjustments in rehabilitation protocols. The long-term benefits and potential risks of widespread use of exoskeletons in the Medicare population will need to be closely studied. As a new treatment modality, it is essential to ensure that the devices are used appropriately and that they deliver on the promise of improved patient outcomes without introducing new health risks. 04/12/2024 - 08:30 AM Finalized Medicare reimbursement pathway for personal exoskeletons expands access for all eligible Medicare beneficiariesMARLBOROUGH, Mass. and YOKNEAM ILLIT, Israel, April 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ReWalk Robotics Ltd. (DBA Lifeward™), (Nasdaq: LFWD) (“Lifeward” or the “Company”), a global market leader delivering life-changing solutions to revolutionize what is possible in rehabilitation, recovery, and the pursuit of life’s passions in the face of physical limitation or disability, today announced that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) has officially revised its April 2024 Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies (“DMEPOS”) Fee Schedule to include a final lump-sum Medicare purchase fee schedule amount for personal exoskeletons with a ceiling-to-floor range from $109,238 to $81,929, and an established rate of $91,032 for each state. CMS states that it calculated this final payment amount by averaging pricing information for exoskeleton devices from Lifeward and other manufacturers. “This CMS publication finalizes the payment rate for the ReWalk Personal Exoskeleton for 2024, which importantly concludes all open items related to establishing Medicare benefit category assignment, coding, and reimbursement,” said Larry Jasinski, CEO of Lifeward. “With this clarity, physicians can now prescribe the ReWalk Personal Exoskeleton with confidence that Medicare patients will have an established reimbursement pathway, allowing us to accelerate the process of providing our devices to the people who need them.” The finalization of the payment level follows the previous determination by CMS through rulemaking that personal exoskeletons such as the ReWalk Personal Exoskeleton fall within the brace benefit category, which is reimbursed by Medicare on a lump sum basis. The final payment determination was made by CMS through a “gap filling” process after CMS determined that lower extremity exoskeletons incorporate “revolutionary features” that cannot be described by any existing code or combination of codes. The final payment rate is in effective for Medicare claims with dates of service on or after April 1, 2024.

The company released its financial and operating results for the full year 2023, reporting a net income before tax provision of $287,102. Solidion aims to provide valuable synthetic graphite, advanced anode materials, and patented battery technology to meet energy needs. Positive Solidion Technology completed a business combination with Honeycomb Battery Company. Shares of Solidion commenced trading on Nasdaq Global on February 2, 2024. The company reported a net income before tax provision of $287,102 for the full year 2023. Solidion focuses on delivering synthetic graphite, advanced anode materials, and patented battery technology to address energy needs. CEO Jaymes Winters highlighted the company's commitment to executing its business plan and providing advanced battery materials and technological solutions. Negative None. Financial Analyst Examining the financial results of Solidion Technology, Inc. post-business combination, there are several noteworthy points. The company's decision to exclude a significant $18.5 million change in fair value of derivative assets/liabilities when reporting net income before tax provision is an accounting move that aligns with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which often allows for such exclusions to provide a clearer picture of operating performance. This adjustment suggests that the company's underlying business operations, excluding these non-cash accounting entries, resulted in a modest profitability.However, the reported net income before tax of $287,102, while positive, is relatively small for a company now listed on the Nasdaq Global Market. This figure, when annualized, may indicate a lower earnings power than some investors might expect from a newly public company in the advanced battery technology sector, a field that is capital intensive and typically requires significant R&D expenditure. The market's response to this earnings report will likely hinge on the perceived sustainability of these earnings and the company's growth trajectory. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Solidion's entry into the public domain via a business combination and subsequent Nasdaq listing is a strategic move that could potentially enhance its visibility and access to capital. The advanced battery technology market is growing rapidly, driven by the global push for clean energy and electric vehicles. Solidion's focus on synthetic graphite and advanced anode materials positions it in a niche but critical segment of the battery supply chain.Investors will be keen on Solidion's future updates regarding the execution of its business plan. The company's patented battery technology could represent a competitive advantage if it leads to superior product performance or cost efficiencies. The long-term success will depend on the company's ability to scale production, manage costs and navigate the competitive landscape, which includes established players with deep pockets and extensive R&D capabilities. Energy Sector Analyst Considering the energy sector's increasing demand for innovative battery technologies, Solidion's focus on synthetic graphite derived from biomass is particularly significant. This approach not only taps into the growing sustainable energy trend but also addresses a critical aspect of battery production—sourcing materials with a lower environmental footprint. Solidion's advancements in this area could lead to partnerships or supply agreements with larger entities in the renewable energy and electric vehicle sectors, which are actively seeking to reduce their carbon footprint.The company's progress in developing advanced anode materials and patented battery technology will be closely monitored by stakeholders. The ability to deliver on these technological promises is important for Solidion to establish itself as a key player in the energy sector. The effectiveness of their technology in terms of energy density, charge cycles and overall battery life will be critical metrics for evaluating their potential market impact. 04/12/2024 - 09:00 AM Successful completion of business combination with Honeycomb Battery CompanyShares commenced trading on Nasdaq Global on February 2, 2024 DALLAS, April 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Solidion Technology, Inc.

(NASDAQ: MGRX) announces a technical agreement with Emifarma S.A. de C.V for the development and testing of Mango ED products for the Mexican and Latin American markets. This marks a significant step towards obtaining certification from COFEPRIS, opening doors for expansion into multiple markets. Positive None. Negative None. Pharmaceutical Industry Analyst The partnership between Mangoceuticals, Inc. and Emifarma S.A. de C.V for the development and testing of Mango ED products is a strategic move that could have significant implications for Mangoceuticals' market penetration and revenue growth, particularly in the Mexican and Latin American markets. By securing a technical agreement with a reputable manufacturing partner that is certified for Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) by COFEPRIS and other health agencies, Mangoceuticals is demonstrating a commitment to quality and regulatory compliance, which is essential in the pharmaceutical industry.The approval process by COFEPRIS is not only a regulatory hurdle but also a quality assurance measure that can build consumer trust in Mango ED products. If approved, the product's availability in over 40,000 pharmacies and retail outlets could substantially increase the company's distribution channels and sales volumes. However, the pharmaceutical market in Latin America is competitive, with strict regulations and varying consumer preferences. The success of Mango ED's market entry will depend on effective marketing strategies, competitive pricing and navigating the complex regulatory environment. Market Research Analyst Entering the erectile dysfunction (ED) medication market in Mexico and Latin America could be promising for Mangoceuticals due to the prevalence of ED in these regions and the cultural openness to OTC medications for this condition. The partnership with Emifarma could provide Mangoceuticals with an established manufacturing infrastructure and local expertise, which are critical when entering a new market. This move could also diversify Mangoceuticals' revenue streams and reduce its dependence on existing markets.However, the company must consider the competitive landscape, including the presence of generic ED medications and other international brands. Additionally, consumer behavior and brand loyalty in the pharmaceutical sector can be challenging to shift, especially for a new entrant. Mangoceuticals will need to invest in market research to understand the local consumer behavior and preferences to tailor their marketing and product positioning strategies accordingly. Regulatory Affairs Specialist Obtaining certification from COFEPRIS is a critical step for Mangoceuticals to ensure compliance with Mexican health regulations. COFEPRIS's recognition in other Latin American countries can streamline the process for Mangoceuticals to enter additional markets, leveraging the certification to gain faster access. However, the company must navigate each country's unique regulatory landscape, as mutual recognition does not equate to automatic approval.Moreover, the bioequivalence and stability testing required by COFEPRIS are rigorous processes that ensure the product's quality, safety and efficacy. These tests can be resource-intensive and time-consuming, but they are necessary to meet the standards set forth by the regulatory body. Mangoceuticals must manage this process efficiently to avoid delays in product launch and additional costs that could impact the company's financial projections and investor expectations. 04/12/2024 - 08:45 AM Signifies the first major step towards the application process for the certification of its Mango ED oral dissolvable products by Mexico’s health governing agency, COFEPRIS Dallas, Texas, April 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mangoceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: MGRX) (“MangoRx” or the “Company”), a company focused on developing, marketing, and selling a variety of men’s health and wellness products in the area of erectile dysfunction (ED), hair growth and hormone replacement therapies is excited to announce that its subsidiary, MangoRx Mexico S.A. de C.V. (“MangoRx Mexico”), has secured and executed a technical agreement with Emifarma S.A. de C.V (“Emifarma”) for the initial stages of development and testing (Bioequivalence and Accelerated Stability, required to obtain registry from COFEPRIS) of the Company’s Mango ED products intended for the Mexican and Latin American markets. Founded in 1998 by a group of pharmaceutical professionals with experience in Development, Production and Quality, Emifarma is a Mexican company that employs more than 100 workers and has 4 plants that specialize in: Hormonal, Injectable, Additive and Oral Solid (tablet and powdered) products where they serve as a manufacturing partner for some of the most relevant pharmaceutical companies both domestically and internationally, operating in Mexico. Emifarma is Certified for Good manufacturing Practices (GMP) by the following organizations: COFEPRIS, INVIMA, Ministry of Health of the Republic of Peru. “This marks an enormous milestone for MangoRx as this signifies the most crucial first step in our highly anticipated planned expansion into the Mexican and Latin American markets,” noted Jacob Cohen, MangoRx’s Co-Founder and CEO, who continued, “As we had noted earlier upon our announcement of this growth initiative, establishing a pharmaceutical manufacturing partner was the catalyst necessary to begin product development for testing as required for the application and certification with the Comisión Federal para la Protección contra Riesgos Sanitarios (“COFEPRIS”). Assuming such approval is obtained, we expect to be able to start marketing and selling our Mango ED products to the more than 40,000 pharmacies, retail outlets, and convenience stores across Mexico.” In addition, achieving the COFEPRIS certification is anticipated to offer additional advantages for further expanding sales of MangoRx products internationally into other large and growing Latin American markets that offer ED medications as OTC products. Specifically, COFEPRIS is recognized in the following additional countries: Columbia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Chile, Costa Rica and Panama. Efi Karchmer, President of MangoRx Mexico stated, “after visiting, interviewing, and negotiating with many different pharmaceutical manufacturing companies over the past several months, we are very excited about our decision to partner with Emifarma in this endeavor. Each of Emifarma’s facilities has its own warehousing of both raw materials and finished products, a dedicated quality lab as well as full capability for packaging such as blisters, packets, envelopes, and secondary packaging such as boxes, bags, pouches, and trays which gives them a lot of flexibility and along with their proactiveness and out of the box thinking makes them an ideal partner. We have no doubt that Emifarma will be able to provide us with the production, manufacturing, and quality that we need as we work to scale our business in the Mexico and other Latin American countries.” According to a recent market study and analysis report conducted by Groupo Knobloch, the estimated annual market size in Mexico for ED pharmaceutical products is USD $216 million with approximately 24 million units sold annually, which market is estimated to be growing at a rate of 4% per year at an average sales price of USD $8.50 per unit. About MangoRx MangoRx is focused on developing a variety of men's health and wellness products and services via a secure telemedicine platform. To date, the Company has identified men's wellness telemedicine services and products as a growing sector and especially related to the area of erectile dysfunction (ED), hair growth and hormone replacement therapies. Interested consumers can use MangoRx’s telemedicine platform for a smooth experience.

The agreement includes the delivery and installation of the products within 9 months, highlighting the robots' advanced features like self-navigation, live video streaming, face and license plate detection, and more. The deal is expected to boost business expansion and sales, reinforcing EZGO's leading position in short-distance transport solutions.","EZGO Enters into an RMB13 Million Procurement Agreement for Sale of Security Patrol Robots and Platform Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary EZGO Technologies announced a procurement agreement with Hangzhou Huiyu Zhichuang Industrial Co., for the sale of security patrol robots and an intelligent patrol platform for $1.84 million, showcasing the company's strong R&D capabilities. The agreement includes the delivery and installation of the products within 9 months, highlighting the robots' advanced features like self-navigation, live video streaming, face and license plate detection, and more. The deal is expected to boost business expansion and sales, reinforcing EZGO's leading position in short-distance transport solutions. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The procurement agreement between EZGO Technologies Ltd. and Hangzhou Huiyu Zhichuang Industrial Co., Ltd. illustrates a strategic move within the smart transportation and security sector. The sale of security patrol robots and an intelligent patrol platform for a significant sum reflects a growing market for automated security solutions in industrial settings. This transaction not only generates immediate revenue for EZGO but also has the potential to foster long-term business relationships and recurring sales, particularly with Huiyu Group's industrial parks.From a market trend perspective, the incorporation of features such as self-navigation and live video streaming in security robots aligns with the increasing demand for advanced surveillance technology. As industries seek to enhance security measures, companies like EZGO that can provide innovative solutions are likely to see an uptick in demand. The technology's compatibility with smart patrol systems suggests a forward-thinking approach, catering to the digital transformation goals of modern enterprises.For shareholders, the key takeaway is the company's ability to secure sizable contracts and its focus on sustained order growth, which could translate into stable revenue streams and potentially improved stock performance in the long term. However, it's important to monitor the company's execution of the contract within the stipulated timeline, as delays could impact customer satisfaction and investor confidence. Financial Analyst With EZGO's announcement of a procurement agreement valued at approximately $1.84 million, investors should note the immediate positive impact on the company's financials. This deal represents a significant cash inflow, which could enhance EZGO's balance sheet and provide capital for further research and development or expansion. It's worth noting that the company's ability to secure contracts from top-ranked enterprises like Huiyu Group may serve as a positive indicator of its competitive positioning within the industry.Investors should consider the implications of this deal on EZGO's revenue projections and earnings potential. The nine-month delivery timeline suggests that revenue recognition from this contract will contribute to the financial results of the upcoming quarters. This could be a positive signal for the company's short-term financial health, provided that the cost of fulfilling the contract does not exceed expectations.However, the reliance on a single contract for a considerable portion of revenue does carry risks, such as customer concentration risk. Should any issues arise with Huiyu Zhichuang, the financial repercussions for EZGO could be significant. Diversification of the customer base is a critical factor for mitigating such risks. Supply Chain Management Expert The procurement agreement between EZGO and Hangzhou Huiyu Zhichuang Industrial Co., Ltd. underscores the importance of a robust supply chain and operational efficiency. Delivering and installing the security robots and platform within nine months is a considerable undertaking that will require effective supply chain management to meet the deadline. The ability to deliver on time will not only affect customer satisfaction but also the company's reputation and potential for future contracts.Investors should be aware of the challenges associated with scaling up production and managing logistics for high-tech products. Any disruptions in the supply chain, such as delays in sourcing components or logistical bottlenecks, could lead to delays in delivery and increased costs. On the other hand, successful execution could enhance EZGO's operational credibility and lead to process improvements that benefit future projects.It is also essential to consider the after-sale support for these advanced security systems. Maintenance, software updates and potential hardware issues will require ongoing support, which EZGO must be prepared to provide. This could have implications for operating expenses and the need for a skilled workforce to maintain service quality. 04/12/2024 - 08:00 AM CHANGZHOU, China, April 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- EZGO Technologies Ltd.

While the radio and music industries have previously been able to analyze airplay and spins, both industries are now able to see the impact of those spins with actual broadcast listening metrics. The way consumers view their vehicles has changed considerably in recent years. The vehicle is now viewed as a destination unto itself for work, socializing and even relaxing. As such, consumers are more interested in engaging with various forms of content in the car. DTS AutoStage is the only independent media platform creating a unique in-car infotainment experience that seamlessly integrates audio, radio with streaming video and soon even games, offering personalized content to everyone in the car. The DTS AutoStage Broadcaster Portal, which provides radio broadcasters worldwide with insights into where their audiences are listening, when they are listening, how long they are listening and the content they enjoy the most, represents data from the millions of vehicles globally equipped with the DTS AutoStage platform. Insights from the portal further Xperi’s mission to support the broadcast community by empowering broadcasters to forge deeper connections with their audiences. Top Most Listened-To Songs In-Vehicle (U.S. and Global) Q1 2024 Rapper Jack Harlow’s “Lovin on Me,” which appeared first on TikTok, was the number one most listened-to song in-vehicle in the U.S. in Q1 2024, displacing Taylor Swift, whose “Cruel Summer” dominated both the U.S. and global in-vehicle charts in 2023. Q1 saw Swift drop to number three globally, as perennial hitmaker Dua Lipa’s “Houdini” became the most listened-to song in-vehicle globally. Canadian Tate McRae’s “Greedy” rose to the number two spot on both the U.S. and global Q1 2024 in-vehicle charts. Miley Cyrus’ Grammy-winning “Flowers,” which had been number three in the U.S. and number one globally with in-vehicle listeners in 2023, dropped out of the top five as Doja Cat’s “Agora Hills” rose to number three in the U.S., and Tyla’s “Water” held the number five spot both globally and in the U.S. Luke Combs’ “Fast Car,” the only male artist in the U.S. top five most listened-to songs in-vehicle for 2023, dropped out of the top five but remained in the top 10, showing the staying power of the song.

Tyla “Water” “These lists chart actual sessions by in-vehicle radio listeners and are just the opening salvo of our data insights for broadcasters, which go deep into where, when and what in-vehicle listeners are enjoying, including listener heat maps and the songs, ads and program segments listeners enjoy the most,” said Joe D’Angelo, senior vice president, broadcast at Xperi. “And, because we can track radio plays for songs across all our global radio station partners, we’re able to analyze specific scenarios and trends. For example, how a song might be breaking and how the audience is responding.” DTS AutoStage Song Impact Report: 80s Folk/Rock Classic Goes Country, Then Back to Its Roots DTS AutoStage’s Song Impact Report spotlights the in-vehicle, active listening trajectory of Luke Combs’ country music cover of Tracy Chapman’s 1988 folk-rock hit “Fast Car” to becoming one of the top five most listened-to songs in-vehicle in the U.S. in 2023 – followed by the breakout of Chapman’s original version, 36 years after its original airing. While the phenomenon of “Fast Car” has been much reported on, this is the first time its path for active in-vehicle listeners has been tracked. Combs’ cover received some early spins on radio in March 2023 and officially dropped in April 2023. Debuting as the 10,000th most played song on radio for in-vehicle listeners, in a mere five weeks it had broken through the top 100 and was well on its way to the number one spot, which it achieved the week of July 24, 2023. During that climb, it experienced the kind of ups and downs expected as the audience connected with the new cut. By the time it reached number one on the DTS AutoStage Song Impact Report, it had been heard more than 650,000 times in DTS AutoStage-enabled cars and played on more than 1,100 stations in the U.S. alone. The connection with audiences and support of program directors in the U.S. and around the world only continued to grow as the Grammy nominations were announced and awarded. The cover spent 23 weeks in the top 10 in 2023 and was heard over four million times, finishing as the fifth most-played song in the U.S. for 2023. The success of the track continued into 2024 with “Fast Car” staying in the top 20 most-played songs in the U.S. and heard over 1.6 million times in Q1 2024. At the time Combs’ “Fast Car” became the number one most listened-to song in-vehicle, Tracy Chapman’s original version ranked at only 1,544 in in-vehicle listening, but by the week of Feb. 5, 2024, in the wake of Chapman’s stunning live performance with Combs at the 2024 Grammys, in-vehicle listeners went back to Chapman’s original, driving it up the charts to number 292. View the full list of 2023’s Top 100 Most Listened-to Songs In-Vehicle in the U.S. and Globally here. “The radio industry has long reported spins, which provided some measure of a song’s performance, but in today’s digital age, it’s really all about the listener and how they are responding to new music,” continued D’Angelo. “For the first time, broadcast radio program directors and record promoters can access near real-time information about how a song is actually landing with the audience and if engagement is building, waning or flattening. This information is critical as both industries make decisions regarding programming, rotations and artist promotions.” The “Fast Car” snapshot is one example of the impact on listener insights and the implications it can have on the broadcast community.

The Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System Code K1007 approved for billing. Ekso Bionics to collaborate with clinics for patient qualification and training. Positive None. Negative None. Healthcare Financial Analyst The recent determination by the PDAC contractor for CMS regarding the Ekso Indego Personal exoskeleton represents a significant milestone for Ekso Bionics. The set payment level of $91,031.93 for Medicare reimbursement may have a substantial impact on the company's revenue streams. This pricing decision not only validates the product's market viability but also opens up a broader customer base. The adoption of Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System Code K1007 potentially simplifies the billing process for healthcare providers, which could lead to increased usage.From a financial perspective, the reimbursement approval is likely to enhance the company's attractiveness to investors, as it provides a clearer pathway to market penetration and revenue predictability. It's important to note that the pricing is in line with the high costs associated with advanced medical technologies, reflecting the significant R&D investment and the value of the innovative features of the device. However, investors should monitor the adoption rate closely, as it will be a critical determinant of the financial impact of this reimbursement level. Medical Device Market Analyst The exoskeleton technology market is rapidly evolving and the approval of Medicare reimbursement for the Ekso Indego Personal exoskeleton by CMS is a testament to the product's clinical utility and potential market growth. The exoskeleton's advanced features, such as the modular design and advanced gait mode, position it competitively in the market. The ability for faster walking speeds can distinguish it from other mobility aids.This reimbursement approval could serve as a catalyst for market expansion, as it not only increases the device's accessibility to patients with spinal cord injuries but also sets a precedent for other public and private payers to follow suit. Ekso Bionics' existing relationship with over 260 clinics provides a strong foundation for rapid dissemination and adoption of the technology. However, the long-term impact on the market will depend on the clinical outcomes and cost-benefit analysis from the broader use of the device. Health Policy Expert The decision by CMS to reimburse the Ekso Indego Personal exoskeleton at a specific payment level is a significant development in health policy, reflecting a growing recognition of the benefits of assistive technologies in rehabilitation. The use of the K1007 billing code may streamline the reimbursement process and encourage other insurers to adopt similar policies. This could lead to increased access to innovative treatments for individuals with spinal cord injuries, potentially improving patient outcomes and quality of life.While this is a positive development for patients and Ekso Bionics, it's essential to consider the broader implications for the healthcare system. Reimbursement at this level may influence the cost of care and insurance premiums. Additionally, the potential increase in demand for the Ekso Indego Personal will require careful monitoring to ensure that the supply chain and clinical training can keep pace, thus avoiding bottlenecks that could delay patient access to this technology. 04/12/2024 - 08:00 AM SAN RAFAEL, Calif., April 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ekso Bionics Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: EKSO) (the “Company” or “Ekso Bionics”), an industry leader in exoskeleton technology for medical and industrial use, today announced that the Pricing, Data Analysis, and Coding (“PDAC”) contractor for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) has determined a final payment level of $91,031.93 for Medicare reimbursement of the Ekso Indego Personal, which took effect on April 1, 2024. As previously announced, CMS approved use of Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System Code K1007 to bill Medicare for the Ekso Indego Personal. This code can also be used by other public health insurance programs as well as private payers. Ekso Bionics will work with inpatient and outpatient clinics across the country to qualify individuals with spinal cord injuries who can potentially benefit from the Ekso Indego Personal. Ekso Bionics’ expansive clinical and rehabilitation customer base, which includes more than 260 clinics across North America, have the skilled therapists and clinicians to train individuals over the course of several sessions to maximize clinical outcomes. Ekso Bionics has worked with many of these facilities by offering clinical demonstrations, where interested individuals can trial the Ekso Indego Personal. “There are clinically demonstrated advantages for individuals with SCI who train with Ekso’s Indego Personal device in post-acute care that help improve their quality of life,” said Jenna Tosto-Mancuso, PT, DPT, NCS, Clinical Manager, Division of Rehabilitation Innovation at Mount Sinai. “As patients can now benefit from reimbursement, those covered by CMS will gain improved access to this life changing device, which has the ability to accelerate their recovery outside of in-clinic or hospital rehabilitation and allow for better mobility in everyday life, which has associated mental health benefits.” Ekso Indego Personal is a modular, lightweight and easily portable exoskeleton that is safe for use in most home and community environments. The device contains an advanced gait mode where the individual can reach faster walking speeds, granting them a new level of independence.

Negative None. 04/12/2024 - 08:00 AM Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - April 12, 2024) - ParcelPal Logistics Inc. (OTCQB: PTNYF) (CSE: PKG) (FSE: PT0A) (the ""Company"" or ""ParcelPal""), is pleased to announce that it continues to make progress on securing a viable site in the southern U.S. to host the previously announced antmining machine business line. It is important to note that this site is the largest to date in terms of potential processing power with up to 100 Megawatts of power, capable of hosting up to 38,000 antmining machines. ParcelPal plans to enter into a letter of intent for this property in the next week, assuming it can secure acceptable financing terms on the equipment needs and delivery schedules from all other parties involved. Unlike prior sites under consideration, this site is a natural gas site, which would power the electricity needed to operate the antminer machines. To this end, the Company has entered into negotiations with an on-site generator supply company and has sourced the sites equipment needs, each of which is contingent upon the final consummation of the other components of the deal, including signing the final equipment financing terms, as well as the payment terms to the Company by the third party whose machinery the Company would be hosting. Based on initial projections, assuming the Company generates the maximum 100MW electricity and output capacity generation by the antminers, and assuming the anticipated hosting fee, ParcelPal can project gross revenue at this site to be approximately $3,400,000.00 per month. The Company estimates its net profit margins to be approximately 15-20%. CEO Rich Wheeless stated, ""I am excited to work to secure this property as it has the potential to host the largest number of antminers on one site and to scale operations in the shortest amount of time (comparative to traditional warehouses and data centers, which have inherent electrical capacity limits in many cases). Additionally, the energy rates are more favorable than the other facilities the Company has considered and conducted diligence on to date. We continue to work diligently to execute and consummate the proposed antminer hosting business line. While there are hurdles and material negotiations and contingencies involved with any site, which we cannot guarantee will be overcome, we are working very hard and remain focused on getting this business line launched and operational with our first qualified property in the second fiscal quarter of 2024, as it presents a very good business expansion and revenue generation opportunity."" Update From the CEO, Rich Wheeless, on Details of the Current Stock Roll-Back:Rich Wheeless, in addressing the Company's shareholders stated: ""Importantly, we have completed a 1 for 10 reverse stock split, which was only executed after much consideration by our team internally. It was a difficult decision, but for us to move the Company forward with the opportunities that are currently on the table, it was a necessary move for us to get ParcelPal in a more suitable situation for growth, capital needs, and to be able to meet our minimum price per share exchange compliance requirements. This might be a moment of discontent or uncertainty for some of our shareholders, but shareholders should know that we are working exceedingly hard, and with a very limited budget in what has been a very volatile and tight capital markets environment. With that, we take this step with an eye toward the future and in an attempt to provide shareholders with the potential value that our business expansion and other efforts we believe will produce. We value our business and the shareholders enough to do the hard thing even if it seems to be at the wrong time. We will continue to give our best effort in making sure the business commitments we are currently making will be the most beneficial moves for the Company as a whole, for its shareholders, and the bottom-line revenue of the Company. It's not easy to convey a message with the proper amount of totality to keep all parties involved, but we want to assure you that we continue to work hard to move this Company forward on the right path with absolute conviction and consideration to all involved.""We look forward to providing additional material updates in the coming days and weeks and appreciate the support from our shareholders.

Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary NextPlat Corp announces a definitive business combination agreement with Progressive Care Inc., expecting revenue synergies and significant cost reductions. The merger will result in Progressive Care becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of NextPlat, with shareholders receiving newly issued shares of NextPlat's Common Stock. The transaction, approved by both boards, is set to close in the third quarter of 2024, pending regulatory and stockholder approvals. Positive Revenue synergies and cost reductions expected from the business combination Progressive Care to become a wholly owned subsidiary of NextPlat Shareholders to receive newly issued shares of NextPlat's Common Stock Transaction approved by both NextPlat and Progressive Care's Boards of Directors Negative None. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the definitive business combination between NextPlat and Progressive Care represents a strategic consolidation that can potentially streamline operations and enhance shareholder value. By merging with a majority-owned subsidiary, NextPlat is poised to integrate Progressive Care's assets and capabilities more deeply into its business model, potentially leading to revenue growth and cost efficiencies.The focus on top-line growth through the expansion of consumer offerings, such as the launch of the Florida Sunshine brand, indicates an aggressive strategy to capture more market share in the personalized healthcare services marketplace. However, the success of such new product lines will depend on market acceptance and the effectiveness of NextPlat's marketing strategies. Investors should monitor consumer response to these new offerings as an indicator of the merger's success.Significant cost reductions through the elimination of redundancies post-merger could improve profitability. However, the execution of these cost-cutting measures must be managed carefully to avoid any negative impact on the company's operations or customer service levels. Investors should look for clear communication from NextPlat on how these reductions will be achieved without compromising the quality of service. Financial Analyst The exchange ratio of NextPlat shares for Progressive Care, based on a 20-day volume-weighted average price, suggests a valuation strategy that could be favorable for Progressive Care shareholders, as it was determined at a price per share above its 20-day VWAP. This could imply a premium for Progressive Care's shares, which might incentivize shareholders to approve the merger.Investors should examine the financials of both companies to understand the merger's implications fully. A comprehensive analysis of Progressive Care's contribution to NextPlat's revenue and profit margins post-merger will be critical in assessing the long-term financial impact of this consolidation. Additionally, the market will react to the actual realization of the projected synergies and cost savings, so it's important to track the company's performance against these projections over time.The unanimous approval of the merger by both Boards of Directors indicates strong internal support, which can be a positive signal to the market. However, the real test will be the merger's execution and whether the anticipated synergies materialize into tangible financial results. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the involvement of special committees of independent directors and the engagement of separate legal advisors for NextPlat and Progressive Care demonstrate a structured approach to the merger, aimed at ensuring fairness and transparency. This is particularly important in transactions involving a parent company and its subsidiary, where conflicts of interest could arise.Investors should be aware that the merger's closure is still subject to regulatory and stockholder approvals, indicating that there are still hurdles to overcome. Regulatory scrutiny will likely focus on antitrust considerations and the maintenance of a competitive market post-merger. Stockholder approval will hinge on the shareholders' belief in the merger's value proposition.The detailed disclosure in the Current Reports on Form 8-K will be a key document for stakeholders to assess the merger's terms and its strategic rationale. Stakeholders should review these filings to understand the potential impact of the merger on their investments. 04/12/2024 - 08:41 AM Transaction Expected to Provide Revenue Synergies and Significant Initial Annual Operating Cost Reductions COCONUT GROVE, Fla. and MIAMI, April 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- NextPlat Corp (NASDAQ: NXPL, NXPLW) (""NextPlat"" or the ""Company""), a global e-Commerce provider, today announced that it has entered into a definitive business combination agreement with its majority owned subsidiary, Progressive Care Inc. (OTCQB: RXMD) (""Progressive Care""). The definitive business combination agreement was negotiated by the special committees of independent directors of NextPlat and Progressive Care's respective Boards of Directors. Under the terms of the business combination agreement, a wholly owned subsidiary of NextPlat (the ""Merger Sub"") will merge with and into Progressive Care, with the Merger Sub surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of NextPlat and be renamed Progressive Care LLC. Upon closing the merger, Progressive Care shareholders will receive newly issued, registered shares of NextPlat's Common Stock. The exchange ratio of NextPlat shares to be issued in the business combination, not subject to adjustment, was calculated based upon a 20-day, volume-weighted average price (""VWAP"") of NextPlat's Common Stock preceding execution of the business combination agreement and a value per share of Common Stock of Progressive Care at $2.20. The exchange ratio was determined at a price per Common Share of Progressive Care above its 20-day VWAP on the date of execution and follows a comprehensive, independent, third-party valuation analysis conducted at the request of Progressive Care's special committee of independent directors. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of both NextPlat and Progressive Care. It is expected to close in the third quarter of 2024, subject to regulatory and stockholder approvals, and other customary closing conditions. Additional information may be found in the Current Reports on Form 8-K that will be subsequently filed by NextPlat and Progressive Care with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. ""Over the past two years, our team has worked to better position Progressive Care for continued growth and success, the results of which can clearly been seen in its strong fiscal 2023 results. In consultation with the Board, we believe that the long-term value of Progressive Care can best be realized through a combination with NextPlat, thereby making it a wholly owned subsidiary. As a result of this business combination, we expect to quickly realize an array of valuable synergies from additional top-line growth to improved bottom-line profitability. These benefits include the ability to expand Progressive Care's consumer offerings with new OTC products such as our soon-to-be-launched Florida Sunshine brand of premium-grade vitamins and dietary supplements, and significant combined annual cost reductions resulting from the elimination of complexities and redundant public company legal and accounting expenses,"" said Charles M. Fernandez, Executive Chairman and CEO of NextPlat Corp. ""Progressive Care's continued success provides us with great confidence it is ability to contribute positively to the value of NextPlat as we seek to further expand our access into the large personalized healthcare services marketplace.""

GE HealthCare to feature Mobile Mammography Screening Truck along with Latest AI Platform as part of SBI2024 Breast Cancer Imaging Showcase,2024-04-12T12:00:00.000Z,Neutral,Positive,GE HealthCare to Showcase Latest Breast Cancer Detection Technology at SBI 2024 Symposium,"GE HealthCare to feature Mobile Mammography Screening Truck along with Latest AI Platform as part of SBI2024 Breast Cancer Imaging Showcase Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags AI Rhea-AI Summary GE HealthCare to Showcase Latest Breast Cancer Detection Technology at SBI 2024 Symposium Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in mammography, as demonstrated by GE HealthCare's MyBreastAI Suite, represents a significant advancement in breast cancer detection. This technology notably addresses the limitations of traditional mammograms in women with dense breast tissue. By incorporating AI applications such as ProFound AI for DBT, SecondLook for 2D Mammography and PowerLook Density Assessment, clinicians can potentially identify malignancies earlier, which is critical given that early detection is a key factor in improving survival rates.From a research perspective, the operational productivity improvements promised by the MyBreastAI Suite could reduce the time radiologists spend on each case, allowing for a higher volume of screenings without sacrificing accuracy. This efficiency gain could translate into increased capacity for healthcare providers and potentially lead to reduced wait times for patients. Healthcare Industry Analyst GE HealthCare's showcase of the Pristina Bright solution at the Society of Breast Imaging Symposium could have implications for the adoption of Contrast-Enhanced Mammography (CEM) technology. The comprehensive solution aims to simplify the process for healthcare providers to start new contrast programs, which could lead to wider utilization of CEM. Given that CEM has been shown to reveal lesions not visible in routine mammography, its increased adoption could lead to better diagnostic outcomes for patients.The business impact of such technology extends to the potential for healthcare facilities to market their advanced capabilities to referring doctors and patients. Facilities that adopt the Pristina Bright offering may gain a competitive edge by differentiating their services with the ability to perform rapid biopsies and handle a higher throughput of patients, which could ultimately affect their financial performance and market share within the diagnostic imaging sector. 04/12/2024 - 08:00 AM The latest MyBreastAI Suite* supports clinicians in accelerating breast cancer detection, while the company’s Pristina Bright** solution helps healthcare providers start a new contrast program. MONTREAL--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- GE HealthCare (Nasdaq: GEHC), a leader in breast health technology and diagnostics, will feature its latest breast cancer detection technology during the 2024 Society of Breast Imaging Symposium in Montreal, Canada, April 11-14, 2024. This year’s showcase will feature the Mobile Mammography Screening Truck, the recently released MyBreastAI Suite* and Pristina Bright** offering to demonstrate the company’s personalized approach to transforming breast cancer imaging. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women, with one in eight facing diagnosis in their lifetime.1 Regular mammograms are critical, but their effectiveness is reduced in women with dense breast tissue, who are four to six times more likely to develop breast cancer.2 As a result, clinicians are turning to supplemental screening options and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to help enhance the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer, improve patient outcomes, and help with radiology workflow so more patients can benefit from the world’s most sophisticated mammography tools.3 GE HealthCare’s latest MyBreastAI Suite provides an all-in-one AI platform optimized for mammography to support clinicians with breast cancer detection. With this initial release, MyBreastAI Suite integrates three AI applications from iCAD including ProFound AI for DBT, SecondLook for 2D Mammography and PowerLook Density Assessment to help support early detection and improve patient outcomes, as well as help radiology departments improve operational productivity. ""As part of GE HealthCare’s ongoing commitment to transform healthcare and improve patient outcomes, we continue to explore how we can leverage the power of AI in mammography to support the early detection of breast cancer,” says Pooja Pathak – Vice President and General Manager of Mammography. “We look forward to sharing this latest tool in our portfolio of technologies for personalized breast cancer care with the breast imaging community this year at SBI2024.” Contrast-Enhanced Mammography (CEM), a technology first pioneered by GE HealthCare in 2010, is a game changer in breast diagnostic imaging and biopsy care - with over 200 publications that demonstrate its clinical performances. In an effort to help further advance breast cancer and support healthcare providers in starting a new contrast program, the company will also be showcasing its Pristina Bright offering - a comprehensive solution that combines SenoBright HD, Pristina Serena, and Serena Bright with an education program that includes dedicated on-site support, CME accredited self-assessment, and access to a users’ club to share with experts around the globe and leverage resources needed to market their facility among referring doctors and patients. With Pristina Bright, clinicians can see lesions that cannot be seen on routine mammography4 5 6 and biopsy what is seen within 15 minutes.7 To help improve overall productivity, Pristina Bright can also help providers take more patients on their system, with the ability to image up to 30 patients a day with contrast mammography8 through an easy-to-read exam. “Through our research and clinical experiences, contrast enhanced mammography (CEM) continues to emerge as game-changer in helping to improve breast cancer outcomes for patients facing this difficult diagnosis,” shares Dr. Jordana Phillips – Radiologist at Boston Medical Center. “When it comes to findings that are difficult to define, CEM leverages the addition of a contrast agent to highlight unusual areas of blood flow - providing an efficient yet familiar, patient-centric approach to evaluate the presence of cancer with high sensitivity and specificity. With contrast, we’re able to turn a normal mammogram into something that provides so much more information which accelerates our ability to make a confident diagnosis. We’re excited to be joining GE HealthCare and the breast imaging community at SBI 2024 to share more about our experience through the hands-on learning course, as well as share how we’ve implemented CEM as part of our efforts to provide personalized breast cancer care to community we serve.” As part of the company’s commitment to enabling access to healthcare, GE HealthCare will have its mobile mammography showcase onsite. Attendees will have the unique opportunity to explore the capabilities of this unit designed to offer convenient screening set-up within the familiar environment of a workplace. The truck is equipped with the Senographe Pristina and Invenia ABUS to ensure accurate and efficient screenings. Visit booth 301 to learn more about GE HealthCare’s personalized breast cancer screening solutions, including: Senographe Pristina, a mammography system designed to provide a better patient experience and optimized for rapid diagnosis; Invenia ABUS, the first FDA-approved automatic breast ultrasound supplemental screening specifically designed for detecting cancer in dense breast; SenoBright HD Contrast Enhanced Mammography (CEM), which combines mammography and vascular-based screening methods to highlight areas of unusual blood-flow patterns that may indicate malignancy - helping reduce the masking effect of fibro glandular breast tissue so lesions can be more clearly identifiable; and Serena Bright, the industry’s first contrast-guided biopsy solution which transforms the screening room into an interventional suite if medical indications recommend pathology. *MyBreastAI suite is a commercial offering that includes GE HealthCare’s Edison Health Services platform, ProFound AI® for DBT, SecondLook for 2D Mammography and PowerLook® Density Assessment. These applications are provided by iCAD.

Financial Analyst The reported increase in net premiums written by 18% and net premiums earned by 19% for Progressive Corporation indicates a significant expansion in the company's underwriting activities. This growth is a positive signal for investors as it reflects both a larger customer base and potentially improved pricing power. The substantial 421% rise in net income year-over-year, alongside a notable per-share increase from $0.75 to $3.94, suggests a highly profitable quarter, likely influenced by both operational efficiencies and favorable claims trends.Moreover, the improvement in the combined ratio from 99.0 to 86.1 points to enhanced underwriting profitability. A combined ratio below 100 indicates that the company is making an underwriting profit, which is a key metric for evaluating the performance of insurance companies. The total pretax net realized gains on securities also saw a significant increase, which may reflect savvy investment strategies or favorable market conditions. However, the change in accounting calendar might have affected the comparability of the results, hence investors should interpret the year-over-year comparisons with caution. Market Research Analyst Progressive's reported 7% growth in policies in force for personal lines, including both agency and direct auto, as well as a 10% increase in property business, suggests a robust demand for their insurance products. This growth is indicative of strong market positioning and effective customer acquisition strategies. The expansion in total personal auto and special lines is particularly noteworthy, as it demonstrates the company's ability to cross-sell and retain customers in a competitive market.It's also important to note the steady increase in Commercial Lines and Property business, which diversifies the company's revenue streams and reduces reliance on any single line of business. The continuous growth in these areas could be attributed to Progressive's strategic initiatives and investments in technology, which improve customer experience and operational efficiency. This diversification strategy could provide a buffer against market volatility and regulatory changes that are common in the insurance industry. Economist The financial results from Progressive Corporation can be seen as a microcosm of broader economic conditions. The increase in policies suggests consumer confidence and economic growth, as more individuals and businesses are investing in insurance coverage. The rise in net income and improved combined ratio could partially stem from macroeconomic factors such as lower-than-expected claim frequencies or severities, possibly linked to trends such as safer driving technology or changes in consumer behavior.However, the insurance industry is cyclical and sensitive to economic downturns, regulatory changes and catastrophic events. While the short-term outlook based on these results seems positive, long-term sustainability will depend on Progressive's ability to adapt to these variables. Investors should consider the potential impact of economic shifts on claim costs and investment returns when evaluating the long-term prospects of the company. 04/12/2024 - 08:15 AM MAYFIELD VILLAGE, OHIO, April 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) today reported the following results for the month ended March 31, 2024 and the first quarter of 2024: March Quarter (millions, except per share amounts and ratios; unaudited) 2024 2024 2023 ChangeNet premiums written$7,746.0 $18,962.2 $16,109.7 18%Net premiums earned$5,633.5 $16,148.6 $13,533.1 19%Net income$893.6 $2,331.4 $447.9 421%Per share available to common shareholders$1.52 $3.94 $0.75 425%Total pretax net realized gains (losses) on securities$58.3 $155.6 $71.8 117%Combined ratio 84.3 86.1 99.0 (12.9) pts.Combined ratio – prior year month 106.2 Average diluted equivalent common shares 587.4 587.3 587.0 0% In October 2023, we converted our monthly accounting closing calendar to align with the Gregorian calendar.

(PRTG) pauses adenosine clinical development to evaluate strategic alternatives and extend cash runway. Board of Directors halts ADPORT-601 trial enrollment for adenosine inhibitors PORT-6 and PORT-7. Positive None. Negative Evaluation of strategic alternatives may not lead to agreements or successful transactions, potentially requiring restructuring or company wind down in the absence of a deal. Financial Analyst The decision by Portage Biotech to halt further enrollment in the ADPORT-601 clinical trial represents a pivotal moment for the company's financial strategy. In the pharmaceutical and biotech sectors, the progression of clinical trials is a key driver of investor confidence and stock valuation. This pause not only signals a potential delay in the development and commercialization of PORT-6 and PORT-7, but also reflects broader concerns about the company's ability to secure necessary capital in the current market.Investors typically look for consistent progress in clinical trials as an indicator of a company's growth prospects. A pause like this can lead to a decline in investor sentiment and possibly a decrease in stock price, as it introduces uncertainty regarding the company's future. Moreover, the exploration of strategic alternatives suggests that the company is considering significant changes to its operational structure, which could range from partnerships to a complete sale of the company or its assets. These options carry their own risks and potential rewards and the lack of a set timetable for this evaluation could contribute to prolonged investor uncertainty. Medical Research Analyst From a medical research perspective, the suspension of enrollment in the ADPORT-601 trial has implications for the field of immuno-oncology. Adenosine antagonists like PORT-6 and PORT-7 are part of a class of compounds that have been gaining attention for their potential to modulate the tumor microenvironment and enhance anti-tumor immune responses. The decision to pause the trial might slow down the advancement of knowledge in this therapeutic area.For stakeholders, this delay could mean a setback in the availability of new treatments that could benefit patients with cancer. Furthermore, the company's need to explore strategic alternatives to extend its cash runway could impact the continuity of research and development efforts. This strategic pivot could lead to a reallocation of resources away from research and development, which is often seen as the lifeblood of biotech firms, towards maintaining operational viability. Market Research Analyst Assessing the impact of Portage Biotech's announcement from a market research standpoint involves understanding the competitive landscape of immuno-oncology treatments. The pause in clinical development may provide an opportunity for competitors to advance their own therapies and potentially occupy the market space that Portage's products might have filled. This could lead to a shift in the competitive dynamics within the sector.Moreover, the company's exploration of strategic alternatives indicates a search for a viable path forward amidst challenging capital raising conditions. This reflects a broader trend in the biotech industry, where funding has become increasingly selective and companies with promising but early-stage assets struggle to progress without solid financial backing. The outcome of Portage's strategic evaluation will be closely watched by market participants, as it could signal broader shifts in the industry's approach to funding and partnerships. 04/12/2024 - 08:01 AM -Adenosine clinical development pausedWESTPORT, Conn., April 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Portage Biotech Inc. (NASDAQ: PRTG), a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company advancing novel multi-targeted therapies for use as monotherapy and in combination, today reported that it is expanding its evaluation of strategic alternatives and implementing additional measures to extend its available cash runway.

Financial Analyst The recent announcement of Citi's first quarter financial results for 2024 is a pivotal moment for stakeholders and the market at large. A thorough examination of the reported figures compared to market expectations can yield insights into the bank's operational efficiency, growth trajectory and risk management strategies. Particularly, scrutinizing the net interest margin, loan growth and default rates provides a lens into the bank's profitability and asset quality amidst economic fluctuations.Additionally, understanding the impact of macroeconomic conditions, such as interest rate changes by the Federal Reserve, on Citi's balance sheet and revenue streams is essential. This analysis can help to anticipate the bank's future performance and inform investment decisions. It's also important to assess the commentary from Citi's management regarding future guidance, as this can affect market sentiment and stock valuation. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Citi's financial results serve as an industry barometer, indicating broader banking sector health. The performance of Citi's various segments, such as consumer banking and institutional clients group, can provide insights into consumer behavior and corporate investment activity. For instance, a rise in consumer loans may suggest economic confidence among individuals, while growth in capital market services might reflect corporate optimism.It's also valuable to analyze the market's reaction to the earnings report.
