(NASDAQ: FFIE) announces a 1-for-3 reverse stock split of common stock, effective February 29, 2024. The split-adjusted trading begins on March 1, 2024. Stockholders approved the proposal at a special meeting, impacting convertible securities, stock options, and warrants. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The decision by Faraday Future to initiate a reverse stock split is a strategic move often employed by companies aiming to shore up their stock price and meet exchange listing requirements. This action typically signals to the market that a company's shares have been trading at low levels, which can be a concern for investors regarding the company's market valuation and long-term prospects.From a financial standpoint, the reverse stock split does not inherently change the company's valuation, as it is a cosmetic alteration of the stock structure. However, it can have psychological effects on investor perception, potentially making the stock more appealing to institutional investors who might avoid lower-priced shares. For current investors, the reverse stock split will proportionally consolidate their holdings, which could lead to increased volatility due to the reduced number of shares available for trading.It is also noteworthy that the reverse stock split will adjust the exercise price of warrants and convertible securities. This is a critical factor for derivative holders to consider, as it alters the terms under which these financial instruments operate, potentially impacting their value and the decisions of holders regarding exercising or converting these securities. Market Research Analyst The impact of a reverse stock split on a company's reputation and investor sentiment can be significant. In the case of Faraday Future, the market's response will be an indicator of confidence in the company's future performance and management's ability to execute its business plan. Historically, reverse stock splits have been met with mixed reactions, as they can be perceived as a measure to avoid delisting, but can also be seen as a step towards restructuring and stabilizing share price.Furthermore, the reduction in authorized shares from 1,389,937,500 to 463,312,500 represents a significant decrease in potential dilution risk, which could be viewed positively by current shareholders. It's essential to monitor how this action aligns with the company's overall strategy and any subsequent announcements or changes in operations that might provide further context to the reverse stock split decision. Securities Lawyer Legally, the execution of a reverse stock split must be in compliance with both corporate governance and securities regulations. Faraday Future's disclosure that the stockholders voted to approve the reverse stock split indicates adherence to the necessary legal procedures, including amending the company's Charter.For shareholders, it is important to understand that no fractional shares will be issued and instead, they will receive one full share for any fractional entitlement. This aspect of the reverse stock split can have implications for shareholder rights and the distribution of ownership post-split. Shareholders should be aware of their rights in this context and how the consolidation might affect their voting power and dividend entitlements, if applicable. 02/25/2024 - 09:00 PM LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIE) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today announced that the Company intends to implement a reverse stock split of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “common stock”), at a ratio of 1-for-3 (the “reverse stock split”), that is expected to become effective at 5:00 p.m. ET on February 29, 2024. The Company’s common stock is expected to begin trading on a split-adjusted basis commencing upon market open on March 1, 2024. As previously disclosed, at the Company’s Special Meeting of Stockholders held on February 5, 2024, the Company’s stockholders voted to approve a proposal authorizing the Board of Directors of the Company to amend the Company’s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as amended, the “Charter”) to effect a reverse stock split of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock and a corresponding reduction in the total number of shares of common stock the Company is authorized to issue. As a result of the reverse stock split, every three shares of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock will be automatically combined and converted into one issued and outstanding share of common stock. The Company’s Class A common stock will trade under a new CUSIP number, 307359 703, effective March 1, 2024, and remain listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “FFIE.” The Company’s Class B common stock will have a new CUSIP number, 307359 802, effective March 1, 2024. The Company’s publicly traded warrants will continue to be traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “FFIEW” and the CUSIP number for the warrants will remain unchanged. However, under the terms of the applicable warrant agreement, the number of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable on exercise of each warrant will be proportionately decreased. Specifically, following effectiveness of the Reverse Stock Split, every three shares of Class A Common Stock that may be purchased pursuant to the exercise of public warrants now represents one share of Class A Common Stock that may be purchased pursuant to such warrants. Accordingly, for the Company’s warrants trading under the symbol “FFIEW”, every three warrants will be exercisable for one share of Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of $2,760 per share of Class A Common Stock. The reverse stock split reduces the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of the Company’s outstanding convertible securities, and the exercise or vesting of its outstanding stock options, restricted stock units and private warrants in proportion to the ratio of the reverse stock split and causes a proportionate increase in the conversion and exercise prices of such convertible securities, stock options, restricted stock units and private warrants. In addition, the authorized shares of Common Stock will be reduced from 1,389,937,500 to 463,312,500. No fractional shares of common stock will be issued as a result of the reverse stock split. Stockholders of record who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share will be entitled to receive from the Company one full share of the post-reverse stock split common stock. The reverse stock split impacts all holders of the Company’s common stock proportionally and will not impact any stockholder’s percentage ownership of the Company common stock. Faraday Future has chosen its transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, to act as exchange agent for the reverse stock split. Stockholders owning shares via a bank, broker or other nominee will have their positions automatically adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split and will not be required to take further action in connection with the reverse stock split, subject to brokers’ particular processes. Additional information about the Reverse Stock Split and the related Charter amendment can be found in the Company’s definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 10, 2024, as supplemented on January 24, 2024.

Key highlights include successful boric acid and lithium extraction, finalization of electrical engineering work, positive commercial discussions, government support, and marketing initiatives. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The announcement by 5E Advanced Materials regarding their operational progress and commercial operations timeline is a positive signal for market stakeholders. The company's move towards initiating production at the 5E Boron Americas Complex is notable as it aligns with the increasing demand for critical materials like boron and lithium, which are essential for clean energy technologies. The successful running of production wells and the transition towards commercial-grade product validation signifies a reduction in operational risks and lays the groundwork for revenue generation.Additionally, the engagement with potential off-take partners suggests a proactive approach in securing sales channels, which is critical for the company's cash flow post-production commencement. The company's employment growth, particularly from local communities, may also have a favorable impact on regional economies and stakeholder sentiment. Financial Analyst The update from 5E Advanced Materials could be a precursor to future financial performance, as the initiation of production has direct implications for the company's revenue streams and cost structure. Investors should note the company's strategic positioning within the critical materials sector, which could potentially lead to preferential funding opportunities, especially with the involvement of federal agencies like the DOD and DOE. However, the capital expenditures associated with the ramp-up to full production and the ongoing need for funding proposals highlight the importance of liquidity management for the company.The inclusion of boron in the Critical Minerals List could have significant financial implications, potentially unlocking government support and subsidies, which would be beneficial for the company's long-term financing strategy. It's crucial to monitor the company's ability to maintain its timeline for commercial operations, as any delays could impact investor confidence and the stock's performance. Legal Expert The regulatory landscape for mining critical materials like boron and lithium is complex, involving various federal and state agencies. 5E Advanced Materials' designation as a U.S. government Critical Infrastructure entity and its active engagement in government affairs could facilitate smoother regulatory processes and access to incentives. The company's public support for legislative changes, such as the inclusion of boron in the Critical Minerals List, underscores the strategic importance of aligning business operations with government policy objectives. This alignment can mitigate legal and regulatory risks, providing a more stable operating environment for the company.Investors should be aware of the potential regulatory shifts and their impact on the company's operations. For instance, changes in environmental regulations or shifts in critical minerals policies could alter operational costs or create barriers to entry for competitors, affecting the company's competitive landscape. 02/25/2024 - 05:30 PM Measurable progress continues towards near-term plant completion Company remains on track to commence commercial operations in CY Q2 2024 at the 5E Boron Americas Complex in California HESPERIA, Calif., Feb. 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 5E Advanced Materials, Inc. (Nasdaq: FEAM) (ASX: 5EA) (5E or the Company), a boron and lithium company with U.S. government Critical Infrastructure designation for its 5E Boron Americas Complex, provided an update on mining operations and related activities as it moves closer to initial production at the Company’s 5E Boron Americas Complex. “This is an exciting time for all stakeholders of the Company as we finalize a number of initiatives that will see us commence initial production next quarter,” commented Susan Brennan, Chief Executive Officer of 5E Advanced Materials. “Our operations team is working diligently to transition our facility to operational status, and we are concurrently ramping up our commercial and marketing activities in order to leverage the value of our boron and lithium with potential customers. I cannot emphasize enough the importance 5E will represent in the U.S. in the coming months as a new and secure producer of critical materials needed for clean energy economies.” Operational Development Updates Boric Acid and Lithium Product Since the launch of mining operations last month at the 5E Boron Americas Complex, the Company has been successfully running all four of its production wells to extract boric acid and lithium. Initial head grade and recovery rates are in line with historical expectations, with the wells continuing to be conditioned to achieve final operational profile. Extracted solution from the Company’s initial production wells has produced boric acid after laboratory crystallization. This boric acid has been sent to an independent laboratory for analysis to validate commercial grade quality. Facility Operations Significant progress has been made with respect to the finalization of final electrical engineering work, which is now nearly complete. The personnel required to run the plant are already in place, and final appointments are being made for fully staffed status ahead of final plant commissioning. 5E remains on track to begin operating the plant commercially, starting in CY Q2 2024. The Company now employs 51 professionals and is pleased to be employing talent from local communities. Figure 1: Photo of 5E lab assistant testing boric acid head-gradeFigure 2: Photo of wellfield DCS Feb 2024 Market Engagement Updates Customers Commercial discussions continue to move in a positive direction, as the Company works with various potential off-take partners. 5E intends to use product from initial production next quarter to complete product validation, which will be focused on product acceptance within a variety of boric acid consumers. Government The Company’s Government Affairs program also continues to drive progress in its effort to gain increased support for large-scale production of boric acid and lithium at Fort Cady. The Company is currently engaged in several funding proposals with various federal government agencies, including the Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Energy (DOE). The Company recently announced its public support of a congressional push to include boron into the upcoming Critical Minerals List, administered by the United States Geological Society, under the Department of the Interior (DOI). As this program continues to evolve and progress, it will underpin the Company’s longer-term financing strategy. Investor Engagement 5E is currently focused on deploying several marketing initiatives designed to increase engagement across all market stakeholders. This includes analyst briefings, institutional and fund investor meetings, conferences, and targeted industry trade shows. The Company attended the Mines and Money conference last week in Miami and will be attending the Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) event in March. A targeted retail strategy is also underway with the Company to support broader awareness and digital campaigns to retail and institutional investors.

The buyback agreement will run from February 26, 2024, to May 24, 2024, with shares purchased under the Program to be cancelled. The purchases will comply with regulations, including the Market Abuse Regulation 596/2014. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Share buyback programs often signal a company's confidence in its own financial health and future prospects. In the case of Tenaris S.A., the announcement of a $1.2 billion buyback program represents a significant capital allocation decision. By opting to cancel the acquired shares, Tenaris is effectively reducing its shares outstanding, which can lead to an increase in earnings per share (EPS) and potentially enhance shareholder value. The timing of buyback programs can be critical, as they are often executed when management believes the shares are undervalued. The non-discretionary agreement with the financial institution ensures that the buyback is conducted without Tenaris's influence, which is designed to prevent potential market manipulation and adhere to regulatory compliance.From a financial perspective, the market will often react positively to such news, as it may imply that the company's leadership believes the stock is undervalued. It is also an indication that the company is generating enough cash flow to fund significant share repurchases without compromising its operational capabilities or investment opportunities. However, investors should consider the opportunity cost of such a program, as the capital used for share repurchases could alternatively be used for expansion, debt reduction, or other investments that might also drive long-term growth. Market Research Analyst It is essential to understand the broader market implications of Tenaris's share buyback program. The steel pipe manufacturing industry is influenced by global demand for energy, as Tenaris's products are primarily used in the oil and gas sector. With the cyclical nature of these industries, Tenaris's decision to engage in a buyback program could reflect an internal analysis that anticipates stable or increasing demand for its products. Moreover, buybacks can be a tool for adjusting capital structure and improving financial ratios, which may make the company more attractive in the eyes of investors and analysts.Additionally, the market will monitor the execution of this buyback program closely, as the timing and volume of share repurchases can affect stock price dynamics. If the Bank executing the buyback operates during market downturns or periods of low liquidity, it could provide a floor for the stock price. However, it is also important for investors to scrutinize the long-term effects on the company's balance sheet and whether the buyback aligns with broader strategic initiatives that include investment in innovation and market expansion. Legal Expert The legal framework surrounding share buybacks is complex and highly regulated to ensure fair market practices. Tenaris's compliance with the Market Abuse Regulation 596/2014 and the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1052 is crucial to maintain the integrity of the financial markets. These regulations are designed to prevent insider trading and market manipulation by stipulating strict rules on how and when a company can repurchase its own shares. The non-discretionary nature of the agreement with the Bank ensures that Tenaris remains at arm's length from the decision-making process related to the timing of the share purchases.This legal framework provides a safeguard for investors, ensuring that the buyback is conducted in a manner that is both transparent and compliant with the law. The fact that Tenaris can continue to purchase shares during closed periods, as allowed under the Regulations, indicates the robustness of the compliance measures in place. Investors should take comfort in the company's adherence to these regulations, which helps to mitigate legal risk and uphold market confidence. 02/25/2024 - 11:55 AM LUXEMBOURG, Feb. 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tenaris S.A.

BARCELONA, Spain--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Mobile World Congress: ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW), the leading digital workflow company making the world work better for everyone, and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today announced that they are broadening their relationship with the introduction of telco-specific generative AI solutions to elevate service experiences. The first solution, Now Assist for Telecommunications Service Management (TSM), is built on the Now Platform and uses NVIDIA AI to help boost agent productivity, speed time to resolution, and enhance customer experiences. As telcos look to reduce costs and uncover new business opportunities, they’re turning to AI and automation. In a survey from IDC, 73% of global telecommunications service providers identified AI/ML investments to support operations as their top transformation priority.1 “GenAI is a game-changer for telcos looking to boost productivity, improve customer experiences, and drive cost savings with its ability to learn and improve with each use,” said Rohit Batra, general manager and vice president for telecom, media, and tech at ServiceNow. “Together, ServiceNow and NVIDIA will help telcos realize unprecedented business value and impact, fast. This is just the beginning of a large-scale transformation for the industry, and we’re excited to be at the forefront.” “The telco industry is rapidly evolving as AI makes its mark on enterprises everywhere,” said Chris Penrose, global head of business development for telco at NVIDIA. “Our partnership with ServiceNow will help telcos leverage GenAI to tackle their unique challenges and build better, stronger, more efficient experiences.” Many features within Now Assist are powered by ServiceNow fine-tuned large language models, as well as served using NVIDIA Triton Inference Server™ and customized with NVIDIA NeMo™, both included with NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform for the development and deployment of production-grade AI applications, including generative AI cutting-edge innovation for business-critical use cases, including: Customer Care: Telco customer service agents are expected to provide customers with accurate, fast support. GenAI-powered chat summarization and agent assist capabilities help boost productivity and play a pivotal role in call deflection. GenAI can summarize case activity, work notes, and customer interactions, and guide agents with next best actions. This helps agents serve customers quickly and focus on complex queries that require personalized attention—leading to overall better customer experiences. Service Assurance: GenAI provides service assurance teams, stakeholders, and customers a streamlined and rapid understanding of incidents. Take a fiber cut, a common service assurance use case that can have problematic and financial consequences for telcos. Incident management teams face a slew of challenges when handling these incidents, dealing with technical data and the risk of misinterpretation due to specialized terminology and acronyms. GenAI helps decipher technical jargon, distill complex information into clear, concise summaries designed to speed time to resolution, drive cost savings, and improve customer experiences. ServiceNow and NVIDIA plan to build out additional telco-specific GenAI use cases based on the unique needs of customers. Together, the companies are working to solve the industry’s biggest challenges and drive business transformation for telcos globally. Partnering for responsible and safe AI The telco use cases are an extension of ServiceNow and NVIDIA’s partnership announced in May 2023. 1IDC, 2023 Telecommunications Service Provider Transformation Plans and Strategies Survey Highlights, Doc # US49352223, May 2023 Additional Information Find out how generative AI can help cloud service providers improve business processes, customer experience, and network management.

Negative None. 02/25/2024 - 08:11 PM Operations to Continue Uninterrupted, With No Impact to Customers, Employees or Vendors KANSAS CITY, Mo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust, Inc. (OTC Pink: CORR, CORRL) (“CorEnergy” or the “Company”) today announced that it has reached an agreement with certain of its noteholders on a comprehensive financial restructuring that will reduce debt and restructure its balance sheet. The Ad Hoc Group of Noteholders, whose members hold approximately 90% of CorEnergy’s 5.875% Unsecured Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the “Senior Notes”), has entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement (the “RSA”) with the Company. “Restructuring our debt will help to right-size our capital structure for the smaller scale of the enterprise following the MoGas and Omega sale, building on our efforts to increase liquidity through a combination of asset sales and tariff increases,” said Dave Schulte, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of CorEnergy. Schulte continued, “As we move through the reorganization process, we intend to continue to meet all obligations to our valued customers, employees, vendors and partners, and we expect Crimson Pipeline will also continue to operate normally. Our case for rate relief before the California Public Utilities Commission must be resolved favorably to ensure the future viability of the Crimson Pipeline assets, which continue to provide a critical service to shippers in that state.” To implement the RSA, CorEnergy has filed a voluntary chapter 11 proceeding in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Missouri. Neither Crimson Pipeline, in which CorEnergy holds a noncontrolling joint interest, nor any other CorEnergy subsidiary has filed for bankruptcy. Both the Company and Crimson Pipeline expect to have sufficient liquidity to continue operating without interruption during and after CorEnergy’s restructuring process. The case is being filed on a prearranged basis to allow for rapid implementation of the RSA, with the RSA parties already having agreed to support the Company’s Plan of Reorganization. The proceeding is intended to facilitate a restructuring of the Company’s capital structure only, with no plans for trade impairment or other contract rejections. Consistent with the terms of the RSA, the Plan provides for the treatment for each creditor class as follows: Senior Notes: The Senior Notes will be exchanged for cash, $45 million in new secured debt with a five-year term and a 12.0% coupon and approximately 89% of the equity in a reorganized CorEnergy, subject to dilution from the management incentive plan and adjustment based on final cash available upon emergence. General unsecured claims (including trade claims): Paid in full in cash. Existing preferred equity: Holders of CorEnergy’s existing preferred equity and securities that are convertible into preferred equity will receive the remaining approximately 11% of the equity of the reorganized CorEnergy, also subject to dilution from the management incentive plan and adjustment based on final cash available upon emergence. Common stock: All outstanding common stock will be cancelled. The Company aims to complete this restructuring process and emerge from bankruptcy in the second quarter of 2024 as a real estate investment trust. The RSA parties share a common commitment to strong corporate governance and robust disclosure that will facilitate the reorganized company’s plan to pursue trading on the OTC following emergence, providing enhanced liquidity to owners while reducing overhead expenses to a level commensurate with the reorganized company’s smaller size. Additional information on the RSA will be filed on a Form 8-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or purchase any securities, which would be made only pursuant to definitive documents and an applicable exemption from the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. This press release does not constitute a solicitation to vote on the bankruptcy Plan, and all parties entitled to vote should rely solely upon any disclosure statement approved by the Bankruptcy Court. CorEnergy has retained Husch Blackwell LLP as legal counsel, Teneo Capital LLC as its financial advisor and Miller Buckfire as its investment banker. The Ad Hoc Group of Noteholders has retained Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP as its legal counsel and Perella Weinberg Partners and TPH&Co., the energy business of Perella Weinberg Partners, as its investment bankers. Court filings and information about the Chapter 11 case is available on a separate website (https://cases.stretto.com/corenergy) administered by CorEnergy’s claims agent, Stretto.

Market Research Analyst The acquisition of NetACE by ServiceNow represents a strategic move to bolster its offerings in the telecommunications sector. By integrating NetACE's network management and automation technology, ServiceNow is positioning itself as a comprehensive provider for telcos, aiming to streamline operations and improve efficiency. The consolidation of network lifecycle management on a single platform is anticipated to address the current inefficiencies telcos face due to manual processes. This could lead to a reduction in operational costs and an increase in productivity for ServiceNow's telecom clients, potentially making ServiceNow's platform more attractive and increasing its market share in this vertical.From a market perspective, this acquisition could signal ServiceNow's deeper foray into the telecom industry, suggesting possible future growth in this sector. Investors may interpret this move as ServiceNow's commitment to expanding its service offerings, which could have positive implications for the company's growth trajectory and stock performance. However, the impact on the stock market will depend on the successful integration of the technology and the realization of the anticipated operational efficiencies. Financial Analyst ServiceNow's acquisition of Atrinet's NetACE technology, while not disclosing financial terms, is an investment in the future of its telecom offerings. The market will be closely monitoring the post-acquisition integration process, as the success of this venture is contingent upon seamless technological integration and market adoption.

The all-scrip transaction values Alumina Limited at approximately $2.2 billion, with Alumina Limited shareholders receiving 0.02854 Alcoa shares per Alumina Limited share. The acquisition aims to enhance operational flexibility, provide long-term value creation, and increase exposure to Alcoa's global aluminum business. Positive Alcoa's agreement with Alumina Limited strengthens its position as a major bauxite and alumina producer. The all-scrip transaction values Alumina Limited at around $2.2 billion, with shareholders receiving 0.02854 Alcoa shares per Alumina Limited share. The acquisition aims to enhance operational flexibility, create long-term value, and increase exposure to Alcoa's global aluminum business. Alcoa's commitment to Western Australia is reaffirmed through the proposed acquisition. The transaction offers significant strategic and financial benefits for both companies' shareholders. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The proposed acquisition of Alumina Limited by Alcoa represents a strategic move that could significantly alter the competitive landscape of the bauxite and alumina industry. This transaction would enhance Alcoa's vertical integration, providing control over a larger portion of the supply chain. Such consolidation can lead to economies of scale, potentially lowering production costs and increasing bargaining power with suppliers and customers. From a market research perspective, the deal could strengthen Alcoa's market position against competitors, particularly in regions where these tier-1 assets are located.Furthermore, the premium offered to Alumina Limited's shareholders suggests confidence in the synergies expected from the deal. The premium is indicative of the value Alcoa sees in acquiring Alumina Limited's assets, which could be a result of anticipated cost savings, increased market share, or improved operational efficiencies. The proposed secondary listing on the ASX for Alcoa could also facilitate liquidity for the new shareholders and demonstrate Alcoa's commitment to the Australian market. Financial Analyst Examining the financial implications of the acquisition, the all-stock nature of the deal suggests a conservative approach to financing, avoiding the increase in debt that could accompany cash acquisitions. The implied equity value of $2.2 billion for Alumina Limited and the share exchange ratio should be scrutinized against industry benchmarks and historical transactions to ensure fair valuation. The transaction is expected to be accretive to Alcoa's earnings, given the potential for cost synergies and increased operational flexibility.However, the financial benefits must be weighed against the risks of integration and the costs associated with the transaction. The long-term financial profile of the combined entity will hinge on Alcoa's ability to effectively integrate Alumina Limited's operations and realize the anticipated value creation. Investors should also consider the impact of the transaction on Alcoa's capital returns program and whether the projected growth strategy aligns with current market conditions and commodity cycle trends. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the transaction is subject to various customary conditions and regulatory approvals, which include a scheme implementation agreement and approvals from both Alumina Limited's shareholders and Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board. The absence of a financing condition underscores the transaction's preparedness but also places emphasis on the importance of regulatory compliance and shareholder approval.The appointment of two directors from Alumina Limited to Alcoa's Board post-acquisition is a strategic move to ensure smooth governance transition and representation of Alumina Limited's shareholder interests within the new corporate structure. The legal complexities of such cross-border transactions require meticulous due diligence to navigate the regulatory environment and to anticipate any potential antitrust concerns. 02/25/2024 - 05:04 PM Transaction would further enhance Alcoa’s position as of one of the world’s largest bauxite and alumina producers with increased ownership of core, tier-1 assets Transaction would provide Alumina Limited shareholders the opportunity to participate in the upside potential of a stronger, better-capitalized company with a larger, more diversified portfolio Transaction would result in significant and long-term value creation for both companies’ shareholders from greater operational flexibility Alumina Limited’s largest holder, Allan Gray Australia, has entered into an agreement with Alcoa which gives Alcoa the right to acquire up to 19.9% of Alumina Limited’s issued share capital Investor conference call scheduled for today, February 25, 2024 at 6:00 p.m. ET / February 26, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. AEDT PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Alcoa (NYSE: AA or “Alcoa”) today announced that it has entered into an agreement with Alumina Limited (ASX: AWC) on terms and process for the acquisition of Alumina Limited, subject to entry into a scheme implementation agreement. Alcoa and Alumina Limited have entered into an exclusivity and transaction process deed (“Process Deed”), and the Alumina Limited Board of Directors has confirmed that, subject to entry into a scheme implementation agreement, it intends to recommend the transaction to Alumina Limited shareholders. Under the all-scrip, or all-stock, transaction, Alumina Limited shareholders would receive consideration of 0.02854 Alcoa shares for each Alumina Limited share (the “Agreed Ratio”). Based on Alcoa’s closing share price as of February 23, 2024, the Agreed Ratio implies an equity value of approximately $2.2 billion for Alumina Limited. The Alumina Limited Board of Directors intends to recommend the Agreed Ratio in the absence of a superior proposal and subject to an independent expert concluding (and continuing to conclude) that the transaction is in the best interests of Alumina Limited shareholders. Under the Process Deed, Alcoa and Alumina Limited intend to finalize and enter into a scheme implementation agreement for the all-scrip transaction (the “Agreement”). Upon completion of the Agreement, Alumina Limited shareholders would own 31.25 percent, and Alcoa shareholders would own 68.75 percent of the combined company.1 Alcoa is the sole operator of Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals (AWAC), a joint venture (“JV”) with Alumina Limited. AWAC consists of a number of affiliated entities that own, operate or have an interest in bauxite mines and alumina refineries in Australia, Brazil, Spain, Saudi Arabia and Guinea. AWAC also has a 55 percent interest in an aluminum smelter in Victoria, Australia. Alcoa owns 60 percent and Alumina Limited owns 40 percent of the AWAC entities, respectively, directly, or indirectly. The Agreement would increase Alcoa’s economic interest in its core business and simplify governance by acquiring the minority partner in its AWAC JV, resulting in greater operational flexibility and strategic optionality. It would also allow Alumina Limited shareholders to participate in the upside potential of a stronger, better-capitalized company with a larger and more diversified portfolio while offering exposure to Alcoa’s upstream aluminum business. Executive Commentary “We are pleased to have entered into the transaction process and exclusivity deed to finalize the terms of the transaction, which will provide significant and long-term benefits to both Alcoa and Alumina Limited shareholders,” said William F. Oplinger, Alcoa’s President and CEO. “Alcoa has been a proven operator of AWAC, and we recognize the value creation opportunities possible under a simplified ownership structure, including the ability to implement AWAC’s operational and strategic decisions on an accelerated basis. We believe now is the right time to consolidate ownership in AWAC and look forward to working closely with the Alumina Limited team to consummate a transaction that will better position Alcoa to execute on our long-term growth strategy.” Mr. Oplinger continued, “This acquisition would build on our commitment to Western Australia, and provides significant benefits to employees, customers, host communities, and others who rely on the continuing success of our global business.” Compelling Strategic and Financial Benefits Increases Alcoa’s exposure to its core, tier-1 bauxite and alumina business, and provides Alumina Limited shareholders with exposure to Alcoa’s global aluminum business. The acquisition of Alumina Limited would consolidate Alcoa’s ownership of one of the world’s largest bauxite and alumina producers with tier 1 assets. With this acquisition, Alcoa would significantly increase its ownership in five of the 20 largest bauxite mines and five of the 20 largest alumina refineries globally (excluding China).2 This complements Alcoa’s low carbon, global smelting portfolio that has the fifth largest global production (excluding China).3 Importantly, Alumina Limited shareholders gain access to the benefits of Alcoa’s upstream aluminum business. Enhances Alcoa’s global position as the leading pure-play upstream aluminum company. A combination of Alcoa and Alumina Limited would enhance Alcoa’s vertical integration across the value chain, with leading positions across bauxite, alumina and aluminum smelting and casting, excluding China. AWAC's mining operations are strategically located in proximity to AWAC refineries and major Atlantic and Pacific markets. Alcoa’s smelters are strategically located proximate to key markets in North America and Europe. The increased vertical integration in a combined company also provides more stability throughout the commodity cycle. Offers Alumina Limited shareholders ownership in a stronger, well-capitalized business. With ownership of the combined entity, Alumina Limited shareholders will exchange their shares in a non-operating passive investment vehicle for an ownership position in Alcoa. As part of this transition, Alumina Limited shareholders would participate in Alcoa’s capital returns program, including the current dividend, and would have access to a larger, strong balance sheet that will be better able to fund portfolio actions, maintenance capital, and growth capital. Simplifies corporate structure and governance, resulting in greater operational flexibility and strategic optionality. Having 100 percent ownership of AWAC simplifies the corporate structure and allows for a more efficient operating model. With a centralized management team and strategy, Alcoa will be better positioned to execute operational and strategic decisions on an accelerated basis. In addition, a simplified corporate structure will result in efficiencies through a reduction in corporate costs. Bolsters long-term financial profile and maximizes value creation for both companies’ shareholders. The proposed transaction would increase Alcoa's financial flexibility, enabling more efficient funding and capital allocation decisions, as well as liability management. Alcoa would be better positioned to achieve many of the Company’s long-term strategies to maximize value creation for shareholders. These being: returning cash to shareholders, increasing portfolio exposure to what has been Alcoa’s highest margin and highest return on capital business historically, and positioning for growth with the ability to make decisions on a streamlined basis. Additionally, an acquisition of Alumina Limited increases Alcoa’s financial flexibility for its Western Australia mining projects and near-term portfolio actions. Reaffirms Alcoa’s commitment to Western Australia – a premier global mining jurisdiction. Alcoa has a long track record in the tier-1 Western Australia mining jurisdiction. The proposed acquisition of Alumina Limited builds on Alcoa’s commitment to continued productive relationships built on engagement with local communities, significant employment, and improved environmental performance. The proposed acquisition would better position Alcoa to continue its long-term plan of investing in Australian bauxite mining and alumina refining. Transaction Details Under the proposed all-scrip, or all-stock, Agreement, Alumina Limited shareholders would receive consideration of 0.02854 Alcoa shares for each Alumina Limited share.4 This consideration would imply a value of A$1.15 per Alumina Limited share, based on Alcoa’s closing share price on the NYSE as of February 23, 2024 of $26.52.5 This represents a premium of 13.1% to the closing price of Alumina Limited’s shares on February 23, 2024. As part of the proposed transaction, Alcoa would apply to establish a secondary listing on the Australian Securities Exchange (""ASX"") to allow Alumina Limited shareholders to trade Alcoa common stock via CHESS Depositary Interests (""CDIs"") on the ASX. Under the terms of the Agreement, two new mutually agreed upon directors from Alumina Limited’s Board would be appointed to Alcoa’s Board of Directors upon closing. Conditional Share Sale Agreement with Allan Gray Australia Alumina Limited’s largest holder, Allan Gray Australia, has entered into an agreement with Alcoa that gives Alcoa the right to acquire up to 19.9 percent of Alumina Limited at the Agreed Price 0.02854 Alcoa shares for each Alumina Limited share. The conditional share sale agreement will be disclosed in a substantial holder notice to be released to ASX. Transaction Conditions The transaction would be subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions and regulatory approval, including entry into a scheme implementation agreement, a recommendation from Alumina Limited’s Board of Directors that Alumina Limited shareholders vote in favor in the absence of a superior proposal, and an independent expert concluding (and continuing to conclude) that the proposed transaction is in the best interests of Alumina Limited's shareholders, approval by Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board, Alumina Limited's shareholders approving the transaction and Alcoa shareholders approving the issue of the new Alcoa shares under the NYSE rules. The transaction is not conditional on due diligence or financing. The parties expect to be in a position to announce a scheme implementation agreement detailing the full details of the transaction in the near-term.

Advisors J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and UBS Investment Bank are acting as financial advisors to Alcoa, and Ashurst and Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP are acting as its legal counsel.

Positive Faraday Future has made substantial progress despite funding challenges and market headwinds, entering the revenue generation phase in 2023. The company has invested $3 billion in creating an industry-leading EV platform with 660 patents filed for both EV and I.A.I. technology competitiveness. FFIE has a 10,000 capacity production facility in Hanford, California, with plans for expansion into the Middle East market in 2024. The company focuses on user-centric design and AI technology, with the FF 91 boasting a tri-motor powertrain, 1050 hp, and advanced AI capabilities. FFIE is working towards cash flow breakeven, cost reduction, and product enhancements, while tightening restrictions for convertible note holders and reducing monthly cash burn. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The announcement of Faraday Future's updated master plan 1.1 and its strategic positioning for growth in 2024 indicates a significant development phase for the company. The company's entry into revenue generation in 2023 and its closed-loop operation from user acquisition to delivery are pivotal in assessing its market potential. The emphasis on the EV company's ability to pass US homologation requirements places it alongside established players like Tesla and Lucid, which could resonate positively with investors. The disclosed investment of $3 billion to develop its EV platform and the filing of 660 patents suggests a robust intellectual property portfolio and technological advancement, which are critical in the competitive EV industry.Furthermore, the company's expansion into international markets, including the Middle East and its partnership with the Abu Dhabi Investment Office highlight strategic moves to diversify market presence and tap into emerging TechLuxury segments. The focus on cash flow breakeven rather than scaling production too quickly is a prudent strategy that may appeal to investors concerned with sustainable growth. The strategic positioning in less crowded market segments at higher price points could offer a competitive advantage in terms of profitability margins. Financial Analyst Faraday Future's financial updates reflect a strategic approach to capital management and cost reduction. The company's efforts to secure additional funding and tighten restrictions on convertible note holders demonstrate a proactive stance on strengthening its financial position. The suspension of the ATM program and ELOC, along with measures to reduce monthly cash burn, suggest a disciplined approach to expense management. The company's strategy to prioritize cash flow breakeven at a lower production volume compared to competitors could mitigate risks associated with overexpansion. The substantial savings achieved by insourcing a key component of the vehicle, leading to a $50,000 reduction in the Bill of Materials, exemplifies effective cost optimization strategies that could improve profit margins. Investors would likely find the detailed execution plan for 2024 and beyond, with a clearer projection of profitability, reassuring for the company's financial trajectory. Automotive Industry Analyst The technical specifications and AI capabilities of the FF 91 2.0 highlight Faraday Future's commitment to innovation in the EV space. The vehicle's tri-motor powertrain with 1050 hp and a reported 381 miles EPA range place it in direct competition with luxury performance vehicles. The integration of AI services, including the ability to run applications like Zoom and ChatGPT, along with OTA upgrades, set a high bar for user experience and vehicle connectivity. The emphasis on a user-centric design that caters to a diverse range of needs reflects an understanding of the evolving consumer demands in the luxury EV market. The focus on continuous product and technology enhancements is essential to maintain a unique market position, especially as EV adoption rates increase and competition intensifies. The decision to target the TechLuxury market, alongside the company's cultural roots in the US and China, could capitalize on growing demand in these key markets while expanding into the Middle East. 02/25/2024 - 09:00 PM An open letter from Matthias Aydt, Global CEO of Faraday Future. LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIE) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today released an open letter from Matthias Aydt, Global CEO of FF, to share an updated master plan 1.1 for the growth of Faraday Future in 2024. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240225201526/en/Faraday Future Announces Updated Master Plan 1.1 to Strategically Position Itself for Growth in 2024. (Photo: Business Wire) Opportunities and Accomplishments I’m issuing this letter to align expectations as to where FF stands today and where we hope to lead FF in 2024. FF has made great strides in the past 12 months, under limited funding and strong headwinds from the markets, including the changing landscape of the EV business. FF entered the revenue generation phase in 2023 and established a closed-loop operation from user acquisition and delivery to user operations while launching the process of adding industry leaders and partnering with our first users and Co-Creation Officers. There were significant changes in FF’s business foundation, including the addition of a new management team that we believe collectively boasts the strongest capabilities in the history of FF. We believe that during this critical period for business growth, the Company is now structurally best positioned for the next development phase since its inception. FF is only one of five new EV companies globally that has passed US homologation requirements, others include Tesla, Lucid, Rivian, and Fisker. $3 billion invested capital to date to create an industry leading EV platform, I.A.I. technology, product development and manufacturing capabilities. 660 patents filed or issued utility and design patents for both EV and I.A.I. technology competitiveness. 10,000 capacity - future potential annual production capacity at FF's self-operated manufacturing facility in Hanford, California with $200+ million invested. Dual Home Deep cultural roots in both the US and China provide competitive advantage across two of the largest EV markets with anticipated movement into the Middle East Markets in 2024. High-profile vehicle owners and Co-Creation Officers such as Chris Brown, Motev and others, demonstrating strong brand power. Direct sales online with anticipated targeted in-person experience centers and FF partner stores across target markets such as the US, China, Europe, and the Middle East. Phase Two of the Company's Three-Phase Delivery Plan for the Company’s FF 91 2.0 Futurist Alliance launched in the third quarter 2023. FF also signed an agreement with the Abu Dhabi Investment Office (ADIO) to unleash generative AI and advanced EVs for Abu Dhabi's SAVI cluster. Abu Dhabi’s SAVI cluster builds on the strength of Abu Dhabi’s industrial base and supports the UAE’s target of half of all cars on the roads being electric by 2050. The Middle East market presents exciting opportunities for smart and autonomous vehicles and is well aligned with FF product technology and brand positioning. We look forward to this being our first of many future endeavors and collaborations in the Middle East. We believe that the FF 91 2.0 is a vehicle uniquely positioned to provide new markets representing a new generation of aiEV users with a fully integrated, optimized software and hardware architecture to create a true All-Ability Hypercar. This vehicle includes full connectivity and personalized AI services and features. Key Deliverables Since Previous Announcement of FF’s Master Plan on October 2023 Gradually evolving the corporate orientation and direction towards a continuous operation with similar priorities in regard to production and sales as well as enhancing the product power of the product palette. Actively managing costs and expenses and focusing on improving Company-wide efficiency. Expanding our market presence into TechLuxury markets beyond the U.S with adequate volumes. Focusing on cashflow breakeven and next growth steps. Continuous product and technology enhancements to maintain unique position in the market. Took action to investigate short selling to protect shareholder interest. Have resulted in: A lean and flat organization dedicated to Product Definition, Product Execution, Product Delivery, User Operation, Corporate Development and supporting functional areas. Manufacturing, supply chain and product quality improvements. Reasonable cost structure and optimized costs and expenses. A successful market launch in one of the most important TechLuxury markets, the UAE. Confirmation of a solidified execution plan for 2024 and 2025 and beyond with clearer projection of profitability. A start of definition and conceptualization of the next generation revolutionizing product enhancement. Communications with various securities brokers regarding our short selling analysis. Product and Technology FF 91 comes from our disruptive approach to innovation across intelligent technology, user-centric design, and EV propulsion. It is a user-centric experience designed for people with many talents, many obligations and many goals in life. FF has addressed these complex needs in a single vehicle that combines the luxury of an intelligent connected space, with the capabilities of a hyper-dynamic EV powertrain and predictive AI architecture. Together, these elements work to elevate a user’s potential, and provide them the ultimate freedom to do what they want, when they want and how they want. The FF 91 has tri-motor powertrain capability, 1050 hp, is faster than Lamborghini Urus, and has a reported 381 miles EPA. It is also the first AI capable car able to run Zoom, ChatGPT, livestream, has a strong computing capacity with self-designed software and hardware platform including Nvidia chips and 5G*3 access point connectivity. As we recently announced, we continuously keep our product at the forefront through over-the-air (OTA) upgrades. These OTA upgrades significantly enhance the interaction between the user’s smartphone and their vehicle, making functions more intuitive and user-friendly. In addition to supporting conventional functions like unlocking doors, air conditioning, and charging, it also enables comprehensive control of in-car screens, enhancing the experience of in-car entertainment and work activities. Beyond the outstanding performance, technology, and agility of our product we have discussed in the past, we would request that everyone who has the chance to get into our car should take that opportunity to be amazed by the experience. Financial Updates We are continuing to make progress on future funding and believe we will successfully close on an additional round of capital from strategic and financial investors. We are currently also working to tighten restrictions to convertible note holders for their conversion and paused both our ATM program and ELOC. We are succeeding in reducing our monthly cash burn by cutting back on spending that is no longer necessary given our more advanced stage of development while continuing to balance investments into the business that are critical to moving the Company forward. We are prioritizing cash flow breakeven over volume to avoid scaling production too quickly, which has been an issue for many competitors. As such, we believe we will be cash flow breakeven at a lower vehicle production/delivery figure than that of our competitors. Additionally, our market (in terms of price point) is far less crowded. Cost Reduction: Bill of Materials (BoM) Significant reduction in cost - some of this is coming naturally with improvements in manufacturing efficiency but we are also targeting specific elements of the BoM, switching suppliers, and/or insourcing the production where available and cost effective. This is yielding meaningful, fruitful results – one example was taking a key component of the vehicle bringing the production in-house, this led to approximately $50,000 savings on a single element of the BoM. We are working on various other opportunities and low-hanging fruit that still exists in terms of continuously and meaningfully reducing the BoM in the near term. Next Steps 1. Operations: Operation optimization and upgrade to achieve sustainability in the near future. Cost reduction and spending efficiency, including daily operation and FF91 material cost. Continue product deliveries to celebrities and opinion leaders. Achieve industry-leading advantages in product and technology powers and “Ultimate AI TechLuxury” Top Brand momentum through the FF Co-Creation model. Focus on U.S, China Dual Home market & Middle East 3rd Pole. Achieve industrial implementation in the Middle East, access and localization of products and technologies, and establishment of a user ecosystem. 2. Product and technology: Continuously enhance the product and technology powers of the FF 91 2.0. Middle East product planning and implementation: Launch FF 91 2.0 aiFalcon this year. Research and develop the next-generation product FF 92, maintaining FF's leading edge in product and technology powers. Focus on the application research and development of AI technology, continue to lead in the vertical application of generative AI in the mobility field. 3. Manufacturing/Supply Chain: Progress the equipment commissioning and upgrading of FF ieFactory to lay the foundation for increased production. Comprehensively improve the factory manufacturing system and promote the continuous upgrade of the production and manufacturing quality system. Promote global supply chain integration and establish a global strategic supplier system. Further promote supplier quality and capacity enhancement and improve the supply chain quality performance system and cost reduction. 4. Funding and Finance: Continue and accelerate current plans to bring strategic investors. Globally optimize and upgrade the Company's financial system in the three regions, improve financial efficiency, and establish healthy and sustainable cash management. We believe that FF has the foundations to support future growth, subject to obtaining additional needed funding. We've triumphed over the challenging moments many times in our past, and FF has been bolstered by many achievements. Since the start of deliveries in 2023, and leading into 2024, the Company has consistently taken measures to reduce operational and supply chain costs in support of our strategic objectives. We believe that these steps will only help us succeed moving forward. With our unique DNA and the support of our global employees, our present and future users, and our many stakeholders, we remain steadfast in our belief that we stand on the cusp of an extraordinary surge of energy and success!

Negative None. 02/25/2024 - 06:47 PM VANCOUVER, BC and SYDNEY, Australia, Feb. 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Highlights Patriot continues to intersect spodumene at the CV13 Pegmatite, with highlights:22.5 m at 1.10% Li2O, including 15.2 m at 1.57% Li2O (CV23-300).19.4 m at 1.20% Li2O (CV23-312).16.1 m at 1.54% Li2O, including 7.2 m at 2.57% Li2O (CV23-319).The CV13 Pegmatite has been traced over a 2.3 km strike length, as defined by multiple outcrop exposures and drilling completed to date, and remains open along strike at both ends and to depth. The distance between CV5 and CV13 has now been traced to ~3 km with ongoing drilling focused, in part, on closing this gap.Assays are reported herein for 15 drill holes completed in 2023 at the CV13 Spodumene Pegmatite. For drill holes completed in 2023, results remain to be reported for an additional 20 holes at the CV13 Pegmatite, 42 holes at the CV5 Pegmatite, and 18 holes at the CV9 Pegmatite.At the Corvette Property in 2024, through February 22, approximately 23,000 m of drilling have been completed – 21,200 m at CV5 and 1,800 m at CV13 – with ten (10) drill rigs active at site.Two (2) drill rigs are currently active at the CV13 Pegmatite as part of the ongoing 2024 winter drill program. The drilling is targeted to further delineate the principal pegmatite body at CV13 along strike and downdip.The Company is mobilizing an additional drill rig as part of the winter drill program, which will focus on geomechanical holes at CV5. An updated mineral resource estimate (""MRE"") for the Corvette Project, including both CV5 and a maiden MRE for the CV13 spodumene pegmatites, is planned for Q3 2024, with the focus of the MRE update to increase the confidence of the Inferred Resource.The Company's exploration camp at KM-270 of the Trans-Taiga Road, Shaakichiuwaanan, is operational at an initial 80-person capacity, with a planned increase to at least a 132-persons later in the year.The 2024 winter program is entirely ground supported (i.e., no helicopters), through a combination of winter and all-season access road constructed by the Company, extending from KM-270 of the Trans-Taiga Road to CV5 and through to CV13, resulting in dramatically reduced costs for the drill program.A geomechanical drill program at CV5 is anticipated to begin shortly, with geotechnical and hydrogeological drill programs planned for this summer. Patriot Battery Metals Inc. (the ""Company"" or ""Patriot"") (TSX: PMET) (ASX: PMT) (OTCQX: PMETF) (FSE: R9GA) is pleased to announce additional drill results from the 2023 program completed at the CV13 Spodumene Pegmatite, as well as recent infrastructure development supporting the ongoing 2024 drill program at the Corvette Property. The Corvette Property (the ""Property"" or ""Project""), wholly owned by the Company, is located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of Quebec. The CV13 Spodumene Pegmatite is located approximately 3 km west-southwest of the CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite, which hosts a maiden mineral resource estimate of 109.2 Mt at 1.42% Li2O inferred1 and is situated approximately 13.5 km south of the regional and all–weather Trans-Taiga Road and powerline infrastructure. CV13 Pegmatite, 2023 Drill ResultsDrill results for 15 drill holes completed in 2023 at the CV13 Spodumene Pegmatite are reported herein (Figure 1). These holes primarily target the near-surface and downdip extension of the principal pegmatite body along its western limb, as well as the eastern limb. Results include: 22.5 m at 1.10% Li2O, including 15.2 m at 1.57% Li2O (CV23-300).19.4 m at 1.20% Li2O (CV23-312).16.1 m at 1.54% Li2O, including 7.2 m at 2.57% Li2O (CV23-319).13.8 m at 1.16% Li2O (CV23-320).The drilling continues to trace spodumene pegmatite at CV13 to the west-northwest along geological trend and remains open along strike and downdip in this area. Results remain to be reported for twelve (12) drill holes, covering approximately 300 m of strike, over the far portions of this western limb. The mineralized pegmatite in this area has a shallow northeasterly dip resulting in pegmatite being traced down dip for over 250 m with minimal drilling, while still only being approximately 100 m vertical depth below surface – see geological cross-section in Figure 2, which includes drill holes CV23-305 and 312 as reported herein. Results are also reported herein for one (1) hole completed in 2023 (CV23-300, noted below) within the apex of the regional host structure at CV13. One (1) drill hole (CV23–302) completed in 2023 remains to be reported from this area (Figure 1). 22.5 m at 1.10% Li2O, including 15.2 m at 1.57% Li2O (CV23-300).Results reported herein for drill holes completed over the eastern limb of the CV13 Pegmatite (CV23-293, 299, 301, and 306) returned only minor intervals of pegmatite ranging from <2 m to 5.8 m (core length). However, the pegmatite remains well mineralized in drill holes CV23-299 (4.7 m at 1.38% Li2O) and CV23-293 (2.7 m at 1.10% Li2O). The pegmatite dyke thins in this area of the eastern limb; however, is confirmed to thicken moving northeasterly along strike as evidence from drill holes completed in 2022. Results for six (6) drill holes completed in 2023 along the eastern limb of CV13 remain to be reported (Figure 1). The CV13 Pegmatite is currently interpreted to be characterized by a principal ""upper"" dyke and a secondary ""lower"" dyke, as well as several subordinate sub-parallel dykes, and are collectively geologically modelled to be shallowly dipping northerly. The principal dyke (the ""upper"" dyke), dips typically between 20-25° and has been traced at depth to at least 300 m down-dip (vertical depth from surface of ~140 m). The principal dyke at CV13 has been traced over a 2.3 km strike length, as defined by multiple outcrop exposures and drilling completed to date, and remains open along strike at both ends and to depth. In 2024, through February 22, approximately 23,000 m of drilling have been completed at Corvette – 21,200 m at CV5 and 1,800 m at CV13 – with ten (10) drill rigs active at site (see Figure 3 and Figure 4). Two (2) of the ten (10) drill rigs are currently active at the CV13 Pegmatite. The drilling at CV13 is targeted to further delineate the principal pegmatite body along strike and downdip. An updated mineral resource estimate for the Corvette Project, including both the CV5 and CV13 spodumene pegmatites, is planned for Q3 2024. Core sample assays for drill holes reported herein are presented in Table 1 for all pegmatite intersections >2 m. Drill hole locations and attributes are presented in Table 2. For drill holes completed in 2023, results remain to be reported for the CV13 Pegmatite (20 holes), the CV5 Pegmatite (42 holes), and the CV9 Pegmatite (18 holes). Infrastructure DevelopmentThe 2024 winter drill program is entirely ground supported, utilizing the all-season/winter road constructed by the Company, which extends south from KM–270 of the Trans-Taiga Road to the CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite (Figure 3, Figure 4, and Figure 5). The winter portion of this road has been further extended westerly to support drilling at the CV13 Spodumene Pegmatite. No helicopters are currently active at site due this infrastructure now emplaced and in daily use. The Company's exploration camp at KM-270 of the Trans-Taiga Road has been operational since early January at an initial 80-person capacity, with an anticipated increase to at least 132-person later in the year (Figure 6). After consultation with elders from the Cree Nation of Chisasibi by the tallyman and his family, the camp has recently been formally named the Shaakichiuwaanan Camp (pronounced Shaa-gi-chi-waa-nan), a Cree word meaning ""to climb up a hill or mountain"". The camp is located only 13 km directly north of the CV5 Pegmatite, thereby dramatically reducing the transport time of field staff to and from the drill area. The combination of the Company's exploration camp on the Trans-Taiga and direct access roads to the CV5 and CV13 pegmatites have dramatically reduced the costs of the drill program through more cost-effective staff movement, reduced transport time, reduced accommodation costs, and reduced time for drill moves. In addition to the camp and road infrastructure development, the Company anticipates completing a geomechanical drill program this winter at CV5. Data from this drilling and sampling will provide key datapoints to assess pit slope stability and design. This work will be followed in the summer by an infrastructure and condemnation geotechnical drill program, which will include potential tailings and waste rock storage sites, process plant, and camp accommodations for operation. A phase II hydrogeological drill program at CV5 is also planned for the summer, which will build upon the preliminary hydrogeological model completed in 2023. 1 The CV5 mineral resource estimate (109.2 Mt at 1.42% Li2O and 160 ppm Ta2O5 inferred) is reported at a cut-off grade of 0.40% Li2O with effective date of June 25, 2023 (through drill hole CV23-190). Mineral resources are not mineral reserves as they do not have demonstrated economic viability. Largest in the Americas based on contained LCE. Quality Assurance / Quality Control (QAQC)A Quality Assurance / Quality Control protocol following industry best practices was incorporated into the program and included systematic insertion of quartz blanks and certified reference materials into sample batches at a rate of approximately 5%. Additionally, analysis of pulp-split and coarse-split sample duplicates were completed to assess analytical precision at different stages of the laboratory preparation process, and external (secondary) laboratory pulp-split duplicates were prepared at the primary lab for subsequent check analysis and validation. All core samples collected were shipped to SGS Canada's laboratory in Val-d'Or, QC, for sample preparation (code PRP89 special) which includes drying at 105°C, crush to 90% passing 2 mm, riffle split 250 g, and pulverize 85% passing 75 microns. The pulps were shipped by air to SGS Canada's laboratory in Burnaby, BC, where the samples were homogenized and subsequently analyzed for multi-element (including Li and Ta) using sodium peroxide fusion with ICP-AES/MS finish (codes GE_ICP91A50 and GE_IMS91A50). About the CV Lithium TrendThe CV Lithium Trend is an emerging spodumene pegmatite district discovered by the Company in 2017 and is interpreted to span more than 50 kilometres across the Corvette Property. The core area includes the approximate 4.4 km long CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite, which hosts a maiden mineral resource estimate of 109.2 Mt at 1.42% Li2O inferred1. To date, seven (7) distinct clusters of lithium pegmatite have been discovered across the Corvette Property – CV4, CV5, CV8, CV9, CV10, CV12, and CV13. Given the proximity of some pegmatite outcrops to each other, as well as the shallow till cover in the area, it is probable that some of the outcrops may reflect a discontinuous surface exposure of a single, larger pegmatite ""outcrop"" subsurface.

Appendix 1 – JORC Code 2012 Table 1 information required by ASX Listing Rule 5.7.1Section 1 – Sampling Techniques and DataCriteria JORC Code explanation Commentary Sampling techniques Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels, random chips, or specific specialized industry standard measurement tools appropriate to the minerals under investigation, such as down hole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc). These examples should not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling.Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity and the appropriate calibration of any measurement tools or systems used.Aspects of the determination of mineralization that are Material to the Public Report.In cases where 'industry standard' work has been done this would be relatively simple (eg 'reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was pulverized to produce a 30 g charge for fire assay'). In other cases more explanation may be required, such as where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems. Unusual commodities or mineralization types (eg submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed information. Core sampling protocols meet industry standard practices. Core sampling is guided by lithology as determined during geological logging (i.e., by a geologist). All pegmatite intervals are sampled in their entirety (half-core), regardless if spodumene mineralization is noted or not (in order to ensure an unbiased sampling approach) in addition to ~1 to 3 m of sampling into the adjacent host rock (dependent on pegmatite interval length) to ""bookend"" the sampled pegmatite. The minimum individual sample length is typically 0.3-0.5 m and the maximum sample length is typically 2.0 m. Targeted individual pegmatite sample lengths are 1.0 m. All drill core is oriented to maximum foliation prior to logging and sampling and is cut with a core saw into half-core pieces, with one half-core collected for assay, and the other half-core remaining in the box for reference. Core samples collected from drill holes were shipped to SGS Canada's laboratory in Val-d'Or, QC, for sample preparation (code PRP89 special) which included drying at 105°C, crush to 90% passing 2 mm, riffle split 250 g, and pulverize 85% passing 75 microns. Core sample pulps were shipped by air to SGS Canada's laboratory in Burnaby, BC, where the samples were homogenized and subsequently analyzed for multi-element (including Li and Ta) using sodium peroxide fusion with ICP-AES/MS finish (codes GE_ICP91A50 and GE_IMS91A50). Drilling techniques Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer, rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, sonic, etc) and details (eg core diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of diamond tails, face-sampling bit or other type, whether core is oriented and if so, by what method, etc). NQ size core diamond drilling was completed for all holes. Core was not oriented. Drill sample recovery Method of recording and assessing core and chip sample recoveries and results assessed. Measures taken to maximize sample recovery and ensure representative nature of the samples. Whether a relationship exists between sample recovery and grade and whether sample bias may have occurred due to preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse material. All drill core was geotechnically logged following industry standard practices, and includes TCR, RQD, ISRM, and Q-Method. Core recovery is very good and typically exceeds 90%. Logging Whether core and chip samples have been geologically and geotechnically logged to a level of detail to support appropriate Mineral Resource estimation, mining studies and metallurgical studies. Whether logging is qualitative or quantitative in nature. Core (or costean, channel, etc) photography. The total length and percentage of the relevant intersections logged. Upon receipt at the core shack, all drill core is pieced together, oriented to maximum foliation, metre marked, geotechnically logged (including structure), alteration logged, geologically logged, and sample logged on an individual sample basis. Core box photos are also collected of all core drilled, regardless of perceived mineralization. Specific gravity measurements of pegmatite are also collected at systematic intervals for all pegmatite drill core using the water immersion method, as well as select host rock drill core. The logging is qualitative by nature, and includes estimates of spodumene grain size, inclusions, and model mineral estimates. These logging practices meet or exceed current industry standard practices. Sub-sampling techniques and sample preparation If core, whether cut or sawn and whether quarter, half or all core taken. If non-core, whether riffled, tube sampled, rotary split, etc and whether sampled wet or dry. For all sample types, the nature, quality and appropriateness of the sample preparation technique. Quality control procedures adopted for all sub-sampling stages to maximize representivity of samples. Measures taken to ensure that the sampling is representative of the in situ material collected, including for instance results for field duplicate/second-half sampling. Whether sample sizes are appropriate to the grain size of the material being sampled. Drill core sampling follows industry best practices. Drill core was saw-cut with half-core sent for geochemical analysis and half-core remaining in the box for reference. The same side of the core was sampled to maintain representativeness. Sample sizes are appropriate for the material being assayed.A Quality Assurance / Quality Control (QAQC) protocol following industry best practices was incorporated into the program and included systematic insertion of quartz blanks and certified reference materials (CRMs) into sample batches at a rate of approximately 5% each. Additionally, analysis of pulp-split and course-split sample duplicates were completed to assess analytical precision at different stages of the laboratory preparation process, and external (secondary) laboratory pulp-split duplicates were prepared at the primary lab for subsequent check analysis and validation at a secondary lab.• All protocols employed are considered appropriate for the sample type and nature of mineralization and are considered the optimal approach for maintaining representativeness in sampling. Quality of assay data and laboratory tests The nature, quality and appropriateness of the assaying and laboratory procedures used and whether the technique is considered partial or total. For geophysical tools, spectrometers, handheld XRF instruments, etc, the parameters used in determining the analysis including instrument make and model, reading times, calibrations factors applied and their derivation, etc. Nature of quality control procedures adopted (eg standards, blanks, duplicates, external laboratory checks) and whether acceptable levels of accuracy (ie lack of bias) and precision have been established. Core samples collected from drill holes were shipped to SGS Canada's laboratory in Val-d'Or, QC, for standard sample preparation (code PRP89 special) which included drying at 105°C, crush to 90% passing 2 mm, riffle split 250 g, and pulverize 85% passing 75 microns. Core sample pulps were shipped by air to SGS Canada's laboratory in Burnaby, BC, where the samples were homogenized and subsequently analyzed for multi-element (including Li and Ta) using sodium peroxide fusion with ICP-AES/MS finish (codes GE_ICP91A50 and GE_IMS91A50). The Company relies on both its internal QAQC protocols (systematic use of blanks, certified reference materials, and external checks), as well as the laboratory's internal QAQC. All protocols employed are considered appropriate for the sample type and nature of mineralization and are considered the optimal approach for maintaining representativeness in sampling. Verification of sampling and assaying The verification of significant intersections by either independent or alternative company personnel. The use of twinned holes. Documentation of primary data, data entry procedures, data verification, data storage (physical and electronic) protocols. Discuss any adjustment to assay data. Intervals are reviewed and compiled by the VP Exploration and Project Managers prior to disclosure, including a review of the Company's internal QAQC sample analytical data. Data capture utilizes MX Deposit software whereby core logging data is entered directly into the software for storage, including direct import of laboratory analytical certificates as they are received. The Company employs various on-site and post QAQC protocols to ensure data integrity and accuracy. Adjustments to data include reporting lithium and tantalum in their oxide forms, as it is reported in elemental form in the assay certificates. Formulas used are Li2O = Li x 2.153, and Ta2O5 = Ta x 1.221. Location of data points Accuracy and quality of surveys used to locate drill holes (collar and down-hole surveys), trenches, mine workings and other locations used in Mineral Resource estimation. Specification of the grid system used. Quality and adequacy of topographic control. Each drill hole's collar has been surveyed with a RTK Trimble Zephyr 3 or RTK Topcon GR-5. The coordinate system used is UTM NAD83 Zone 18. The Company completed a property-wide LiDAR and orthophoto survey in August 2022, which provides high-quality topographic control. The quality and accuracy of the topographic controls are considered adequate for advanced stage exploration and development, including mineral resource estimation. Data spacing and distribution Data spacing for reporting of Exploration Results. Whether the data spacing and distribution is sufficient to establish the degree of geological and grade continuity appropriate for the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimation procedure(s) and classifications applied. Whether sample compositing has been applied. At CV5, drill hole collar spacing is dominantly grid based at ~100 m; however, tightens to ~50 m in multiple areas, and widens to ~150 m in a small number of areas. Several collars are typically completed from the same pad at varied orientations resulting in more varied pegmatite pierce points at depth. At CV13, drill hole spacing is dominantly grid based at ~100 m; however, collar locations and hole orientations may vary widely, which reflect the varied orientation of the pegmatite body along strike. At CV9, drill hole collar spacing is irregular with varied hole orientations and multiple collars on the same pad. It is interpreted that some of the drill hole spacing is sufficient to support a mineral resource estimate. Core sample lengths typically range from 0.5 to 1.5 m and average ~1 m. Sampling is continuous within all pegmatite encountered in the drill hole. Orientation of data in relation to geological structure Whether the orientation of sampling achieves unbiased sampling of possible structures and the extent to which this is known, considering the deposit type. If the relationship between the drilling orientation and the orientation of key mineralized structures is considered to have introduced a sampling bias, this should be assessed and reported if material. No sampling bias is anticipated based on structure within the mineralized body. The principal mineralized bodies are relatively undeformed and very competent, although have some meaningful structural control. At CV5, the principal mineralized body and adjacent lenses are steeply dipping resulting in oblique angles of intersection with true widths varying based on drill hole angle and orientation of pegmatite at that particular intersection point. i.e., the dip of the mineralized pegmatite body has variations in a vertical sense and along strike, so the true widths are not always apparent until several holes have been drilled (at the appropriate spacing) in any particular drill-fence. At CV13, the principal pegmatite body has a shallow varied strike and northerly dip. At CV9, the orientation and geometry of the pegmatite is not well understood. The pegmatite is currently interpreted to be comprised of a single principal dyke, which outcrops at surface, has a steep northerly dip, and is moderately plunging to the east-southeast. Sample security The measures taken to ensure sample security. Samples were collected by Company staff or its consultants following specific protocols governing sample collection and handling. Core samples were bagged, placed in large supersacs for added security, palleted, and shipped directly to Val-d'Or, QC, being tracked during shipment along with Chain of Custody. Upon arrival at the laboratory, the samples were cross-referenced with the shipping manifest to confirm all samples were accounted for. At the laboratory, sample bags are evaluated for tampering. Audits or reviews The results of any audits or reviews of sampling techniques and data. A review of the sample procedures for the Company's 2021 fall drill program (CF21-001 to 004) and 2022 winter drill program (CV22-015 to 034) was completed by an Independent Competent Person and deemed adequate and acceptable to industry best practices (discussed in a technical report titled ""NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Corvette Property, Quebec, Canada"", by Alex Knox, M.Sc., P.Geol., Issue Date of June 27th, 2022.) A review of the sample procedures through the Company's 2023 winter drill program (through CV23-190) was completed by an independent Competent Person with respect to the CV5 Pegmatite's maiden mineral resource estimate and deemed adequate and acceptable to industry best practices (discussed in a technical report titled "" NI 43–101 Technical Report, Mineral Resource Estimate for the CV5 Pegmatite, Corvette Property"" by Todd McCracken, P.Geo., of BBA Engineering Ltd., and Ryan Cunningham, M.Eng., P.Eng., of Primero Group Americas Inc., Effective Date of June 25, 2023, and Issue Date of September 8, 2023. Additionally, the Company continually reviews and evaluates its procedures in order to optimize and ensure compliance at all levels of sample data collection and handling. Section 2 – Reporting of Exploration ResultsCriteria JORC Code explanation Commentary Mineral tenement and land tenure status Type, reference name/number, location and ownership including agreements or material issues with third parties such as joint ventures, partnerships, overriding royalties, native title interests, historical sites, wilderness or national park and environmental settings. The security of the tenure held at the time of reporting along with any known impediments to obtaining a licence to operate in the area. The Corvette Property is comprised of 424 CDC claims located in the James Bay Region of Quebec, with Patriot Battery Metals Inc. being the registered title holder for all of the claims. The northern border of the Property's primary claim block is located within approximately 6 km to the south of the Trans-Taiga Road and powerline infrastructure corridor. The CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite is situated approximately 13.5 km south of the regional and all–weather Trans-Taiga Road and powerline infrastructure. The CV13 and CV9 spodumene pegmatites are located approximately 3 km west-southwest and 14 km west of CV5, respectively. The Company holds 100% interest in the Property subject to various royalty obligations depending on original acquisition agreements. DG Resources Management holds a 2% NSR (no buyback) on 76 claims, D.B.A. Canadian Mining House holds a 2% NSR on 50 claims (half buyback for $2M) and Osisko Gold Royalties holds a sliding scale NSR of 1.5-3.5% on precious metals, and 2% on all other products, over 111 claims. The vast majority of the CV13 Spodumene Pegmatite, as is currently delineated, is not subject to a royalty. The Property does not overlap any atypically sensitive environmental areas or parks, or historical sites to the knowledge of the Company. There are no known hinderances to operating at the Property, apart from the goose harvesting season (typically mid-April to mid-May) where the communities request helicopter flying not be completed, and potentially wildfires depending on the season, scale, and location. Claim expiry dates range from February 2025 to November 2026. Exploration done by other parties Acknowledgment and appraisal of exploration by other parties. No core assay results from other parties are disclosed herein. The most recent independent Property review was a technical report titled ""NI 43-101 Technical Report, Mineral Resource Estimate for the CV5 Pegmatite, Corvette Property, James Bay Region, Québec, Canada"", by Todd McCracken, P.Geo., of BBA Engineering Ltd., and Ryan Cunningham, M.Eng., P.Eng., of Primero Group Americas Inc., Effective Date of June 25, 2023, and Issue Date of September 8, 2023. Geology Deposit type, geological setting and style of mineralization. The Property overlies a large portion of the Lac Guyer Greenstone Belt, considered part of the larger La Grande River Greenstone Belt and is dominated by volcanic rocks metamorphosed to amphibolite facies. The claim block is dominantly host to rocks of the Guyer Group (amphibolite, iron formation, intermediate to mafic volcanics, peridotite, pyroxenite, komatiite, as well as felsic volcanics). The amphibolite rocks that trend east-west (generally steeply south dipping) through this region are bordered to the north by the Magin Formation (conglomerate and wacke) and to the south by an assemblage of tonalite, granodiorite, and diorite, in addition to metasediments of the Marbot Group (conglomerate, wacke). Several regional-scale Proterozoic gabbroic dykes also cut through portions of the Property (Lac Spirt Dykes, Senneterre Dykes). The geological setting is prospective for gold, silver, base metals, platinum group elements, and lithium over several different deposit styles including orogenic gold (Au), volcanogenic massive sulfide (Cu, Au, Ag), komatiite-ultramafic (Au, Ag, PGE, Ni, Cu, Co), and pegmatite (Li, Ta). Exploration of the Property has outlined three primary mineral exploration trends crossing dominantly east-west over large portions of the Property – Golden Trend (gold), Maven Trend (copper, gold, silver), and CV Trend (lithium, tantalum). The CV5 and CV13 spodumene pegmatites are situated within the CV Trend. Lithium mineralization at the Property, including at CV5, CV13, and CV9, is observed to occur within quartz-feldspar pegmatite, which may be exposed at surface as high relief 'whale-back' landforms. The pegmatite is often very coarse-grained and off-white in appearance, with darker sections commonly composed of mica and smoky quartz, and occasional tourmaline. The lithium pegmatites at Corvette are categorized as LCT Pegmatites. Core assays and ongoing mineralogical studies, coupled with field mineral identification and assays, indicate spodumene as the dominant lithium-bearing mineral on the Property, with no significant petalite, lepidolite, lithium-phosphate minerals, or apatite present. The pegmatites also carry significant tantalum values with tantalite indicated to be the mineral phase. Drill hole Information A summary of all information material to the understanding of the exploration results including a tabulation of the following information for all Material drill holes: easting and northing of the drill hole collar elevation or RL (Reduced Level – elevation above sea level in metres) of the drill hole collar dip and azimuth of the hole down hole length and interception depth hole length. If the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis that the information is not Material and this exclusion does not detract from the understanding of the report, the Competent Person should clearly explain why this is the case. Drill hole attribute information is included in a table herein. Pegmatite intersections of <2 m are not typically presented as they are considered insignificant. Data aggregation methods In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques, maximum and/or minimum grade truncations (eg cutting of high grades) and cut-off grades are usually Material and should be stated. Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high grade results and longer lengths of low grade results, the procedure used for such aggregation should be stated and some typical examples of such aggregations should be shown in detail. The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values should be clearly stated. Length weighted averages were used to calculate grade over width. No specific grade cap or cut-off was used during grade width calculations. The lithium and tantalum average of the entire pegmatite interval is calculated for all pegmatite intervals over 2 m core length, as well as higher grade zones at the discretion of the geologist. Pegmatites have inconsistent mineralization by nature, resulting in some intervals having a small number of poorly mineralized samples included in the calculation. Non-pegmatite internal dilution is limited to typically <3 m where relevant and intervals indicated when assays are reported. No metal equivalents have been reported. Relationship between mineralization widths and intercept lengths These relationships are particularly important in the reporting of Exploration Results. If the geometry of the mineralization with respect to the drill hole angle is known, its nature should be reported. If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there should be a clear statement to this effect (eg 'down hole length, true width not known'). At CV5, geological modelling is ongoing on a hole-by-hole basis and as assays are received. However, current interpretation supports a principal, large pegmatite body of near vertical to steeply dipping orientation, flanked by several subordinate pegmatite lenses (collectively, the 'CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite') At CV13, geological modelling is ongoing on a hole-by-hole basis and as assays are received. However, current interpretation supports an upper and lower pegmatite body, each trending sub-parallel to each other with a shallow northerly dip (collectively, the 'CV13 Spodumene Pegmatite') At CV9, geological modelling is ongoing on a hole-by-hole basis and as assays are received. However, current interpretation indicates CV9 is comprised of a single principal dyke, which outcrops at surface, has a steep northerly dip, and is moderately plunging to the east-southeast. A strike length of 450 m has been delineated through drilling and outcrop. All reported widths are core length. True widths are not calculated for each hole due to the relatively wide drill spacing at this stage of delineation and the typical irregular nature of pegmatite, as well as the varied drill hole orientations. As such, true widths may vary widely from hole to hole. Diagrams Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of intercepts should be included for any significant discovery being reported These should include, but not be limited to a plan view of drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views. Please refer to the figures included herein as well as those posted on the Company's website. Balanced reporting Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not practicable, representative reporting of both low and high grades and/or widths should be practiced to avoid misleading reporting of Exploration Results. Please refer to the table(s) included herein as well as those posted on the Company's website. Results for pegmatite intervals <2 m are not reported. Other substantive exploration data Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be reported including (but not limited to): geological observations; geophysical survey results; geochemical survey results; bulk samples – size and method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics; potential deleterious or contaminating substances. The Company is currently completing baseline environmental work over the CV5 and CV13 pegmatite area. No endangered flora or fauna have been documented over the Property to date, and several sites have been identified as potentially suitable for mine infrastructure. The Company has completed a bathymetric survey over the shallow glacial lake which overlies a portion of the CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite. The lake depth ranges from <2 m to approximately 18 m, although the majority of the CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite, as delineated to date, is overlain by typically <2 to 10 m of water. The Company has completed preliminary metallurgical testing comprised of HLS and magnetic testing, which has produced 6+% Li2O spodumene concentrates at >70% recovery on both CV5 and CV13 pegmatite material, indicating DMS as a viable primary process approach, and that both CV5 and CV13 could potentially feed the same process plant. A DMS test on CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite material returned a spodumene concentrate grading 5.8% Li2O at 79% recovery, strongly indicating potential for a DMS only operation to be applicable. Various mandates required for advancing the Project towards economic studies have been initiated, including but not limited to, environmental baseline, metallurgy, geomechanics, hydrogeology, hydrology, stakeholder engagement, geochemical characterization, as well as transportation and logistical studies. Further work The nature and scale of planned further work (eg tests for lateral extensions or depth extensions or large-scale step-out drilling). Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible extensions, including the main geological interpretations and future drilling areas, provided this information is not commercially sensitive. The Company intends to continue drilling the pegmatites of the Corvette Property, focused on the CV5 Pegmatite and adjacent subordinate lenses, as well as the CV13 Pegmatite. A follow-up drill program at the CV9 Spodumene Pegmatite is anticipated following receipt of assays.

Positive None. Negative None. 02/25/2024 - 02:00 PM Detailed results from the NIH-sponsored Phase III OUtMATCH study showed treatment with Xolair increased the amount of peanuts, tree nuts, egg, milk and wheat that people as young as 1 year consumed without an allergic reaction The U.S. FDA recently approved Xolair as the first and only medicine for children and adults with one or more food allergies Allergic reactions can be life-threatening and it is estimated that food-related anaphylaxis results in 30,000 medical events treated in emergency rooms in the U.S. each year1-3 Basel, 25 February 2024 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced today data from Stage 1 of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-sponsored pivotal Phase III OUtMATCH study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Xolair® (omalizumab) in patients allergic to peanuts and at least two other common foods were published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and featured in a late-breaking symposium at the 2024 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) Annual Meeting. The study showed treatment with Xolair increased the amount of peanuts, milk, egg, wheat and tree nuts (cashew, hazelnut and walnut) that it took to cause moderate to severe allergic reactions in multi-food allergic people as young as 1 year. Safety findings were consistent with the known safety profile of Xolair across its approved indications and in previous clinical trials.4 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved the expanded use of Xolair in children and adults with IgE-mediated food allergies based on the OUtMATCH data. “Over the past 35 years, I have seen how debilitating food allergies can be for patients and their loved ones, as they are consumed by the fear of accidental exposure,” said Robert Wood, M.D., director of the Eudowood Division of Allergy, Immunology and Rheumatology at Johns Hopkins Children's Center, and principal investigator of the OUtMATCH study. “While allergic reactions to exposures are common and often severe, there have been limited treatment advancements for food allergy. The results of the OUtMATCH study showed that anti-IgE therapy could significantly reduce the occurrence of allergic reactions across multiple foods in the event of an accidental exposure.” “Living with food allergies has a profound impact on patients and their families, causing significant stress and requiring constant vigilance,” said R. Sharon Chinthrajah, M.D., associate professor of medicine, Stanford School of Medicine, Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy and Asthma Research and OUtMATCH co-lead study investigator. “The OUtMATCH study demonstrated that anti-IgE therapy increased most patients’ threshold for an allergic reaction. This presents an important new treatment option for patients and families in its potential to reduce the risk of allergic reactions from accidental exposures they may face in day-to-day life.” One hundred eighty patients ages 1 to 55 years old entered Stage 1 of the OUtMATCH study unable to tolerate up to 100 mg of peanut protein (equivalent to about one third of a peanut), and up to 300 mg of at least two other food proteins among milk, egg, cashew, walnut, hazelnut and wheat. After 16 to 20 weeks of treatment with Xolair or placebo, each participant completed four separate blinded food challenges (including a placebo ingredient) to assess patients’ ability to consume a single dose of at least 600 mg of peanut protein (primary endpoint), and a single dose of at least 1,000 mg of milk, egg, wheat, cashew, hazelnut or walnut protein (secondary endpoints) without experiencing moderate to severe allergic reactions. Results showed that, compared to placebo, a statistically significant (p<0.001) higher proportion of patients receiving Xolair were able to consume at least 600 mg of peanut protein and at least 1,000 mg of milk, egg and cashew protein without experiencing moderate to severe allergic reactions. Additionally, compared to placebo, a higher proportion of patients receiving Xolair were also able to consume at least 1,000 mg of walnut, hazelnut and wheat protein without experiencing moderate to severe allergic reactions. Detailed results are included in the table below. OUtMATCH Primary and Secondary Endpoints Results in Paediatric Population (n=177)Percentage of Patients Successfully Consuming Predefined Threshold Dose of Seven Foods Approximate Equivalents5 Xolair Treated Patients Placebo Treated Patients Number of Patients Primary Endpoint Peanut (≥600 mg) 95% CI for difference: 47 to 70; p<0.001 2.5 peanuts or 1/2 teaspoon of regular peanut butter 67% 7% 177 Key Secondary Endpoints Cashew (≥1,000 mg) 95% CI for difference: 19 to 52; p<0.001 3.5 cashews 41% 3% 99 Egg (≥1,000 mg) 95% CI for difference: 46 to 79; p<0.001 1/4 of an egg 67% 0% 71 Milk (≥1,000 mg) 95% CI for difference: 30 to 74; p<0.001 2 tablespoons of 1% milk 66% 10% 62 Additional Secondary Endpoints Walnut (≥1,000 mg) 95% CI for difference: 27 to 68 3 walnut halves 64% 13% 78 Hazelnut (≥1,000 mg) 95% CI for difference: -2 to 78 4.5 hazelnuts 65% 14% 24 Wheat (≥1,000 mg) 95% CI for difference: 13 to 88 3.5 saltine crackers 75% 13% 20 Additionally, out of three adult OUtMATCH participants, two completed Stage 1 of the study; the adult who received Xolair met the primary endpoint compared to the placebo-enrolled adult patient. Adverse event rates in the study were similar between Xolair and placebo. The most common adverse event in Xolair-treated children and adolescents was injection site reaction (9%). “The Phase III OUtMATCH results represent a major advance and reinforce our commitment to addressing critical gaps in care for conditions like food allergy,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “Now recently FDA-approved, Xolair provides a new way to help manage food allergies for children and adults who live with the constant fear of life-threatening allergic reactions.” While efficacy cannot be established from uncontrolled, open-label studies, for 38 children who continued Xolair for 24-28 weeks in an open-label extension, the percentage of patients who were able to consume 600 mg or more of peanut protein and 1,000 mg or more of egg, milk and/or cashew protein without moderate to severe dose-limiting symptoms was maintained. About 3.4 million children and 13.6 million adults in the U.S. will have been diagnosed with IgE-mediated food allergies, based on estimates for 2024.1,2 Food allergy prevalence has been on the rise for the past 20 years.6 There are 160 different foods that cause IgE-mediated food allergy.7 Allergic reactions can range from mild to moderate, including hives and swelling, to severe and life-threatening, such as anaphylaxis.3 More than 40% of children and more than half of adults with food allergies have experienced a severe reaction at least once, and it is estimated that food-related anaphylaxis results in 30,000 medical events treated in emergency rooms in the U.S. each year.1-3 On 16 February, 2024, the FDA approved Xolair for the reduction of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, that may occur with accidental exposure to one or more foods in adult and paediatric patients aged 1 year and older with IgE-mediated food allergy. People taking Xolair for food allergies should continue to avoid all foods they are allergic to (commonly referred to as “food allergen avoidance”). Xolair should not be used for the emergency treatment of any allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Xolair is the first and only FDA-approved medicine to reduce allergic reactions in people with one or more food allergies. In the U.S., Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation work together to develop and co-promote Xolair. About the OUtMATCH StudyThe Omalizumab as Monotherapy and as Adjunct Therapy to Multi-Allergen Oral Immunotherapy in Food Allergic Children and Adults (OUtMATCH; NCT03881696) study is an NIH-sponsored, three-stage, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating Xolair safety and efficacy in patients aged 1 to 55 years who are allergic to peanuts and at least two other common foods. Stage 1 included 180 patients (177 children and adolescents; 3 adults) who were randomly assigned to receive placebo or Xolair injections either every two weeks or every four weeks for 16 to 20 weeks. The Xolair dose and dosing interval were determined by total serum IgE level and body weight at baseline. After 16 to 20 weeks of treatment with Xolair or placebo, each participant completed four separate blinded food challenges where they were given gradually increasing amounts of peanut protein, two other food proteins they were allergic to, and a placebo ingredient. The food challenges were conducted in a carefully controlled setting with investigators looking for signs and symptoms of allergic reaction to assess patients’ ability to consume a single dose of at least 600 mg of peanut protein (primary endpoint), and a single dose of at least 1,000 mg of milk, egg, wheat, cashew, hazelnut or walnut protein (secondary endpoints) without experiencing dose-limiting symptoms, which were defined as moderate to severe allergic reactions, including skin, respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. The OUtMATCH study is being sponsored and funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the NIH, and conducted by the NIAID-funded Consortium for Food Allergy Research (CoFAR) at 10 clinical sites across the U.S. led by Johns Hopkins Children's Center and co-led by Stanford School of Medicine. The study is also supported by Genentech and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation. About Xolair Xolair is the only approved antibody designed to target and block immunoglobulin E (IgE). By reducing free IgE, down-regulating high-affinity IgE receptors and limiting mast cell degranulation, Xolair minimises the release of mediators throughout the allergic inflammatory cascade.

NRS Digital Media Launches StrataSelect,2024-02-26T14:10:00.000Z,Low,Positive,"NRS Digital Media Launches StrataSelect, a Hyper-Targeting In-Store Retail Media Solution, Enhancing Brand Campaigns with Data-Driven Store Targeting","NRS Digital Media Launches StrataSelect Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary NRS Digital Media Launches StrataSelect, a Hyper-Targeting In-Store Retail Media Solution, Enhancing Brand Campaigns with Data-Driven Store Targeting Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The launch of StrataSelect by NRS Digital Media represents a significant advancement in the retail advertising space. By moving away from a one-size-fits-all approach to in-store advertising, StrataSelect's hyper-targeting capability allows for a more granular and effective marketing strategy. The use of proprietary computational processes to analyze diverse data sets, such as store-specific scan data and consumer behavior, empowers brands to place their advertising content in front of the most receptive audiences.This innovation has the potential to increase the return on investment (ROI) for brands that advertise through the NRS network. By ensuring that marketing efforts are not wasted on uninterested customers, StrataSelect could lead to higher conversion rates and ultimately, increased sales. From the perspective of the stock market and investors, companies that leverage such advanced targeting technologies may gain a competitive edge, potentially reflecting positively on their stock valuations. Financial Analyst StrataSelect's impact on NRS's financial performance could be substantial. The data-driven approach to in-store advertising could attract more brands to the NRS network, increasing the company's advertising revenues. Given that NRS operates across a vast network of 28,300 POS terminals with a reported $17.2 billion in sales over the past year, the scale at which StrataSelect operates could lead to significant incremental revenue.Investors should monitor the adoption rate of StrataSelect among brands and its effect on NRS's overall financial health. The ability to offer targeted advertising at scale is a unique value proposition that could justify a premium on the company's services, potentially leading to expanded profit margins. However, investors should also consider the costs associated with developing and implementing such sophisticated technology and whether these are outweighed by the additional revenue generated. Advertising Technology Expert The introduction of StrataSelect is a testament to the ongoing evolution of advertising technology, particularly in the retail sector. The use of advanced analytics and big data to enhance the resonance of in-store media is a trend that's gaining traction. StrataSelect's approach, which includes analyzing detailed demographics and consumer behavior, is at the forefront of this trend.For stakeholders in the advertising and retail industries, understanding the capabilities and limitations of such technology is crucial. The ability to deliver hyper-targeted content at the point of sale can lead to a more personalized shopping experience, fostering customer loyalty. However, it's also important to consider privacy concerns and the ethical use of consumer data. Ensuring that data is used responsibly and in compliance with regulations is key to maintaining consumer trust and avoiding legal pitfalls. 02/26/2024 - 09:10 AM StrataSelect Enhances Resonance of In-Store Retail Media with Hyper-Targeting NEWARK, NJ, Feb. 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NRS Digital Media, a division of National Retail Solutions (NRS), today launched StrataSelect, an in-store retail digital media planning solution that enables brands to achieve data-driven, value-based, store targeting across more than 28,000 NRS digital screens hosted by an independent retailers nationwide.

This technology is particularly relevant as it can accelerate the deployment of 4G and 5G networks, which are critical for modern digital economies. The investment in Ukraine's digital infrastructure signals a strong commitment to the region's recovery and could lead to enhanced connectivity and economic growth. The involvement of high-level government officials from Japan and Ukraine underscores the strategic importance of this initiative.From a business perspective, the deployment of Open RAN could give Kyivstar a competitive edge in the Ukrainian market by allowing for more agile network upgrades and maintenance. For Rakuten Symphony, this represents a substantial opportunity to demonstrate the efficacy of its technology in a challenging environment, potentially leading to further adoption of its solutions globally. Investors might view this collaboration as a positive indicator of VEON's commitment to innovation and market expansion, which could have favorable implications for the company's long-term growth and stock performance. Financial Analyst The financial implications of VEON's commitment to invest 600 million USD, with intentions to increase to 1 billion USD, in Ukraine's digital infrastructure are considerable. This level of investment not only reflects the scale of the reconstruction efforts required but also VEON's confidence in the future of the Ukrainian market. The investment is likely to be a multi-year driver of growth for Kyivstar and could lead to significant returns if the deployment of Open RAN technology leads to cost savings and increased customer satisfaction.For the broader stock market, this news may be received as a positive development, showcasing how companies can contribute to societal recovery while pursuing business opportunities. The long-term nature of this investment could provide a steady growth narrative for VEON, potentially making it an attractive proposition for investors seeking companies with a blend of social impact and financial performance. It's also important to note that such large-scale investments carry risks, including political and economic instability in the region, which investors will need to monitor closely. Market Research Analyst Analyzing the market impact of Kyivstar's planned deployment of Open RAN technology reveals potential shifts in the telecommunications landscape. Open RAN is poised to disrupt traditional network deployment models, which could lead to changes in market dynamics as operators seek more cost-effective and flexible infrastructure solutions. The Ukrainian telecommunications market could become a case study in the adoption of Open RAN, influencing other operators in Eastern Europe and beyond.The initiative's scope, involving both 4G and 5G technology, indicates an effort to not only recover but also future-proof Ukraine's digital infrastructure. This could attract additional foreign investment and technology partnerships, bolstering the country's digital economy. For Rakuten Symphony, success in Ukraine could translate into increased market credibility and lead to further global business opportunities, potentially impacting the stock market valuation of Rakuten Group. 02/26/2024 - 09:07 AM Companies intend to take the first steps in implementation in 2024 Barcelona, February 26, 2024 – VEON, (NASDAQ: VEON, Euronext Amsterdam: VEON), a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services, today announces that its wholly-owned subsidiary Kyivstar and Rakuten Symphony, a subsidiary of the leading internet services company Rakuten Group have signed of a Letter of Intent (LoI) that confirms Kyivstar’s interest in procuring and deploying Rakuten Symphony's Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN) technology in its network. The LoI confirms Kyivstar’s intent to use Rakuten’s Open RAN and 5G technologies to help rebuild Ukraine's digital infrastructure, reinforcing both companies’ commitment to supporting Ukraine’s recovery and reconstruction. The companies intend to take the first steps in the implementation of their cooperation within 2024. Kyivstar and Rakuten Symphony are currently collaborating to define the scope of their initiative, which will involve both 4G and 5G Open RAN technology. Rakuten and Kyivstar held a signing ceremony for the LoI in the presence of Fumio Kishida, Prime Minister of Japan, and Denys Shmyhal, Prime Minister of Ukraine, at the Japan-Ukraine Conference for Promotion of Economic Growth and Reconstruction, hosted in Tokyo on February 19, with Hideyuki Hirama, EVP, COO and CSO of Rakuten Symphony, and Sergiy Korsunsky, Ukrainian Ambassador to Japan, in attendance. Mickey Mikitani, Chairman and CEO, Rakuten Group, said, “Rakuten is extremely proud to continue its support for Ukraine’s efforts to rebuild its infrastructure and in supporting Kyivstar’s vision for deploying Open RAN. We look forward to advancing collaboration between our two organizations and to realising Ukraine’s digital potential through the rebuilding of the country’s digital infrastructure.” Kaan Terzioglu, Group CEO of VEON, said “We are now in the implementation phase of our 600 million USD investment commitment for the reconstruction of Ukraine. I share the excitement of our Kyivstar team, under the leadership of Kyivstar CEO Oleksandr Komarov, in working with Rakuten to rebuild the country’s infrastructure with Open RAN as a part of this commitment. We have a shared passion for building Ukraine’s digital future and I’m glad to see the progress in our joint effort.” The signing follows a number of measures taken by Rakuten and VEON to support Ukraine throughout the war, demonstrating a commitment to its people, economy and post-war reconstruction. In August 2023, Rakuten Symphony and VEON, Kyivstar’s parent company, signed a Memorandum of Understanding to explore cooperation in Ukraine, with the goal of accelerating the reconstruction of the country’s infrastructure, through collaboration on Open RAN and digital services. Rakuten Group Chairman and CEO Mickey Mikitani accompanied Japanese government officials on a diplomatic mission to Ukraine in September 2023. Serving as a representative of Japan’s private sector, Mikitani met with Ukraine leaders including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Minister Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine’s Vice Prime Minister for Innovation, Development of Education, Science and Technology and Minister of Digital Transformation. Rakuten also launched the Ukraine Humanitarian Crisis Emergency Relief Fund through its online donation platform, Rakuten Clutch Special Charity Fund, and held a t-shirt donation drive to support Ukraine that raised more than 1.3 billion yen.

The project aims to create LEED-certified industrial distribution buildings totaling approximately 2.2 million square feet by 2027.","Terreno Realty Corporation Announces Development Starts in Hialeah, FL Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Terreno Realty Corporation (TRNO) has started construction on Countyline Corporate Park Phase IV buildings 32 and 33 in Hialeah, Florida, with an expected investment of $79.1 million. The project aims to create LEED-certified industrial distribution buildings totaling approximately 2.2 million square feet by 2027. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The commencement of the construction of Countyline Corporate Park Phase IV by Terreno Realty Corporation represents a significant expansion in their industrial real estate portfolio. The investment in high-clearance, rear-load distribution buildings highlights a strategic focus on logistics and distribution, which is a growing segment due to the rise in e-commerce and the demand for efficient supply chain solutions. The location of the park, being adjacent to major transportation routes such as Florida's Turnpike and I-75, is critical for distribution logistics, potentially reducing transportation costs and delivery times for future tenants.The projected LEED certification for the buildings indicates a commitment to sustainability, which can be a draw for environmentally conscious tenants and may result in operational cost savings due to energy efficiency. Additionally, the estimated stabilized cap rate of 6.0% is a key figure for investors as it suggests the expected yield on the investment once the property reaches market occupancy. This figure is within the typical range for industrial investments, indicating a competitive return potential in the current market. Financial Analyst An estimated total investment of $79.1 million for the initial phase and $511.5 million for the complete project is a substantial outlay that reflects confidence in the industrial real estate market, particularly in the Miami area. Investors should consider the scale of the project and the long-term horizon for completion and stabilization. The estimated stabilized cap rate provides a glimpse into the expected profitability and risk profile of the project. A cap rate of 6.0% is generally considered attractive in today's low-interest-rate environment, suggesting the project could offer a solid income stream once fully leased.It's important to note that the actual return could vary based on the final leasing rates, occupancy levels and operating costs. The project's success will depend on market conditions at the time of completion, including the supply and demand dynamics for industrial space in the Miami market. Investors should also consider the potential risks associated with construction delays, cost overruns and changes in market conditions over the multi-year development period. Environmental Consultant The pursuit of LEED certification for the new buildings is indicative of a broader industry trend towards sustainable development. LEED-certified buildings are designed to be resource-efficient and have a reduced carbon footprint. For Terreno Realty Corporation, this could mean lower operating costs and a competitive advantage in attracting tenants who prioritize sustainability. From a broader perspective, such developments can also contribute positively to the company's environmental, social and governance (ESG) profile, which is increasingly relevant to investors.However, the actual environmental impact of the development will depend on various factors, including the specifics of the LEED certification achieved and the operational practices implemented. Investors with an interest in sustainable development should look for additional details on the types of LEED credits Terreno is targeting, as these will determine the extent to which the buildings meet high environmental performance standards. 02/26/2024 - 09:15 AM BELLEVUE, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Terreno Realty Corporation (NYSE:TRNO), an acquirer, owner and operator of industrial real estate in six major coastal U.S. markets, announced today that it has commenced construction of Countyline Corporate Park Phase IV Buildings 32 and 33 in Hialeah, Florida. Building 32 of Terreno Realty Corporation’s Countyline Corporate Park is a 164,000 square foot 36-foot clear height rear-load industrial distribution building on 8.3 acres with 53 dock-high and two grade-level loading positions and parking for 148 cars. Building 33 of Terreno Realty Corporation’s Countyline Corporate Park is a 158,000 square foot 36-foot clear height rear-load industrial distribution building on 9.0 acres with 53 dock-high and two grade-level loading positions and parking for 136 cars. The buildings are expected to be completed in 2025 and achieve LEED certification, the total expected investment is $79.1 million and the estimated stabilized cap rate is 6.0%. Countyline Corporate Park Phase IV consists of a 121-acre project entitled for 2.2 million square feet of industrial distribution buildings in Miami’s Countyline Corporate Park (“Countyline”), immediately adjacent to Terreno Realty Corporation’s seven fully-leased buildings within Countyline (Countyline Corporate Park Phase III). Countyline is a landfill redevelopment adjacent to Florida’s Turnpike and the southern terminus of I-75 located at the intersection of NW 170th Street and NW 107th Avenue. At expected completion in 2027, Countyline Corporate Park Phase IV is expected to contain ten LEED-certified industrial distribution buildings totaling approximately 2.2 million square feet providing 660 dock-high and 22 grade-level loading positions and parking for 1,875 cars for a total expected investment of approximately $511.5 million. Taken together, Terreno Realty Corporation’s Countyline Corporate Park Phase III and IV will contain 17 industrial distribution buildings and 3.5 million square feet. Estimated stabilized cap rates are calculated as annualized cash basis net operating income stabilized to market occupancy (generally 95%) divided by total acquisition cost. Total acquisition cost includes the initial purchase price, the effects of marking assumed debt to market, buyer’s due diligence and closing costs, estimated near-term capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to achieve stabilization. Terreno Realty Corporation acquires, owns and operates industrial real estate in six major coastal U.S. markets: Los Angeles; Northern New Jersey/New York City; San Francisco Bay Area; Seattle; Miami; and Washington, D.C.

The offering includes common stock, pre-funded warrants, and common warrants, with Maxim Group LLC acting as the sole placement agent. The offering is expected to close on February 27, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The public offering of Aclarion, Inc. at a price of $0.58 per unit, consisting of common stock and warrants, is a strategic move aimed at raising capital. The proceeds of approximately $3.0 million, before fees and expenses, are poised to fund the company's operations and development projects. Analyzing the offering price and the terms of the warrants, which are immediately exercisable, it appears that Aclarion is incentivizing immediate investment, potentially to accelerate their growth plans or to fund ongoing research and development. The five-year expiration on the warrants also provides a medium-term horizon for investors to consider the company's value proposition.It's crucial to assess the dilutive impact of such an offering on current shareholders. With over 5 million units being sold, existing stockholders may experience a decrease in their ownership percentage and potential earnings per share. However, if the capital is used effectively to advance Aclarion's healthcare technology, it could lead to future growth that might offset this dilution. Market Research Analyst The healthcare technology sector is highly competitive and Aclarion's focus on biomarkers and augmented intelligence for chronic low back pain identification places it within a niche market with significant growth potential. The success of this public offering could be indicative of investor confidence in the company's proprietary technology and its market potential. Market trends show increasing demand for innovative healthcare solutions, which could work in Aclarion's favor if their technology proves to be effective and gains market acceptance.However, the relatively low offering price could signal to the market a potential undervaluation or an urgent need for cash. Investors will be watching closely to see if the funds raised will lead to tangible product advancements and market penetration, which would be critical in justifying the current valuation and terms of the offering. Medical Technology Analyst Aclarion's proprietary augmented intelligence algorithms represent a convergence of technology and healthcare that could potentially transform the diagnosis and treatment of chronic low back pain. The capital raised through this public offering is likely earmarked for further development and validation of their technology. Success in this field not only depends on technological innovation but also on the ability to navigate regulatory pathways and effectively integrate into existing clinical workflows.Investment in such a specialized area of healthcare technology is often considered high-risk due to the rigorous clinical and regulatory hurdles that must be overcome. However, if Aclarion can demonstrate clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness, the long-term impact on the healthcare system and the company's financial performance could be substantial. Stakeholders will be interested in post-offering developments, particularly in terms of how the company progresses with clinical trials, regulatory approvals and partnerships with healthcare providers. 02/26/2024 - 09:15 AM BROOMFIELD, CO, Feb. 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NewMediaWire -- Aclarion, Inc. (“Aclarion” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: ACON, ACONW), a healthcare technology company that is leveraging biomarkers and proprietary augmented intelligence algorithms to help physicians identify the location of chronic low back pain, today announced the pricing of its public offering of 5,175,000 units, with each unit consisting of one share of common stock (or one pre-funded warrant in lieu thereof), and two common warrants, with each common warrant to purchase one share of common stock.

Neffy could address existing gaps in efficacy of currently available treatments. Urticaria affects approximately 5 million cases in the US annually. Less than 40% of cases become chronic urticaria, with many non-responsive to antihistamines. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) represents a challenging condition for both patients and the healthcare system, often requiring long-term management and treatment strategies. The recent findings from ARS Pharmaceuticals' phase 2 study of neffy, an epinephrine nasal spray, are of significant interest due to the potential impact on treatment paradigms for CSU. The study's positive results, showing efficacy in reducing pruritus, hives, body surface area and erythema, suggest that neffy may address the unmet needs of patients who are resistant to first-line antihistamines and biologics. The implications for stakeholders are multifaceted. For patients, the availability of a rapid-onset, non-invasive treatment could greatly improve quality of life and reduce the burden of disease. For healthcare providers, neffy could offer a novel intervention that may reduce the frequency of acute flare management, including emergency room visits. For ARS Pharmaceuticals, the successful development of neffy may open up a new market segment within the allergy therapeutics space, potentially leading to increased revenue streams and market share. However, it is important to consider the long-term safety profile of neffy, as well as its cost-effectiveness compared to existing treatments. The clinical significance of these findings is underscored by the fact that nearly half of CSU cases do not respond to first-line therapies, highlighting the importance of developing alternative treatments. The absence of serious adverse events in the study is promising, although the long-term safety and tolerability of neffy remain to be established in larger patient populations and over extended periods of use. Healthcare Economist From an economic perspective, the development of neffy could have considerable implications for the healthcare system. CSU is associated with a substantial economic burden, including direct medical costs and indirect costs related to loss of productivity. Innovative treatments like neffy that offer rapid relief could potentially reduce the direct costs associated with managing acute flares, such as hospital admissions and outpatient visits. Furthermore, the potential for neffy to be used as an outpatient treatment aligns with the broader trend in healthcare towards cost containment and the shift from inpatient to outpatient care settings. By potentially reducing the need for emergency room visits and hospitalizations, neffy could contribute to lowering healthcare expenditures. However, the pricing strategy for neffy will be a critical factor in its economic impact. If priced competitively with existing therapies, neffy could be widely adopted, whereas a high price point might limit its use to only the most severe cases or lead to payer restrictions. Investors and market analysts will monitor the progress of neffy closely, as its market penetration will depend not only on its clinical efficacy and safety but also on reimbursement policies and the competitive landscape. The planned pivotal study in 2025 will be a key milestone to watch, as it will provide more robust data that can influence payer decisions and market uptake. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The announcement of neffy's phase 2 trial results is likely to have a positive impact on ARS Pharmaceuticals' stock performance in the short term, as investors often react favorably to positive clinical trial outcomes. The potential initiation of a pivotal study in 2025 may further bolster investor confidence if the development timeline is adhered to and no significant hurdles emerge. It's important to note that the CSU treatment market is characterized by a high demand for new therapies due to the limited efficacy of current options for a subset of patients. As a result, neffy's market entry could be met with significant interest from both prescribers and patients. The differentiation of neffy as a non-invasive, rapid-onset treatment is likely to be a key selling point. However, the competitive dynamics of the market, including the presence of biologics and other novel therapies, will influence neffy's market positioning and pricing strategy. Analyzing the company's capacity to meet potential demand, manufacturing scalability and distribution channels will be important in assessing the long-term business implications. Additionally, intellectual property considerations, such as patent protection and potential for market exclusivity, will play a role in the financial outlook for neffy and ARS Pharmaceuticals. 02/26/2024 - 09:01 AM neffy demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in pruritus, hives, body surface area and erythema in treatment-resistant chronic spontaneous urticaria patients, a skin disorder that causes itchy hives and/or angioedemaData supports continued development of neffy in urticaria with planned outpatient study in acute flares to initiate during 2024, with pivotal study to potentially initiate in 2025 SAN DIEGO, Feb. 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ARS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: SPRY), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to empowering at-risk patients and caregivers to better protect patients from severe allergic reactions that could lead to anaphylaxis, today announced positive efficacy results in its phase 2 inpatient chronic spontaneous urticaria study with neffy (epinephrine nasal spray), an investigational new drug. The trial met its primary endpoints with both 1 mg and 2 mg neffy demonstrating statistically significant and clinically meaningful changes from baseline in itch, hives, urticaria and erythema scores as early as 5 minutes after dosing. Urticaria is a skin disorder that causes itchy hives and/or angioedema; 50% of chronic urticaria cases1 are non-responsive to first-line antihistamine therapy. These data for neffy are being presented in an oral presentation today, February 26, at 1:10 pm ET at the 2024 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) in Washington, D.C. in Room 207B (Level 2) of the Convention Center. “The Phase 2 results in this highly refractory patient population are impressive and encouraging as they indicate neffy could be a game-changing therapeutic advance in the treatment of urticaria,” says David Bernstein, M.D., Emeritus Professor of Pediatrics at the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, a former member of the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters (urticaria guidelines) and Principal Investigator of the Study, “Urticaria symptoms clear within minutes after dosing, and neffy could offer patients a novel treatment option to address existing gaps in the efficacy of currently available antihistamines or biologics.” Design of neffy efficacy study in urticaria The EPI-U01 study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study evaluating the safety and efficacy of epinephrine nasal spray in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) treated with chronic medications who were still experiencing flares. This oral presentation includes data analysis from 18 adult patients as of the cut-off date who enrolled in this study and returned to the clinical site while experiencing a flare, where they were randomized to receive either a single treatment of 1 mg or 2 mg neffy or placebo in a crossover design. All subjects had flares with pruritus and hives scores greater than or equal to 2 on a 3 point severity scale, despite all patients having been treated with antihistamines or Xolair. Results from neffy efficacy study in urticaria There was no meaningful difference in efficacy on patient-reported itch severity score, patient-reported hives severity score, investigator-related extent of urticaria, or investigator-related erythema score between 1 mg and 2 mg neffy doses, indicating that the 1 mg dose may be sufficient to activate the beta-2 adrenergic receptors responsible for stopping the mast cell degranulation and allergic mediator release that leads to an urticaria flare. neffy was well-tolerated, with adverse events reported in 8 subjects, which were all mild or moderate in severity. The most common adverse event reported was nasal discomfort in 5 subjects. There were no serious adverse events. “This study adds to the wealth of data supporting the efficacy and safety of neffy in the treatment of type I allergic reactions,” said Sarina Tanimoto, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer and Co-Founder of ARS Pharma. “Urticaria is not only a standalone type I allergy disease, but also represents the most frequent symptom observed during type I allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. The improvement in urticaria symptoms almost immediately after dosing neffy demonstrated its rapid onset of action, and is consistent with the previously reported responses on pharmacodynamic markers of efficacy in as little as one minute after dosing.” Unmet need in urticaria and role of neffy Urticaria is a skin disorder driven by mast cell degranulation and histamine release, which causes itchy wheals (hives) and angioedema, or both. In the United States, the annualized incidence is approximately 5 million cases (1.56 per 100,000).2 Less than 40% of cases become chronic urticaria, which can last for several years before spontaneous remission occurs.2 Antihistamines are the first-line therapy for treatment of urticaria, but 20 to 25% of acute urticaria cases1, and 50% of chronic urticaria cases3 are non-responsive to antihistamines. These non-responsive patients on stable therapy regimens can experience exacerbations or flares several times a year among acute cases, and even several times a week4, including up to 3 or 4 emergency room visits, among chronic urticaria cases.5 Angioedema is also a co-occurring symptom in about 33 to 67% of these patients.6 There are currently no approved community use treatments for acute flares experienced by urticaria patients on chronic regimens of antihistamines. neffy may provide episodic symptomatic relief of these acute flares or exacerbations to improve the quality of life of urticaria patients. Patients would have the option to quickly resolve exacerbations or flares at home without escalating to chronic use of systemic biologics that may have more serious side effects and benefit-risk considerations, or having to visit the emergency room for further treatment. Next steps for neffy development in urticaria ARS Pharma plans to initiate a placebo-controlled outpatient urticaria study in patients treated with antihistamines who experience frequent acute flares later in 2024 followed by the potential initiation of a single pivotal efficacy study in 2025. This would follow the anticipated FDA approval of neffy for allergic reactions (Type I) including anaphylaxis in the second half of 2024. About Type I Allergic Reactions including AnaphylaxisType I severe allergic reactions are serious and potentially life-threatening events that can occur within minutes of exposure to an allergen and require immediate treatment with epinephrine, the only FDA-approved medication for these reactions. While epinephrine autoinjectors have been shown to be highly effective, there are well published limitations that result in many patients and caregivers delaying or not administering treatment in an emergency situation. These limitations include fear of the needle, lack of portability, needle-related safety concerns, lack of reliability, and complexity of the devices. There are approximately 40 million people in the United States who experience Type I severe allergic reactions. Of those, only 3.3 million currently have an active epinephrine autoinjector prescription, and of those, only half consistently carry their prescribed autoinjector. Even if patients or caregivers carry an autoinjector, more than half either delay or do not administer the device when needed in an emergency. About ARS Pharmaceuticals, Inc.ARS Pharma is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to empowering at-risk patients and caregivers to better protect themselves from severe allergic reactions that could lead to anaphylaxis. The Company is developing neffy® (previously referred to as ARS-1), an intranasal epinephrine product in clinical development for patients and their caregivers with Type I allergic reactions including food, medications and insect bites that could lead to life-threatening anaphylaxis.

Negative Total revenue for Q4 2023 expected to be $7.0 million, a 26.3% reduction from the same period in 2022. Capital spending weakness in end markets led to lower revenue in Q4 2023. Operating expenses for 2023 full year were $52.8 million, a decrease from $62.1 million in 2022. Financial Analyst Telesis Bio's recent financial performance indicates a mixed picture. On one hand, the record sales of BioXp kits and a 60% gross margin reflect a strong operational execution and a successful strategy in improving product mix and collaboration revenue. The gross margin exceeding 60% is notably higher than the industry average for biotech companies, which typically hovers around the 50-55% range. This suggests that Telesis Bio has managed to enhance its profitability through high-margin products and services.However, the total revenue decline of 26.3% in Q4 year-over-year, alongside a slight increase in annual revenue, indicates potential challenges in the broader market, such as capital spending weakness. The company's ability to reduce operating expenses by nearly $10 million from the previous year demonstrates a proactive approach to cost management, which is crucial in a challenging macro environment. Investors should be aware of the company's ongoing cost reductions, which could lead to improved profitability in the future, despite current revenue pressures. Market Research Analyst The adoption of BioXp mRNA de novo synthesis kits and the 300% growth in mRNA workflows highlight a significant trend in the biotechnology industry. There is an increasing demand for rapid and flexible solutions in therapeutic discovery, particularly in cell and gene therapy, vaccine and antibody development. Telesis Bio's focus on mRNA and cell-free RNA synthesis workflows positions the company favorably within this growing market segment.Investors should note the company's strategic focus on oligo insourcing, which has reached a point where over 70% of the company's oligo supply needs can be fulfilled internally. This not only contributes to the gross margin improvement but also enhances supply chain resilience, which is critical in the biotech sector. The emphasis on internal production capabilities may serve as a buffer against external supply chain disruptions, which have been a concern in recent times. Biotech Industry Analyst The financial results from Telesis Bio underscore the importance of innovation in the biotech industry. The company's success with its BioXp kits is a testament to the value of proprietary technology in generating revenue and improving margins. Furthermore, the shift towards collaboration revenue, which increased by 30.7%, suggests that Telesis Bio is effectively leveraging its technology to form profitable partnerships.Long-term stakeholders should consider the potential of Telesis Bio's SOLA platform, alongside the BioXp system, to disrupt traditional drug discovery workflows. The CEO's remarks on the transformative nature of their mRNA synthesis kits indicate confidence in the company's direction and technology. However, it is essential to monitor how the company navigates the 'capital spending weakness' it has noted in end markets, as this could impact future financial performance. 02/26/2024 - 09:15 AM Telesis Bio announces Q4 and full-year 2023 select preliminary financial results, highlighting strong BioXp kit sales, expanding gross margin and reduced expenseSAN DIEGO, Feb. 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Telesis Bio Inc.

The offering, consisting entirely of secondary shares, is priced under a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. The proceeds will go to Selling Stockholders, not the Company. J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley are the underwriters. Positive None. Negative The Company is not selling any shares in the offering, resulting in no proceeds for the Company itself. Financial Analyst An underwritten public offering, especially one involving a significant number of shares such as the 15,526,915 Class A common stock from TPG, can indicate several underlying factors about the company's market perception and the liquidity needs of its shareholders. In this case, the fact that the offering is secondary and the proceeds go entirely to the Selling Stockholders rather than the company itself suggests that the current shareholders are looking to diversify their investments or realize gains, rather than the company needing to raise capital for growth or operations.Investors should consider the potential dilutive effect of such a large offering on the market price of TPG's shares. While this is not a dilutive event in terms of additional shares being added to the market, as these shares are already issued and outstanding, the sale by significant shareholders could signal a shift in the ownership structure which might affect the stock's volatility in the short term. Additionally, the involvement of prominent underwriters like J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley could be seen as a vote of confidence in the stability and liquidity of the stock, potentially attracting institutional investors. Market Research Analyst The dynamics of a secondary offering in the alternative asset management industry can be quite telling. For one, it can reflect the maturity of the firm and the industry segment's current phase. Given that TPG is a leading firm, this move could be indicative of broader trends within the sector, such as consolidation or a shift towards newer investment vehicles. Furthermore, the timing and pricing of the offering could be leveraged to gauge market sentiment towards the sector.From a market perspective, the method of the offering—through Nasdaq, over-the-counter, negotiated transactions, or otherwise—provides flexibility and could help in managing the market impact. The market's reaction to such an offering can also serve as a bellwether for investor confidence in alternative asset managers and could potentially influence peer companies' stock performance. Legal Expert It's important for investors to understand the legal framework surrounding such offerings. The utilization of a shelf registration statement indicates a pre-planned financing option that allows the company to sell shares over a period, subject to market conditions. This strategy can provide the Selling Stockholders with the flexibility to capitalize on favorable market conditions to maximize proceeds. The effectiveness of the registration statement upon filing, a feature of well-established issuers, streamlines the process, signaling a level of preparedness and regulatory compliance that could reassure investors.Prospective investors should pay close attention to the prospectus and the prospectus supplement for details on the offering, as they contain critical information on the risks and specifics of the transaction. Legal due diligence is crucial in understanding the implications of such offerings and the rights of new shareholders versus those of the Selling Stockholders. 02/26/2024 - 09:11 AM SAN FRANCISCO & FORT WORTH, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- TPG Inc. (“TPG” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: TPG), a leading global alternative asset management firm, today announced the pricing of a secondary underwritten public offering of 15,526,915 shares of TPG’s Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”), pursuant to a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

Shares Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Bitfury Group announces the shareholder approval of a non-dilutive distribution of approximately 126 million common shares currently held in Cipher Mining Inc. (NASDAQ:CIFR) to diversify its shareholder base. The distribution will benefit long-term shareholders, employees, contractors, and advisors, reducing Bitfury's stake in Cipher and preparing it for future growth. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent announcement by Bitfury Group regarding the non-dilutive distribution of Cipher Mining Inc. shares represents a significant restructuring of the company's ownership. This move is poised to reduce Bitfury's ownership concentration in Cipher, which can be interpreted as an effort to enhance liquidity in Cipher's shares and potentially improve corporate governance by reducing the influence of a single majority shareholder.From a financial perspective, the distribution will likely increase the free float of Cipher's shares, which is generally positive for the stock's liquidity and could lead to a more accurate market valuation. However, investors should be mindful of the potential for increased volatility in Cipher's stock price as the market absorbs the new shares. It is also notable that the majority owner of Bitfury will retain a significant stake, which may still allow for considerable influence over Cipher's strategic direction.Long-term, this move could be beneficial for Cipher by attracting a broader investor base and potentially improving access to capital markets. However, the short-term impact on the stock price will depend on the market's perception of the distribution and the future prospects of the company. Corporate Governance Expert The distribution of shares by Bitfury to its long-term shareholders and the allocation to employees, contractors and advisors is indicative of a strategic decision to diversify its shareholder base and improve corporate governance. By decreasing its stake in Cipher, Bitfury is effectively reducing its control, which can be seen as a move towards a more decentralized and potentially democratic governance structure within Cipher.This action could be interpreted positively by the market, as it suggests that Cipher is moving towards a model that encourages broader shareholder participation and oversight. This can lead to more robust decision-making processes and a corporate structure that is less susceptible to the whims of a single entity. However, it is essential to monitor how this redistribution of shares will affect the balance of power within the company, especially considering that the majority owner will still hold a substantial portion of the shares. Market Research Analyst The distribution of shares by Bitfury, a full-service blockchain technology company, is an event that merits attention from a market research perspective. The blockchain sector is known for its rapid growth and innovation and companies like Cipher Mining Inc. are at the forefront of this industry. The timing of the distribution, ahead of the next Bitcoin halving cycle, is particularly interesting, as halving events have historically influenced the profitability of mining operations and could have significant implications for Cipher's business model and financial performance.Market participants will be closely watching the impact of this distribution on Cipher's stock performance, especially considering the increased free float and the potential for greater market participation. It will be important to observe how the market reacts to the increased availability of shares and whether this leads to greater price stability or volatility in the short term. Furthermore, the long-term implications for Cipher's growth trajectory, given its now more diversified shareholder base, will be a key area of focus for market research analysts and investors alike. 02/26/2024 - 09:00 AM Approved distribution readies Cipher for its next chapter of growth with a more diversified shareholder base AMSTERDAM , Feb. 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Bitfury Group (""Bitfury"" or the ""Company""), a leading full-service blockchain technology company, today announced the shareholder approval of the non-dilutive distribution of approximately 126 million common shares currently held by Bitfury in Cipher Mining Inc. (NASDAQ:CIFR) (""Cipher"") in accordance with plans that were previously outlined. Of these 126 million common shares of Cipher, approximately 107 million shares will be distributed by Bitfury to its long-term shareholders on a pro rata basis, including approximately 50 million shares being distributed to the majority owner of Bitfury, V3 Holding Limited (a holding company wholly-owned by Bitfury's CEO), and approximately 57 million shares being distributed in the aggregate to approximately 50 other Bitfury shareholders. The company believes these are shareholders that support Bitfury and now may benefit from having direct exposure to the competitive advantages of Cipher's business model, particularly going into the next halving cycle in the coming months. In addition to the pro rata distribution described above, approximately 18.5 million shares will be reserved for the benefit of former and current Bitfury employees, contractors and advisors. The distribution of approximately 107 million shares and 18.5 million shares being allocated to employees, contractors and advisors will reduce Bitfury's stake in Cipher to approximately 50 million shares as part of a strategically planned effort to reduce Bitfury's ownership concentration in Cipher priming its successful spin off for its next stage of growth. The following table shows Bitfury's estimate of the approximate general concentration of ownership in Cipher's shares before and after the distribution (share numbers in millions): Prior to Distribution Following Distribution of approx. 107 million shares Following Distribution of approx. 18.5 million shares (shares) ( %) (shares) ( %) (shares) ( %) Bitfury 175.8 68.4 % 68.5 26.6 % 50.0 19.5 % V3 Holding Limited (1) 0 0.0 % 50.3 19.6 % 50.3 19.6 % Free Float 81.3 31.6 % 138.2 53.8 % 156.7 61.0 % Total Shares Outstanding (2) 257.1 100.0 % 257.1 100.0 % 257.1 100.0 % (1) Counting only shares owned directly, excluding beneficial ownership of shares owned by Bitfury. (2) 257,057,496 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of December 8, 2023, based on (i) 254,660,072 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of November 6, 2023, as disclosed in Cipher's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and (ii) Cipher's issuance of 2,397,424 shares of Common Stock on December 8, 2023, as disclosed in Cipher's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 8, 2023 V3 Holding Limited is expected to beneficially own approximately 46% of the outstanding shares of Cipher following the distribution of approximately 107 million shares and reducing it to approximately 39% following the distribution of approximately 18.5 million shares, including both the shares V3 Holding Limited receives in the pro rata distribution and the shares which are retained by Bitfury. Bitfury believes that none of its other shareholders will hold positions of more than 5% of Cipher's shares as a result of the distribution. The pro rata distribution process of approximately 107 million shares is expected to commence today and to be largely completed in the coming weeks, with the distribution of the approximately 18.5 million shares expected to be completed in the next few months. Val Vavilov, CEO of Bitfury, commented on today's news, ""Bitfury has served as an incubator for Cipher, transferring the knowledge we've accumulated during more than 10 years of building and operating Bitcoin mining data centers all around the world, with the end goal always being to provide the firm with the financial and operational freedom via a diversified shareholder base. Cipher is a great example of the value we can provide to our portfolio of incubated companies, and I believe this move will yield positive results for both Bitfury and Cipher shareholders alike."" Tyler Page, CEO of Cipher, commented, ""We are excited about these upcoming changes to the Cipher capital table. The market can now look beyond technical issues of our shareholder base, and focus instead on the enormous fundamental value in our stock, driven by our best-in-class power structure, our clear path to growth, and our proven execution.""

The Company aims to empower small and medium-sized businesses with enhanced mobile app technology and streamline operations to unlock shareholder value. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Recruiter.com's strategic transformation, including the exclusive licensing agreement with GoLogiq, Inc., positions the company to capitalize on the growing demand for mobile app development among small and medium-sized businesses. The focus on the O2O market, which is currently underserved in North America, could present a significant growth opportunity. The licensing deal allows Recruiter.com to leverage GoLogiq's fintech and AI technology, potentially driving innovation and competitive advantage in a market that values differentiation.The issuance of 19.99% of the company's outstanding stock as part of the compensation for the license suggests a strong commitment to the partnership and aligns interests between the two companies. However, this dilution could impact current shareholders' equity. An 8% fee on sales also indicates a continuous revenue stream for GoLogiq, but it's crucial to monitor the balance between growth investments and profitability. Financial Analyst The restructuring plan's impact on Recruiter.com's financial health is multifaceted. The Gologiq Licensing Agreement's potential addition of $3.5M in assets is a positive step towards addressing Nasdaq's minimum shareholders' equity requirement. If the agreement does indeed bolster the balance sheet as management expects, it could help mitigate the risk of delisting and reassure investors regarding the company's financial stability.However, the ongoing strategic sale to Job Mobz and the asset spin-out to CognoGroup introduce complexity. Removing the condition for shareholder approval in the Job Mobz transaction may expedite the process but also raises questions about shareholder rights and corporate governance. Investors should closely monitor the outcomes of the Nasdaq hearing and the company's efforts to meet compliance standards, as these will have direct implications for stock performance and investor confidence. Legal Expert The amendment with Job Mobz, which removes the need for shareholder approval, could streamline the acquisition process but may also raise concerns about the transparency and decision-making process within the company. It's essential to consider the legal implications of such changes, especially in the context of corporate governance and fiduciary responsibilities. The upcoming Nasdaq hearing is another critical legal juncture for Recruiter.com. Compliance with Nasdaq's requirements is paramount for maintaining its listing and avoiding potential legal and financial repercussions.The filing of a Proxy Statement for the election of Directors and the ratification of an independent auditor signifies a move towards resolving compliance issues with Nasdaq's annual meeting requirement. Stakeholders should evaluate the outcomes of these corporate actions for any legal ramifications that could affect their interests. 02/26/2024 - 09:01 AM NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / February 26, 2024 / Recruiter.com Group, Inc.

The company is working on a succession plan for an Interim CEO and evaluating strategic alternatives. Positive None. Negative Employees placed on mandatory leave, including the President and CEO, due to financial concerns Risk of dispute under existing employment agreements Uncertainty regarding the return of employees after the temporary leave period Financial Analyst The decision by Neptune Wellness Solutions Inc. to implement mandatory unpaid leave for certain employees, including high-level executives, is a strong indicator of severe financial distress. This cost-cutting measure suggests an urgent need to preserve cash flow amidst ongoing financial concerns. The market typically reacts negatively to such drastic measures as they can imply deeper underlying issues within the company's operational and financial strategies. Investors should scrutinize the company's cash burn rate, liquidity position and any recent earnings reports for further context on the severity of the financial situation.Additionally, the resignation of Michael Cammarata from the board and his challenge to the unpaid leave could signal potential legal disputes, which might introduce further volatility to the company's stock. Investors should be aware of the risks associated with leadership instability, including potential disruptions to the company's strategic direction and the possibility of reputational damage. Legal Expert The invocation of mandatory unpaid leave, particularly for contracted employees such as Michael Cammarata and John Wirt, raises complex legal considerations. The risk of dispute under existing employment contracts may lead to litigation, which could be costly and time-consuming for Neptune. Legal proceedings could also distract from the company's restructuring efforts and potentially result in financial settlements or other liabilities. Stakeholders should monitor for any updates on legal proceedings as they could impact the company's financial recovery and strategic plans. Market Research Analyst Neptune's restructuring efforts, including the appointment of a special restructuring committee, indicate a strategic pivot that could redefine the company's market positioning. The outcome of these efforts will be critical for long-term stakeholder value. The company's ability to successfully navigate through the restructuring process and appoint a competent Interim CEO will be key to regaining investor confidence. From a market perspective, the success of the restructuring plan will likely influence the company's competitive edge, particularly in the wellness solutions industry, which is characterized by rapid innovation and strong competition. 02/26/2024 - 09:00 AM LAVAL, QC / ACCESSWIRE / February 26, 2024 / Neptune Wellness Solutions Inc. (""Neptune"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ:NEPT), today announced that it has placed certain employees on a mandatory unpaid leave of absence effective February 23, 2024 in connection with a rapid cost cutting and restructuring effort, as a result of the Company's previously disclosed ongoing financial concerns.Among the employees placed on mandatory leave are Michael Cammarata, President and Chief Executive Officer, and John Wirt, Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer, both of whom are under employment contracts (the terms of which have been previously disclosed). Mr. Cammarata also concurrently resigned from the Company's board of directors (the ""Board"") and all other board positions at the Company's subsidiaries and affiliates effective immediately. Mr. Cammarata is challenging his unpaid leave under the terms of his employment agreement, and there is a risk of dispute under existing employment agreements as a result of the announced temporary leaves.The Company is currently working through a succession plan to determine who will assume the role of Interim Chief Executive Officer in Mr. Cammarata's absence. In the interim, the Company has appointed a special restructuring committee comprised of certain members of the Board to evaluate candidates for the role of Interim Chief Executive Officer and to lead the Company through this transitionary period.The last day of work for employees placed on mandatory leave was February 23, 2024. The initial period of mandatory leave is for thirty (30) days, though any decisions to recall staff to active service, extend the period of leave, or relieve staff of responsibilities have not yet been made. The Company will continuously evaluate its financial condition as well as all available strategic alternatives in connection with its ongoing restructuring effort to determine when employees will be recalled to active service, though there can be no assurance at this stage that any of the employees will return to the Company at the end of the temporary period of mandatory leave, if at all.About Neptune Wellness Solutions Inc.Neptune is a consumer-packaged goods company that aims to innovate health and wellness products.

If the Company is unable to obtain funding in the near term, it may have to cease operations and liquidate its assets. These conditions cast substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.Media Contacts:media@neptunecorp.comInvestor Contacts:Valter Pinto, Managing DirectorKCSA Strategic Communicationsneptune@kcsa.com 212.896.1254SOURCE: Neptune Wellness Solutions, Inc.View the original press release on accesswire.com Why did Neptune Wellness Solutions Inc. place certain employees on a mandatory unpaid leave?

The acquisition, valued at $135 million, involves a cash tender offer for all outstanding shares not held by affiliates of The Column Group, LP. The transaction is recommended by a Special Committee of independent directors and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The acquisition of NGM Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. by Atlas Neon Parent, Inc. represents a significant premium of 80% over the closing share price prior to the announcement. This is a substantial markup and is indicative of the purchaser's confidence in the intrinsic value of NGM Bio. The total equity value of the transaction is $135 million, which should be considered in the context of NGM Bio's reported cash and marketable securities of approximately $144.2 million as of the end of the last fiscal quarter. This suggests that the acquisition price is closely aligned with the company's net cash position, a factor that may influence the perception of value among the Unaffiliated Stockholders.The absence of a financing contingency implies that the purchaser has secured the necessary funds to complete the transaction, providing a degree of certainty to stockholders. From a financial perspective, the transaction's success hinges on the tender of a majority of shares held by Unaffiliated Stockholders. The decision by the Rollover Stockholders to contribute their shares rather than cashing out could be seen as a vote of confidence in the future prospects of NGM Bio under private ownership.For investors, the key considerations will be the fairness of the offer price and the strategic rationale behind the acquisition. The premium offered may reflect not just the current financial health of NGM Bio, but also the potential value of its therapeutic pipeline and proprietary technology. However, the loss of public market liquidity and potential upside from future growth will need to be weighed against the immediate cash premium offered. Legal Expert The role of the Special Committee in this transaction is critical as they serve as fiduciaries for the Unaffiliated Stockholders. Their unanimous recommendation suggests a rigorous evaluation process and an assessment that the deal terms are in the best interest of these stockholders. The Special Committee's use of independent legal and financial advisors further underscores the integrity of their review process.Legal counsel's involvement is crucial in navigating the complexities of a merger agreement, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and protecting the interests of all parties involved. The legal framework will also govern the tender offer process, the subsequent merger and the conversion of shares into cash for stockholders not participating in the offer.It is important for Unaffiliated Stockholders to understand their rights in this context, including any rights to dissent from the transaction and the legal implications of such a decision. The acquisition, once completed, will result in NGM Bio's delisting from Nasdaq, effectively ending its status as a public company and the regulatory obligations that come with it. This transition will have legal and operational implications for the company's governance and reporting structures. Market Research Analyst The biotechnology sector is known for its high-risk, high-reward nature, with significant capital required for research and development. NGM Bio's need for 'significant additional funding' as noted by the Special Committee Chair, Suzanne Sawochka Hooper, is a common challenge in the industry. The decision to go private may provide NGM Bio with more flexibility to manage its capital allocation and strategic direction without the pressures of quarterly reporting and short-term market expectations.Analysis of the biotech market shows that private ownership can sometimes accelerate the development of novel therapeutics by allowing companies to focus on long-term goals. However, it also removes the opportunity for public investors to participate in potential future gains. The industry trend towards consolidation and the interest from larger entities in acquiring promising biotech firms could have influenced the Special Committee's decision to approve the transaction, believing that private ownership might better support the company's growth trajectory.Understanding the broader market dynamics, including the competitive landscape of NGM Bio's therapeutic areas and the potential for strategic partnerships or additional acquisitions post-transaction, will be essential in assessing the long-term implications of this acquisition for the industry as a whole. 02/26/2024 - 09:03 AM NGM Bio stockholders to receive $1.55 per share in cash, an 80% premium over the closing share price on the last trading day prior to disclosure of receipt from The Column Group of a non-binding expression of interest in purchasing shares in a going-private transactionBased on a thorough exploration and review of strategic and financial alternatives, a Special Committee of independent and disinterested directors unanimously recommends the transaction SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NGM Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (“NGM Bio”) (Nasdaq: NGM), a biotechnology company focused on discovering and developing transformative therapeutics for patients, today announced that it has entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) under which Atlas Neon Parent, Inc. (“Purchaser”) and Atlas Neon Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”) will acquire NGM Bio through a cash tender offer to be commenced by Merger Sub for all outstanding shares of NGM Bio not held by affiliates of The Column Group, LP and certain other stockholders, as described below, at a price per share of $1.55 in cash. Purchaser and Merger Sub are affiliates of The Column Group, LP (together with certain of The Column Group, LP’s affiliates, the “TCG Stockholders”), NGM Bio’s longest and largest stockholder, holding approximately 26% of NGM Bio’s outstanding shares. The TCG Stockholders and certain other existing stockholders of NGM Bio (the “Rollover Stockholders”) have agreed to contribute their shares of NGM Bio stock to Purchaser as a part of the transaction rather than receive the cash price per share. This price per share corresponds to a total equity value of $135 million on a fully diluted basis and represents an 80% premium over the last trading day closing price (December 29, 2023) prior to NGM Bio’s Form 8-K confirming receipt from the TCG Stockholders of a non-binding expression of interest in exploring and evaluating a potential acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of NGM Bio not already owned by the TCG Stockholders in a going-private transaction. NGM Bio’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities were $166.0 million as of September 30, 2023 and an estimated $144.2 million as of December 31, 2023. Following a thorough exploration and review of strategic and financial alternatives with the assistance of its legal and financial advisors, a Special Committee of the NGM Bio Board of Directors (the “Special Committee”), consisting solely of independent and disinterested members of the NGM Bio Board of Directors (the “Board”), determined that the acquisition by Purchaser is in the best interests of NGM Bio stockholders (excluding the TCG Stockholders, Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Rollover Stockholders, the members of the Board and the officers of NGM Bio subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, referred to as the “Unaffiliated Stockholders”), and unanimously recommended approval of the Merger Agreement to the Board. The Special Committee and NGM Bio management team explored a range of strategic options, including engaging with multiple potential third party acquirors, before negotiating and entering into the Merger Agreement. “We conducted a thorough review of our financial and strategic alternatives, including remaining a publicly held company, with particular focus on NGM Bio’s ongoing need for significant additional funding. Based on this review, we believe that this negotiated transaction for Purchaser to acquire NGM Bio is in the best interest of the Unaffiliated Stockholders,” said Suzanne Sawochka Hooper, an independent member of the Board and Chair of the Special Committee. Based upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, with the assistance of its legal and financial advisors, the Board determined that the acquisition by Purchaser is in the best interests of the Unaffiliated Stockholders, and approved the Merger Agreement. Closing of the tender offer is subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions, including the tender of NGM Bio shares representing at least a majority of the total number of outstanding shares held by the Unaffiliated Stockholders. The tender offer is not subject to a financing contingency. Promptly following the closing of the tender offer, Merger Sub will merge with and into NGM Bio, and all remaining shares not tendered in the offer, other than dissenting shares, treasury shares and rollover shares held by the TCG Stockholders, Purchaser and any other subsidiary of Purchaser, or the Rollover Stockholders, will be converted into the right to receive a price per share of $1.55 in cash. The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2024. If completed, the transaction will result in NGM Bio becoming a privately held company and its shares will no longer be listed on Nasdaq.

The Company plans to utilize the proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes.,"Antelope Enterprise Announces Closing of $1.3 Million Registered Direct Offering and Private Placement Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Antelope Enterprise Holdings Limited (AEHL) announced the closing of a $1.3 million offering of its Class A ordinary shares and concurrent private placement of warrants. The Company plans to utilize the proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The capital raise by Antelope Enterprise Holdings Limited through a mix of a registered direct offering and a concurrent private placement of warrants is a significant move for the company's financial strategy. The offering price at $1.00 per share, with warrants exercisable at $1.10, suggests a potential upside for investors if the company's stock performs well, albeit with a dilutive effect on existing shareholders. The immediate exercisability of the warrants could lead to a quicker capital inflow if the stock price appreciates above the exercise price. However, the dilution could also have a negative impact on the stock's price in the short term.From a financial standpoint, the gross proceeds of $1.3 million seem modest for a company operating in the high-growth livestreaming ecommerce sector, which could indicate a strategic choice to avoid excessive dilution or a limited capacity to raise larger funds at this time. Investors should consider the company's current cash burn rate and the potential for these funds to extend its runway and finance growth initiatives. The use of proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes is broad and the impact on the company's operational capabilities will depend on the efficiency and effectiveness of the capital allocation. Market Research Analyst Antelope Enterprise's operation within the livestreaming ecommerce space is noteworthy, as this sector is experiencing significant growth in China. The access to over 800,000 anchors and influencers could provide the company with a substantial market reach and customer engagement potential. However, the competitive landscape in China's ecommerce market is fierce, with major players like Alibaba and JD.com dominating the scene. The company's ability to carve out a niche and leverage its influencer network will be critical to its success.Additionally, investors should be aware of the regulatory environment in China, which has shown increased scrutiny over tech and ecommerce companies. Changes in regulations or enforcement actions could have material impacts on the company's operations and its ability to capitalize on its influencer network. The modest size of the offering could reflect a cautious approach in an uncertain regulatory climate. Legal Expert The structure of the offering, utilizing both a registered direct offering and a private placement of warrants, is a strategic legal maneuver. The use of a shelf registration statement on Form F-3 indicates the company's preparedness to issue securities in a timely manner, which is crucial for capitalizing on favorable market conditions. The reliance on Regulation S for the private placement highlights the international aspect of the investment, targeting non-U.S. investors and complying with the Securities Act of 1933.It's important for investors to understand that the securities sold in the private placement are not registered and, therefore, are subject to restrictions on resale. The legal framework surrounding these transactions is designed to balance the company's need for capital with investor protection considerations. Stakeholders should pay attention to the final prospectus supplement filed with the SEC for a comprehensive understanding of the terms and risks associated with the offering. 02/26/2024 - 09:00 AM CHENGDU, China, Feb. 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Antelope Enterprise Holdings Limited (NASDAQ Capital Market: AEHL) (""Antelope Enterprise"" or the ""Company""), which operates Kylin Cloud, a livestreaming ecommerce business in China with access to 800,000+ anchors and influencers, announced today that it has closed an offering of $1.3 million of its Class A ordinary shares, no par value each (the ""Ordinary Shares"") in a registered direct offering and a concurrent private placement of warrants to purchase Ordinary Shares (jointly, the ""Offering"").

To meet these varied and evolving needs, Westlake Royal Building Products is exploring every innovation, from new easy-to-install products to support services. Westlake Royal will also detail how its products can help achieve these top trends.

Royal WoodTone Styles offer the elegant look of stained wood in six trending colors, including American Walnut, Oak Ridge, Natural Cedar, Smoke Grey, Weathered Oak and Charred Timber. The line features a 6"" v-grooved plank, beadboard, crown and bed mould. NEW! Royal Knock Down Column Wraps are an easy-to-install and cost-effective way to add instant curb appeal to a home. Featuring best-in-class lock miter joints for easy assembly, the column wraps can seamlessly slip over existing, outdated columns, giving a porch or exterior a cleaner and more modern look. Made of durable cellular PVC, Royal Knock Down Column Wraps are resistant to moisture and prevent issues found in traditional wood columns, such as warping, rotting and insect damage. In addition to its low-maintenance qualities and long-lasting performance, the column wraps are beautifully versatile with its bright white color and smooth texture, which can be painted to complement a home’s exterior color palette. Royal Knock Down Column Wraps are available in 4x4, 6x6 and 8x8 sizes, and two standard lengths—8’6” & 10’ lengths.

Roofing Westlake Royal, a leader in energy-efficient and weather-resistant roofing systems and components, is planning four key launches at this year’s IBS. These include: NEW! Unified Steel Material List Generator, an interactive tool that auto-generates a roofing product list. The system simplifies the estimating process for both Unified Steel Stone Coated Roofing and Westlake Royal Roofing Components™. The Material List Generator integrates seamlessly with roof measurements acquired traditionally or through 3D and geospatial measurement generating software solutions. There is no cost to builders and contractors who use it. NEW! Unified Steel Cool Roof Colors - Developed in line with national color trends, regional building code requirements and for optimal performance, these products are Cool Roof Rated by the CRRC and manufactured to increase comfortability, help decrease energy costs and prolong the roof’s lifespan. The new colors, Harborwood™ and Stirling Gray™, are offered in both PINE-CREST Shake and PACIFIC Tile profiles. NEW! Roofing Underlayment CEU Course - The Importance of Roof Underlayment for Energy Efficiency and Fire Resistance explores the roof underlayment as an integral part of the total roof system design and educates architects on the performance, benefits, fire resistance and weather resilience of various underlayment types. Course participants will obtain 1.0 CEU credit upon completion. Architects may access the new CEU course at Hanley Wood University and through the AIA. NEW! DaVinci Roofscapes E-books - In keeping with the 2024 trend and focus on home exteriors and colors, DaVinci Roofscapes has launched two new e-books in their FRESH series. Authored by international color expert Kate Smith with Sensational Color, the e-books provide “top-down” guidance on Fixed Features, Regional Colors, Environment & Surroundings, Style of the Home and Historic or HOA Colors. The first e-book invites people to follow the “5 Steps for Finding the Perfect Hues for Your Home” and the second new e-book tackles the topic of “FRESH Colors for Homes with Brick or Stone.” Stone Westlake Royal will feature Cultured Stone, Eldorado Stone and Dutch Quality Stone®, made to enhance interior and exterior vertical spaces by featuring organic textures, dynamic color palettes and multisensory aesthetic cues that pay homage to architectural traditions while expanding the boundaries of design. NEW! Dutch Quality Stone Colors includes two colorways debuting at IBS 2024. The first, Coal Crest, is a moody palette with a rich blend of charcoal and ash that serves as the perfect complement to the brand’s Dry Stack and Weather Ledge profiles. The second color palette, Oak Blend, was designed for the Limestone, Stack Ledge and Weather Ledge profiles to deliver a fresh take on earthy browns with the subtle interplay of cream and silver undertones. Eldorado Stone presents the charming LoreioBrick™, a long-format, linear brick veneer profile with gradient color blends, and Rivenwood™, a panelized design with wood grain characteristics that exudes textural diversity for an aged yet contemporary look. Cultured Stone displays its newest profile Tenley Brick™, which offers unique bond and patterning options with its linear shape, organic tonality and four trend-forward colorways. Outdoor Living Westlake Royal is redefining outdoor living spaces and will exhibit several key products at IBS 2024: Zuri™ Premium Decking combines the natural beauty and warmth of exotic hardwood with the unsurpassed durability and exceptionally low-maintenance requirements of PVC. Unlike competitor composite decking that does not look like wood, Zuri's PVC substrate is capped with a photo-realistic wood-grain print and a clear acrylic that resists stains, scratches, fading and moisture. All Zuri products are backed by a 25-year Color Fastness Warranty against color shifting. Zuri’s color line includes Hickory, Chestnut, Walnut, Pecan, Brazilia and Weathered Gray; the planks are available in both square and grooved boards along with fascia and corners.

They aim to reduce total emissions by 30% by 2030 and have already achieved a 25% reduction by 2023. Initiatives include energy efficiency improvements in Walgreens stores and a trial bulk fuel program in California. Boots UK is transitioning away from natural gas, collaborating on industry net zero emission goals. Boots and No7 Beauty Company are developing an emissions reduction plan. Positive None. Negative None. Environmental Sustainability Expert Walgreens Boots Alliance's (WBA) efforts to reduce carbon emissions are an integral part of the broader corporate responsibility to address climate change. The commitment to a 30 percent reduction in total emissions by 2030, aligning with the Science Based Targets initiative, reflects a strategic understanding that environmental sustainability can drive long-term shareholder value and mitigate operational risks associated with climate change.WBA's trial of renewable diesel in place of traditional diesel is a forward-thinking move that could significantly lower the carbon footprint of their logistics operations. If this trial is successful and scalable, it would not only benefit WBA's emission targets but could also serve as a benchmark for the retail industry. However, it is crucial to monitor the availability and cost implications of renewable diesel, as these factors will influence the feasibility and impact of the rollout.The transition from natural gas to electric energy sources in UK stores demonstrates a proactive approach to reducing Scope 1 emissions, which are direct emissions from owned or controlled sources. This transition is likely to incur short-term costs but could lead to long-term operational savings and improved energy security. The establishment of a network of Net Zero Leads is a commendable step in embedding sustainability into the corporate culture and operational practices, though the effectiveness of this measure will depend on the actionable strategies and engagement they foster within the company. Financial Analyst Investors are increasingly factoring environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria into their investment decisions and WBA's progress in this area could potentially enhance its appeal to socially responsible investors. The disclosed reductions in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 25 percent since 2019 suggest that WBA is on track to meet its 2030 emissions reduction targets, which could translate into improved operational efficiencies and reduced regulatory risks.However, the financial implications of these sustainability initiatives, such as capital expenditures on energy-efficient technologies and the operational costs associated with transitioning to renewable energy sources, must be scrutinized. While these investments may lead to long-term cost savings and risk mitigation, they could also impact short-term profitability and cash flows. Furthermore, the success of these initiatives in contributing to WBA's competitive advantage will depend on the pace at which competitors adopt similar sustainability practices and the evolving regulatory landscape. Market Research Analyst The retail sector is under increasing scrutiny for its environmental impact and WBA's proactive stance on sustainability could resonate well with consumers who prioritize corporate responsibility. The shift towards renewable energy sources and the reduction of plastic and food waste are likely to enhance WBA's brand image and customer loyalty. However, the consumer response and potential increase in market share or sales as a result of these initiatives remain to be seen.It is also important to consider the broader market dynamics, such as the availability of renewable energy technologies and infrastructure, as well as consumer trends towards sustainable products and practices. The success of WBA's sustainability initiatives could influence other retailers and catalyze industry-wide changes, potentially leading to new market standards and expectations. 02/26/2024 - 01:30 PM NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / February 26, 2024 / Walgreens Boots Alliance remains committed and focused to the ambitious but very necessary targets set in the areas of carbon emissions reduction, plastic reduction and food waste reduction. Details on our progress against our emissions reduction goals can be found in our 2023 Environmental, Social & Governance Report.At WBA, we believe there is an inextricable link between the health of our planet and the health of our communities, whether impacted by extreme temperatures, natural disasters, airborne diseases or poor air quality. We also believe climate change is caused by human activities and requires swift action by corporations to do our part in reducing our footprint. WBA has continued to execute against our global emissions reduction targets, which include an ambition to reduce our total emissions by 30 percent by the end of fiscal 2030. At the end of fiscal 2023, WBA was able to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 25 percent compared to the 2019 baseline.To position WBA to meet our reduction targets, we continually seek opportunities to advance energy efficiency in our largest business, Walgreens. With more than 8,700 stores and clinics in the U.S., implementing new strategies that reduce the energy consumption involved in maintenance, sourcing and other energy intensive activities is crucial to ensure we meet our 2030 goals.In fiscal 2023, Walgreens initiated a trial bulk fuel program in two California distribution centers that replaced traditional diesel with renewable diesel. This has the potential to decrease transportation emissions in these locations by 75 percent. Given the positive impact of this program, WBA intends to roll it out to other locations across the U.S. as additional supply becomes available.In the UK, Boots has continued to limit the reliance on natural gas in its stores. Our position is to not use gas in new stores, and we have active gas to electric programs to support the transition away from gas. As part of that program, Boots was able to remove natural gas from seven stores via HVAC projects and significantly limited the reliance on gas in one additional store.In fiscal 2021, Boots UK collaborated with other UK retailers on a roadmap for the industry to achieve net zero emissions by 2040, including net zero Scope 2 emissions by 2030, Scope 1 by 2035 and Scope 3 by 2040. Boots Ireland signed up to the Business in the Community Ireland Low Carbon Pledge to set science-based carbon emissions reduction targets by 2024.This year, Boots and the No7 Beauty Company established a network of Net Zero Leads across the business who are using baseline footprint data for Scopes 1, 2 and 3, gathered in fiscal 2022, to develop an emissions reduction plan. The Leads will meet monthly and are tasked with identifying opportunities to reduce emissions in their business area, gathering data to support annual footprinting and engaging and inspiring their teams to reduce emissions.For more information on WBA's energy and emissions initiatives please see the latest ESG Report.

The bank's focus on affordable housing, new markets tax credits, and technology revamp with SilverLake core processing solution leads to strong market presence and expansion. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The expansion of Legacy Bank & Trust reflects a strategic pivot towards niche markets that are often overlooked by larger financial institutions. By doubling its asset size within two years, the bank demonstrates a significant growth trajectory. This is particularly noteworthy in the context of the banking sector, where asset growth can be indicative of increased market share and customer trust. The focus on affordable housing, new markets tax credits and commercial banking, alongside geographic expansion, suggests an aggressive yet targeted approach to growth that could set a precedent for similar-sized community banks.Furthermore, the bank's investment in Jack Henry's scalable technology implies a forward-looking approach to banking operations. The ability to automate processes and improve operational efficiencies can lead to reduced operational costs and enhanced customer experiences, which are critical factors in maintaining competitiveness in the financial sector. The bank's technological upgrade could serve as a case study for other community banks aiming to scale operations without compromising service quality. Financial Analyst The financial implications of Legacy Bank & Trust's growth are multifaceted. Asset growth, especially when it involves a doubling of size, can lead to a reevaluation of the bank's financial health and stability by investors and rating agencies. It's essential to consider the quality of these assets and the risk profile associated with the new niche markets. If managed effectively, this growth can result in higher profitability through increased lending opportunities and interest income.However, expansion into new markets also introduces new risks, including the potential for higher default rates in underserved areas. Investors should monitor the bank's non-performing loan ratios and provision for loan losses in subsequent financial statements. The bank's success in these niche markets can also attract attention from larger banks, potentially leading to increased competition. Thus, the long-term sustainability of this growth strategy will be a key area of interest. IT Systems Analyst Legacy Bank & Trust's adoption of Jack Henry's SilverLake system underscores the importance of scalable and robust IT infrastructure in modern banking. SilverLake's hosted core processing solution likely offers the bank a combination of high customization, regulatory compliance and enhanced security features, which are crucial for banks targeting underserved markets with complex needs. The ability to integrate new tools and improve communication across branches can lead to significant improvements in customer service and internal workflows.It's also worth noting that such technological investments may have a substantial upfront cost but can yield long-term savings and revenue opportunities. As the bank continues to grow, the flexibility and scalability of its IT systems will be pivotal in ensuring that it can adapt to changing market demands and regulatory environments without incurring prohibitive costs or experiencing service disruptions. 02/26/2024 - 09:00 AM Open, flexible technology empowers focus on underserved communities and commercial banking, positions CDFI to continue strong growth MONETT, Mo., Feb. 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Jack Henry™ (Nasdaq: JKHY) announced today that Legacy Bank & Trust has doubled its asset size in two years by implementing a differentiated business strategy and revamping its technology stack to meet new growth areas and complex needs.

New growth also led to competing in larger urban areas in Oklahoma and Texas. The bank's timely response to strong demand from financially underserved communities made it one of the largest affordable housing lenders in the Midwest and a reputable Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI). Legacy Bank & Trust has been running on Jack Henry systems since 2003. To meet its new strategic direction, the bank decided to revamp its technology stack, selecting Jack Henry's more scalable hosted core processing solution, SilverLake.

Today, the bank has competitive technology to enter new markets easily and create positive user experiences.

Positive None. Negative The delay in the reverse stock split may lead to uncertainty among investors and traders, impacting the company's stock price and market performance. Financial Analyst The announcement of Infobird Co.'s reverse stock split and its subsequent delay due to regulatory clearance issues is a significant event for shareholders and potential investors. A reverse stock split is often employed by companies to boost the share price by reducing the number of shares outstanding, which can make the stock more attractive to institutional investors and help maintain compliance with exchange listing requirements.In the short term, this delay could introduce volatility in the stock as investors react to the uncertainty and the perceived administrative challenges faced by the company. It's important to note that while a reverse split does not fundamentally alter a company's value, the market's perception can lead to a temporary change in investor sentiment.In the long term, the effectiveness of this strategy will largely depend on the company's underlying financial health and its ability to deliver on growth prospects. Investors should closely monitor Infobird's performance metrics post-split to assess the impact on the company's market valuation. Market Research Analyst The delay in the reverse stock split for Infobird may reflect deeper operational or compliance-related issues that could be of concern to stakeholders. The AI-powered customer engagement solutions industry is highly competitive and companies need to demonstrate agility and adherence to regulatory standards to maintain their market position.Stakeholders should consider the potential implications of this delay on Infobird's reputation and the possible effects on its customer acquisition and retention strategies. Competitors may leverage such delays in their marketing strategies to position themselves as more reliable alternatives.From a market trend perspective, it's essential to contextualize this event within the broader SaaS and AI sectors. Any shifts in regulatory practices or market expectations could have wider implications beyond Infobird, signaling a need for increased vigilance among companies in similar circumstances. Legal Expert The necessity for regulatory clearances in the process of a reverse stock split is a critical aspect that underscores the importance of compliance in corporate actions. Delays caused by regulatory issues can signal potential governance concerns that may need to be addressed by Infobird's management.From a legal standpoint, the delay highlights the intricacies of navigating the regulatory landscape, which can be fraught with complexities that impact a company's strategic timelines. It is crucial for companies to ensure that their corporate actions are in strict adherence to the rules set forth by governing bodies such as the SEC and stock exchanges.For stakeholders, this development serves as a reminder of the regulatory risks associated with investing in publicly traded companies, particularly those in high-tech industries like AI, where regulations can evolve rapidly.

Citigroup Global Markets Limited will handle trading decisions independently until 26 April 2024. The program will comply with relevant regulations and be conducted on- and off-market. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst A share buyback, such as the one executed by Shell plc, often signals a company's belief that its shares are undervalued and it can be a way to return value to shareholders. By reducing the number of shares in circulation, the earnings per share (EPS) may increase, potentially leading to a higher stock price. However, the impact on the stock price can vary depending on market perception and the scale of the buyback relative to the company's market capitalization.Investors should consider the financial health of the company and the opportunity cost of the buyback. If the company is foregoing investment in growth opportunities or paying down debt, the long-term effects could be negative. Additionally, the execution of the buyback within pre-set parameters suggests a disciplined approach, minimizing the potential for market manipulation.It's also noteworthy that the buyback is being conducted in compliance with both EU and UK market abuse regulations, ensuring transparency and adherence to legal standards. This compliance is crucial for maintaining investor confidence, especially post-Brexit, as it demonstrates Shell's commitment to upholding rigorous regulatory standards. Market Research Analyst From a market research perspective, the buyback program's impact on Shell's market position must be assessed. The energy sector is currently undergoing significant transformation, with a shift towards renewable sources. Shell's decision to repurchase shares rather than directly investing in new energy projects could be interpreted as a conservative strategy, possibly maintaining short-term shareholder value at the potential expense of long-term strategic positioning.Moreover, the timing and size of the buyback can affect investor sentiment. The market's reaction to such a program can serve as a barometer for the company's perceived intrinsic value. It will be important to monitor the stock's performance and trading volume in the wake of the announcement to gauge the market's response to Shell's strategic financial decision. Legal Expert Legally, the share buyback process is tightly regulated to prevent market abuse and ensure fair trading practices. Shell's announcement mentions compliance with both the EU Market Abuse Regulation and its UK counterpart, reflecting the complexities of operating in a post-Brexit regulatory environment. The legal intricacies of such operations require meticulous attention to the evolving legislative landscape.The involvement of Citigroup Global Markets Limited as an independent trading entity adds a layer of compliance, as it is meant to prevent the company from influencing the share price during the buyback period. This separation is a standard practice to ensure that trading decisions are made without undue influence from the company whose shares are being repurchased. 02/26/2024 - 01:05 PM Transaction in Own Shares 26 February, 2024 • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • Shell plc (the ‘Company’) announces that on 26 February 2024 it purchased the following number of Shares for cancellation.

By Kim BorgesSandy Green's home, once filled with voices and laughter, fell silent following her daughter and granddaughter's 2015 move from Raleigh, North Carolina, to Kansas City.""An empty nest just guts you,"" Green said. ""I was rendered paralyzed with sadness.""Consolation arrived in the form of friends who gathered around the firepit, and the music played by one who brought a guitar.I'm going to buy a guitar. I knew I needed to play that thing.Sandy GreenGreen's thought at the end of the night?""I'm going to buy a guitar. I knew I needed to play that thing.""Green devoted the entire next weekend to learning her new instrument.""I watched instructional videos and printed out chords,"" she said. ""By Monday, I noticed I wasn't sad anymore. It took me out of that place. I began looking forward to coming home after work and playing every night. It was my therapy.""Terry Hoey, Mortgage Production manager and Raleigh market executive for Regions Bank by day and fellow avid guitarist during his down time, first crossed paths with Green that same year.""Sandy and I met at a pickin' circle, where musicians get together to learn new material from each other and just play for the sheer joy of playing,"" he said.Shortly thereafter, Green discovered the joy of playing was just the first verse of her song. Turns out, she had a far larger act in store bringing joy to thousands more.""One instrument in one shelter was originally my goal,"" she said of donating a guitar to a homeless shelter housing a teen she'd been mentoring through the Big Brothers Big Sisters organization.Sandy and I met at a pickin' circle, where musicians get together to learn new material from each other and just play for the sheer joy of playing.Terry Hoey, Mortgage Production manager and Raleigh market executiveBut, then, an observation.""She was all present, all calm with that guitar in her hand,"" said Green, describing the teen's reaction. ""I don't think I've ever known a life where music wasn't important. In that moment, I saw I wasn't the only one whose life could be saved because of an instrument; I knew it was time to organize.""Green's orchestrated effort involved launching Guitarists for Good, a nonprofit sharing the love of music by providing free instruments to homeless shelters and nonprofits serving people experiencing housing insecurity. Today, Green and her band of volunteers have distributed nearly 500 instruments to 160 organizations across 18 states. Hoey is part of the goodness ensemble.""I've delivered multiple guitars around North Carolina and other instruments like keyboards and drums throughout Western Virginia over the years,"" he said. ""Providing others with access to music was an easy commitment to make. It's a way I can leverage my personal passion to help others.""In addition to delivering instruments, Hoey also helps string guitars, many of which are donated.""Terry is wonderful,"" said Green. ""He fans my flames and is just so supportive and cool.""Others are fanning the flames, too. The friend who sold Green her first guitar? The guitar shop he owned still collects donations then refurbished by volunteers. He also serves as a member of Guitarists for Good's board of directors.Providing others with access to music was an easy commitment to make. It's a way I can leverage my personal passion to help others.Terry Hoey""I've got this army of do-gooders who have supported me every step of the way,"" said Green.Hoey's volunteerism is driven by two factors.""Sandy's enthusiasm is a force,"" he said. ""And, while it may not seem intuitive, musical instruments can play a part in helping men, women and teens in crisis, I can tell you in the most absolute terms they do. When people find themselves in overwhelming situations - and there's no immediate escape or solution - sometimes, slowing down and finding a moment of peace, a moment of joy can change their perspective. Music can offer that moment of gratitude.""And maybe even moments of healing, too. It certainly has for Green. Today, her life is humming - and strumming - along quite nicely thanks to all who support Guitarists for Good.

The automation tools provided, including seamless uploading of locations and assets, user management and streamlined ordering processes, aim to reduce administrative burdens and improve the accuracy of fuel tracking and management. This is particularly relevant for businesses operating large fleets or construction equipment, where fuel costs can be a significant operational expense.By automating billing and payment processes, EzFill is likely to improve customer satisfaction and retention, which could translate into increased revenue streams. Furthermore, the adoption of the system by two of the largest construction equipment rental companies in the U.S. serves as a testament to its effectiveness and potential for widespread market acceptance. This could lead to an expansion in EzFill's market share and potentially impact its financial performance positively. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the development and implementation of these new features require significant investment in technology and innovation. However, the long-term cost savings and efficiency gains for customers could justify the initial outlay. As EzFill's platform becomes more integral to its customers' operations, it could lead to a more stable and predictable revenue model, particularly if the company adopts a subscription-based pricing strategy for access to its advanced features.Investors will be interested in monitoring the uptake of these new features and how they contribute to EzFill's overall financial health. Key metrics to watch would include customer acquisition rates, churn rates and the impact on average revenue per user (ARPU). Positive trends in these areas could signal a strong growth trajectory and increase investor confidence in the company's stock. Technology Analyst The integration of automation into EzFill's services reflects broader industry trends towards digital transformation and the Internet of Things (IoT). By enabling one-click fuel ordering and comprehensive tracking, EzFill is leveraging technology to address pain points in the logistics and fleet management sectors. The use of these advanced digital tools can provide valuable data analytics, which can be used to optimize fuel consumption and reduce waste.In the context of the mobile fuel industry, the adoption of such technologies can be a differentiator and drive competitive advantage. It will be crucial for EzFill to maintain a focus on cybersecurity and data privacy, given the sensitive nature of the data being handled. Continuous innovation and updates to their platform will be necessary to keep pace with evolving customer needs and technological advancements. 02/26/2024 - 12:15 PM New Features added to its consumer application MIAMI, FL, Feb. 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- EzFill Holdings, Inc. (“EzFill” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: EZFL), a pioneer and emerging leader in the mobile fuel industry, announced the launch of a new and improved Fleet Fueling customer portal and new features added to its consumer application. As previously announced, the robust system is designed to significantly improve the way businesses manage their fleets, offering a comprehensive suite of automation tools. The system caters to both fleet business customers and on-demand construction equipment customers, allowing seamless uploading of locations and assets, adding users, setting recurring orders, and ordering on-demand fueling with a single click, streamlining the fuel procurement process. Customers are also able to use the system to track their fleet/equipment fuel to better manage their needs and see their savings. Additionally, all billing and payments have been completely automated. Two of the largest construction equipment rental companies in the United States have already adopted the system, with their employees praising its transformative impact on their operations. Avi Vaknin, EzFill's Chief Technology Officer, expressed enthusiasm about the launch, stating, ""The portal we have designed is sophisticated and user-friendly and we believe it rivals the top solutions currently available in the mobile fuel delivery industry. Onboarding of current fleet business clients to the portal is currently underway. In the first months since launching the EzFleet portal, we have already added 6,822 assets consisting of customer vehicles, generators, and construction equipment across 318 locations. We believe that the EzFleet portal makes customers ordering fuel and our delivery a simple worry free process.” In addition to the EzFleet portal, EzFill has recently introduced significant enhancements to its consumer mobile app. The new features allow app users to order fueling for their in-home generators, get gas cheaper than the gas station as VIP members, and earn rewards points for every gallon of fuel delivered to their vehicles, boats, or generators with the ability to redeem these points for cash discounts on future fuel orders. EzFill remains committed to driving innovation and convenience in the fuel delivery industry, and looks forward to further advancements in the near future.

For commercial and specialty customers, at-site delivery during downtimes enables operators to begin their daily operations with fully fueled vehicles. For more information, visit www.ezfl.com.

Hackers targeted Jewish and Chinese customers, selling their genetic information on the dark web. The company failed to disclose this targeting, leading to potential risks for affected customers. Lawsuits have been filed, alleging negligence and lack of transparency. Positive None. Negative Potential risks for affected customers due to the disclosure of personal genetic information on the dark web. Allegations of negligence and lack of transparency against 23andMe for not disclosing the targeting of Jewish and Chinese customers by hackers. Cybersecurity Expert The incident involving 23andMe highlights significant cybersecurity vulnerabilities within the genetic testing industry. The targeted nature of this breach, focusing on specific ethnic groups, raises concerns about the potential for genetic information to be misused for discriminatory purposes. The sale of genetic information on the dark web can lead to a myriad of risks, including identity theft, extortion and even bio-targeting.From a cybersecurity perspective, the delay in disclosing the full extent of the breach is troubling. Timely notification is critical to allow affected individuals to take protective measures. Furthermore, the company's attempt to shift blame to customers for reusing login credentials, while a valid security concern, does not absolve the company of its responsibility to safeguard user data with robust security measures.It's imperative for companies holding sensitive data to implement advanced encryption methods, continuous monitoring and to educate users on best practices for account security. The impact of this breach on 23andMe's reputation and user trust could have significant long-term consequences for the company. Legal Expert The filed class action lawsuit against 23andMe has substantial legal implications. Not only is the company facing accusations of failing to protect sensitive customer data, but the allegation that it concealed vital details about the breach could lead to increased scrutiny under data protection laws. In jurisdictions with stringent data privacy regulations, such as California's CCPA or Europe's GDPR, the penalties for non-compliance can be severe.The specific targeting of Jewish and Chinese customers could also introduce elements of discrimination and hate crimes into the legal proceedings. If the company is found to have not taken adequate steps to inform the affected groups, it could face additional claims of negligence. The legal outcomes of this case could set a precedent for how genetic data breaches are handled in the future and may lead to calls for more robust data privacy legislation. Financial Analyst The breach at 23andMe is likely to have immediate and long-term financial repercussions for the company. In the short term, the company may experience a decline in user trust and brand reputation, potentially leading to a decrease in new user sign-ups and an increase in churn rates. The costs associated with the legal proceedings, potential settlements and increased security measures will likely impact the company's financial performance.In the long term, the breach could lead to increased regulatory costs and the need for significant investments in cybersecurity infrastructure. Moreover, if the breach results in stricter industry regulations, the entire genetic testing sector could face higher compliance costs. Investors should monitor the situation closely, as the breach could affect not only 23andMe's stock price but also the valuation of similar companies in the genetic testing market. 02/26/2024 - 12:15 PM NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / February 26, 2024 / 23andMe (NASDAQ:ME) was hacked in December 2023, affecting approximately 7 million users of its genetic services website. According to a recently filed class complaint, hackers who infiltrated 23andMe's system were after the personal information of Jewish and Chinese customers, but the company hid that detail when notifying affected customers.The hackers specifically targeted the personal genetic information of Jewish and Chinese customers and compiled that data - including genetic heritage, names, and addresses - into lists that were then sold on the dark web, but 23andMe concealed both those revelations when it announced the extent of the breach in December 2023.According to the lawsuit, the hacker leaked a list of over 1 million Jewish customers expressly in retribution for the Israel-Hamas war. The hacker was also more than happy to leak a list of 350,000 Chinese customers upon request from a user with the alias ""Wuhan.""These lists generated a huge amount of interest from hackers on the dark web from all over the world and were shared and reshared an untold number of times.The disclosure of these lists threatens the safety of those customers, including from the Chinese government, which has a long history of tracking Chinese citizens.According to the lawsuit,to this day, 23andMe has not informed the 7 million compromised customers that their personal genetic information was disclosed on the dark web, nor has it told its Jewish and Chinese customers that they were specifically targeted.IF YOU ARE A VULNERABLE person whose personal genetic information identifies you as having Ashkenazi Jewish heritage or Chinese ancestry, and/or live in California, Illinois, Oregon, or Alaska, please contact us to review your rights and eligibility for compensation:https://bit.ly/3sYm8CnADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:According to a recently filed class action complaint, on Oct. 1, 2023, a hacker using the alias ""Golem"" leaked the 23andMe data of 1 million Ashkenazi Jews on Breach Forums, calling it ""the most valuable data you'll ever see.""""Golem's explicit targeting of Jewish 23andMe users is further conveyed by his use of the character 'Gollum' from The Lord of the Rings - a creature driven by greed with ugly and outsized facial features - as his profile picture.""A few hours later, a user with the alias ""Wuhan"" asked Golem if he had ""Chinese accounts,"" according to the complaint. The next day, Golem leaked the data of 7 million users, saying in the post that the customer information included phenotype and health information, photos, and identification data.Golem listed prices for the customer profiles at $1,000 for 100 profiles, $5,000 for 1,000 profiles, $20,000 for 10,000 profiles and $100,000 for 100,000 profiles.Interest in the leaked Jewish and Chinese information was immediate and overwhelming following an Israeli bombing of a Palestinian hospital.23andMe attempted to shift the blame to customers, telling them the breach was a result of customers using recycled login credentials from their accounts on other websites.Further, 23andMe then waited until December to report that 7 million customers were directly affected by the breach and didn't say anything about the data being sold on the dark web or that Jewish and Chinese customers were specifically targeted.Levi Korsinsky, LLP is investigating whether affected customers are entitled to compensation.

Negative None. 02/26/2024 - 10:30 AM The Collaboration Will Bring Limitless Design Opportunities to JennAir and KitchenAid Cooktops in 2025 BENTON HARBOR, Mich., Feb. 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Whirlpool Corporation and BORA share the belief that the kitchen is the hub of the home and is a space that should be redesigned through a lens that pushes boundaries while merging technology and function. Founded on the mutual passion to question the ordinary, the two companies are collaborating to bring the best induction downdraft technology exclusively to JennAir and KitchenAid brand induction downdraft cooktops in North America in 2025. In recent years, consumers in North America have continued to adopt induction technology and within the cooktop industry, induction has grown roughly 62% since 20181. There remains, however, a largely unmet consumer demand for induction downdraft solutions to match the rising cooking trend. With the new product collaboration comes added consumer benefits ranging from aesthetics to functional power. Downdraft technology eliminates the need for a separate overhead ventilation unit — commonly known as a range hood — allowing for limitless design opportunities, without sacrificing performance. ""Whirlpool Corporation has long been committed to delivering products in the name of disruptive progress, and we're excited to announce this collaboration with BORA at the Kitchen & Bath Industry Show,"" said Alessandro Perucchetti, Whirlpool Corporation NAR President. ""Through our new collaboration, we're thrilled to further enhance our JennAir and KitchenAid appliances in 2025 with new induction downdraft technology that has already revolutionized the European market."" Utilizing innovation to create spaces that offer clear, unrestricted sightlines and the opportunity to create a kitchen as unique as the consumers who enjoy them each day is a longstanding priority for the JennAir and KitchenAid brands. In fact, the JennAir brand's history with downdraft technology dates back to 1965 when founder Lou Jenn invented downdraft technology, changing the kitchen forever. Since then, JennAir has continued to push the luxury appliance industry forward with appliances that break the mold through differentiated aesthetics, disruptive technology and quiet performance. Similarly, KitchenAid exists to help the world make more of the kitchen by creating a space of inspiration and connection. The KitchenAid brand remains committed to delivering major appliances that continue to expand capabilities as makers progress in their cooking skills.

TotalEnergies SE: Disclosure of Transactions in Own Shares,2024-02-26T17:00:00.000Z,Low,Very Negative,"TotalEnergies SE (TTE) announces share repurchase transactions totaling 2,865,424 shares for a total amount of 169,904,570.05 EUR from February 19 to February 23, 2024, in compliance with shareholder authorization.","TotalEnergies SE: Disclosure of Transactions in Own Shares Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary TotalEnergies SE (TTE) announces share repurchase transactions totaling 2,865,424 shares for a total amount of 169,904,570.05 EUR from February 19 to February 23, 2024, in compliance with shareholder authorization. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Share repurchase programs are a significant signal to the market, often reflecting a company's confidence in its financial health and perceived undervaluation of its stock. In the case of TotalEnergies SE, the repurchase of 2,865,424 shares within a week represents a substantial investment back into the company, amounting to approximately 169.9 million EUR. This action could be interpreted as a positive indicator to investors, suggesting that the company believes its shares are undervalued and that it is using its capital to generate shareholder value.From a financial perspective, this buyback will reduce the number of outstanding shares, potentially increasing earnings per share (EPS) and return on equity (ROE), both of which are key indicators of financial performance. However, it is also essential to consider the opportunity cost of this capital allocation. The funds used for share repurchases are not being invested in other growth opportunities or used to pay down debt, which could have different implications for the company's long-term growth trajectory. Market Research Analyst The timing and price of the share repurchases provide insights into market dynamics and investor sentiment. TotalEnergies SE's repurchase occurred over consecutive days, with a slight fluctuation in the daily weighted average purchase price. This could indicate market stability and a consistent valuation of the company's shares during that period.Analyzing the volume and price across different markets (XPAR, CEUX, TQEX, AQEU) could reveal patterns in liquidity and investor behavior in various trading venues. The distributed nature of the buyback suggests that TotalEnergies is utilizing a broad market approach to execute its repurchase plan, which may be aimed at minimizing market impact and obtaining an optimal average price for the shares. Energy Sector Analyst For stakeholders in the energy sector, share repurchases by a company like TotalEnergies SE must be contextualized within the industry's current landscape. The energy sector is often influenced by geopolitical events, regulatory changes and fluctuations in commodity prices. A buyback of this scale could indicate that TotalEnergies is in a stable position relative to these factors and is looking to consolidate its financial structure amidst industry volatility.It's also pertinent to consider the environmental, social and governance (ESG) implications of such financial moves. With increasing focus on sustainable energy, investors may scrutinize how buybacks align with a company's commitment to transitioning towards renewable energy sources and how it balances shareholder returns with sustainable investments. 02/26/2024 - 12:00 PM PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News: In accordance with the authorization given by the ordinary shareholders’ general meeting on May 26, 2023, to trade on its shares and pursuant to applicable law on share repurchase, TotalEnergies SE (LEI: 529900S21EQ1BO4ESM68) (Paris:TTE) (LSE:TTE) (NYSE:TTE) declares the following purchases of its own shares (FR0000120271) from February 19 to February 23, 2024: Transaction Date Total daily volume (number of shares) Daily weighted average purchase price of shares (EUR/share) Amount of transactions (EUR) Market (MIC Code) 19/02/2024 365,883 59.797280 21,878,808.20 XPAR 19/02/2024 149,794 59.796995 8,957,231.07 CEUX 19/02/2024 28,573 59.796854 1,708,575.51 TQEX 19/02/2024 24,216 59.797881 1,448,065.49 AQEU 20/02/2024 370,196 59.141498 21,893,945.99 XPAR 20/02/2024 150,720 59.139911 8,913,567.39 CEUX 20/02/2024 28,674 59.139479 1,695,765.42 TQEX 20/02/2024 24,108 59.141587 1,425,785.38 AQEU 21/02/2024 373,265 58.818907 21,955,039.32 XPAR 21/02/2024 150,235 58.817898 8,836,506.91 CEUX 21/02/2024 29,192 58.816266 1,716,964.44 TQEX 21/02/2024 25,200 58.815792 1,482,157.96 AQEU 22/02/2024 369,661 59.312537 21,925,531.74 XPAR 22/02/2024 149,016 59.310635 8,838,233.59 CEUX 22/02/2024 28,973 59.308738 1,718,352.07 TQEX 22/02/2024 25,552 59.313033 1,515,566.62 AQEU 23/02/2024 369,053 59.413361 21,926,679.12 XPAR 23/02/2024 148,815 59.414406 8,841,754.83 CEUX 23/02/2024 28,527 59.413213 1,694,880.73 TQEX 23/02/2024 25,771 59.414004 1,531,158.30 AQEU Total 2,865,424 59.294740 169,904,570.05 Transaction details In accordance with Article 5(1)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 (the Market Abuse Regulation) a full breakdown of the individual trades are disclosed on the TotalEnergies website: https://totalenergies.com/investors/shares-and-dividends/total-shares/info/company-share-transactions About TotalEnergies TotalEnergies is a global multi-energy company that produces and markets energies: oil and biofuels, natural gas and green gases, renewables and electricity.

Positive None. Negative None. 02/26/2024 - 11:00 AM ~ 63% of Energy CEOs surveyed expect to realize value from generative AI and automation ~ ORLANDO, Fla., Feb. 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, at Distributech 2024, IBM (NYSE: IBM) unveiled additional findings from its global study findings that show that 74% of Energy & Utility companies surveyed have implemented or are exploring using AI in their operations. Within the sector, among surveyed IT Professionals, 33% are focusing AI projects on HR/Talent Acquisition and 27% are focused on AI Monitoring & Governance. The findings are from IBM's Global AI Adoption Index 2023 global study* administered by Morning Consult and commissioned by IBM, based on interviews with 2,342 IT Professionals at enterprises located across 20 countries. This new data echoes insights from the IBM Institute for Business Value's 2023 study, 'CEO decision-making in the age of AI,' which also interviewed 420 Energy & Resources CEOs thinking around AI. The fresh analysis of the Industry C-suite data shows that: 63% Energy & Resources CEOs surveyed are more likely than their global peers to expect to realize value in the next three years from generative AI and automation61% of CEOs surveyed express concerns about the sources of data used in generative AIWhen considering the impact of transformational technologies, Energy Industry CEOs surveyed appear to place Generative AI first in terms of expected value. To help the industry chart a path forward to realize the value of generative AI, at Distributech 2024, the leading annual transmission and distribution event, IBM at booth#2743 today showcased watsonx - its enterprise ready AI and data platform. Importantly, to help, Energy & Resources companies to navigate data-related challenges, including unclear data calculation and, critically, a lack of insights, IBM is highlighting its watsonx.governance toolkit for AI governance which allows a Utility company to direct, manage and monitor its AI . It employs software automation to strengthen a company's ability to mitigate risks, manage regulatory requirements and address ethical concerns for both generative AI and machine learning models. While not all models are created equal, every model should have governance to drive responsible and ethical decision-making throughout the business. Casey Werth, Global Energy Industry General Manager IBM said, ""Energy & Utility CEOs have moved beyond experimentation with AI to focusing on where they can drive the most business value with AI. As they manage ongoing transformation efforts they can also capitalize on the great opportunities of generative AI and foundation models. In doing so they need to remember to focus on their own data, how it is gathered, accessed and used within their workflows along with the governance that should be baked into their tools and processes."" A good example of how Utility companies can tap large language models is to augment their internal compliance process. For a Utility company this can allow them to automate and align internal compliance processes to their specific business needs. For example, a utility can: Provide a single repository of obligation management to classify complex requirements.Enable their organization to govern their environmental, social and governance (ESG) programs and sustainability.Track provenance and document model performance against key performance indicators determined by the business.Provide visibility to key stakeholders through dynamic, user-based dashboards, charts and dimensional reporting.At #DISTRIBUTECH24, IBM has several executive speaking sessions designed to help show how the industry can digitally transform at pace. Topics include; Quantum in the Energy Sector, Digitally Managing Emergency Response & Mobilization, Digital Twin for advanced and predictive Load Management, Preparing the Grid for tomorrow, Applying weather & climate risk analytics to create more sustainable and resilient grids. IBM's Energy CTO Bryan Sacks, will also lead an industry roundtable focused on AI for Grid Management discussing how companies in the energy and utilities industry are thinking about AI, use cases, policy and governance.

The company attributes this growth to an increase in net interest income and cost control initiatives. Despite a slight increase in interest expenses, IBOC remains competitive in the current economic environment. The company's strong financial performance is supported by its outstanding balance sheet management strategies and exceptional capital position, positioning it for continued success in 2024 and beyond. Positive Annual net income for 2023 reached $411.8 million, a 37.2% increase over 2022. Diluted earnings per share for 2023 were $6.62, a 38.5% rise compared to 2022. Net income for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2023, was $106.4 million, with a 1.0% increase over the same period in 2022. Net interest income saw a significant increase due to a larger investment portfolio and higher loan interest income. IBOC closely monitors interest rates to remain competitive and retain deposits. The company's cost control initiatives and efficiency measures have contributed to its positive financial results. Total assets at Dec. 31, 2023, were $15.1 billion, with total net loans at $7.9 billion and deposits at $11.8 billion. IBOC is a multi-bank financial holding company with 166 facilities and 256 ATMs serving 75 communities in Texas and Oklahoma. The company's return on assets (ROA) positions it among the top publicly traded bank holding companies in the nation. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported annual net income growth of 37.2% and the 38.5% increase in diluted earnings per share for International Bancshares Corporation (IBOC) reflect a significant improvement in financial performance, surpassing the previous year's results. This growth can largely be attributed to the strategic expansion of the bank's investment portfolio and the favorable impact of higher Federal Reserve interest rates on loan interest income. It's important to note that the rise in net income, despite the increase in interest expense due to higher rates on deposits, indicates effective cost control measures and operational efficiency.IBOC's management of interest income and expense in response to changing interest rate environments demonstrates a proactive approach to balance sheet management. Their strategies have yielded a positive net interest margin, which is a critical indicator of a bank's profitability. The robust capital position and liquidity, along with a strong deposit base, suggest resilience and potential for sustained performance, which could be attractive to investors seeking stability in the financial sector. Market Research Analyst IBOC's performance positions the company among the top publicly traded bank holding companies, as indicated by its return on assets (ROA). This metric is a key indicator of how efficiently a company's management is using its assets to generate earnings. IBOC's solid earnings performance, particularly in the context of economic uncertainty and fluctuating interest rates, may signal to market participants the company's competitive edge and operational effectiveness.However, the reduction in total deposits from $12.7 billion to $11.8 billion raises questions about the bank's ability to retain and attract deposits in a competitive rate environment. This could be a point of concern for investors, as deposits are a fundamental source of funding for banks. The ability to maintain a strong deposit base is crucial for the bank's lending capabilities and overall financial health. Economist IBOC's performance must be contextualized within the broader economic environment, particularly the monetary policy landscape influenced by the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. The bank's increase in loan interest income is a direct consequence of the Fed's rate hikes, which can lead to higher interest margins for banks. However, this environment also increases the cost of deposits, as banks must offer more competitive rates to retain depositors.Looking ahead, IBOC's confidence in its balance sheet management strategies suggests a degree of preparedness for potential economic shifts. The ability to navigate the interplay between asset liability, liquidity management and interest rate fluctuations will be crucial for IBOC's continued success, especially in a climate of anticipated rate changes. Investors should monitor how the bank adjusts to these macroeconomic factors and maintains its profitability in a potentially volatile interest rate environment. 02/26/2024 - 01:16 PM LAREDO, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- International Bancshares Corporation (NASDAQ:IBOC), one of the largest independent bank holding companies in Texas, today reported annual net income for 2023 of $411.8 million, or $6.62 diluted earnings per common share ($6.63 per share basic), compared to $300.2 million, or $4.78 diluted earnings per common share ($4.79 per share basic), which represents an increase of 38.5% in diluted earnings per share and a 37.2% increase in net income over the corresponding period in 2022. Net income for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2023 was $106.4 million, or $1.71 diluted earnings per common share ($1.71 per share basic), compared to $105.4 million, or $1.68 diluted earnings per common share ($1.69 per share basic) for the same period in 2022, representing an increase of 1.0% in net income and a 1.8% increase in diluted earnings per share. Net income for the year ended Dec. 31, 2023 was positively impacted by an increase in net interest income, which is primarily attributable to an increase in the size of our investment portfolio, the interest earned on funds held at the Federal Reserve Bank and an increase in loan interest income, of which the latter two have increased consistently with Federal Reserve Board actions to raise interest rates in 2022 and 2023. Net income for the period has also been impacted by increases in interest expense, primarily driven by an increase in interest paid on deposits. We closely monitor rates paid on deposits to remain competitive in the current economic environment and retain deposits. The increase in those revenue streams coupled with the cost control initiatives to streamline operations and increase efficiency in recent years have been the primary drivers in achieving these results.

The company emphasizes the production and deliveries of Class 1 and Class 3 vehicles, while Bollinger Motors gears up for Class 4 production starting in the second half of 2024. Mullen's strategic acquisitions have enabled faster scaling and production, with a strong emphasis on battery solutions and AI-driven battery management systems. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Examining Mullen Automotive's announcement from a market perspective, the company's achievement of a positive gross margin per Class 1 and Class 3 electric vehicles is a significant milestone. Typically, new entrants in the EV market struggle with profitability due to high production costs and lower economies of scale. Mullen's ability to reach positive gross margins so early in production is noteworthy, indicating effective cost management and a potentially scalable business model. Furthermore, the focus on commercial EVs is strategic, as this market segment is expected to grow rapidly due to increasing e-commerce and urbanization, leading to higher demand for last-mile delivery solutions. The integration of advanced battery solutions and AI-driven battery management systems, which Mullen refers to as 'The Intelligent BMS', suggests a commitment to technological innovation and could provide a competitive edge. Battery performance is a critical factor for EV adoption and advancements in this area can lead to increased vehicle range, efficiency and lifecycle, which are key considerations for commercial fleet operators. However, the planned start of Class 4 vehicle production in the second half of 2024 indicates a timeline that investors and stakeholders will monitor closely. Delays in production could affect the company's financials and stock performance. Additionally, maintaining the positive gross margin as production scales will be crucial for long-term sustainability. Automotive Industry Expert The shift towards electric vehicles in the commercial sector is a global trend, driven by regulatory pressures and the need for sustainable transportation solutions. Mullen Automotive's focus on Class 1-3 vehicles caters to a niche in urban last-mile delivery, which is experiencing increased demand due to the rise of online shopping. The EPA and CARB certifications for their vehicles are essential for operating across the United States, as these certifications ensure compliance with strict environmental standards. The mention of acquisitions, such as Bollinger Motors and Electric Last Mile Solutions assets, highlights a strategic move to accelerate growth and expand capabilities. These acquisitions not only provide Mullen with additional technology and production facilities but also indicate an aggressive approach to capturing market share in the EV space. As the production of Class 4-6 vehicles by Bollinger Motors is planned for the second half of 2024, it will be important to observe how these vehicles will be received in the market, especially since they will be competing with established players who are also expanding their EV offerings. Sustainability Analyst From a sustainability standpoint, Mullen Automotive's progress in producing commercial electric vehicles aligns with broader environmental goals and the transition towards a low-carbon economy. The integration of advanced battery technology and AI in battery management systems could lead to improved energy efficiency and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. This technological innovation is in line with industry trends focusing on the electrification of transport as a means to combat climate change. The acquisition of a large automotive manufacturing facility also suggests that Mullen is positioning itself to meet the expected increase in demand for EVs while potentially reducing its carbon footprint through domestic production. The ability to sell in every state thanks to EPA and CARB certifications enhances the potential market reach of their vehicles, thus contributing to the adoption of clean energy vehicles on a national scale. However, the actual environmental impact will depend on the life-cycle analysis of the vehicles, including production processes, energy sources for electricity and end-of-life vehicle management. 02/26/2024 - 10:00 AM Company in full commercial EV production with Class 1 and Class 3 vehicles; Bollinger Motors focused on Class 4-6 vehicles with Class 4 production starting in second half 2024 Company achieves positive gross margin per Class 1 and Class 3 vehicles invoiced Company integrating advance battery solutions and AI driven battery management system, “The Intelligent BMS” BREA, Calif., Feb. 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via IBN – Mullen Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ: MULN) (“Mullen” or the “Company”), an emerging electric vehicle (“EV”) manufacturer, highlights today the Company’s continued focus on the commercial vehicle segment with production and deliveries of its Class 1 and Class 3 commercial EVs. The Company also highlights Bollinger Motors' focus on the Class 4-6 commercial vehicle segment and production start of Class 4 vehicles, which is planned in the second half of 2024. The Company has achieved positive gross margin per vehicles invoiced, which is an important highlight considering majority of EV companies have launched EVs with significant losses to date. “Strategically, in 2022 we understood EV adoption in the commercial sector would occur faster and doubled down on our acquisition efforts with both the majority acquisition of Bollinger Motors and the purchase of Electric Last Mile Solutions assets, which included full ownership of a large automotive manufacturing facility in Mishawaka, Indiana,” said David Michery, CEO and chairman of Mullen Automotive. “These acquisitions allowed us to scale faster, which is best demonstrated by the launch of commercial vehicle production and customer deliveries in 2023. Mullen’s effort will be matched when Bollinger begins Class 4 production launch, which is planned later in 2024. Our effort on the commercial segment is laser focused and the opportunity has never been better with increased demand seen across all our commercial vehicle offerings. “Along with production, we have remained steadfastly focused on continuous improvement and R&D as seen in the addition of our battery facility in Fullerton, California, to produce our own packs. The focus on batteries is ever more important for the sector from a range and supply chain perspective. We believe harnessing AI and applying it to our battery management systems can hold additional promise for our vehicles in the commercial sectors.” Mullen began Class 3 vehicle production in August 2023 and first vehicle deliveries in September 2023. Mullen Class 1 production began in November 2023 with first vehicle deliveries in December 2023. The all-electric Mullen ONE Class 1 EV cargo van and Mullen THREE Class 3 low cab forward EV truck are both purpose-built to meet the demands of urban last-mile delivery and vocational services. Both the Class 1 and Class 3 commercial vehicles are in receipt of Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and CARB certifications and can be sold in every state throughout the U.S. About MullenMullen Automotive (NASDAQ: MULN) is a Southern California-based automotive company building the next generation of electric vehicles (“EVs”) that will be manufactured in its two United States-based assembly plants.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), is launching a new AWS infrastructure Region in Mexico by early 2025, investing over $5 billion (approx. MXN $85 billion) in the country. The Region will cater to a wide range of customers, including developers, startups, enterprises, and government organizations, offering lower latency and secure content storage options. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The announcement of Amazon Web Services' expansion into Mexico represents a strategic move to capitalize on the high demand for cloud services in the Latin America region. The investment of over $5 billion signals AWS's commitment to establishing a significant presence and suggests expectations of substantial growth in the local market. This infrastructure development can be expected to enhance AWS's competitive edge by reducing latency for end users and adhering to data sovereignty requirements that are increasingly important for customers in various sectors.From a market perspective, this move could potentially increase Amazon's market share in cloud services within Latin America and provide a boost to its overall revenue growth. The expansion may also lead to a ripple effect, encouraging other tech giants to bolster their presence in emerging markets, thereby intensifying competition. For investors and stakeholders, the long-term investment in Mexico's digital infrastructure could translate into sustained revenue streams and a stronger foothold in a market that is rapidly digitizing. Financial Analyst The $5 billion investment over 15 years into the AWS Mexico (Central) Region should be dissected in terms of its financial implications. Given that cloud computing is a high-margin business, AWS's expansion into Mexico could lead to improved margins over time due to economies of scale and increased utilization of the new infrastructure. However, the initial capital expenditure will be substantial and investors should monitor the impact this will have on Amazon's free cash flow, especially in the context of its broader capital allocation strategy.Moreover, the long-term nature of the investment means that the financial benefits will accrue gradually. It's important to consider the potential for increased operating expenses associated with the expansion, including costs related to staffing, maintenance and local regulatory compliance. The market's reaction to this news may be mixed, as the benefits are long-term and the costs upfront, but a successful execution could lead to a re-rating of Amazon's stock as the company taps into the growing Latin American market. Economist The investment of AWS into Mexico is indicative of the broader economic trends where technology and digital services are becoming pivotal to economic growth. Mexico, being a part of Latin America, represents an emerging market with a growing middle class and increasing technological adoption, making it an attractive destination for such investments. The potential economic impact includes job creation, both directly and indirectly, through the establishment of data centers and the stimulation of the local tech ecosystem.It's also likely to contribute to the GDP of Mexico through increased productivity and innovation. The direct investment into digital infrastructure can be a catalyst for further economic development, as access to advanced cloud technologies can enable local businesses to scale and compete globally. The long-term nature of the investment also demonstrates a vote of confidence in the stability and growth potential of the Mexican economy, which could encourage further foreign direct investment into the region. 02/26/2024 - 09:50 AM AWS Mexico (Central) Region will enable customers to run workloads and securely store their content in Mexico while serving end users with even lower latency New Region reflects AWS’s long-term commitment to meeting high demand for cloud services in Latin America AWS plans to invest more than $5 billion (approx. MXN $85 billion) in Mexico SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Amazon Web Services (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ:AMZN), today announced plans to launch an AWS infrastructure Region in Mexico by early 2025. The new AWS Mexico (Central) Region will give developers, startups, entrepreneurs, and enterprises, as well as government, education, and nonprofit organizations, greater choice for running their applications and serving end users from data centers located in Mexico, ensuring that customers who want to store their content in Mexico can do so. As part of its long-term commitment to Latin America, AWS is planning to invest more than $5 billion (approx. MXN $85 billion) in Mexico over 15 years. The upcoming AWS Mexico Region is the latest in AWS’s ongoing investments in Mexico to provide customers with advanced and secure cloud technologies. For more information about AWS Global Infrastructure, visit aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure. “Cloud services are an essential part of everyday life, helping us to digitally and economically transform Mexico,” said Raquel Buenrostro, Mexican secretary of economy. “We welcome AWS’s investment and expansion in Mexico because it is a sign of trust and demonstrates conditions are right to support the nearshoring trend across many sectors of our economy. We also welcome AWS’s investment in training students, micro, small and medium-sized companies, and digital entrepreneurs in Mexico at scale.” “AWS is excited to see thousands of customers in nearly every industry across Mexico innovate and grow,” said Prasad Kalyanaraman, vice president of Infrastructure Services at AWS. “Our investment in Mexico reflects AWS’s long-term commitment to customers so they can take advantage of advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning. We look forward to helping customers in Mexico meet data residency preferences and deliver cloud-based applications with low latency, accelerating the country’s digital transformation, and fueling economic growth.” The new AWS Region will consist of three Availability Zones at launch, adding to AWS’s existing 105 Availability Zones across 33 geographic regions globally. With today’s announcement, AWS has plans to launch 15 more Availability Zones and five more AWS Regions in Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Thailand, and the AWS European Sovereign Cloud. AWS Regions consist of Availability Zones that place infrastructure in separate and distinct geographic locations. Availability Zones are located far enough from each other to support customers’ business continuity, but near enough to provide low latency for high availability applications that use multiple Availability Zones. Each Availability Zone has independent power, cooling, and physical security and is connected through redundant, ultra-low-latency networks. AWS customers focused on high availability can design their applications to run in multiple Availability Zones to achieve even greater fault tolerance. The AWS Mexico (Central) Region will enable customers with data residency preferences or requirements to store their content securely in Mexico, enable customers to achieve even lower latency, and serve demand for cloud services across Latin America. Customers from startups to enterprises to government organizations and nonprofits will be able to use advanced technologies from the world’s leading cloud to drive innovation. AWS offers the broadest and deepest portfolio of services, including analytics, artificial intelligence, compute, database, Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, mobile services, storage, and other cloud technologies. As part of a continued commitment to contribute to the development of digital skills, AWS will hire and develop additional local personnel to operate and support the new AWS Region in Mexico. “Amazon has demonstrated confidence in our country and this investment is the result of the close collaboration that they have built with the government of Mexico,” said Emiliano Calderón, head of national digital strategy for Mexico’s government. “This administration has promoted an open policy for all technology companies as a foundational tool for digital and financial inclusion, with the ultimate objective of bringing technology and innovation closer to the people. Congratulations to AWS on its upcoming infrastructure region, which will be a key driver of Mexico’s digital transformation.” “AWS’s infrastructure expansion in Queretaro is a testament to our state’s commitment to advanced technology and innovation, and to the work we’ve done to create an environment where technology companies can thrive,” said Mauricio Kuri, governor of the state of Queretaro. “This investment reinforces our role as a leader in Mexico’s digital transformation and helps us drive economic growth. With AWS, we look forward to adding jobs, generating new businesses, and expanding opportunities for the people of Queretaro and across the country.” Customers welcome the AWS Region in Mexico Organizations in Mexico are among the millions of active customers using AWS in more than 190 countries around the world. Enterprises in Mexico choose AWS to innovate, drive cost efficiencies, and accelerate time to market. Customers using AWS include Aeroméxico, Banco Santander Mexico, BBVA, Cinépolis, Kavak, Palace Resorts, and Vector Casa de Bolsa. Mexican public sector customers also use AWS to help drive cost savings and better serve local citizens. These customers include Government of the State of Michoacán, Nacional Monte de Piedad, and Tec de Monterrey. Startups and small businesses, including Kueski, Rappi, and SkyAlert, are building their businesses on AWS to rapidly scale nationally and around the world. Aeroméxico is Mexico’s flagship airline and a leader in Latin American aviation, transporting over 1.9 million passengers in January 2024. “Our purpose as a global airline is to offer an extraordinary experience to our customers in every travel destination. We are able to achieve this goal with AWS as our primary cloud provider, which helps us to prioritize technological modernization and improve the efficiency of our operations,” said Fernando Rocha, CIO at Aeroméxico. “A new AWS Region in Mexico shows a strong sign of the commitment to Mexican customers through investment in local infrastructure. For Aeroméxico, it represents a valuable opportunity to take advantage of higher performance in our mission-critical applications and more efficient telecommunications services – which means we can innovate faster and deliver a better customer experience.” Banco Santander Mexico is one of the leading financial groups in the country, focused on retail and commercial banking, and other financial services, serving more than 20.5 million customers. “AWS has played a strategic role in our digital transformation,” said Juan Pablo Chiappari, head of IT infrastructure for North America at Banco Santander. “Thanks to their wide range of services, we have been able to innovate faster, improve our customer experience and reduce our operating costs.” Cinépolis is the third largest cinema chain globally in terms of the number of screens, with more than 6,700 fully operational. The cinema chain is present in 19 countries and is the largest cinema chain in Latin America. “At Cinépolis, we aim to create inspiring experiences that touch people’s lives. AWS infrastructure helps us reach a growing number of customers with the latest entertainment content across Latin America and the U.S.,” said Juan Velez Ballesteros, director of development and architecture at Cinépolis. “The development of a new AWS infrastructure Region in Mexico will allow us to continue innovating with the scalability, resilience and security that a fast-growing business requires and deliver even more unforgettable experiences to our customers.” Vector Casa de Bolsa is the largest independent securities broker-dealer in Mexico and has a presence in 10 countries. It offers a full-service broker dealer and wealth manager with specialized products and services designed for individual investors, companies, institutional funds, government, and foreign investors. “Innovation is one of our core values, and we’re constantly seeking new ways to better serve our customers,” said Mónica Martínez, chief AI and innovation officer at Vector Casa de Bolsa. “Our strong desire to work with AWS is strengthened to continue accessing the latest technologies and resources, including world-class infrastructure at the local level that will enable us to build the next generation of our services and products powered by generative AI, and bring innovative solutions to our customers.” Mexican AWS Partners also welcome the new AWS Region The AWS Partner Network (APN) is a global community that leverages AWS technologies, programs, expertise, and tools to build solutions and services for customers. Together, partners and AWS provide innovative solutions, solve technical challenges, win deals, and deliver greater customer value. AWS Partners in Mexico include Escala 24x7, Nyx Technologies, and XalDigital. For the full list of AWS Partners, visit aws.amazon.com/partners. XalDigital is an AWS Partner that develops innovative technological solutions to drive digital transformation for companies. “AWS’s infrastructure investment in Mexico will play an important role in accelerating digital transformation in the country while bringing multiple benefits to our customers,” said Denis Génova, co-founder and CEO at XalDigital. “The upcoming AWS Region will enable companies to store and process data securely and reliably in the cloud, improving business efficiency and strengthening trust in digital operations. Organizations across financial services, telecommunications, media and entertainment, healthcare, and more will also have the tools to drive industry-leading innovation through adoption of emerging technologies like generative AI.” AWS investment in Mexico Since 2020, AWS has launched seven Amazon CloudFront edge locations in Mexico. Amazon CloudFront is a highly secure and programmable content delivery network that accelerates the delivery of data, videos, applications, and APIs to users worldwide with low latency and high transfer speeds. In 2020, AWS also launched AWS Outposts in Mexico. AWS Outposts is a family of fully managed solutions delivering AWS infrastructure and services to virtually any on-premises or edge location for a truly consistent hybrid experience. AWS expanded its infrastructure footprint in Mexico again in 2023 with the launch of AWS Local Zones in Queretaro. AWS Local Zones are a type of AWS infrastructure deployment that places compute, storage, database, and other select services closer to large population, industry, and IT centers, enabling customers to deliver applications that require single-digit millisecond latency to end users. In 2023, AWS also established an AWS Direct Connect location in Queretaro, allowing customers to establish private connectivity between AWS and their data center, office, or colocation environment. To support the growth in cloud adoption across Mexico, AWS continues to invest in upskilling students, local developers and technical professionals, nontechnical professionals, and the next generation of IT leaders in Mexico through offerings like AWS re/Start, AWS Academy, AWS Educate, and AWS Skill Builder. These programs and learning centers help learners of all backgrounds and experiences prepare for careers in the cloud. From college courses to full-time training programs to interactive, game-based learning content, AWS Training and Certification provides individuals with training in the ways they like to learn. As part of the long-term commitment to Latin America, since 2017 AWS has trained over two million people across the region on cloud skills, including 400,000 people in Mexico.

Additionally, the U.S. market may offer more favorable tax treatments and a regulatory environment that could be beneficial for the company's bottom line.It's important to note that the 1:1 share exchange ratio maintains the equity value for existing shareholders, which is a neutral factor in the short term. However, the change in CUSIP number reflects a technical adjustment that signifies the completion of the redomiciliation process. Investors should monitor the company's performance post-redomiciliation to assess any changes in trading volumes or investor sentiment that may arise from the company's new U.S. presence. Market Research Analyst Market dynamics for electric commercial vehicles are evolving, with increasing demand driven by a global push towards sustainability and clean energy. Cenntro's move to the U.S. positions the company within a market that is aggressively adopting electric vehicles (EVs), spurred by both governmental policies and private sector initiatives. The U.S. market offers a robust infrastructure for EVs and a growing customer base that is receptive to commercial electric vehicles, which could translate into increased market share and sales for Cenntro.Furthermore, being listed on the Nasdaq could enhance visibility among investors who are specifically interested in technology and green energy sectors. This could potentially lead to an increase in trading activity and investor interest. However, it's crucial for Cenntro to capitalize on the U.S. market's opportunities by scaling operations effectively and navigating the competitive landscape, which includes well-established EV manufacturers as well as emerging players. Legal Expert The legal process of redomiciliation through a scheme of arrangement indicates a well-planned and structured approach to corporate restructuring. This legal mechanism ensures that the transition is executed in an orderly manner, with clear guidelines for shareholders and regulatory compliance. One key aspect of this process is the protection of shareholder rights, as evidenced by the issuance of shares on a 1:1 basis without diluting ownership.Additionally, the adherence to timelines and the coordination with Nasdaq to maintain the continuity of trading under the same ticker symbol 'CENN' demonstrates a commitment to transparency and regulatory compliance. The legal implications of such a move are significant, as they involve cross-border legal frameworks and require meticulous attention to the corporate governance standards of both the departing and receiving jurisdictions. Stakeholders should be reassured by the company's adherence to these rigorous legal standards. 02/26/2024 - 12:00 PM FREEHOLD, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cenntro Electric Group Limited (NASDAQ: CENN) (“Cenntro” or “the Company”), a leading electric vehicle technology company with advanced, market-validated electric commercial vehicles, refers to the proposed scheme of arrangement in relation to which Cenntro will redomicile from Australia to the United States (""U.S."", the “Scheme”), and under which Cenntro will become a subsidiary of Cenntro Inc., a corporation incorporated in accordance with the laws of the state of Nevada (""HoldCo"") for the purpose of effecting the Scheme.

Duffy announced that after meeting its goal of $33 million for St. Jude by 2024, the company has set a new pledge goal of $50 million by 2030. And a specially-designed pair of Carnival Jubilee-themed cowboy boots by Houston-based Parker Boot Co. were auctioned off for $25,000 to benefit Operation Homefront, which is dedicated to supporting military families. ""I know she has been honored in so many ways for her music with numerous awards and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and now she has a ship!,"" said Duffy as she introduced Stefani. ""She's also put giving back as an important focus in her life, especially to a number of children's causes, so we are truly thrilled to have Gwen as the Godmother of our flagship Carnival Jubilee!"" As she joined Duffy and Captain Stefano Bonica on stage, Stefani blessed and named the ship, and then pulled a lasso rope and lever that released the champagne bottle that struck the ship's bow to officially christen Carnival Jubilee. Stefani then treated the guests to a private concert of some of her hit songs, including ""Just a Girl,"" ""The Sweet Escape"" and ""Hollaback Girl."" Carnival Jubilee is homeported year-round in Galveston, sailing week-long Western Caribbean cruises. The ship is powered by a liquefied natural gas (LNG) technology platform and accommodates 6,500 guests and 1,750 crew.

Customers can access special pricing and free shipping offers on popular gaming storage drives. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Seagate Technology's strategic move to launch an e-commerce platform represents a significant shift in its go-to-market approach. By selling directly to consumers, Seagate is likely to enhance its brand visibility and customer engagement. This direct-to-consumer model can potentially increase profit margins by eliminating the need for intermediaries. However, it could also disrupt existing relationships with retailers and distributors, potentially leading to channel conflict.Furthermore, the introduction of exclusive promotions and discounts could stimulate demand, but it's crucial to monitor if these incentives are sustainable or merely a short-term strategy to drive initial traffic to the new platform. The long-term success will depend on the user experience, customer service quality and the efficiency of the logistics behind the new sales channel. Financial Analyst Investors should note Seagate's aggressive pricing strategy for its gaming storage drives, which may indicate a push to capture market share in the gaming segment. This pricing could potentially compress margins in the short term but could be offset by higher volumes and reduced sales and distribution costs. The company's expansion into e-commerce should be monitored for its impact on operational costs and working capital, as increased inventory levels might be required to fulfill direct consumer orders promptly.As Seagate expands its e-commerce presence globally, the capital expenditure and operational costs associated with this expansion will be important to track. Investors should look for improvements in revenue growth and customer acquisition costs in subsequent earnings reports to gauge the effectiveness of this strategic initiative. E-commerce Strategy Expert The launch of Seagate's e-commerce site is a notable development in the tech industry's ongoing trend towards digital transformation. By offering products directly on its website, Seagate can collect valuable consumer data and buying behavior insights, which can inform future product development and marketing strategies. The success of this initiative hinges on the company's ability to leverage this data effectively.It is essential to evaluate how Seagate's e-commerce platform integrates with existing digital ecosystems and how it complements or competes with other online retailers. The company's ability to offer a frictionless shopping experience, including ease of navigation, secure payment options and reliable fulfillment, will be critical in building customer loyalty and repeat business. 02/26/2024 - 11:19 AM FREMONT, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Seagate Technology plc (NASDAQ: STX), the leading innovator of mass-capacity storage solutions, today announced the launch of its new e-commerce website in the United States.

The FTC's decision is criticized for potentially raising food prices and strengthening competitors like Walmart and Amazon. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The proposed merger between Kroger and Albertsons is a significant event in the grocery sector that could reshape the competitive landscape. From a market research perspective, the claim that the merger would result in lower prices and more choices for consumers is a core benefit that needs to be scrutinized. Historically, consolidation in a market can lead to less competition, which might not always align with the interests of consumers. However, Kroger's commitment to reducing prices and investing in local products could stimulate competition by forcing other retailers to match these benefits.Furthermore, the investment in wages and benefits is a strategic move to strengthen the workforce and potentially improve service quality, which can be a differentiator in the retail industry. The emphasis on union jobs is particularly noteworthy, given the national trend of declining union membership. This could lead to improved employee retention and satisfaction, indirectly benefiting consumers through better service and potentially driving loyalty to the brand. Financial Analyst From a financial standpoint, the merger's impact on Kroger's gross margins is critical. The company's history of reducing gross margins to lower prices contrasts with the industry trend of increasing margins. This strategy could affect profitability in the short term but may be sustainable if it leads to increased market share and volume. The planned investment of $1.8 billion in price reductions and store improvements post-merger indicates a significant capital outlay with expectations for long-term returns.The divestiture plan with C&S Wholesale Grocers also merits attention. It could mitigate antitrust concerns and enable the merger to proceed, but the success of divested stores will depend on C&S's ability to operate them effectively. This move could introduce a new dynamic in the market, as C&S expands its retail footprint, potentially increasing competition. Legal Expert The FTC's opposition to the merger raises questions about antitrust law and consumer protection. The legal arguments Kroger presents in favor of the merger—such as no store closures, maintaining collective bargaining agreements and investing in community initiatives—will be weighed against antitrust concerns like market concentration and potential price increases. The outcome of the litigation will set a precedent for how such mergers are viewed in the context of antitrust law, particularly in an essential service industry like grocery retail.The companies' commitment to no store closures and maintaining employment levels post-merger is also significant. Such promises will likely be scrutinized in court to ensure they are not just short-term commitments to gain merger approval but are sustainable long-term strategies. 02/26/2024 - 12:39 PM CINCINNATI, Feb. 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The Kroger Co. (NYSE: KR) today issued the following statement: Contrary to the FTC's statements, blocking Kroger's merger with Albertsons Companies will actually harm the very people the FTC purports to serve: America's consumers and workers. Kroger's business model is to take costs out of the business and invest in lowering prices for customers. Kroger has reduced prices every year since 2003, resulting in $5 billion invested to lower prices and a 5% reduction in gross margin over this period. This business model is immediately applied to merger companies. Kroger has a proven track record of lowering prices so more customers benefit from fresh, affordable food, and our proposed merger with Albertsons will mean even lower prices and more choices for America's consumers. The FTC's decision makes it more likely that America's consumers will see higher food prices and fewer grocery stores at a time when communities across the country are already facing high inflation and food deserts. In fact, this decision only strengthens larger, non-unionized retailers like Walmart, Costco and Amazon by allowing them to further increase their overwhelming and growing dominance of the grocery industry. The proposed merger with Albertsons Cos. will produce meaningful and measurable benefits for customers, associates and communities across the country. The combined company committed that no stores, distribution centers or manufacturing facilities will close as a result of the merger, including those divested to C&S Wholesale Grocers. Customers will benefit from lower prices and more choices following the merger close. The company committed to investing $500 million to begin lowering prices day one post-close, and an additional $1.3 billion to improve Albertsons Cos.' stores. This commitment builds on Kroger's long track record of reducing prices every year, with $5 billion invested to lower prices since 2003. Kroger's work to deliver better value to customers over the last 20 years has reduced its gross margins by 5%. In the same timeframe, competitors like Amazon, Ahold Delhaize, Walmart and Dollar General have increased their gross margins by 22%, 4%, 1% and 2%, respectively. Kroger's track record includes the years following past mergers, as it invested more than $125 million to lower prices following its merger with Harris Teeter and more than $100 million to lower prices after it merged with Roundy's. Additionally, Kroger invested $2.5 million and $2.4 million in capital per Harris Teeter and Roundy's store, respectively, to enhance the customer experience in the three years following each merger. Customers will also have access to more favorite items from their own communities, as the company committed to increasing the number of local products in its stores by 10 percent post-close. As large retailers continue to squeeze suppliers and raise prices, this merger creates more opportunities for families to access the fresh, affordable foods they love. As a combined company, Kroger committed to investing $1 billion to raise wages and comprehensive benefits. This builds on the incremental $1.9 billion Kroger invested to improve wages and comprehensive benefits since 2018. To provide the best holistic support for each associate, the company will also extend continuing education and financial literacy benefits to all associates following the merger close. As union membership continues to decline nationwide, especially in the grocery industry, this merger is the best way to secure union jobs. Kroger has added more than 100,000 good-paying union jobs since 2012. The proposed merger will allow the combined company to invest more deeply to end hunger in communities across America. In 2023, Kroger committed to donating 10 billion meals to families across the U.S. by 2030. Bringing these companies together provides one more step toward achieving communities that are free from hunger and food waste. The anticipated divestiture plan with C&S builds on the benefits of the merger and fulfills the commitments Kroger set out in its original merger agreement in October 2022. C&S Wholesale Grocers is an industry leader in wholesale grocery supply and supply chain solutions, with a strong track record as a successful grocery retailer. Kroger and Albertsons Cos. took considerable steps to position C&S to continue to successfully operate divested stores as part of its comprehensive plan. This includes providing C&S with strong teams, a cohesive network of stores supported by two regional headquarters, beloved banners and private label brands, and a robust operational infrastructure. In addition to ensuring no store closures as a result of the merger, the divestiture plan will extend a competitor to new geographies and will maintain all current collective bargaining agreements, which include industry-leading healthcare and pension benefits, bargained-for wages, and ensuring frontline associates remain employed. The merging parties look forward to litigating this action in court so we can deliver the benefits of this merger to communities across America - lower prices, more choices, and more good-paying union jobs for decades to come.

(TSXV: DBG) (OTCQB: DBLVF) (FSE: A1W038) (the ""Company or ""Doubleview"") is pleased to announce analyses from the final five Hat Property drill holes of the 2023 drill campaign. Drill holes H067 and H068 in the South Lisle Zone returned very significant intervals of copper and gold values that add important length and grade dimensions to the porphyry deposit. Drill holes H069 and H070, in the main Lisle zone, were strategically placed to verify and expand our exploration model and have increased the mineralization and shown near-surface continuation. The enhanced volume of mineralization will be reflected in the estimates included in the Maiden Resource Estimate (MRE) currently being prepared.The Hat Porphyry project is located in the prolific ""Golden Triangle"" of the Stikine mining district of northwestern British Columbia, Canada, and is in a territory that hosts several large base and precious metal deposits. In addition to copper and gold, the Hat Deposit contains several critical metals, including Cobalt, and Scandium. Mr. Farshad Shirvani, President and CEO, comments that ""The 2023 program of drilling comprised almost 11,000 metres of drilling that explored and extended the Lisle deposit to west, south and southwest, enabled new interpretation of the deposit orientation and model, and revealed a new gold-silver-cobalt-rich area. Several previously unconnected mineral zones were joined and over-all dimensions were increased. A 4 meter section of hole H067 returned a remarkable 6.94% copper and 8.29 g/t gold (11.27% Cu Eq[-Sc] ""Cu Eq calculated excluding Sc content""). Data for the Maiden Resource Estimate (MRE) were compiled and forwarded to an outside, arm's length, consultant.

The Hat deposit is one of a small number of North American deposits that potentially contains significant amounts of scandium: Scandium is utilized in various industries due to its unique properties, especially when alloyed with aluminum. Applications take advantage of scandium's ability to enhance the strength, durability, and thermal resistance of aluminum, making the resultant alloy ideal for aerospace, military, and automotive industries. Additionally, scandium finds applications in the manufacturing of solid oxide fuel cells, where it serves as a critical component due to its electrical conductivity and heat resistance. These fuel cells are used in power generation with high efficiency and low emissions. Other industries that benefit from the use of scandium include lighting, electronics, and 3D printing, leveraging its capacity to improve the performance of materials and components within these sectors.Quality Assurance and Quality Control:Core samples were prepared at the North Vancouver facility of ALS Canada Ltd. using their PREP-31, PGM-ICP24, ME-MS61, and ME-ICP06 packages.

The $47.5 million cash acquisition accelerates Lendway's growth strategy, with Tulp 24.1, LLC now holding an 81.4% interest in Bloomia. The deal was financed through a mix of credit facilities and bridge loans. Lendway aims for significant value creation for stockholders and plans to explore further growth opportunities in related industries. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The acquisition of Bloomia B.V. by Lendway, Inc. represents a strategic expansion that could potentially enhance Lendway's growth trajectory and diversify its revenue streams. The transaction, valued at approximately $47.5 million, allows Lendway to integrate Bloomia's established market presence and operational expertise within the specialty agriculture sector. Notably, the financing structure involving a new credit facility and bridge loans indicates a leveraged buyout, which could impact Lendway's balance sheet and financial leverage ratios.Investors should closely monitor the post-acquisition integration process, as successful mergers can lead to synergies and improved financial performance. However, they also come with integration risks that could disrupt operations. The management's ability to effectively merge Bloomia's operations with Lendway's existing business model will be crucial in realizing the anticipated value creation for shareholders. Additionally, the acquisition price should be evaluated against Bloomia's earnings and growth potential to assess whether the investment could yield a favorable return on capital. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of a major tulip producer positions Lendway within a niche market, which could offer a competitive edge in the specialty agribusiness sector. The fresh cut flower industry, while subject to seasonal and economic fluctuations, has a consistent consumer demand, particularly in the United States. Lendway's strategic partnerships and Bloomia's existing relationships with U.S. retailers could provide a robust distribution network, enhancing market penetration and brand recognition.The long-term growth potential in the specialty agriculture sector hinges on consumer trends and preferences. As such, market research into evolving consumer behaviors towards floral products will be pivotal in guiding Lendway's product offerings and marketing strategies. The company's ability to capitalize on Bloomia's brand and operational efficiencies could lead to increased market share and potentially influence stock performance positively if executed well. Agriculture Industry Expert Lendway's acquisition of Bloomia underscores a strategic move into the specialty agriculture domain, specifically the fresh cut tulip market. Bloomia's operational presence in the United States, Netherlands, South Africa and through a partnership in Chile, suggests a robust supply chain and access to key markets for fresh tulips. The vertical integration of Bloomia's production capabilities with Lendway's financial expertise may offer significant operational efficiencies and cost savings.However, the agriculture industry is highly susceptible to external factors such as climate change, trade policies and consumer preferences. The success of this acquisition will depend on Lendway's ability to navigate these challenges and leverage Bloomia's innovative spirit and global perspective. Stakeholders should consider the implications of agricultural technology advancements, sustainable practices and regulatory changes on Lendway's expanded operations. 02/26/2024 - 09:15 AM Transaction Broadens Lendway's Mission to Be a Specialty Ag and Finance CompanyMinneapolis, MN / ACCESSWIRE / February 26, 2024 / Lendway, Inc.

Supply Chain Management Expert The adoption of AI-first Logility® Digital Supply Chain Platform by U.S. Autoforce represents a strategic move to bolster their supply chain capabilities in response to their aggressive expansion. Advanced features such as Demand Optimization and Inventory Planning are crucial for managing the increased complexity that comes with scaling up to 2.5 million database records and beyond.

Company issues targeted ongoing run rate cash unit operating cost guidance. Investors invited to participate in presentation. New slide deck released. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Understanding the cost structure of Sigma Lithium's operations is crucial for assessing the company's competitiveness in the lithium market. The provided cash unit operating costs offer a glimpse into the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of their production process. A cost of $370/tonne at the plant gate is particularly significant as it represents the direct costs associated with producing the lithium concentrate before additional logistics costs are factored in.Comparing these figures to industry averages can shed light on Sigma Lithium's position in the market. For instance, if the reported costs are significantly lower than those of their competitors, it could indicate a competitive advantage that may lead to higher profit margins and an improved market share. Conversely, if the costs are higher, it could suggest challenges that the company might face in maintaining profitability, especially in a commoditized market where price competition is fierce.Furthermore, the FOB (Free On Board) Vitoria cost of $420/tonne and the CIF (Cost, Insurance and Freight) China cost of $510/tonne provide insights into the logistical expenses and the final cost to the customer, respectively. These metrics are essential for investors to understand the end-to-end cost efficiency of Sigma Lithium's supply chain. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the guidance on cash unit operating costs is a valuable indicator for forecasting Sigma Lithium's future margins and profitability. The costs directly impact the gross margin and, consequently, the bottom line. Investors will monitor these costs closely as fluctuations can significantly affect earnings.It is also important to consider the context of the lithium market. With the growing demand for electric vehicles, the demand for lithium is expected to rise. If Sigma Lithium can maintain or reduce production costs, it may benefit from the expanding market while protecting its margins. However, investors should also be aware of the volatility in commodity prices and how that may impact the cost structure in the long term.Lastly, the transparency in providing such detailed cost guidance can be seen as a positive sign of management's confidence in their operational efficiency and cost control measures. This level of disclosure can help build investor trust and potentially lead to a more favorable view of the company's stock. Sustainability Analyst Given the increasing importance of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in investment decisions, Sigma Lithium's emphasis on producing carbon-neutral, socially and environmentally sustainable lithium concentrate is noteworthy. Investors with a focus on sustainable practices may find the company's commitment to ESG principles aligns with their investment criteria.However, it is essential to critically assess the tangible impact of these initiatives. The company's ability to produce lithium at competitive costs while adhering to stringent sustainability standards could set a benchmark in the industry and potentially attract investment from ESG-focused funds. On the other hand, the costs associated with maintaining such standards should not be overlooked, as they could affect the overall cost competitiveness of the company.Analyzing the long-term sustainability of Sigma Lithium's operations is essential, especially considering the finite nature of lithium reserves and the environmental impact of mining activities. The company's approach to sustainability could influence its reputation and market position in an industry facing increasing regulatory and consumer scrutiny. 02/26/2024 - 09:21 AM HIGHLIGHTS Sigma Lithium CEO Ana Cabral-Gardner to present at the 2024 BMO Global Metals, Mining & Critical Minerals Conference, followed by a fireside Q&A with leading BMO research analyst Joel JacksonCompany is issuing pro forma ""targeted ongoing run rate"" cash unit operating cost guidance as follows:$370/tonne at Plant Gate$420/tonne FOB Vitoria$510/tonne CIF ChinaSigma Lithium would like to invite investors to please kindly contact your BMO representative to participate in the presentation in person or remotely.SÃO PAULO, Feb. 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Sigma Lithium Corporation (""Sigma Lithium"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: SGML, BVMF: S2GM34, TSXV: SGML), a leading global lithium producer dedicated to powering the next generation of electric vehicles with carbon neutral, socially and environmentally sustainable lithium concentrate, announced today that Company Co-Chairperson and CEO Ana Cabral-Gardner is scheduled to present at the BMO Global Metals, Mining & Critical Minerals Conference on Tuesday, February 27, 2024, at 11:15 am ET.

Positive None. Negative None. 02/26/2024 - 10:30 AM NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / February 26, 2024 / This new feature in the Logitech MX #WomenWhoMaster series brings together two exceptionally creative leaders in technology who have a lot to say about passion and creativity in the industry. Marija Musja is the founder and CEO of Empowerment Lab, a start-up based in Switzerland that connects girls to tech skills and careers via their personal passions. Nikita Washington is a senior UX designer and public speaker from New York City who says that if technology is calling your name, you should answer, even if - or especially if - you come from a non-traditional background.But here's the thing: neither started their careers in technology. They never majored in math, engineering or computer science, and neither came up through the standard routes to leadership in tech. Marija worked in non-profits and Nikita was a high school teacher. But both were struck by the many empowering opportunities that technology could open up, in their lives and in the lives of young girls and women. As Nikita says, their paths to tech careers included a lot of zigs and zags. But passion kept them on course.Q: How do you get young girls passionate about technology?MM: The key to getting girls really excited about the digital world is to appeal to their personal creativity. Our process begins with a fun, science-backed matching quiz that helps girls identify their passions - maybe they're super-interested in telling stories or they want to work with marine mammals or manage a retail store.Then our app reveals a number of amazing tech-related careers that connect to these interests. The girls are offered a range of online courses that let them try out relevant digital skills. They start to see connections between these tech skills and what they're passionate about, and this draws them in.Q: You've gone on to create a start-up company, Empowerment Lab. What inspired you to take this big jump, and what's it been like?MM: The girls I met just didn't see any link between their lives and having a career in digital tech. But I was convinced that if they knew the options and could experiment with different tools, they'd find opportunities that resonated with their own passions. And that conviction fueled me - it drove me to launch Empowerment Lab.Building this organization and being able to bring my own ideas to life is one of the most rewarding experiences imaginable. I've learned that if you have a vision for something new, trust yourself because no one knows better what you can build!""By sparking girls' interests in tech-related careers, we're creating a world of fulfilled and passionate professionals.""Similarly, our conversation with Nikita Washington reveals how drive and passion led her to pivot from education to design as a Black woman of Trans experience.Q: How did you come to technology? Was it something that interested you as a child?Nikita Washington: No, I wanted to be a teacher. I was the kind of kid who had lots of imaginary friends so I'd collect old textbooks and teach my imaginary students reading, math, history, all of that good stuff!I got a BA and an MA in education and taught for 10 years, but I kept getting drawn to edtech - technology was calling my name! I finally looked at all the different types of jobs in technology and discovered that UX Design was a great fit because it was creative. I ended up pursuing a certification with the bootcamp Design Lab and then was hired by Ally Financial as a Senior UX Designer.""There are so many different routes to a career in technology and people get there in their own unique way - there's no one right path.""Q: You also are a leader with the non-profit organization Out in Tech. Why was this important to you and your work?NW: Out in Tech is the largest international LGBTQ+ organization in tech, with over 45,000 members, and I'm the lead on the Trans, non-binary, gender nonconforming channel. As a Black Trans woman and a former educator, I'm passionate about sharing my story and showing people that it's very possible to pivot into technology, regardless of who you are or where you come from.Marija and Nikita each discovered the power of technology to open new opportunities and change lives. Now, the former lawyer and the ex-teacher aim to spark those same opportunities in the lives of young women who, like them, never dreamed of a career in technology. Their goal, in Marija's words, is to build a world of fulfilled and passionate professionals. Because no matter where you start, passion and creativity can guide you on the path to success.To read the full interview with Marija and Nikita, please click here to learn more.Connect with Marija on LinkedIn and Twitter to learn more about her work connecting young girls to technology at Empowerment Lab. And you can connect with Nikita on LinkedIn or visit her website to learn more about how she pivoted from education to tech as a Black Trans woman.Women Who Master puts a spotlight on women who have made outstanding contributions to STEM fields. The goal of the series is to celebrate those contributions, inspire future leaders, and help close the gender gap in technology.

(NYSE: MUX), announces assay results from the 2022-2023 season, highlighting significant copper grades. The company is fully funded for the current drilling campaign, seeking additional funding for feasibility engineering. The Los Azules project progresses towards a feasibility study by Q1 2025, with a record-setting drill season underway. Positive None. Negative None. Geologist The assay results reported by McEwen Copper Inc. are indicative of significant mineralization, particularly within the Enriched zone of the Los Azules project. The continuity and extension of mineralization are critical factors that can influence the project's economic viability. The reported grades, such as 0.63% Cu over 446 meters, are substantial considering the average grade of copper deposits globally, which often hover below 0.5% Cu. The distinction between Enriched and Primary zones is important, as enriched deposits are typically formed closer to the surface and can be less expensive to mine due to the higher copper concentrations and reduced overburden removal.The technical aspects of the drilling campaign and the subsequent resource categorization from Inferred to Indicated suggest a maturing project that may soon reach a stage where a decision on mining feasibility can be made. The investment by Nuton and Stellantis underscores the project's potential and the strategic importance of copper as a critical mineral in the global transition to greener technologies. The geological data should be considered in the context of the Feasibility Study, which will provide a more detailed economic analysis of the project. Market Analyst From a market perspective, the reported drilling results by McEwen Copper Inc. represent a positive development for the company and its stakeholders. The increase in Measured and Indicated resources can lead to a revaluation of the company's assets and potentially attract further investment. The timing of these results aligns with a growing demand for copper, fueled by its essential role in electric vehicles, renewable energy infrastructure and other green technologies.Investors should note that the project is still in the exploration and pre-feasibility stage and thus carries the inherent risks associated with mining investments, including commodity price fluctuations and operational risks. However, the involvement of a Rio Tinto venture and Stellantis, combined with the positive political climate in Argentina towards mining, could mitigate some of these risks. The market will likely monitor the progress towards the Feasibility Study closely, as it will provide a clearer picture of the project's financial and operational parameters. Financial Analyst Examining the financial implications, the assay results may have a positive impact on McEwen Mining Inc.'s stock valuation, as the parent company of McEwen Copper Inc. The confirmation of high-grade copper over significant intervals enhances the Los Azules project's prospects and could lead to future revenue growth. Investors should consider the project's stage and the capital required to reach production when evaluating the company's financial health and future cash flow projections.The investments by Nuton and Stellantis not only provide necessary capital for the ongoing drilling campaign but also validate the project's potential. However, the search for additional funding for feasibility-level engineering and pre-construction work indicates that McEwen Copper Inc. will likely incur more expenses before reaching production. Long-term investors might be drawn to the project's growth potential, while short-term investors could be wary of the time required to realize returns. 02/26/2024 - 10:00 AM Remaining assays from the 2022-2023 season, highlights include: 446 m of 0.63% Cu, including 76 m of 0.92% Cu (AZ23228MET) TORONTO, Feb. 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- McEwen Copper Inc., 47.7% owned by McEwen Mining Inc. (NYSE: MUX) (TSX: MUX) is pleased to announce assay results from the final unreleased drill holes of the last season (2022-2023). The results from this period not only validate previous drilling results but also confirm the continuity of mineralization and extend the mineralization. Selected Highlights: Hole AZ23205MET returned 257 m of 0.76% Cu within the Enriched zone.Hole AZ23228MET returned 446 m of 0.63% Cu in the Enriched zone, including 76 m of 0.92% Cu.Hole AZ23230MET returned 250 m of 0.68% Cu in the Enriched zone, including 192 m of 0.83% Cu. The objective of the 2022-2023 drilling campaign was to collect information needed as the project advances towards the completion of a Feasibility Study in Q1 2025. Work continues during this field season (2023-2024) and includes resource drilling that will convert the initial 5-year pit resources to Measured and Indicated categories and will further upgrade resources from Inferred to Indicated. In addition to resource drilling, geotechnical, metallurgical, hydrogeological, exploration, and condemnation drilling are also being performed. With the closing in October 2023 of a US$10.0 million investment by Nuton, a Rio Tinto venture, and the ARS $42 billion investment by Stellantis, the Los Azules Project is fully funded for the 2023-2024 drilling campaign. McEwen Copper is currently seeking funding to support feasibility-level engineering and pre-construction work. Another record-setting drill season is underway at Los Azules with over 62,000 meters of drilling, of which 43,000 meters have been completed to date. “Argentina’s new president is taking important initiatives to unlock the country’s potential to become a significant supplier of critical minerals to the world, to combat climate change and at the same time strengthening the economy,” said Rob McEwen, Chairman and Chief Owner. “McEwen Copper’s Los Azules project is progressing at light speed towards completing a feasibility study by Q1 2025 and it has already delivered significant economic benefits to the neighbouring communities. It is a very large copper resource, where recent exploration drilling suggests it definitely has room to grow,” said Michael Meding, Vice President and General Manager of McEwen Copper.

The Enriched mineral zone refers to a copper deposit enriched by precipitation-derived water circulation that carries copper minerals downward through the rocks to accumulate in a thick, often horizontal “blanket”. Immediately above the Enriched zone is the Leached zone, from which copper was removed and transported. Weathering and oxidation often contribute to this process. Below the Enriched zone, the Primary (or Hypogene) zone is formed by ascending copper-rich thermal fluids, originating from a much deeper magmatic source. The green line indicates the pit floor of the 30-year pit shell from the 2023 NI 43-101 Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA). Figure 1 presents a plan view of the location of three sections and the holes reported. Adjacent cross sections are located 50 m apart from each other, starting with the lowest numbered section at the south end of the deposit and progressing to the north. Figure 1 – Plan View Location of Cross-sections and Drill Holes in the Deposit Figure 2 displays an intercept of 446 m grading 0.63% Cu (AZ23228MET) and includes 76 m grading 0.92% Cu within the Enriched zone. This hole extends higher-grade mineralization further to the west within the Enriched zone. Figure 2 - Section 47 - Drilling, Mineralized Zones and 30-year PEA Pit (Looking North) Figure 3 highlights a 257 m interval grading 0.76% Cu (AZ23205MET). Both this hole and hole AZ23199MET (171 m grading 0.80% Cu) directly to the west confirm the continuity and grade of the Enriched zone on this section. Figure 3 - Section 31 - Drilling, Mineralized Zones and 30-year PEA Pit (Looking North) Figure 4 presents an intercept of 250.0 m of 0.68% Cu in hole AZ23230MET. This hole validates mineralization in the center of this section. Hole AZ23210MET displays an intercept of 242.0 m of 0.73% Cu and extends higher grade mineralization in the Enriched zone to the east. Hole GTK2316 contains an intercept of 225.1 m of 0.38% Cu. These three new holes validate the continuity and strength of mineralization on this section.

Notes to the Financial Statements As of December 31, 2022 and 2023 NOTE 2 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Accounting The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Management evaluates the estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, and believes that those estimates and assumptions are reasonable based upon information available to them. Cash Cash are stated at cost which approximates fair value. The Company deposits its cash with financial institutions that the management believes are of high credit quality. The Company’s cash consists primarily of cash deposited in U.S. dollar denominated investment accounts. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Pursuant to the accounting guidance for fair value measurements and its subsequent updates, fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The accounting guidance establishes a three- tier fair value hierarchy that requires the Company to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value. A financial instrument’s classification within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Three levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value: Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2—Inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; Level 3—Unobservable inputs based on the Company’s own assumption. Music Licensing, Inc. Notes to the Financial Statements As of December 31, 2022 and 2023 Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, control has been transferred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. In instances where final acceptance of the product Is specified by the customer, revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met. The Company’s primary source of revenue is the monthly licensing subscription fee. The Company applies the following five steps in order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its arrangements: Identify the contract with a customer.Identify the performance obligations in the contract.Determine the transaction price.Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract, andRecognize revenue as the performance obligation is satisfied. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Because tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations, significant judgment is required. As a result, the Company makes certain estimates and assumptions in (i) calculating its income tax expense, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, (ii) determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets and (iii) evaluating the amount of unrecognized tax benefits, as well as the interest and penalties related to such uncertain tax positions. The Company’s estimates and assumptions may differ significantly from tax benefits ultimately realized. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740), which amends the existing guidance relating to the accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 is intended to simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles of accounting for income taxes and to improve the consistent application of GAAP for other areas of accounting for income taxes by clarifying and amending existing guidance. NOTE 3: GOODWILL ASC 350 defines goodwill as an intangible asset representing the excess of the purchase price of a business over the fair value of its identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. As a result of the acquisition of Pro Music Rights, Music Licensing issued 3,500,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, which on the execution date and net asset value of the pro music rights was $(50,601), which resulted in a goodwill valued at $3,550,601. The Goodwill shall be assessed for impairment regularly, and the management decided that no impairment of the goodwill is required as of December 31, 2023. Music Licensing, Inc. Notes to the Financial Statements As of December 31, 2022 and 2023 NOTE 4 – COPYWRITES, DOMAN NAMES AND ROYALTY STAKES The Company is the owner for the exclusive rights to use these copyrights and domain names as intangible assets. As such, these assets do have an indefinite life. The Company reviews the currently held intangible assets on an annual basis for impairment to determine if an adjustment is required. As the current intangible assets are working no impairment adjustment was considered necessary as of December 31, 2023.

The company addresses the need for advanced security models in the face of digitalization challenges. Positive None. Negative None. 02/26/2024 - 10:30 AM BEIJING, Feb. 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- WiMi Hologram Cloud Inc. (NASDAQ: WIMI) (""WiMi"" or the ""Company""), a leading global Hologram Augmented Reality (""AR"") Technology provider. As IoT applications continue to expand, traditional security models may not be able to meet the challenges of future digitalization needs. Enterprises are particularly concerned about user data privacy, recognizing that privacy breaches can have a huge impact on user trust and business reputation. Therefore, WiMi's model focuses on protecting the data privacy of transactions through Bitcoin and Ether blockchain technology to ensure that user data is adequately protected during network transmission. WiMi developed a blockchain-based transaction data security model for large-scale private networks. First, it is necessary to ensure that the communication between nodes is secure against threats such as attacks. Secondly, it is necessary to address the risk of privacy leakage that a large amount of user data may suffer when it is transmitted in the network. Most importantly, to realize all of this in an IoT architecture, one needs to take into account the possibility that nodes may not always be able to rely on each other for critical communications. WiMi utilized a combination of digital certificates, RSA-based public key infrastructure and blockchain technology. Digital certificates and public key infrastructure ensure the security of the communication channel, while blockchain technology is introduced to enhance data integrity and network node protection. This technology solution is designed to provide comprehensive privacy protection and security for large-scale private networks. The model is based on Bitcoin and Ether, utilizing mechanisms such as Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) to validate transactions and generate new blocks. This guarantees the legitimacy of transactions and the overall robustness of the network. The model ensures the integrity of the transaction data by referencing the immutability of Bitcoin. Each block contains a certain amount of transaction information, forming a coherent chain that prevents data tampering and forgery. The model introduces Ethernet's smart contract concept, which enables a more flexible and automated transaction process through smart contracts. The large-scale private network transaction data security model based on blockchain technology uses blockchain's peer-to-peer encrypted links to ensure the security of data transmission. Each node ensures the security of the encryption and decryption process of the communication channel through the use of Bitcoin and Ethereum cryptography. Through the distributed ledger mechanism of Bitcoin and Ether, the model ensures that each node has an identical, up-to-date copy of the ledger. This helps to ensure data consistency and traceability throughout the large private network. Through the combined use of Bitcoin's PoW mechanism and Ether's PoS mechanism, the model enables efficient verification of transactions and the generation of new blocks. This improves the resistance of the entire network to attacks and makes large private networks more secure and reliable. WiMi will continue to optimize and upgrade its large-scale private network transaction data privacy and security model as technology continues to evolve. The integration of emerging technologies, such as quantum security and more advanced encryption algorithms, will further enhance the security of the network. The model is not only applicable to specific industries, but is also expected to be a solution for building secure large-scale private networks across industries. From finance and healthcare to manufacturing and retail, secure large-scale private networks will play a key role in various fields. WiMi's blockchain technology will play a central role in the data privacy and security model for LPN transactions. By deeply integrating key technologies such as Bitcoin and Ether, the model fully utilizes the immutability of blockchain, the flexibility of smart contracts, and the trustworthiness of distributed ledgers. This integrated use provides an efficient, secure, and scalable technical framework for large-scale private networks, further advancing the development of blockchain technologies such as Bitcoin and Ether in practical applications.

Applauds Germany's Vote to Legalize Recreational Cannabis Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Flora Growth Corp. (FLGC) applauds the German parliament for legalizing recreational cannabis, making Germany the largest federally legal market. The decision benefits consumers and patients, with Flora's strategic partnership with TruHC Pharma GmbH positioning them well for growth. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The legalization of cannabis in Germany represents a significant shift in the European market landscape, with implications for consumer behavior and the competitive dynamics within the cannabis industry. As Germany is poised to become the largest federally legal recreational and medicinal cannabis market globally, companies like Flora Growth Corp. with an established presence and strategic partnerships are likely to experience a surge in demand.From a market research perspective, this development could lead to increased investment in cannabis-related research, product development and marketing strategies tailored to the German market. The anticipated regulatory changes could also influence market entry strategies for other companies looking to capitalize on this new opportunity, potentially leading to increased competition and market consolidation.It is important for stakeholders to monitor consumer preferences and regulatory developments closely, as these will be key determinants of market success. Additionally, the shift towards legalization may prompt changes in public perception and consumption habits, which could have downstream effects on adjacent industries such as pharmaceuticals, alcohol and tobacco. Financial Analyst The announcement by Flora Growth Corp. regarding the German parliament's decision to legalize cannabis is expected to have a profound financial impact on the company's revenue structure. With German revenues projected to constitute over 50% of Flora's consolidated revenues, this legislative change is likely to significantly affect the company's financial performance and valuation.Analyzing the potential increase in market share and revenue growth, it's crucial to consider the operational scalability and the company's ability to meet the rising demand while maintaining product quality and compliance with EU-GMP standards. Investors should also assess the risks associated with regulatory changes, competition and the execution of the company's business plan in this new legal framework.Furthermore, the diversification of Flora's revenue streams through international markets, like Germany, may offer a hedge against market volatility in other regions. The strategic partnership with TruHC positions Flora to navigate the complexities of the German market effectively and could be a catalyst for future international expansion. Legal Expert The legislative changes in Germany surrounding cannabis legalization carry significant legal implications for companies operating in this space. The declassification of cannabis as a narcotic and the easing of prescription requirements suggest a paradigm shift in the legal treatment of cannabis, which will necessitate a thorough understanding of the new regulatory framework for businesses like Flora Growth Corp.Companies will need to navigate the complexities of cultivation limits, possession regulations and the establishment of not-for-profit social clubs. Compliance with these regulations is critical to avoid legal repercussions and to ensure smooth operations. The EU-GMP certification held by Flora's partner, TruHC, underscores the importance of meeting high manufacturing and distribution standards, which are likely to become even more stringent as the market matures.Legal professionals will play a crucial role in advising businesses on how to adapt their operations to align with the new laws and in providing guidance on intellectual property, trade and investment opportunities that arise as a result of market expansion. 02/26/2024 - 09:00 AM Fort Lauderdale, Florida--(Newsfile Corp. - February 26, 2024) - Flora Growth Corp. (NASDAQ: FLGC) (""Flora"" or the ""Company""), a cannabis focused consumer-packaged goods leader and pharmaceutical distributor serving all 50 states and 28 countries with 20,000+ points of distribution around the world, applauds the German parliament for voting in favor of legalizing cannabis for recreation use. Flora's wholly-owned subsidiaries have been active in Germany since 2017, obtained the first medical cannabis license in Germany and are responsible for selling the first gram of medical cannabis in the country. The law passed by Olaf Scholz's ruling party coalition legalizes cultivating up to three plants for private consumption, the possession of 50 grams of cannabis at one time at home, and 25 grams in public. Possession and cultivation are expected to be permitted by April 1, 2024, and not-for-profit social clubs to begin operation on July 1, 2024. The German parliament has also voted to declassify cannabis as a narcotic, ease narcotic prescription requirements and make patient access easier. The decision makes Germany the largest federally legal recreational and medicinal cannabis market in the world. ""The decision marks a historic day for cannabis in Germany. The legalization of recreational cannabis in Europe's leading economy and the easing of access to medicinal cannabis will benefit consumers and patients tremendously. On behalf of Flora, we welcome Germany's decision and look forward to playing an important role in the process,"" said Clifford Starke, Chief Executive Officer.In August 2023, the Company announced a strategic partnership with TruHC Pharma GmbH (""TruHC""), a medical cannabis expert based in Hamburg, Germany, to grow market share in the country. TruHC holds an EU-GMP certification as an importer, distributor, and manufacturer of medical cannabis. TruHC's leadership has been pivotal in establishing Germany's medical cannabis landscape, including previously securing one of the first three cultivation licenses in the country. ""The reason for entering the strategic partnership with TruHC was to get organized and prepare for this day. We are now well positioned to execute on our plans,"" continued Mr. Starke. ""Our existing sales and distribution infrastructure in Germany is expected to provide us with an advantage as Germany's regulatory framework become more favorable to all stakeholders. Flora's German revenues are expected to be over 50% of consolidated revenues. With a clear political path towards legalization, we intend to adapt and execute on our business plan in the country,"" concluded Mr. Starke. ### About Flora Growth Corp.
