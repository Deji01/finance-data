That's why Kellanova is teaming up with Shaw's Supermarkets to donate $50,000 to No Kid Hungry to create #BetterDays for kids in Maine and make summer a time for them to grow, learn and thrive. When the last bell rings at the end of the school year, millions of children are cut off from the healthy meals they get each day at school. The need is especially acute in rural communities, where children may be far away from free summer meals served at schools, libraries and community centers. ""With 34 million people in America not knowing where their next meal will come from, the need to help feed and fulfill continues,"" said Meigan Goodwin, Customer Team Lead – Albertsons, at Kellanova. ""Through our Kellanova Better Days Promise, we're committed to feeding people in need, and we're proud to partner with Shaw's to support those facing hunger in communities around Maine."" No Kid Hungry is focused on school breakfast and summer meals that too often fail to reach the children who need them most. Since 2022, they've invested $128,000 grant funds to school districts and community groups across Maine to support a wide variety of projects that are driven and implemented by trusted local leaders and tailored to each community's needs. For example, in 2023, with the help from a No Kid Hungry grant, the Auburn-Lewiston YMCA summer camp was able to provide daily meals and snacks to the children attending, half of whom come from families facing food insecurity. ""Shaw's is proud to give back to the communities we serve in Maine,"" said Teresa Edington, Shaw's Spokesperson. ""We are dedicated to supporting programs aimed at hunger relief, enabling the children in our communities to live enriched and complete lives, made possible through the kind support of partners such as Kellanova.""

(NASDAQ: LFCR) (the “Company”) announced today that, on April 15, 2024, the Company received a notification letter (the “Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) indicating that, as a result of the Company’s delay in filing its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended February 25, 2024 (the “Q3 Form 10-Q”) and its continued delay in filing its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended August 27, 2023 and November 29, 2023 (the “Q1 Form 10-Q” and “Q2 Form 10-Q,” respectively, and together with the Q3 Form 10-Q, the “Filings”) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), the Company continues not to be in compliance with the requirements for continued listing under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) (the “Listing Rule”), and that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel would consider the delinquency in the filing of the Q3 Form 10-Q in rendering its determination regarding the Company’s continued listing on Nasdaq Global Select Market. The Notice has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. As previously disclosed, Nasdaq had previously granted the Company until February 12, 2024 to regain compliance with the Listing Rule, and, on February 13, 2024, the Company received the Staff Delisting Determination notifying the Company that Nasdaq has initiated a process which could result in the delisting of the Company’s securities from Nasdaq as a result of the Company not being in compliance with the Listing Rule. The Company appealed the Staff Delisting Determination, and, on April 16, 2024, the Company appeared for the hearing in which the Company requested a further stay of any suspension or delisting action to enable the Company to regain compliance with the Listing Rule. The Nasdaq Hearings Panel has not yet issued its decision, although the Company anticipates that a decision will be forthcoming. The Company continues to work diligently to complete the Filings and intends to file the Filings as promptly as possible to regain compliance under the Listing Rule. However, there can be no assurance that such periodic reports will be filed before the expiration of any stay granted by Nasdaq, or that the Nasdaq Hearing Panel will grant the Company’s request for a further stay of any suspension or delisting action This announcement is made in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(b), which requires prompt disclosure of receipt of a deficiency notification.

Momentum continues into the current second quarter, with outlook for another year of record growth in 2024. Management Commentary “2023 reflected a strategic transition in revenue mix to higher margin Overwatch cybersecurity recurring revenue,” stated High Wire CEO, Mark Porter. “In fact, Overwatch managed cybersecurity services recurring revenue increased 75% to $4.0 million for the year, with this upward trend continuing into the new year. “During the year, we completed the overhaul and virtualization of our Secure Voice Corp (SVC) telecom subsidiary to enable greater scale and provide resiliency in line with the best network practices. This also allowed us to pay off $5 million in debt. SVC is now generating positive cash flow, as its revenues have returned to growth in the fourth quarter. “For the first quarter of this year, we expect to report a 58% sequential revenue increase due to our retailer end-customers delaying some major upgrade projects until after the holiday season. This includes a $1 million IT project that is the first phase of a broader Wi-Fi upgrade program for a Fortune 200 department store chain we announced last August. It also includes a $5.3 million Wi-Fi upgrade project we announced a year ago for another nationwide retailer. “At the beginning of this year, we announced the launch of a major pilot project with a national wireless network operator for a large U.S. government agency. We see the launch of this project as a further indicator that the market for our tech enablement business is rebounding from last fall. “Our project delivery backlog is expanding even as we continue to recognize revenue at an increasing pace. We expect backlog to keep growing with our strong near-term sales funnel and newer strategic relationships starting to produce. “Earlier this month, we were awarded an additional fiber installation project for a national environmental solutions provider, that will bring the total value of the engagement to more than $2.8 million. As our first fiber deployment for this customer, we believe we were chosen for our years of experience in multi-site, nationally deployed managed services for hundreds of Fortune 500 companies and the largest government agencies. “Looking ahead, we anticipate our new cybersecurity offerings, such as our enhanced Managed Extended Detection and Response (MXDR) solution, will continue to ramp this year and drive continued expansion of our recurring revenue streams. Given the momentum and progress we’ve made with our revenue mix, broadening our channel reach and winning new recurring business, we expect to drive another year of record topline with positive adjusted EBITDA.” Full Year 2023 Financial Summary Revenue in full year of 2023 totaled $27.0 million, as compared to $26.8 million in 2022. The minor growth in revenue reflects the company’s strategic transition to higher margin Overwatch cybersecurity recurring revenue. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the company generated a monthly rate of more than $1.0 million in recurring revenue. Gross profit totaled $6.7 million or 24.8% of revenue in the full year as compared to $7.4 million or 27.8% of revenue in 2022. The decrease in gross profit in the full year of 2023 is due to the reduction in revenue for Secure Voice (VOIP) as the company retooled the Secure Voice platform to enable automation and set the company up for higher future margins. Total operating expenses increased to $40.0 million compared to $39.9 million in 2022. The increase was primarily due to a $2.2 million goodwill impairment charge and intangible asset impairment charge of $438,000 in 2023 as compared to none in 2022. The increased operating expenses was also due to increased general and administrative expenses of $1.5 million. The increase was also due to increased cost of revenue of $965,000 and increased depreciation and amortization of $30,000. The increase in operating expenses was partially offset by a decrease in salaries and wages expenses of $5.0 million. Net loss from continuing operations in the full year of 2023 totaled $13.1 million or $(0.06) per diluted share, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $11.3 million or $(0.16) per diluted share in 2022. The net loss from continuing operations for the full year of 2023 included non-cash stock-based compensation of $1.5 million; amortization of discounts on convertible debentures and loans payable of $1.1 million; depreciation and amortization of $844,000; and interest expense of $2.5 million.

Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments that can impact a company’s non-cash operating expenses, the company believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-cash and non-recurring expenses allows for meaningful comparisons between its core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing the company with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating its own core business operating results over different periods of time. The company’s adjusted EBITDA measure may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in its industry, as other companies in the company’s industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring, unusual items. The company’s adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or as an indication of operating performance or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. The company does not consider adjusted EBITDA to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results.

The table below indicates the ETNs that will be subject to the reverse split, their trading symbols, the applicable reverse split ratio, their current CUSIP numbers, and the CUSIP numbers that they will receive after giving effect to the reverse split: ETNs Ticker Symbol Reverse Split Ratio Current CUSIP / New CUSIP MicroSectorsTM U.S. Big Banks Index -3X Inverse Leveraged ETNs due March 25, 2039 BNKD 1-for-5 063679625 / 06367V501 MicroSectorsTM Gold Miners -3X Inverse Leveraged ETNs due June 29, 2040 GDXD 1-for-10 063679641 / 06367V600 Each reverse split will be effective at the open of trading on April 29, 2024. Each ETN will begin trading on the NYSE Arca on a reverse split-adjusted basis on that date. Holders of an ETN who purchased that ETN prior to April 29, 2024 will receive one reverse split-adjusted ETN for the applicable number of ETNs in accordance with the applicable reverse split ratio indicated in the table above In addition, investors that hold a number of ETNs that are not evenly divisible by the number indicated above will receive a cash payment for any fractional ETNs remaining (the ""partials""). The cash amount due on any partials will be determined on May 2, 2024 and will equal, for each remaining ETN, its closing indicative value on that date. Bank of Montreal will pay these amounts on or about May 7, 2024. The closing indicative value of each ETN on April 26, 2024 will be multiplied by the number indicated above to determine the applicable reverse split-adjusted closing indicative value. Following the reverse split, the ETNs will have a new CUSIP, as set forth above, but will continue to trade under their current ticker symbols. The reverse splits will affect the trading denominations of the ETNs, but they will not affect the aggregate principal amount of the ETNs, except that the aggregate principal amount will be reduced by the corresponding aggregate amount of any cash payments for the ""partials."" Illustration of a Reverse Split The following table shows the effect of a hypothetical 1-for-10 reverse split on the hypothetical closing indicative value of the ETNs.

Das Unternehmen plant, nach dieser Entscheidung strategische Alternativen zu erkunden. Positive None. Negative Resource constraints leading to wind-down of Phase 2 NASH trial Low probability of generating relevant efficacy data with current cash resources Transitioning patients out of the trial due to program wind-down Financial Analyst The announcement by Hepion Pharmaceuticals to cease the ASCEND-NASH trial is a pivot that warrants attention from a financial perspective. The company's decision is attributed to resource constraints, which highlights a critical liquidity situation. This development could indicate cash burn issues that are common in the biopharmaceutical sector but raise red flags for investors regarding the company's sustainability. The fact that they are exploring strategic alternatives suggests they might be looking at options such as partnerships, mergers, or asset sales, which could either dilute current shareholders' equity or potentially bring an infusion of capital if well-negotiated. Investors should closely monitor the management's next steps, as they will be pivotal for the company's future and the stock's performance. Medical Research Analyst From a scientific angle, halting the Phase 2b trial of rencofilstat in NASH patients is a setback not only for Hepion but also for the advancement of NASH treatments. The trial's cessation due to funding rather than efficacy or safety concerns does provide a silver lining that the investigational drug wasn't facing clinical issues. Nevertheless, this underscores the importance of adequate financial planning in clinical research. For the industry, this event may serve as a cue to reassess the economic models of drug development, especially for diseases like NASH, which has a significant unmet medical need yet is a complex and costly condition to tackle. 04/19/2024 - 04:30 PM EDISON, N.J., April 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hepion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:HEPA), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company that has been developing a treatment for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”), hepatocellular carcinoma (“HCC”), and other chronic liver diseases, today announced that it has begun wind-down activities in its ASCEND-NASH Trial, while continuing to explore strategic alternatives, as previously announced in December 2023. ASCEND-NASH is a Phase 2b, randomized, multi-center, double-blinded study with first patient screened in August 2022, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rencofilstat dosed for 12 months, with a target enrollment of 336 subjects. Enrollment was paused in April 2023, with 151 subjects randomized. To date, approximately 80 subjects have completed their Day 365 visits and are evaluable for both safety and efficacy. An additional 40 subjects will provide significant safety data for evaluation. These patients will be added to our existing safety database. “We are disappointed to announce the wind-down of our Phase 2 NASH trial, which we attribute entirely to resource constraints,” said John Brancaccio, Executive Chairman of Hepion. “The Company remains committed to its strategic alternative efforts previously announced in December 2023. Given the number of enrolled NASH patients to date and the low probability of generating relevant efficacy data to support a registrational trial with our current cash resources, we have opted to wind down the program and assure that patients are transitioned out of the trial in a safe and compliant manner. There were no safety concerns observed for rencofilstat in the ASCEND-NASH trial.” About Hepion Pharmaceuticals Rencofilstat, is a potent inhibitor of cyclophilins, which are involved in many disease processes. Rencofilstat has been shown to reduce liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma tumor burden in experimental disease models. In November 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) granted Fast Track designation for rencofilstat for the treatment of NASH. That was followed in June 2022 by the FDA’s granting of Orphan Drug designation to rencofilstat for the treatment of HCC. Hepion has created and maintains a proprietary Artificial Intelligence deep machine learning (“AI/ML”) platform designed to better understand disease processes and identify patients that are rencofilstat responders. This AI/ML has the potential to shorten development timelines and increase the observable differences between placebo and treatment groups. In addition, Hepion’s AI/ML can be used to further NASH and HCC clinical development programs and identify other potential therapeutic indications for cyclophilin inhibition with rencofilstat.

This decision aims to reduce expenses and allow the company to focus more on research and development efforts in pioneering new medicines for chronic diseases. Vaxxinity, Inc. ha annunciato la sua intenzione di ritirare volontariamente e deregistrare le sue azioni ordinarie di Classe A dal Mercato Globale Nasdaq a causa di problemi di conformità e basso valore di scambio. Questa decisione mira a ridurre le spese e permettere all'azienda di concentrarsi maggiormente sugli sforzi di ricerca e sviluppo nella creazione di nuovi farmaci per le malattie croniche. Vaxxinity, Inc. ha anunciado su intención de retirar y deslistar voluntariamente su acción común Clase A del Mercado Global Nasdaq debido a problemas de cumplimiento y bajo valor comercial. Esta decisión tiene como objetivo reducir gastos y permitir a la empresa concentrarse más en la investigación y desarrollo de medicamentos innovadores para enfermedades crónicas. Vaxxinity, Inc.는 규정 준수 문제와 낮은 거래 가치로 인해 나스닥 글로벌 마켓에서 자사의 클래스 A 보통주를 자발적으로 상장 폐지 및 등록 취소할 의사를 발표했습니다. 이 결정은 비용을 절감하고 회사가 만성 질환을 위한 새로운 의약품 개발에 더 집중할 수 있도록 하기 위함입니다. Vaxxinity, Inc. a annoncé son intention de retirer volontairement et de radier ses actions ordinaires de classe A du marché mondial Nasdaq en raison de problèmes de conformité et d'une faible valeur commerciale. Cette décision vise à réduire les dépenses et à permettre à l'entreprise de se concentrer davantage sur les efforts de recherche et développement dans l'élaboration de nouveaux médicaments pour les maladies chroniques. Vaxxinity, Inc. hat die Absicht bekannt gegeben, seine Stammaktien der Klasse A freiwillig von der Nasdaq Global Market aufgrund von Compliance-Problemen und geringem Handelswert delisten und deregistrieren zu lassen. Diese Entscheidung zielt darauf ab, Kosten zu senken und es dem Unternehmen zu ermöglichen, sich stärker auf Forschungs- und Entwicklungsarbeiten für die Entwicklung neuer Medikamente für chronische Krankheiten zu konzentrieren. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The decision by Vaxxinity to delist and deregister its Class A common stock is a significant financial maneuver with direct implications on shareholder value and market perception. The move often suggests an underlying pessimism about the stock's future performance or an admission that the costs and regulatory requirements of being a listed company outweigh the benefits. This is especially pertinent given the company's failure to comply with the Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement, which is a red flag for investors as it indicates a lack of market confidence and often precedes further decline in investor interest.For existing shareholders, the delisting could both limit liquidity, making it difficult to buy or sell shares and potentially erode the value of their investment. While the company highlights a shift in focus towards R&D endeavors, the immediate concern for investors would be the diminished transparency and reduced regulatory oversight that comes with delisting. Vaxxinity's plan to re-invest resources in research and development must be weighed against the potential loss of visibility and access to capital that comes with being a publicly traded entity. Market Research Analyst From the lens of market dynamics, Vaxxinity's announcement can influence investor sentiment towards the biotech sector, especially concerning liquidity and capital access for smaller cap companies. Delisting may raise questions about the viability of public markets for funding emerging biotech ventures, particularly those unable to meet exchange listing requirements. This could steer such companies towards alternative financing routes like private investments or strategic partnerships.Moreover, by withdrawing from the Nasdaq, Vaxxinity is sidestepping the public scrutiny that comes with regular SEC filings. While this may reduce administrative burdens, it also removes a layer of investor reassurance provided by mandatory disclosures. For potential investors, this could signal increased risk, as access to consistent information is a key factor in investment decisions. The ripple effect of the decision could influence how emerging biotech firms are perceived in terms of financial stability and operational transparency. Healthcare Industry Analyst Within the healthcare industry, the delisting of a company like Vaxxinity could be indicative of broader trends. The biotech industry is known for its high burn rates and long development cycles, which necessitate sustained capital infusions. A delisting could reflect an industry-wide shift as companies balance the need for capital against the burdens of public market compliance.However, this move to delist should be considered within the context of Vaxxinity's specific pipeline and strategic objectives. If the company has a robust set of assets in development that could bring substantial value in the long term, then reallocating resources away from the administrative overhead of a public listing could be a strategic recalibration. The potential benefit lies in accelerating the development of their therapies, which could, in turn, lead to significant market disruption if successful. Stakeholders should closely monitor the company's performance metrics and development milestones in the absence of public reporting requirements. 04/19/2024 - 04:27 PM CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., April 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vaxxinity, Inc. (“Vaxxinity”, “we”, “us” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: VAXX), a U.S. company pioneering the development of a new class of medicines, today announced its intention to voluntarily delist from the Nasdaq Global Market (“Nasdaq”) and to deregister its Class A common stock under Section 12(b) and Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and suspend its reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. On February 9, 2024, the Company received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC indicating that the Company was no longer in compliance with Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) with respect to its Class A common stock, which requires the Company to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share for continued listing on Nasdaq, and providing until August 7, 2024 to regain compliance. In determining to voluntarily delist and deregister its Class A common stock, the Company considered that the current low trading value, and the resulting low trading volume, limits the liquidity of the Company’s Class A common stock and affects the Company’s ability to raise capital from the public markets, attract interest from institutional investors or market analysts or otherwise realize the traditional benefits of being a publicly traded company. Despite the lack of these benefits, the Company incurs all of the significant annual expenses and indirect costs associated with being a public company. The Company believes the reduction in time and resources spent by management and employees to comply with the requirements applicable to Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) reporting companies will enable the Company to re-invest resources in research and development endeavors, focus more on its goal of pioneering a new class of medicines aimed at disrupting the existing treatment paradigm for chronic disease, and work to realize the Company’s long-term objectives, without the distraction of stock price movement. On April 19, 2024, the Company notified Nasdaq of its intent to voluntarily delist its Class A common stock from Nasdaq. The Company currently anticipates that it will file with the SEC a Form 25 relating to the delisting and deregistration of its Class A common stock on or about April 29, 2024, and anticipates that the delisting and deregistration under Section 12(b) of its Class A common stock will then become effective on or about May 9, 2024. Following the delisting, any trading in the Company’s Class A common stock would only occur in privately negotiated sales and potentially on an over-the-counter market. The Company expects that its Class A common stock will initially be quoted on a market operated by OTC Markets Group Inc. (the “OTC”) so that a trading market may continue to exist for its Class A common stock for some period of time. There is no guarantee, however, that a broker will continue to make a market in the Class A common stock and that trading of the Class A common stock will continue on an OTC market or otherwise. Following the delisting of its Class A common stock from Nasdaq, the Company plans to file with the SEC a Form 15 to deregister its Class A common stock under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and suspend its reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. About Vaxxinity, Inc. Vaxxinity, Inc. is a purpose-driven biotechnology company committed to democratizing healthcare across the globe. The company is pioneering a new class of synthetic, peptide-based active immunotherapy medicines aimed at disrupting the existing treatment paradigm for chronic disease, increasingly dominated by monoclonal antibodies, which suffer from prohibitive costs and cumbersome administration. The company’s proprietary technology platform has enabled the innovation of novel pipeline candidates designed to bring the efficiency of vaccines to the treatment of chronic diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, migraine, and hypercholesterolemia. The technology is also implemented as part of a COVID-19 vaccine program. Vaxxinity has optimized its pipeline to achieve a potentially historic, global impact on human health.

Positive Total deposits were $2.992 billion at March 31, 2024. Net interest margin was 2.50 percent for the first quarter of 2024. Total yield on interest-earning assets was 5.33 percent for the first quarter of 2024. The provision for credit losses was $2.1 million in the first quarter of 2024.

Asset quality saw $1.1 million in net charge-offs in the first quarter of 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported net income of $5.9 million represents a sequential quarter drop from $6.1 million and a year-over-year decline from $8.1 million. This trajectory suggests a tightening of margins likely influenced by the current macroeconomic factors, such as higher interest rates and potential softening of credit quality. The decrease in earnings per share (EPS) to $0.32 from $0.46 in the same quarter of the previous year highlights a reduction in profitability, potentially affecting shareholder returns.Furthermore, the net interest margin contraction to 2.50 percent, from 3.15 percent year-over-year, indicates an increasing cost of funds which may squeeze future net interest income. The rise in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities by 130 basis points year-over-year confirms this pressure. However, the efficiency ratio improvement to 58.8 percent signals a relative increase in operational efficiency, which could mitigate some margin pressures.Looking at asset quality, the rise in the provision for credit losses and non-accrual loans, coupled with a substantial drop in the allowance for credit losses to non-accrual loans ratio, raises concerns about potential future credit losses and merits close investor monitoring. The dividend declaration, despite these conditions, suggests confidence in the company's liquidity and capital management. Market Research Analyst Investors should consider the broader banking industry trends, particularly the impact of prolonged higher interest rates on community banks like BCB Bancorp. The stability of the company's deposit base, with a modest increase to $2.992 billion, is a positive sign in terms of customer confidence and funding stability. However, the decline in total loans receivable indicates a contraction in the bank's core business of lending.While the company has tactically adjusted its capital with the issuance of Series J Preferred Stock, an assessment of the company’s long-term strategy in terms of loan portfolio growth and asset quality management becomes critical. The increase in investments in commercial business loans may reflect a strategic pivot to higher-yielding assets, which could benefit the bank if credit quality is maintained. Risk Management Analyst The increased allowance for credit losses and higher proportion of non-accrual loans year-over-year are indicative of deteriorating asset quality. A comprehensive risk evaluation is necessary to assess the potential impact on future earnings. Investors should analyze how the bank's risk management strategies, including its ACL ratio above industry norms, can absorb potential credit losses without eroding capital positions.The bank's acknowledgment of a challenging macroeconomic environment and focus on balance sheet strength may be seen as preemptive measures to uphold credit quality. However, the reported figures demand vigilance, as the adequacy of the ACL should be continually reassessed against the backdrop of economic headwinds. 04/19/2024 - 04:15 PM BAYONNE, N.J., April 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BCB Bancorp, Inc.

Debt obligations increased by $138 thousand to $510.6 million at March 31, 2024 from $510.4 million at December 31, 2023.

The increase was attributable to the increase in retained earnings of $2.7 million, or 2.0 percent, to $138.6 million at March 31, 2024 from $135.9 million at December 31, 2023, and an increase in additional paid in capital preferred stock of $2.7 million, or 10.7% to $27.7 million at March 31, 2024, from $25.0 million at December 31, 2023, due to the Company’s previously announced issuance of shares of its Series J Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $2.7 million. First Quarter 2024 Income Statement Review Net income was $5.9 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024 and $8.1 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2023. The decline was primarily driven by lower net interest income, higher credit loss provisioning and higher non-interest expenses, which were partially offset by an increase in non-interest income for the first quarter of 2024 as compared with the first quarter of 2023. Net interest income decreased by $4.3 million, or 15.8 percent, to $23.1 million for the first quarter of 2024, from $27.5 million for the first quarter of 2023. The decrease in net interest income resulted from higher interest expense which was partially offset by higher interest income. Interest income increased by $6.9 million, or 16.4 percent, to $49.3 million for the first quarter of 2024 from $42.4 million for the first quarter of 2023. The average balance of interest-earning assets increased $216.1 million, or 6.2 percent, to $3.699 billion for the first quarter of 2024 from $3.483 billion for the first quarter of 2023, while the average yield increased 47 basis points to 5.33 percent for the first quarter of 2024 from 4.86 percent for the first quarter of 2023. Interest expense increased by $11.3 million to $26.1 million for the first quarter of 2024 from $14.9 million for the first quarter of 2023. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in the average rate on interest-bearing liabilities of 130 basis points to 3.54 percent for the first quarter of 2024 from 2.24 percent for the first quarter of 2023, while the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased by $296.5 million to $2.957 billion for the first quarter of 2024 from $2.661 billion for the first quarter of 2023. The net interest margin was 2.50 percent for the first quarter of 2024 compared to 3.15 percent for the first quarter of 2023. The decrease in the net interest margin compared to the first quarter of 2023 was the result of the increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities partially offset by the increase in the yield on interest-earning assets. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company recognized $1.1 million in net charge-offs compared to a $52 thousand net recoveries in the first quarter of 2023. The Bank had non-accrual loans totaling $22.2 million, or 0.68 percent of gross loans, at March 31, 2024 as compared to $18.8 million, or 0.57 percent of gross loans, at December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses on loans was $34.6 million, or 1.06 percent of gross loans, at March 31, 2024, and $33.6 million, or 1.01 percent of gross loans, at December 31, 2023. The provision for credit losses was $2.1 million for the first quarter of 2024 compared to $1.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. Management believes that the allowance for credit losses on loans was adequate at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Non-interest income increased by $3.8 million to $2.1 million for the first quarter of 2024 from a net loss of $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2023. The increase in total non-interest income was mainly related to an increase in gains on equity securities of $3.4 million and an increase in BOLI income of $254 thousand. Non-interest expense increased by $984 thousand, or 7.1 percent, to $14.8 million for the first quarter of 2024 from $13.9 million for the first quarter of 2023. The increase in these expenses for the first quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by higher regulatory assessment charges, and the increase in other expenses related to higher off-balance sheet reserves, in the first quarter of 2024 when compared with the first quarter of 2023. The income tax provision decreased by $765 thousand, or 23.7 percent, to $2.5 million for the first quarter of 2024 from $3.2 million for the first quarter of 2023. The consolidated effective tax rate was 29.6 percent for the first quarter of 2024 compared to 28.5 percent for the first quarter of 2023. Asset Quality During the first quarter of 2024, the Company recognized $1.1 million in net charge offs, compared to a net $52 thousand in recoveries for the first quarter of 2023. The Bank had non-accrual loans totaling $22.2 million, or 0.68 percent of gross loans, at March 31, 2024, as compared to $5.1 million, or 0.16 percent of gross loans, at March 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses was $34.6 million, or 1.06 percent of gross loans, at March 31, 2024, and $28.9 million, or 0.89 percent of gross loans, at March 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses was 155.4 percent of non-accrual loans at March 31, 2024, and 571.0 percent of non-accrual loans at March 31, 2023. About BCB Bancorp, Inc.

Pursuant to the share pledge agreement, the Company pledged to the Lender all of the issued and outstanding common shares of NV Gold Corporation (USA), Inc. (the ""NV Gold USA""), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, which holds the Company's mineral projects and lease agreements in the United States.Multilateral Instrument 61-101The issuance of the Loans and entering into of the share pledge agreement are each a ""related party transaction"" under Multilateral Instrument 61-101- Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (""MI 61-101"") as the Lender is an insider of the Company. The Company has relied on the exemptions from the valuation and minority shareholder approval requirements of MI 61-101 contained in sections 5.5(a) and 5.7(1)(f) of MI 61-101 on the basis that the transactions did not exceed 25% of the fair market value of the Company's market capitalization and the Loans are on reasonable commercial terms that are not less advantageous to the Company than if the Loans were obtained from a person dealing at arm's length with the Company. The Company did not file a material change report more than 21 days before the entering into of the share pledge agreement as the terms of the share pledge agreement were not settled until shortly prior to execution and the Company and the parties wished to close the share pledge agreement on an expedited basis for sound business reasons.Stock Option GrantEffective April 19, 2024 the Company granted an aggregate of 420,000 stock options to certain directors, officers and employees of the Company at a price of $0.29 per share for a period of five years. The options are subject to regulatory approval and are granted under the Company's stock option plan.About NV Gold CorporationNV Gold owns 100% interest in 21 mineral exploration projects in Nevada, USA, comprising 639 mining claims totalling 53.4 square kilometers (20.6 square miles).

The ex-dividend date is expected to be April 26, 2024. The per share rate is expected to be announced on April 24, 2024. The final distribution is attributable to the Fund’s remaining estimated accumulated earnings and profits, which are required to be distributed in connection with the previously approved merger. The Fund will make the distribution on the date listed above if any estimated accumulated earnings and profits remain. However, if no estimated accumulated earnings and profits remain, no distribution will be made. The distribution, if any, will be paid entirely in cash, with no option for dividend reinvestment. It is anticipated that, due to the tax treatment of cash distributions made by the publicly-traded master limited partnerships (""MLPs"") in which the Fund invests, a portion of the distribution the Fund may make to Common Shareholders may consist of a tax-deferred return of capital. The final determination of the source and tax status of all distributions paid in 2024 will be made after the end of 2024 and will be provided on Form 1099-DIV. The Fund is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that seeks a high level of after-tax total return with an emphasis on current distributions paid to shareholders. The Fund focuses on investing in MLPs and related public entities in the energy sector which the Fund's investment sub-advisor believes offer opportunities for income and growth. The Fund is treated as a regular corporation, or a ""C"" corporation, for United States federal income tax purposes and, as a result, is subject to corporate income tax to the extent the Fund recognizes taxable income. First Trust Advisors L.P. (""FTA"") is a federally registered investment advisor and serves as the Fund's investment advisor. FTA and its affiliate First Trust Portfolios L.P. (""FTP""), a FINRA registered broker-dealer, are privately-held companies that provide a variety of investment services. FTA has collective assets under management or supervision of approximately $226 billion as of March 28, 2024 through unit investment trusts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, mutual funds and separate managed accounts. FTA is the supervisor of the First Trust unit investment trusts, while FTP is the sponsor. FTP is also a distributor of mutual fund shares and exchange-traded fund creation units. FTA and FTP are based in Wheaton, Illinois. Energy Income Partners, LLC (""EIP"") serves as the Fund's investment sub-advisor and provides advisory services to a number of investment companies and partnerships for the purpose of investing in energy, utility and other energy infrastructure securities. EIP is one of the early investment advisors specializing in this area. As of March 31, 2024, EIP managed or supervised approximately $5.4 billion in client assets. Principal Risk Factors: Risks are inherent in all investing. Certain risks applicable to the Fund are identified below, which includes the risk that you could lose some or all of your investment in the Fund. The principal risks of investing in the Fund are spelled out in the Fund's annual shareholder reports. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor. The Fund also files reports, proxy statements and other information that is available for review. Past performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return and market value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. There can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. The Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. The Fund is subject to risks, including the fact that it is a non-diversified closed-end management investment company. Market risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of a fund in general may fall in value. Investments held by the Fund are subject to market fluctuations caused by real or perceived adverse economic conditions, political events, regulatory factors or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, market manipulation, government defaults, government shutdowns, regulatory actions, political changes, diplomatic developments, the imposition of sanctions and other similar measures, spread of infectious disease or other public health issues, recessions, natural disasters or other events could have significant negative impact on a fund and its investments. Current market conditions risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of the fund in general, may fall in value due to current market conditions. As a means to fight inflation, the Federal Reserve and certain foreign central banks have raised interest rates and expect to continue to do so, and the Federal Reserve has announced that it intends to reverse previously implemented quantitative easing. Recent and potential future bank failures could result in disruption to the broader banking industry or markets generally and reduce confidence in financial institutions and the economy as a whole, which may also heighten market volatility and reduce liquidity. Ongoing armed conflicts between Russia and Ukraine in Europe and among Israel, Hamas and other militant groups in the Middle East, have caused and could continue to cause significant market disruptions and volatility within the markets in Russia, Europe, the Middle East and the United States. The hostilities and sanctions resulting from those hostilities have and could continue to have a significant impact on certain fund investments as well as fund performance and liquidity. The COVID-19 global pandemic, or any future public health crisis, and the ensuing policies enacted by governments and central banks have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets, negatively impacting global growth prospects. Because the Fund is concentrated in securities issued by energy companies, energy sector MLPs and MLP-related entities, it will be more susceptible to adverse economic or regulatory occurrences affecting those industries, including high interest costs, high leverage costs, the effects of economic slowdown, surplus capacity, increased competition, uncertainties concerning the availability of fuel at reasonable prices, the effects of energy conservation policies and other factors. The Fund's use of derivatives may result in losses greater than if they had not been used, may require the fund to sell or purchase portfolio securities at inopportune times, may limit the amount of appreciation the Fund can realize on an investment, or may cause the fund to hold a security that it might otherwise sell. Investment in non-U.S. securities is subject to the risk of currency fluctuations and to economic and political risks associated with such foreign countries. Use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify the effect of any losses. The risks of investing in the fund are spelled out in the shareholder report and other regulatory filings. The information presented is not intended to constitute an investment recommendation for, or advice to, any specific person. By providing this information, First Trust is not undertaking to give advice in any fiduciary capacity within the meaning of ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code or any other regulatory framework. Financial professionals are responsible for evaluating investment risks independently and for exercising independent judgment in determining whether investments are appropriate for their clients.

Financial Analyst The recent public offering of Calidi Biotherapeutics signifies a strategic move by the company to bolster its working capital and advance its clinical-stage projects. The injection of $6.1 million in capital is a substantial amount for a biotech at this stage and can have a considerable impact on their R&D progress. However, potential investors should weigh the dilutive effect of increasing the share count by over 15 million shares. Additionally, the layered structure of warrants could potentially lead to further dilution or stock price pressure if and when they are exercised. With an exercise price of $0.60 per share, the warrants present an interesting future prospect; however, they also suggest that current shareholders value future growth prospects cautiously. It's imperative for investors to monitor how the company allocates these funds, particularly towards its pre-clinical and clinical trials, which are critical for future value creation. Biotech Market Analyst In the biotechnology sector, timely and successful completion of clinical trials is important for long-term sustainability and growth. Calidi Biotherapeutics' allocation of net proceeds toward clinical trials is a significant step in the right direction. For investors, understanding the therapeutic areas and the competitive landscape of Calidi's pipeline is essential. Given that biotech investments are inherently risk-laden due to the binary nature of clinical trial results, the company's strategy and execution in advancing their immunotherapy platform will be pivotal. Moreover, the repayment of certain debts helps streamline the company's financial health, potentially improving its investment attractiveness. However, investors should conduct a risk assessment considering the company's burn rate and the typical high costs associated with biotech R&D. 04/19/2024 - 04:05 PM SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Calidi Biotherapeutics, Inc. (NYSE American: CLDI or “Calidi”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing a new generation of targeted immunotherapies, today announced the closing of its previously announced public offering of 15,197,500 shares of common stock (or pre-funded warrants in lieu thereof) and accompanying Series A Common Warrants, Series B Unit Warrants, with each unit consisting of one share of common stock and a Series B-1 Common Warrant and Series C Unit Warrants, with each unit consisting of one share of common stock and a Series C-1 Common Warrant at an effective combined price of $0.40 per share and common warrants for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $6.1 million, before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses.

Negative None. Financial Analyst Smartsheet's initiation of a $150 million share repurchase program can be interpreted as a signal of self-confidence from the company's management, indicating they believe the stock is undervalued. From a financial perspective, this move is expected to help bolster the share price by reducing the supply of shares available in the open market. Additionally, it can positively affect earnings per share (EPS) figures by decreasing the number of shares outstanding, potentially leading to a more favorable valuation by investors.However, it's important to consider the opportunity cost of using cash for repurchases as opposed to other initiatives like research and development, acquisitions, or debt reduction. Investors should weigh the benefits of a possibly higher share price against the company's long-term growth prospects. The lack of a minimum purchase commitment and the discretionary nature of this program provide Smartsheet the flexibility to adjust their buyback strategy as market conditions change, which can be particularly valuable in periods of volatility. Market Research Analyst Looking at the broader market, share repurchase programs are often well-received by investors, as they can be viewed as a company returning value to shareholders. However, the effectiveness of such programs in creating long-term shareholder value is debated. It's important to note that the share repurchase announcement from Smartsheet comes at a time when tech stocks have experienced considerable price fluctuations.Assessing the industry context, if Smartsheet's competitors are engaging in similar buyback programs, this could indicate an industry trend where companies opt to improve shareholder returns in lieu of immediate growth opportunities. If Smartsheet's stock is indeed undervalued compared to its peers, the repurchase program could make it a more attractive investment. Nonetheless, shareholders should consider whether the buyback is the best use of capital, given the company's growth strategy and market positioning. 04/19/2024 - 04:05 PM BELLEVUE, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Smartsheet (NYSE: SMAR), the enterprise work management platform, today announced that its Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $150 million of the company’s outstanding Class A common stock through open market purchase, block trades, and/or in privately negotiated transactions or pursuant to 10b5-1 plans, in compliance with applicable securities laws and other legal requirements. The timing, manner, price, and amount of any repurchase will be subject to the discretion of the company’s management based on its evaluation of a variety of factors, including the market price of the company’s Class A common stock, general market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other business considerations. The program has no minimum purchase commitment and may extend over a period of approximately twelve months. The repurchase program does not obligate Smartsheet to acquire any particular amount of Class A common stock and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at Smartsheet’s discretion without prior notice.

(NYSE: EEA) (the “Fund”) announced today that the Annual Meeting of Stockholders for the Fund will be held at 10:30 a.m., Eastern time on June 27, 2024 at the offices of DWS Investment Management Americas, Inc., 875 Third Avenue, New York, New York 10022.

At the meeting, stockholders of the Fund will consider the election of Directors and approval of auditors.

Details of the proposal will be set forth in a proxy statement expected to be mailed to stockholders in May. Important Information The European Equity Fund, Inc. is diversified and primarily focuses its investments in equity securities of issuers domiciled in Europe, thereby increasing its vulnerability to developments in that region. Investing in foreign securities, particularly of emerging markets, presents certain risks, such as currency fluctuations, and risks of currency and capital controls, political and economic changes, and market risks. Any fund that concentrates in a particular segment of the market or a particular geographical region will generally be more volatile than a fund that invests more broadly. War, terrorism, sanctions, economic uncertainty, trade disputes, public health crises and related geopolitical events have led, and, in the future, may lead to significant disruptions in US and world economies and markets, which may lead to increased market volatility and may have significant adverse effects on the funds and their investments. The European Union, the United States and other countries have imposed sanctions on Russia in response to Russian military and other actions in recent years. These sanctions have adversely affected Russian individuals, issuers and the Russian economy. Russia, in turn, has imposed sanctions targeting Western individuals, businesses and products. The various sanctions have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, not only the Russian economy, but also the economies of many countries in Europe, including countries in Central and Eastern Europe. The continuation of current sanctions or the imposition of additional sanctions may materially adversely affect the value of the Funds’ portfolios. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one-time public offering and once issued, shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to net asset value. The price of the fund’s shares is determined by a number of factors, several of which are beyond the control of the fund. Therefore, the fund cannot predict whether its shares will trade at, below or above net asset value.

Reference is made to the Company’s Notification of Late Filing on Form 12b-25 (filed with the SEC on March 27, 2024) as amended through the filing of a Form 12b-25/A with the SEC on April 15, 2024, which describe the circumstances leading to the late filing of the Delinquent Report. Although the Company has dedicated significant resources to the completion of finalizing its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures for inclusion in the Delinquent Report, the Company was unable to file the Delinquent Report prior to April 16, 2024, the extension period provided by the 12b-25. Additional time is needed by the Company to complete its review of the financial statements included in the Delinquent Report to ensure a complete, accurate Delinquent Report. The Company intends to file the Delinquent Report as soon as practicable and in any event within the six-month period. In accordance with Section 1007 of the Company Guide, the Company will have six months from the date of the Filing Delinquency (the ""Initial Cure Period""), to file the Delinquent Report with the SEC.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, the Exchange may, in its sole discretion, decide (i) not to afford the Company any Initial Cure Period or Additional Cure Period, as the case may be, at all or (ii) at any time during the Initial Cure Period or Additional Cure Period, to truncate the Initial Cure Period or Additional Cure Period, as the case may be, and immediately commence suspension and delisting procedures if the Company is subject to delisting pursuant to any other provision of the Company Guide, including if the Exchange believes, in the its sole discretion, that continued listing and trading of the Company’s securities on the Exchange is inadvisable or unwarranted in accordance with Sections 1001 through 1006 thereof. The Company intends to regain compliance with the Exchange's continued listing standards. There can be no assurance that the Company will ultimately regain compliance with all applicable Exchange listing standards.

Financial Analyst Upon reviewing the recent financial performance of C&F Financial Corporation, it is evident that there has been a significant decrease in both net income and earnings per share (EPS) in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period last year. A decline from $6.5 million to $3.4 million in net income reflects a stark 47.3% reduction. Concurrently, EPS has almost halved from $1.86 to $1.01. The reported annualized return on average equity (ROAE) and return on average tangible common equity (ROATCE) also indicate a contraction, from 12.87% and 14.93% in the previous year to 6.33% and 7.30% respectively. Similarly, the annualized return on average assets (ROAA) has diminished from 1.10% to 0.57%. These metrics are essential as they provide insight into how effectively the company is utilizing its equity and assets to generate profits. Investors should consider the potential reasons behind such a downturn, which may include increased competition, rises in operating costs, or possibly decreased revenue streams. Additionally, these results might suggest a need to reevaluate the company's operational efficiency and cost-management strategies. While such a trend could be a cause for concern, it is important to analyze multiple quarters to discern whether this is part of a larger pattern or an anomaly specific to this quarter. Market Research Analyst Analyzing the financial results in the context of the market, one must consider the broader economic environment during this period. If the industry or the overall economy is facing headwinds, such as increased interest rates or inflationary pressures, this could explain the performance dip. In a challenging economic climate, banks and financial institutions often face thinner margins and higher credit costs. Furthermore, it's important to cross-reference these financial indicators with peer performance. If competitors are not experiencing similar declines, this might suggest that the issues are specific to C&F Financial Corporation's strategy or operations, rather than industry-wide phenomena. On the flip side, if the entire sector is trending downwards, it could be indicative of systemic issues affecting all market players. Investors should note that singular quarterly results do not always signify a long-term trend. However, the results can impact investor sentiment and the company's stock price in the short term. It's also important to consider any forward-looking statements or strategic plans the company might have disclosed that could address the downturn and potentially restore investor confidence. 04/19/2024 - 04:15 PM TOANO, Va., April 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- C&F Financial Corporation (the Corporation) (NASDAQ: CFFI), the holding company for C&F Bank, today reported consolidated net income of $3.4 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $6.5 million for the first quarter of 2023. The following table presents selected financial performance highlights for the periods indicated: For The Quarter Ended Consolidated Financial Highlights (unaudited) 3/31/2024 3/31/2023 Consolidated net income (000's) $3,435 $6,497 Earnings per share - basic and diluted $1.01 $1.86 Annualized return on average equity 6.33% 12.87%Annualized return on average tangible common equity1 7.30% 14.93%Annualized return on average assets 0.57% 1.10% ________________________1 For more information about these non-GAAP financial measures, which are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), please see “Use of Certain Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and “Reconciliation of Certain Non-GAAP Financial Measures,” below. “Our net income continues to be affected by increases in deposit costs resulting from both a change in mix of deposits and the overall higher interest rate environment,” commented Tom Cherry, President and Chief Executive Officer of C&F Financial Corporation. “While we believe there are signs that our cost of deposits is peaking, there continues to be pressure on our net interest margin. Regardless, we are pleased with several of our other balance sheet measures. Both loan and deposit growth were very good in the first quarter, and asset quality and capital remain strong as well. Despite the continued earnings headwinds we expect to face during 2024, we remain optimistic for our strategic opportunities for the remainder of 2024 and beyond.” Key highlights for the first quarter of 2024 are as follows. Community banking segment loans grew $67.7 million, or 21.3 percent annualized, and $143.3 million, or 12.0 percent, compared to December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively;Consumer finance segment loans grew $7.6 million, or 6.5 percent annualized, and $945,000, or less than 1 percent, compared to December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively;Deposits increased $21.8 million, or 4.2 percent annualized, and $92.1 million, or 4.6 percent, compared to December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively;Consolidated annualized net interest margin was 4.09 percent for the first quarter of 2024 compared to 4.52 percent for the first quarter of 2023 and 4.17 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023;The consumer finance segment recorded provision for credit losses of $3.0 million for the first quarter of 2024 compared to $1.6 million for the first quarter of 2023 and $2.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023;The consumer finance segment experienced net charge-offs at an annualized rate of 2.54 percent of average total loans for the first quarter of 2024 compared to 1.77 percent for the first quarter of 2023 and 2.72 percent for the fourth quarter of 2023;Mortgage banking segment loan originations were $94.3 million for the first quarter of 2024, a decrease of $21.5 million, or 18.5 percent, and $3.9 million, or 4.0 percent, compared to the first quarter of 2023 and the fourth quarter of 2023, respectively. Community Banking Segment. The community banking segment reported net income of $4.0 million for the first quarter of 2024 compared to $6.4 million for the same period in 2023 due primarily to: higher interest expense due primarily to higher rates on deposits and higher balances of interest-bearing deposits; andhigher salaries and employee benefits expense, which have generally increased in line with employment market conditions; partially offset by: higher interest income resulting from the effects of rising interest rates on asset yields and higher average balances of loans, offset in part by lower average balances of securities. Average loans increased $130.1 million, or 11.1 percent, for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due primarily to growth in the commercial real estate, construction, and residential mortgage segments of the loan portfolio. Average deposits increased $72.3 million, or 3.6 percent, for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Average deposits increased $31.8 million, or 6.3 percent annualized, for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Average loan yields and average costs of interest-bearing deposits were higher for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, due primarily to the effects of rising interest rates as market interest rates rose in 2023, and management expects both to continue to rise in 2024. The community banking segment’s nonaccrual loans were $550,000 at March 31, 2024 compared to $406,000 at December 31, 2023. The community banking segment recorded provision for credit losses of $500,000 and $450,000 for the first quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. At March 31, 2024, the allowance for credit losses increased to $16.6 million, compared to $16.1 million at December 31, 2023. The increases in provision and allowance for credit losses are due primarily to growth in the loan portfolio. Management believes that the level of the allowance for credit losses is adequate to reflect the net amount expected to be collected. Mortgage Banking Segment. The mortgage banking segment reported net income of $294,000 for the first quarter of 2024 compared to $227,000 for same period in 2023 due primarily to: higher reversal of provision for indemnifications;lower variable expenses tied to mortgage loan origination volume such as commissions and bonuses, reported in salaries and employee benefits, as well as mortgage banking loan processing expenses and data processing expenses; andlower salaries and employee benefits, occupancy expense and other expenses due to an effort to reduce overhead costs as mortgage loan origination volume has decreased; partially offset by: lower volume of mortgage loan originations. The sustained elevated level of mortgage interest rates, combined with higher home prices and lower levels of inventory, has led to a substantial decline in mortgage loan originations for the mortgage industry during 2024 and 2023. Mortgage loan originations for the mortgage banking segment were $94.3 million for the first quarter of 2024, comprised of $7.5 million refinancings and $86.8 million home purchases, compared to $115.8 million, comprised of $14.0 million refinancings and $101.8 million home purchases, for same period in 2023. Mortgage loan originations in the first quarter of 2024 decreased $3.9 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 due to normal industry seasonal fluctuations, low level of inventory, and the current mortgage interest rate environment. During the first quarter of 2024, the mortgage banking segment recorded a reversal of provision for indemnification losses of $140,000 compared to no provision for indemnification losses in the same period of 2023. The mortgage banking segment increased reserves for indemnification losses during 2020 based on widespread forbearance on mortgage loans and economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The release of indemnification reserves in 2024 was due primarily to improvement in the mortgage banking segment’s assessment of borrower payment performance and other factors affecting expected losses on mortgage loans sold in the secondary market, such as time since origination. Management believes that the indemnification reserve is sufficient to absorb losses related to loans that have been sold in the secondary market. Consumer Finance Segment. The consumer finance segment reported a net loss of $63,000 for the first quarter of 2024 compared to net income of $509,000 for the same period in 2023 due primarily to: higher provision for credit losses due primarily to increased net charge-offs; andhigher interest expense on variable rate borrowings from the community banking segment as a result of increased market interest rates; partially offset by: higher interest income resulting from the effects of rising interest rates on loan yields. Average loans decreased $1.4 million, or less than 1 percent, for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The consumer finance segment experienced net charge-offs at an annualized rate of 2.54 percent of average total loans for the first quarter of 2024 compared to 1.77 percent for the first quarter of 2023 due primarily to an increase in the number of delinquent loans and repossessions, which coupled with a decline in wholesale values of used automobiles, results in an increased charge-off amount on a per-unit basis. At March 31, 2024, total delinquent loans as a percentage of total loans was 2.78 percent compared to 4.09 percent at December 31, 2023 and 2.33 percent at March 31, 2023. Delinquency and loss rates have returned to pre-pandemic levels due to the passage of time since the expiration of stimulus and enhanced unemployment benefits that benefitted borrowers. The consumer finance segment, at times, offers payment deferrals as a portfolio management technique to achieve higher ultimate cash collections on select loan accounts. A significant reliance on deferrals as a means of managing collections may result in a lengthening of the loss confirmation period, which would increase expectations of credit losses inherent in the portfolio. The average amounts deferred on a monthly basis during the first quarter of 2024 were 1.62 percent of average automobile loans outstanding compared to 2.02 percent during the fourth quarter of 2023 and 1.60 percent during the first quarter of 2023. The allowance for credit losses was $23.6 million at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans decreased to 4.95 percent at March 31, 2024 from 5.03 percent and 5.45 percent at December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively, primarily as a result of growth in loans with stronger credit quality while balances of loans with lower credit quality declined. Management believes that the level of the allowance for credit losses is adequate to reflect the net amount expected to be collected. If loan performance deteriorates resulting in continued elevated delinquencies or net charge-offs, the provision for credit losses may increase in future periods. Liquidity. The objective of the Corporation’s liquidity management is to ensure the continuous availability of funds to satisfy the credit needs of our customers and the demands of our depositors, creditors and investors. Uninsured deposits represent an estimate of amounts above the FDIC insurance coverage limit of $250,000. As of March 31, 2024, the Corporation’s uninsured deposits were approximately $560.3 million, or 26.8 percent of total deposits. Excluding intercompany cash holdings and municipal deposits, which are secured with pledged securities, amounts uninsured were approximately $408.3 million, or 19.6 percent of total deposits as of March 31, 2024. The Corporation’s liquid assets, which include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits at other banks and nonpledged securities available for sale, were $298.5 million and borrowing availability was $573.8 million as of March 31, 2024, which in total exceed uninsured deposits, excluding intercompany cash holdings and secured municipal deposits, by $464.0 million as of March 31, 2024. In addition to deposits, the Corporation utilizes short-term and long-term borrowings as sources of funds. Short-term borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank and the Federal Home loan Bank of Atlanta (FHLB) may be used to fund the Corporation’s day-to-day operations. Short-term borrowings also include securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Total borrowings increased to $121.6 million at March 31, 2024 from $109.5 million at December 31, 2023 due primarily to higher borrowings from the FHLB. Borrowings decreased $79.4 million from $201.0 million at March 31, 2023. Additional sources of liquidity available to the Corporation include cash flows from operations, loan payments and payoffs, deposit growth, maturities, calls and sales of securities and the issuance of brokered certificates of deposit. Capital and Dividends. The Corporation declared a quarterly cash dividend for the first quarter of 2024 of $0.44 per share, which was paid on April 1, 2024. This dividend represents a payout ratio of 43.6 percent of earnings per share for the first quarter of 2024. The Board of Directors of the Corporation continually reviews the amount of cash dividends per share and the resulting dividend payout ratio in light of changes in economic conditions, current and future capital requirements, and expected future earnings. Total consolidated equity decreased $567,000 at March 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 due primarily to higher unrealized losses in the market value of securities available for sale, which are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income, share repurchases and dividends paid on the Corporation’s common stock, the significant majority of which was offset by net income. The Corporation’s securities available for sale are fixed income debt securities and their unrealized loss position is a result of rising market interest rates since they were purchased. The Corporation expects to recover its investments in debt securities through scheduled payments of principal and interest and unrealized losses are not expected to affect the earnings or regulatory capital of the Corporation or C&F Bank. The accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the Corporation’s securities available for sale increased to $27.1 million at March 31, 2024 compared to $25.0 million at December 31, 2023 due primarily to an increase in debt security market interest rates. As of March 31, 2024, the most recent notification from the FDIC categorized the C&F Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized under regulations applicable at March 31, 2024, C&F Bank was required to maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based, CET1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios. In addition to the regulatory risk-based capital requirements, C&F Bank must maintain a capital conservation buffer of additional capital of 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets as required by the Basel III capital rules. The Corporation and C&F Bank exceeded these ratios at March 31, 2024. For additional information, see “Capital Ratios” below. The above mentioned ratios are not impacted by unrealized losses on securities available for sale. In the event that all of these unrealized losses became realized into earnings, the Corporation and C&F Bank would both continue to exceed minimum capital requirements, including the capital conservation buffer, and be considered well capitalized. In December 2023, the Board of Directors authorized a program, effective January 1, 2024, to repurchase up to $10.0 million of the Corporation’s common stock through December 31, 2024. During the first quarter of 2024, the Corporation repurchased 9,654 shares, or $516,000, of its common stock under this share repurchase program. About C&F Financial Corporation.

Additional information regarding the Corporation’s products and services, as well as access to its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), are available on the Corporation’s website at http://www.cffc.com. Use of Certain Non-GAAP Financial Measures. The accounting and reporting policies of the Corporation conform to GAAP in the United States and prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, certain non-GAAP measures are used by management to supplement the evaluation of the Corporation’s performance. These include adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted return on average equity, adjusted return on average assets, return on average tangible common equity (ROTCE), adjusted ROTCE, tangible book value per share, price to tangible book value ratio, and the following fully-taxable equivalent (FTE) measures: interest income on loans-FTE, interest income on securities-FTE, total interest income-FTE and net interest income-FTE. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP measures provides meaningful information about operating performance by enhancing comparability with other financial periods, other financial institutions, and between different sources of interest income. The non-GAAP measures used by management enhance comparability by excluding the effects of balances of intangible assets, including goodwill, that vary significantly between institutions, and tax benefits that are not consistent across different opportunities for investment. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP-basis financial statements, and other bank holding companies may define or calculate these or similar measures differently. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures used by the Corporation to evaluate and measure the Corporation’s performance to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is presented below.

The ex-dividend date is expected to be April 26, 2024. The per share rate is expected to be announced on April 24, 2024. The distribution will be paid entirely in cash, with no option for dividend reinvestment. The Fund's Board of Trustees has approved a managed distribution policy for the Fund (the ""Plan"") in reliance on exemptive relief received from the Securities and Exchange Commission which permits the Fund to make periodic distributions of long-term capital gains as frequently as monthly each tax year. A portion of this monthly distribution may include long-term capital gains. This may result in a reduction of the long-term capital gain distribution necessary at year end by distributing long-term capital gains throughout the year. The annual distribution rate is independent of the Fund's performance during any particular period. Accordingly, you should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of any distribution or from the terms of the Plan. This distribution will consist of net investment income earned by the Fund and return of capital and may also consist of net short-term realized capital gains. The final determination of the source and tax status of all distributions paid in 2024 will be made after the end of 2024 and will be provided on Form 1099-DIV. The Fund is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that seeks to provide a high level of total return with an emphasis on current distributions paid to shareholders. The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objectives by investing primarily in securities of companies engaged in the energy infrastructure sector. These companies principally include publicly-traded master limited partnerships (“MLPs”) and limited liability companies taxed as partnerships, MLP affiliates, YieldCos, pipeline companies, utilities, and other companies that derive at least 50% of their revenues from operating or providing services in support of infrastructure assets such as pipelines, power transmission and petroleum and natural gas storage in the petroleum, natural gas and power generation industries (collectively, ""Energy Infrastructure Companies""). To generate additional income, the Fund expects to write (or sell) covered call options on up to 35% of the managed assets held in the Fund's portfolio. First Trust Advisors L.P. (""FTA"") is a federally registered investment advisor and serves as the Fund's investment advisor. FTA and its affiliate First Trust Portfolios L.P. (""FTP""), a FINRA registered broker-dealer, are privately-held companies that provide a variety of investment services. FTA has collective assets under management or supervision of approximately $226 billion as of March 28, 2024 through unit investment trusts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, mutual funds and separate managed accounts. FTA is the supervisor of the First Trust unit investment trusts, while FTP is the sponsor. FTP is also a distributor of mutual fund shares and exchange-traded fund creation units. FTA and FTP are based in Wheaton, Illinois. Energy Income Partners, LLC (""EIP"") serves as the Fund's investment sub-advisor and provides advisory services to a number of investment companies and partnerships for the purpose of investing in energy, utility and other energy infrastructure securities. EIP is one of the early investment advisors specializing in this area. As of March 31, 2024, EIP managed or supervised approximately $5.4 billion in client assets. Principal Risk Factors: Risks are inherent in all investing. Certain risks applicable to the Fund are identified below, which includes the risk that you could lose some or all of your investment in the Fund. The principal risks of investing in the Fund are spelled out in the Fund's annual shareholder reports. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor. The Fund also files reports, proxy statements and other information that is available for review. Past performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return and market value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. There can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. The Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. The Fund is subject to risks, including the fact that it is a non-diversified closed-end management investment company. Market risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of a fund in general may fall in value. Investments held by the Fund are subject to market fluctuations caused by real or perceived adverse economic conditions, political events, regulatory factors or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, market manipulation, government defaults, government shutdowns, regulatory actions, political changes, diplomatic developments, the imposition of sanctions and other similar measures, spread of infectious disease or other public health issues, recessions, natural disasters or other events could have significant negative impact on a fund and its investments. Current market conditions risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of the fund in general, may fall in value due to current market conditions. As a means to fight inflation, the Federal Reserve and certain foreign central banks have raised interest rates and expect to continue to do so, and the Federal Reserve has announced that it intends to reverse previously implemented quantitative easing. Recent and potential future bank failures could result in disruption to the broader banking industry or markets generally and reduce confidence in financial institutions and the economy as a whole, which may also heighten market volatility and reduce liquidity. Ongoing armed conflicts between Russia and Ukraine in Europe and among Israel, Hamas and other militant groups in the Middle East, have caused and could continue to cause significant market disruptions and volatility within the markets in Russia, Europe, the Middle East and the United States. The hostilities and sanctions resulting from those hostilities have and could continue to have a significant impact on certain fund investments as well as fund performance and liquidity. The COVID-19 global pandemic, or any future public health crisis, and the ensuing policies enacted by governments and central banks have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets, negatively impacting global growth prospects. Because the Fund is concentrated in securities issued by energy infrastructure companies, it will be more susceptible to adverse economic or regulatory occurrences affecting that industry, including high interest costs, high leverage costs, the effects of economic slowdown, surplus capacity, increased competition, uncertainties concerning the availability of fuel at reasonable prices, the effects of energy conservation policies and other factors. Investments in securities of MLPs involve certain risks different from or in addition to the risks of investing in common stocks. The number of energy-related MLPs has declined since 2014. The industry is witnessing the consolidation or simplification of corporate structures where the MLP sleeve of capital is being eliminated. As a result of the foregoing, the Fund's MLP investments could become less diverse and the Fund may increase its non-MLP investments consistent with its investment objective and policies. Changes in tax laws or regulations, or interpretations thereof in the future, could adversely affect the Fund or the MLPs, MLP-related entities and other energy sector and energy utility companies in which the Fund invests. The Fund invests in securities of non-U.S. issuers which are subject to higher volatility than securities of U.S. issuers. Because the Fund invests in non-U.S. securities, you may lose money if the local currency of a non-U.S. market depreciates against the U.S. dollar. There can be no assurance as to what portion of the distributions paid to the Fund's Common Shareholders will consist of tax-advantaged qualified dividend income. To the extent a fund invests in floating or variable rate obligations that use the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") as a reference interest rate, it is subject to LIBOR Risk. LIBOR has ceased to be made available as a reference rate and there is no assurance that any alternative reference rate, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR""), will be similar to or produce the same value or economic equivalence as LIBOR. The unavailability or replacement of LIBOR may affect the value, liquidity or return on certain fund investments and may result in costs incurred in connection with closing out positions and entering into new trades. Any potential effects of the transition away from LIBOR on a fund or on certain instruments in which a fund invests is difficult to predict and could result in losses to the fund. As the writer (seller) of a call option, the Fund forgoes, during the life of the option, the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the portfolio security covering the option above the sum of the premium and the strike price of the call option but retains the risk of loss should the price of the underlying security decline. The value of call options written by the Fund may be adversely affected if the market for the option is reduced or becomes illiquid. There can be no assurance that a liquid market will exist when the Fund seeks to close out an option position. If short-term interest rates are lower than the Fund's fixed rate of payment on an interest rate swap, the swap will reduce common share net earnings. In addition, a default by the counterparty to a swap transaction could also negatively impact the performance of the common shares. Use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify the effect of any losses.

The Minister's decision follows regulatory and public review of the Project's Environmental Registration document, which was submitted to the NL Department of Environment and Climate Change (""NLDECC"") on February 29, 2024.Rick LaBelle, CEO, commented: ""Today's news is very positive. The Great Atlantic Salt Project is poised to bring significant economic growth to the west coast of Newfoundland. Upon completion of advanced engineering and construction, the project will be positioned to deliver high-quality Canadian-made salt for markets in North America.

We are fully committed to continuing this engagement as we progress this exciting long-term project,"" said David Robbins, VP ICI Innovations and Senior Environmental Consultant to Atlas.Background to Today's NewsOn August 28, 2023, Atlas released results of a Feasibility Study for the Project, outlining a 34-year mine life producing 2.5 million tonnes of rock salt per year, with access to the deposit via twin declines. Extraction of rock salt would occur using the room and pillar method with continuous mining equipment. Salt would be processed to a specific size and grade using a crushing and screening plant located within the underground mine and transported to surface via conveyor belts. The above ground design envisions an overland conveyor transporting rock salt from the mine area to an existing port for loading onto ships destined for Canadian and American markets.Atlas Salt believes that the Project will significantly contribute to the local and regional economies and create numerous highly skilled generational employment opportunities.The Project's strategic advantage lies in its location close to potential markets, environmental sustainability and its projected economic viability. The near-surface location of the deposit, coupled with its proximity to essential infrastructure, significantly enhances the project's value. The innovative design which optimizes the use of electrical energy contributes to the Project's low GHG emissions while also bolstering its financial attractiveness, presenting a compelling case for environmentally conscious and economically sound mining.For further information and ongoing updates, please visit https://atlassalt.com/.Qualified PersonsThe technical information in this news release has been prepared in accordance with the Canadian regulatory requirements set out in National Instrument 43-101 and approved on behalf of the Company by Patrick J.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The divestiture of ContextLogic's core ecommerce business, Wish, for a cash consideration of $161 million, indicates a strategic shift for the company. This transaction generates liquidity, which can strengthen ContextLogic's balance sheet by bolstering cash reserves. However, it also represents a pivot from the company's former business model. The preservation of approximately $2.7 billion in Net Operating Losses (NOLs) is notable, as these can potentially offset taxable income in future periods, improving net income figures and creating a tax-efficient structure for stakeholders.For shareholders, this means the company's immediate future will be focused on harnessing the value of these NOLs. This is often done through seeking profitable operations or strategic partnerships. It's worth mentioning that the change in the stock ticker to 'LOGC' will signify the company's new direction. Tax Strategy Analyst With ContextLogic's shift through the sale of Wish, the emphasis on NOLs is a significant tax strategy. NOLs are valuable as they allow companies to reduce future tax liabilities, acting as a form of tax credit. A company with $2.7 billion in NOLs can strategically plan to become profitable while potentially avoiding considerable tax expenses. The benefit for investors centers around the efficient use of NOLs which could translate into higher net earnings and, consequently, potential increase in shareholder value. However, it is critical to monitor how the new management plans to utilize these NOLs, as improper usage or inability to generate taxable income could result in these assets becoming less valuable over time due to changes in tax laws or expiration. Corporate Strategy Analyst The completion of the asset sale and the installation of a new CEO and Board suggest a pivot in ContextLogic's strategy. The focus now seems to be on streamlining operations to target profitability. Given the scale of the NOLs, any future operations have the potential to be significantly tax-advantaged, possibly leading to more aggressive business ventures or acquisitions. Investors should consider how the new leadership's experience and vision align with realizing the NOLs' value and driving the company towards profitable endeavors.Such a transformation could bring about volatility in the short term as the market assesses the new direction and management's ability to execute. Long-term investors should closely watch for any strategic moves by ContextLogic that leverage their cash position and NOLs, as these will be critical in defining the company's future trajectory and market valuation. 04/19/2024 - 06:08 PM Transaction Enables Company to Preserve ~$2.7 Billion of Net Operating Losses (NOLs) Rishi Bajaj Appointed Chief Executive Officer; Four New Independent Directors Join Board of Directors SAN FRANCISCO, April 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ContextLogic Inc.

The company plans to focus on developing solutions for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as a private entity, anticipating better access to capital and increased focus on advancing its science. Negative Delisting and deregistering may limit liquidity and trading opportunities for existing shareholders. Transitioning to a private company may restrict access to certain institutional investors and public capital markets. Market perception of delisting could impact future partnerships and collaborations for Vaxxinity. Financial Analyst The announcement that Vaxxinity is delisting from NASDAQ is a significant strategic shift. From a financial perspective, investors should note that the public markets provide liquidity and the potential for returns through share price appreciation. However, delisting often reflects a company's prioritization of operational and financial flexibility over the benefits of being publicly traded.Highlighting the costs—a staggering $3.7 million spent on D&O insurance—versus a backdrop of an unfavorable biotech market, this move can be interpreted as an effort to conserve cash and refocus financial resources on core business activities, such as clinical trials. The Board’s decision, hence, might resonate with a prudent redirection of expenditure in light of Vaxxinity's unique market positioning and substantial R&D needs. Biotech Industry Analyst As Vaxxinity pivots towards specializing in neurodegenerative diseases, it is worth noting the broader industry context. Alzheimer's and Parkinson’s represent a significant unmet medical need and Fast Track designation signals regulatory acknowledgment of potential treatment benefits. The market for neurodegenerative treatments is highly competitive, yet the promise of more effective and affordable alternatives could give Vaxxinity an edge.The company's mention of 'industry-leading data' in Parkinson's and recent clinical successes underscores its potential to be a key player in the field. Vaxxinity's decision to go private may allow for more agile maneuvering through the regulatory and development processes without the scrutiny and pressures that come with being a public entity. 04/19/2024 - 06:53 PM CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., April 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vaxxinity, Inc. (“Vaxxinity”, “we”, “us” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: VAXX), a U.S. company pioneering the development of a new class of medicines, today announced issued a letter to shareholders from its Co-founder and Executive Chairman, Lou Reese and Chief Executive Officer, Mei Mei Hu. To Shareholders of Vaxxinity, Inc.: Earlier today, we announced that we are delisting and deregistering our shares. A few weeks from now, we will no longer be publicly traded on the NASDAQ exchange. It is important to share why we made this decision to “go dark” and why we believe it is in the best interests of the company and our shareholders over the longer-term. Being a public company is very expensive and incredibly time-consuming. Choosing to go public is a path many pursue primarily to obtain access to greater institutional pools of capital. Since the company’s IPO in November 2021, the capital markets have been uniquely and historically adverse for biotech. In retrospect, institutional support withdrew from the market, liquidity dried up and we found ourselves in a downward spiral: The Biotech XBI index decreased for three consecutive yearsOf the over 40 companies that went public in the second half of 2021, only two are trading positively and the majority have decreased more than 80% from their IPO priceOverall, IPO proceeds dropped by 93% from 2021 to 2022 Even in light of these market conditions, Vaxxinity has achieved remarkable successes and results, including: Positive Phase 3 results, validating our platform in COVIDGenerating industry-leading data in Parkinson’s patientsReceipt of FDA Fast Track designation for Alzheimer’s programTwo new programs progressing from animal studies into the clinicExternal validation through over $10M in non-dilutive funding from leading organizations As we witnessed first-hand, downward selling pressure often has nothing to do with company performance. Rather, perversely, we saw investors selling because we were their top-performing portfolio company or selling into good news for the relatively enhanced liquidity. That being said, our liquidity is significantly limited by low daily trading volume which makes it difficult to get both in and out. Relatively few shares openly traded on the market can have an outsized impact on our share price. The costs and resources required to be public, however, continue to be substantial. We spent $3.7M on our first year as a public company on D&O insurance alone. To put that in context, that is equivalent to a large Phase 1 clinical trial. Overall, we are bearing all the costs associated with being public without being able to afford ourselves any of the traditional benefits of access to the public capital markets. Given these dynamics, after careful consideration, the Board of Directors of Vaxxinity has determined that being a private company will give us significantly more opportunity and flexibility going forward to deliver shareholder value and patient impact. Ironically, we expect better access to capital as a private company in today’s environment. Additionally, being private will allow us to focus on what matters most, advancing our science and helping patients. And we believe our science superior. We have shown that Vaxxinity can create vaccines that are as good, if not better, than those already in the market. We did it with COVID, and achieved it with a fraction of our competitors’ resources. In 2.5 years, we: Received an FDA EUA on our antibody testSuccessfully brought our vaccine through a Phase 3 head-to-head with the best-selling vaccine of all time demonstrating that we developed a safer, broader coverage COVID boosterRamped up GMP manufacturing of over 200 million doses of vaccine antigen We recognize that COVID is no longer a top global health priority, but if it were, we believe we would have a best-in-class vaccine offered at 10% of our competitors’ price, or put another way, we would be fulfilling our mission to limit suffering and increase access to the best healthcare solutions in the world. We are now pivoting our focus to another more pernicious, deadly and costly pandemic – neurodegenerative diseases, specifically Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. These slow-progressing diseases affect large and growing global populations, and thus require safe, convenient, and scalable solutions that can intervene early to prevent the disease from worsening. We have the most advanced active immunotherapies in development leveraging cutting-edge technology and an unprecedented opportunity to alleviate the world from its most feared, expensive and devastating diseases. As a private company, we believe we will be better able to keep tirelessly pushing forward, buoyed by purpose and driven by impact. For those of you who choose to sell before we stop trading, we sincerely appreciate your interest in our technology and story to date. For those of you that elect to remain as shareholders through this transition, we would like to thank you in advance for sharing our vision of growing a valued company on a mission of eliminating as much suffering as possible.

Financial Analyst Reviewing Dingdong's recent filing of its Annual Report on Form 20-F provides a comprehensive overview of the company's financial health. Investors should note the audited consolidated financial statements are a key indicator of performance. It's important to scrutinize revenue trends, cost control measures and bottom line results. Particularly in the e-commerce sector, where competition is fierce, the ability to maintain a sustainable growth rate while managing operational expenditure is a strong signal of management effectiveness.Further analysis of any reported long-term debt, equity positions and cash reserves gives an insight into the company's financial stability. In the context of China's dynamic economic environment, these factors can have a material effect on the stock's volatility and investor confidence. Additionally, any changes in gross margin can be indicative of shifts in supply chain efficiency or customer acquisition costs, which are critical in the fresh grocery segment where margins are typically tight. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Dingdong's positioning in the fresh grocery e-commerce market in China is of particular interest. As investors look beyond the numbers, understanding the competitive landscape, user growth and market share could offer a more nuanced picture of potential upside or risks. The company's advanced supply chain capabilities are touted as a differentiator; it's worth assessing how these are reflected in customer satisfaction and retention, both of which are key drivers for future revenue streams.It's also critical to consider external factors such as regulatory changes, shifts in consumer behavior and the evolving competitive landscape. For instance, any regulatory tightening around data privacy could impact Dingdong's operations, while a shift toward online grocery shopping could serve as a tailwind for the business. Moreover, depending on the company's strategies disclosed in the report, one can gauge the potential for international expansion, partnerships, or technology investments that may affect future performance. 04/19/2024 - 05:00 PM SHANGHAI, April 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Dingdong (Cayman) Limited (""Dingdong"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: DDL), a leading fresh grocery e-commerce company in China, with advanced supply chain capabilities, today announced that it filed its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 19, 2024.

Financial Analyst Examining reAlpha Tech Corp's recent financial results reveals a company at the intersection of technology and real estate, a synergy often referred to as proptech. The commercial launch of GENA, an AI-powered platform, indicates a strategic pivot towards digital transformation that could enhance operational efficiencies and client engagement. It's imperative to scrutinize the rollout's influence on revenue streams and the cost structure in subsequent quarters. The proptech space is known for high initial development costs. Thus, potential investors should monitor the balance between R&D spending and income generation. Moreover, as the sector is fragmented, reAlpha's growth strategy could involve acquisitions, demanding careful evaluation of capital allocation and its impact on balance sheets. Real Estate Market Analyst The adoption of AI technologies like GENA could be a game-changer for reAlpha within the real estate arena, an industry traditionally slow to embrace tech innovations. By harnessing AI, reAlpha might streamline asset management and investment processes, offering a competitive edge. For investors, key metrics to observe would include user adoption rates, partnerships established with real estate firms and overall market penetration. It will also be interesting to see how traditional real estate players react to such disruptions. The potential for reAlpha hinges on its ability to not just introduce technology, but to also foster widespread industry adoption, leading to sustainable revenue growth. Tech Industry Analyst From a technology standpoint, the deployment of AI in real estate, such as reAlpha's GENA platform, is indicative of broader sector trends where AI integration is becoming central to innovation. The effectiveness of GENA will likely be determined by the sophistication of its algorithms and the quality of data it processes. Investors should look for evidence of technological robustness, such as patents, unique algorithmic approaches, or partnerships with tech giants for cloud and AI services. The scalability of the platform will be critical, especially as reAlpha looks to grow within the fragmented proptech industry. As the company expands, its technological infrastructure must remain robust and secure to maintain consumer trust and corporate integrity. 04/19/2024 - 04:30 PM DUBLIN, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- reAlpha Tech Corp. (“reAlpha,” the “Company,” “us,” “we” or “our”) (Nasdaq: AIRE), a real estate technology company focused on developing, utilizing and commercializing real estate-focused artificial intelligence (“AI”) technologies, today reports financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024. “reAlpha made significant strides in the first quarter of 2024 with the commercial launch of our AI-powered platform, GENA,” said Giri Devanur, Chief Executive Officer of reAlpha. “This launch demonstrates our commitment to leveraging innovative AI technology to drive change in the real estate industry. We remain focused on executing our strategic initiatives, commercializing our technologies, and pursuing growth opportunities in the fragmented proptech space, which is ripe for innovation. We are excited about the path ahead and look forward to sharing our progress and developments in the coming quarters as we continue to capitalize on these opportunities,” concluded Mr. Devanur. Financial Results Revenues were $20,426 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $111,451 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Our revenues consist of both the short-term rental revenue that we receive from our listed properties, if any, and platform services income that we receive directly from, or services related to, our technologies. The decrease in revenues during the period was attributable to lower rental revenue due to the disposal of our rental properties during and subsequent to fiscal year 2023 as a result of our business strategy shift to focus on the commercialization of our AI technologies, as well as lower platform services revenue as a result of the sale of myAlphie. We had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $4.84 million as of March 31, 2024, and approximately $6.46 million as of December 31, 2023. Net loss was $1,419,045 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $864,913 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in net loss during the period was mainly attributable to increases in wages, professional and legal fees, and amortization of a commitment fee in the form of equity. Adjusted EBITDA was $(1,336,790) for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $(775,098) for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The full reconciliation to Adjusted EBITDA is set forth below. Explanatory Notes on Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP (“GAAP”), we believe “Adjusted EBITDA,” a “non-GAAP financial measure,” as such term is defined under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ SEC”), is useful in evaluating our operating performance. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. We reconcile our non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA to our net income, adjusted to exclude interest expense, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain charges or gains resulting from non-recurring events, if any. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, we did not have any non-recurring events.

Positive Embraer's backlog hit a 7-year high at US$21.1 billion, up 13% quarter-over-quarter. American Airlines placed a firm order for 90 E175 jets, boosting Commercial Aviation backlog by 26%. Executive Aviation deliveries surged from 8 to 18 jets in 1Q24, the highest in 8 years. Embraer delivered 25 jets in 1Q24, a 67% increase from the previous year. The company is implementing a Production Leveling plan to stabilize production throughout the year. Commercial Aviation backlog increased by US$2.3 billion in 1Q24, reaching a total of US$11.1 billion. Negative - Defense & Security backlog decreased by 4% to US$2.4 billion in 1Q24. - While Executive Aviation saw growth, Defense & Security backlog declined slightly. - Services & Support backlog remained flat at US$3.1 billion in 1Q24. Aerospace Industry Analyst Embraer's first quarter performance shows a promising uptick in demand for their aircraft, particularly within the Executive Aviation segment. The marked increase in deliveries here, from 8 to 18 jets, is indicative of a strong market appetite for business jets. This is reflective of broader economic trends where businesses are investing more in travel as we move away from pandemic-induced restrictions. It suggests Embraer's product offerings are resonating with upscale customers, perhaps due to their features, or it could be an indication of successful sales strategies. However, the flat year-over-year delivery numbers in Commercial Aviation at 7 aircraft could raise questions about growth prospects in that segment. Although this may be a point of concern, the significant backlog growth in the same segment, especially with the large American Airlines order, provides a buffer and signals confidence from one of the largest airlines in the industry. This backlog suggests a robust future revenue stream, albeit with the caveat that the company must ensure that its production capabilities can keep pace with the demand to capitalize on this potential revenue. Financial Analyst The significant sequential increase in Embraer's backlog, which now stands at $21.1 billion, represents a substantial 13% quarter-over-quarter growth. From a financial perspective, this is a healthy indicator of the company's order book and future revenue prospects, providing investors with a positive outlook on the company's financial stability and growth trajectory. It highlights strong market confidence in Embraer's offerings, potentially leading to increased investor confidence and a positive impact on the company's stock value.The 13% increase in backlog over the last quarter outpaces typical industry norms, which usually hover in the single-digit percentage range. The demand growth in the Executive Aviation sector, with the highest number of 1Q deliveries in eight years, also reflects a resilient luxury sector that could potentially offer higher margins relative to commercial aircraft. Such an uptick can be an indication of Embraer's strong market positioning and innovative product development strategies that align with current market demands. Supply Chain Analyst A critical component of Embraer's future success lies in its ability to manage supply chains and production levels. The introduction of the Production Leveling plan is a strategic move to address business seasonality and stabilize production. By smoothing out production rates, Embraer can potentially avoid bottlenecks and production inefficiencies that often plague the aerospace industry. This plan, if successful, may lead to a reduction in costs, improve aircraft delivery times and ultimately enhance customer satisfaction.Given the sheer volume of the backlog and the increase in order commitments, the company's supply chain management capabilities will be tested. Delays, which can be common in the industry due to the complexity of aircraft manufacturing, could erode customer trust and impact future sales. The aerospace industry traditionally works on tight schedules with high penalties for delays, thus effective planning and execution of the Production Leveling plan will be important for Embraer's ability to capitalize on its current momentum. 04/19/2024 - 07:56 PM Strong overall backlog volume of US$ 21.1 billion (+13% QoQ)American Airlines placed a firm order for 90 E175 jetsCommercial Aviation backlog rose US$2.3 billion (+26% QoQ)1Q Executive Aviation deliveries were the highest of the last 8 yearsSÃO JOSÉ DOS CAMPOS, Brazil, April 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Embraer (NYSE: ERJ; B3: EMBR3) delivered 25 jets in 1Q24, an increase of 67% compared to the 15 aircraft delivered in 1Q23. Executive Aviation showed robust delivery growth, soaring from 8 to 18 jets during the period. The number of deliveries was the highest 1Q of the last 8 years, and more than doubled YoY. Meanwhile, for Commercial Aviation, deliveries were flat YoY at 7 aircraft.

The company has developed, and it is currently implementing, a plan to mitigate its business seasonality. The Production Leveling plan main objective is to have a stable production pace throughout the calendar year in the near to medium-term future. The company's backlog increased US$2.4 billion or 13% sequentially to US$21.1 billion in 1Q24, compared to a total backlog of US$18.7 billion in 4Q23. The biggest increase happened in Commercial Aviation (US$2.3 billion or 26%) while the smallest one was in Defense & Security (-US$0.1 billion or –4%). Backlog by Segment - US$bn 4Q23 1Q24 QoQ Executive Aviation 4.3 4.6 7 % Defense & Security 2.5 2.4 -4 % Commercial Aviation 8.8 11.1 26 % Services & Support 3.1 3.1 0 % Total 18.7 21.1 13 % Executive Aviation kept its sales momentum with sustained demand across its entire product portfolio and strong customer acceptance, in both retail and fleet markets. The number of deliveries increased 83% YoY in the light jets segment, and more than tripled in the medium jets one compared to 1Q23. Consequently, Executive Aviation ended with a US$4.6 billion backlog in 1Q24, for a US$ 300 million sequential increase. In Defense & Security, the first C-390 Millennium of the Hungarian Air Force successfully completed its maiden flight. The aircraft is now undergoing a mission systems integration test campaign, ahead of its entry into service. Another important milestone in the quarter was the first Embraer Defense Day in the United States; an event during which the C-390 Millennium and the A-29 Super Tucano were showcased to government authorities, military officials, prospects, and partners at our facilities in Melbourne, Florida. The C-390 selection by some countries in the EMEA and APAC regions has not yet been incorporated into the backlog, which represents a significant source of upside potential for the coming quarters. The Defense & Security backlog reached US$2.4 billion (-4% QoQ) in 1Q24. Services & Support continues to be one of the main drivers of Embraer's growth through a combination of operational excellence, customer experience, and innovative solutions. The business unit backlog finished the period sequentially flat at US$ 3.1 billion in 1Q24. Commercial Aviation posted a US$11.1 billion backlog, or US$2.3 billion higher than in 4Q23. The highlight of the quarter was the deal with American Airlines for 90 E175s, with purchase rights for another 43 additional jets, to meet domestic demand in the United States. Also, Embraer delivered one E195-E2 to Azorra, which will fly under the Royal Jordanian flag.

Positive Consolidated net income for the first quarter of 2024 was $5,727,000, with earnings per share (EPS) of $0.69. Net interest income decreased to $17,241,000, primarily due to increased deposit interest expense. Non-interest income was $1,519,000, reflecting changes in the market value of an equity security and a reduction in fees. Total assets were $1.81 billion, showing a decrease from the previous quarter and the same period last year. Gross loans increased to $1.04 billion, while total deposits decreased to $1.61 billion at March 31, 2024. Negative Increase in deposit interest expense led to a decrease in net income compared to prior periods. Non-interest expense increased primarily due to staffing expenses and general operating costs. Total assets and total deposits showed a decrease from previous periods. Decrease in net interest income was influenced by lower deposits and increased cost of funds. Financial Analyst Oak Valley Bancorp's first-quarter earnings report highlights a few key financial metrics that investors should examine. First, the year-over-year decrease in consolidated net income from $9,225,000 to $5,727,000 can raise concerns about the bank's earning stability, especially considering the decline from the previous quarter as well. The reported EPS of $0.69 represents a drop from both the prior quarter's $0.71 EPS and last year's $1.12 EPS. This decline appears to be driven by the increased deposit interest expense, which is a important factor considering it impacts net interest income, a primary revenue driver for banks. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Oak Valley Bancorp's report of increased deposit costs is indicative of rising interest rate environment, as shown by the increase in the average cost of funds to 68 basis points from 10 basis points year-over-year. Investors should note this could have a mixed impact. On one hand, higher interest cost can squeeze margins, as evidenced by the net interest margin contraction to 4.09%. On the other hand, the bank's strategic decision to allow some rate-sensitive deposit migration is an attempt to manage this pressure. The loan growth is a positive sign, showing the bank's ability to expand its asset base even in this environment, potentially offsetting some interest expense concerns. Risk Management Analyst With regards to risk, Oak Valley Bancorp's maintenance of zero non-performing assets (NPA) is commendable and indicates a strong credit portfolio. The allowance for credit losses (ACL) ratio of 1.05% holds steady against industry benchmarks and regulatory expectations, particularly in the face of potential commercial real estate credit risks. The absence of a need to record a provision for credit losses in the first quarter points to the bank's confidence in the stability of its credit quality. This is an important element for investors, as it suggests that the bank is managing its credit risk appropriately in the current economic climate. 04/19/2024 - 05:43 PM OAKDALE, Calif., April 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Oak Valley Bancorp (NASDAQ: OVLY) (the “Company”), the bank holding company for Oak Valley Community Bank and their Eastern Sierra Community Bank division, recently reported unaudited consolidated financial results for the first quarter of 2024. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, consolidated net income was $5,727,000, or $0.69 per diluted share (EPS). This compared to consolidated net income of $5,865,000, or $0.71 EPS, for the prior quarter and $9,225,000, or $1.12 EPS, for the same period a year ago. The net income decrease compared to prior periods was primarily the result of an increase in deposit interest expense. Average cost of funds increased to 68 bps as of March 31, 2024, compared to 55 bps for the prior quarter and 10 bps for the first quarter of 2023. This was partially offset by loan growth of $22.9 million over the prior quarter. Net interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $17,241,000, compared to $17,914,000 in the prior quarter, and $19,543,000 in the same period a year ago. The decrease from the prior periods is attributable to the increased cost of funds, offset by loan growth, as described above. The decrease in net interest income was also influenced by lower deposits as our liquidity position allowed us to strategically tolerate some rate-sensitive deposit migration, which substantially mitigated our cost of funds increases relative to peer. Net interest margin for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was 4.09%, compared to 4.15% for the prior quarter and 4.39% for the same period last year. The interest margin contraction compared to prior periods was due to previously noted deposit rate pressure on cost of funds. “We are pleased with our overall financial position. While our deposit costs have increased, our average cost of funds remains manageable, as our service-focused banking model continues to strengthen our core-deposit base,” stated Rick McCarty, President and Chief Operating Officer. Non-interest income was $1,519,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to $1,755,000 for the prior quarter and $1,655,000 for the same period last year. The decreases compared to prior periods was primarily due to changes in the market value of an equity security, and a reduction in overdraft and non-sufficient fund fees charged to customers resulting from regulatory changes in the industry. Non-interest expense totaled $11,529,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to $10,760,000 in the previous quarter and $9,757,000 in the same quarter a year ago. The increase in non-interest expense compared to prior periods corresponds primarily to staffing expense and general operating costs related to servicing the growing business portfolios. Total assets were $1.81 billion at March 31, 2024, a decrease of $36.7 million and $134.9 million from December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively. Gross loans were $1.04 billion at March 31, 2024, an increase of $22.9 million and $112.7 million over December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively. The Company’s total deposits were $1.61 billion at March 31, 2024, a decrease of $38.1 million and $156.8 million from December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively. The deposit decrease during the first quarter was mainly related to normal seasonal activity. The deposit decrease compared to the same period a year ago was due to the aforementioned migration of rate-sensitive deposits, including those transferred to our Oak Valley Investments channel. Our liquidity position remains strong, as evidenced by $169.7 million in cash and cash equivalents balances at March 31, 2024. “We have started 2024 with a solid performance. Our team’s steadfast focus on targeted prospecting, regardless of economic conditions, has led to a strong first quarter in loan production and a robust loan pipeline,” stated Chris Courtney, CEO. Non-performing assets (“NPA”) remained at zero as of March 31, 2024, as they were as of December 31, 2023, and March 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) as a percentage of gross loans was 1.05% at March 31, 2024, compared to 1.07% at December 31, 2023 and 1.01% at March 31, 2023. Given industry concerns of credit risk specific to commercial real estate, management has performed a thorough analysis of this segment as part of the CECL credit risk model’s ACL computation, concluding that the credit loss reserves relative to gross loans remains at acceptable levels, and credit quality remains stable. As a result, the Company did not record a provision for credit losses during the first quarter.

Positive Successful pricing of €500 million 5.75% senior unsecured notes offering for refinancing and interest expense reduction Redemption of €500 million 7.625% senior unsecured notes due 2026 to reduce interest expenses Repricing of senior secured term loan B facilities to lower debt and interest costs Expected reduction of over $30 million in net interest expenses for 2024 and over $50 million annually Notes Offering and Repricing Transaction as part of debt reduction and capital structure simplification strategy Expected annual interest rate of 5.75% for the Notes and SOFR-based interest rates for term loan facilities with a 2.75% margin Negative Notes not registered under the Securities Act or state securities laws for sale in the US Potential risk associated with offering to qualified institutional buyers and non-US investors only Financial Analyst Carnival Corporation's strategic refinancing through a €500 million notes offering and the repricing of existing secured term loan facilities is aimed at optimizing its capital structure by lowering interest expenses. With a rate reduction from 7.625% to 5.75% on the new unsecured notes, the company stands to reduce its annual interest expense significantly. The anticipated saving of over $50 million annually is a substantial improvement to its interest coverage ratio. This maneuver demonstrates a proactive approach to debt management, particularly important for a company in the capital-intensive leisure industry, which is still rebounding from the pandemic-induced downturn. Debt Market Analyst The transition from a higher-rate unsecured notes due in 2026 to lower-rate notes due in 2030, along with partial prepayment of secured term loans, reflects a shrewd move by Carnival Corporation to capitalize on favorable debt market conditions. The introduction of SOFR-based interest rates with a margin indicates a shift towards more widely accepted benchmarking post-LIBOR. The credit markets view proactive debt restructuring as a positive step, especially when it leads to interest savings and demonstrates improved cash flow management. For investors, these developments could be indicative of the company's commitment to maintaining financial stability and operational flexibility. Investment Risk Analyst Investors should note the unsecured nature of the new notes, which implies they are subordinated to secured debt in the event of insolvency. Despite this, the corporate guarantee by Carnival plc and select subsidiaries provides a layer of assurance. However, the fact that these notes are not registered under the Securities Act signals limited liquidity as they cannot be sold freely in the U.S. without registration or exemption. This could be a double-edged sword, reducing immediate liquidity for investors but also potentially reducing the future debt burden on the company by limiting the note's tradability. 04/19/2024 - 04:05 PM Proceeds from the offering of senior unsecured notes and cash on hand to be used to redeem €500 million 7.625% senior unsecured notes due 2026; cash on hand to repay $800 million of the term loan facilities MIAMI, April 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Carnival Corporation & plc (NYSE/LSE: CCL; NYSE: CUK) today announced that Carnival Corporation (the ""Company"") priced its private offering (the ""Notes Offering"") of €500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.75% senior unsecured notes due 2030 (the ""Notes""). The Company expects to use the net proceeds from the Notes Offering, together with cash on hand, to redeem its €500 million 7.625% senior unsecured notes due 2026 (the ""2026 Euro Unsecured Notes""), resulting in a reduction in interest expense on this outstanding debt of nearly 2%. In addition, the Company has received commitments from lenders to reprice its first-priority senior secured term loan facility maturing in 2028 (the ""2028 Secured Term Loan Facility"") and its first-priority senior secured term loan facility maturing in 2027 (the ""2027 Secured Term Loan Facility"" and, such transaction, the ""Repricing Transaction""). As part of the Repricing Transaction, the Company expects to make a partial prepayment of $500 million under the 2028 Secured Term Loan Facility and a partial prepayment of $300 million under the 2027 Secured Term Loan Facility. The Notes Offering, the redemption of the 2026 Euro Unsecured Notes and the Repricing Transaction are a continuation of the Company's ongoing debt and interest expense reduction and capital structure simplification. Together, the reduction in both interest rates and total debt is expected to result in a reduction of net interest expense of over $30 million for the remainder of 2024 and over $50 million on an annualized basis. The Notes Offering and Repricing Transaction are expected to close on April 25, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions and the execution of definitive documentation. The previously announced redemption of the 2026 Euro Unsecured Notes is expected to occur on April 26, 2024 and is conditioned on the closing of the Notes Offering. The Notes will pay interest annually on January 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2025, at a rate of 5.75% per year. The Notes will be unsecured and will mature on January 15, 2030. The Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis, jointly and severally, by Carnival plc and certain of the Company's and Carnival plc's subsidiaries that also guarantee our first-priority secured indebtedness, certain of our other unsecured notes and our convertible notes. After implementation of the repricing, the 2028 Secured Term Loan Facility will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to SOFR with a 0.75% floor, plus a margin equal to 2.75%. The 2027 Secured Term Loan Facility will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to SOFR with a 0.75% floor, plus a margin equal to 2.75%. PJT Partners is serving as independent financial advisor to Carnival Corporation & plc. This press release does not constitute a notice of redemption with respect to the 2026 Euro Unsecured Notes. The Notes are being offered only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""), and outside the United States, only to non-U.S. investors pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Financial Analyst The initial public offering (IPO) of mF International Limited represents a significant milestone for the company and a potential investment opportunity for market participants. At a price of $4.5 per share, the company has set a valuation that reflects its confidence in the underlying business model and growth prospects. The gross proceeds of $7.5 million indicate the scale of the offering and suggest a modest appetite from the investment community, given the relatively small number of shares offered. This is characteristic of companies in early stages or niche markets. Investors should consider the industry benchmarks for IPO sizes as well as the financial strength of mF International, including revenue, profit margins and growth trajectories, when assessing the potential return on investment. It's important to analyze the use of proceeds outlined by the company, whether for expansion, debt reduction, or other corporate purposes, as this will influence future financial performance. Market Research Analyst mF International's entry into the Nasdaq Capital Market is noteworthy as it provides access to a wider investor base and can be seen as a vote of confidence in the company's growth strategy. The selection of a ticker symbol, 'MFI', is a branding exercise that can impact the recognition of the company among retail investors. When considering such an investment, it's important to evaluate the company's competitive position within the financial trading solutions sector. The company's technological edge, user base, regulatory environment in its operational jurisdictions and partnerships will play a important role in its ability to capture market share. Moreover, the timing of the IPO and market conditions at the time of listing can significantly affect the post-IPO performance. Investors should keep a close eye on market sentiment and industry trends to gauge potential volatility and market reception. Tech Industry Analyst mF International's focus on financial trading solutions suggests an intersection of financial services and technology, commonly referred to as fintech. The rate of adoption of such technologies and their disruption potential in the greater financial markets is a critical element for investors to consider. The company's value proposition in innovating trading experiences, its intellectual property, if any and scalability of its technology platform are key indicators of its long-term viability. It is essential to assess the company's research and development capabilities and their commitment to innovation. Given that technology companies thrive on constant evolution, an understanding of the company's product roadmap and its alignment with industry trends can give investors a sense of the company's future growth potential. 04/19/2024 - 08:30 PM Hong Kong, April 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- mF International Limited (the “Company” or “mF International”), a Hong Kong-based experienced financial trading solution provider, today announced the pricing of its initial public offering (the “Offering”) of 1,666,667 ordinary shares at a public offering price of $4.5 per ordinary share.

Positive The S-3 filing allows the potential issuance of up to 1,000,000 shares of IHT Common Stock.

Diversification may occur through UniGen Power, Inc., clean energy, and hospitality technology innovations. The current stock price is $1.54 per share on the NYSE-American under the symbol 'IHT.' Plans include a dividend declaration and strong hotel operations. The First Fiscal Quarter of 2025 demonstrates record revenue for Tucson and Albuquerque hotels, exceeding $2 million. Negative None. Financial Analyst InnSuites Hospitality Trust's (IHT) recent S-3 filing indicates a strategy to potentially raise capital through the sale of up to 1,000,000 shares. The flexibility in timing and the amount of financing that this type of shelf registration offers is a strategic tool for managing the company's capital structure. The anticipated utilization of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, repayment of debts and possibly repurchasing equity securities suggests a focus on balance sheet strength. The involvement in UniGen Power hints at diversification beyond hospitality, which could mitigate sector-specific risks and catalyze growth, but operational execution and market reception will be key to assess the success of such ventures. Energy Sector Analyst IHT's pivot to invest in UniGen Power's clean energy innovations represents an intriguing diversification play outside of their core hospitality industry. This move possibly positions IHT at the confluence of the growing sustainability trend and the energy sector's evolution. The long-term earnings potential from efficient clean energy solutions could be substantial, given the global push for green technologies. However, investors should keep a keen eye on how these investments align with IHT's core competencies and the scalability of UniGen's technologies in a highly competitive market. Hospitality Industry Analyst With IHT's announcement of continued strong hotel operations and record revenues in its Tucson and Albuquerque properties, the company showcases resilience in its core business. The maintained streak of annual dividends, set to continue with the upcoming dividend declaration, signals confidence in financial stability and a commitment to shareholder returns. Investors should consider the historical performance of these hotel operations when evaluating IHT's ability to sustain and grow dividends, as well as how investments like those in UniGen may affect future dividend policies. 04/19/2024 - 05:25 PM Phoenix, AZ, April 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- InnSuites Hospitality Trust (NYSE American: IHT) IHT management announces Filing an S-3, allowing the potential to offer and sell up to 1,000,000 shares of IHT common stock, without par value (“Common Stock”), of the Company.

Financial Analyst Tupperware Brands Corporation's delay in filing its 2023 financial statements is a red flag that warrants a closer look from an investment perspective. It's not uncommon for companies to experience delays, but the stated reasons, including ongoing material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and attrition in the accounting function, suggest deeper systemic issues that might affect the company's financial health. The NYSE's six-month grace period provides a cushion, but investors should monitor progress closely, as further delays or failure to file within this window could trigger NYSE delisting procedures which would severely impact stock liquidity and investor confidence. Corporate Governance Expert This situation with Tupperware Brands underscores the importance of robust internal controls and governance structures. The disclosed material weaknesses in internal controls are troubling as they may point to the potential for misstatements in financial reports or inefficiencies in financial operations. The attrition in the accounting department could signal a deteriorating workplace environment or internal turmoil. Investors should be vigilant about the company's efforts to address these issues, as they are essential for accurate financial reporting and compliance with regulations, ultimately influencing the company's reputation and valuation. 04/19/2024 - 04:15 PM ORLANDO, Fla., April 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Tupperware Brands Corporation (NYSE: TUP) (the ""Company"") announced today the status of its filing of its 2023 financial statements. Following the Company's engagement of its new auditor, KPMG LLP, in late January 2024, the Company became current in the filing of its quarterly financial statements for the first three quarters of 2023, on March 29, 2024. The Company is currently working to complete the preparation, audit and filing of its full-year 2023 financials in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 (the ""Form 10-K""), which was initially due on March 29, 2024, but which the Company previously announced would be delayed. As expected, the Company received a notice (the ""NYSE Notice"") from the New York Stock Exchange (the ""NYSE"") on April 16, 2024 indicating the Company is not in compliance with Section 802.01E of the NYSE Listed Company Manual because the Company has not timely filed its Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC""). The NYSE Notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company's common stock on the NYSE. The NYSE informed the Company that the Company will have six months from March 29, 2024 to file the Form 10-K with the SEC to regain compliance with this NYSE continued listing standard. If the Company fails to file the Form 10-K within the six-month period, then the NYSE may, in its sole discretion, grant a further extension of up to six additional months for the Company to regain compliance, depending on the specific circumstances. As previously disclosed in its Notification of Late Filing on Form 12b-25 filed by the Company with the SEC on March 29, 2024, the Company requires additional time to file the Form 10-K due to the above discussed delay in filing its quarterly financials, its ongoing material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, additional accounting and auditing procedures related to the Form 10-K, and as a result of attrition in its accounting function. The Company is working diligently to complete the necessary work to file the Form 10-K as soon as practicable and currently expects to be able to file the Form 10-K within the six-month period granted by the NYSE Notice. Forward-Looking Statements This press release includes ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the Company's ability to regain compliance with the NYSE's continued listing standards and the Company's ability to file its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. Such forward looking statements are based on assumptions about many important factors, including the following, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: whether and when the Company can complete its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures for the 2023 fiscal year, whether and when its independent registered public accounting firm can complete its audit, and other risks identified in the Company's most recent filing on Form 10-K and other SEC filings, all of which are available on the Company's website. The Company does not intend to update forward-looking information unless otherwise required by law.

Il rapporto del giudice, emesso il 17 aprile 2024, suggerisce che il tribunale distrettuale dovrebbe invalidare i brevetti di Jetaire, ponendo potenzialmente fine alle rivendicazioni brevettuali contro AerSale. Un Juez Magistrado Federal de los EE. UU. recomienda la invalidación de las patentes de Jetaire en el litigio de AerSale, favoreciendo a AerSale en la disputa sobre los productos AerSafe diseñados para reducir los riesgos de explosión del tanque de combustible en ciertas aeronaves comerciales. El informe del juez, emitido el 17 de abril de 2024, sugiere que el Tribunal de Distrito debería invalidar las patentes de Jetaire, posiblemente terminando con las reclamaciones de patentes contra AerSale. 미국 연방 조정 판사가 AerSale의 소송에서 Jetaire 특허 무효를 권고하며, 특정 상업 항공기의 연료 탱크 폭발 위험을 줄이기 위해 설계된 AerSafe 제품에 대한 분쟁에서 AerSale을 지지했습니다. 2024년 4월 17일 발표된 판사의 보고서는 지방 법원이 Jetaire의 특허를 무효화해야 한다고 제안하며, 이는 AerSale에 대한 특허 청구가 종결될 수 있음을 시사합니다. Un juge magistrat fédéral des États-Unis recommande l'invalidation des brevets de Jetaire dans le procès d'AerSale, en faveur d'AerSale dans le litige concernant les produits AerSafe conçus pour réduire les risques d'explosion des réservoirs de carburant sur certains avions commerciaux. Le rapport du juge, émis le 17 avril 2024, suggère que le tribunal de district devrait invalider les brevets de Jetaire, mettant potentiellement fin aux revendications de brevet contre AerSale. Ein US Bundesrichter empfiehlt die Ungültigerklärung der Jetaire-Patente im Rechtsstreit von AerSale, was AerSale im Streit über die AerSafe-Produkte, die darauf ausgelegt sind, das Risiko von Treibstofftankexplosionen bei bestimmten Verkehrsflugzeugen zu verringern, unterstützt. Der am 17. April 2024 herausgegebene Bericht des Richters schlägt vor, dass das Bezirksgericht die Patente von Jetaire für ungültig erklären sollte, was möglicherweise die Patentrechtsansprüche gegen AerSale beendet. Positive None. Negative None. 04/19/2024 - 05:18 PM CORAL GABLES, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AerSale Corporation (Nasdaq: ASLE) (“AerSale”) announced a favorable recommendation by a U.S. Federal Magistrate Judge in AerSale’s lawsuit with Jetaire Aerospace, LLC, Jetaire Flight Systems, LLC (collectively “Jetaire”), and Jetaire’s owner Michael Williams, relating to AerSale’s AerSafe products that provide a means for mitigating the risk of a catastrophic fuel tank explosion on certain commercial aircraft, including Boeing 737-300/400/500, 737-600/700/800, 757- 200/300, 767-200/300 and 777-200/300, and the Airbus A319/320/321 family of aircraft. On December 17, 2020, Jetaire Aerospace filed a lawsuit against AerSale, alleging that AerSafe products infringe three patents held by Jetaire Aerospace (the “Jetaire Patents”). AerSale filed various counterclaims against Jetaire and Mr. Williams, including seeking declaratory judgments that (i) AerSale’s AerSafe products do not infringe upon the Jetaire Patents and (ii) the Jetaire Patents should be declared invalid. AerSale moved for judgment in its favor as a matter of law on its counterclaims regarding non- infringement and invalidity of Jetaire’s patents. The U.S. Chief Magistrate Judge assigned to the case filed a report and recommendation on April 17, 2024, recommending that the District Court invalidate Jetaire’s patents and enter judgment in favor of AerSale on these counterclaims. Should the District Court adopt this recommendation, Jetaire’s patent claims would be rendered moot. The report and recommendation can be accessed HERE. AerSale’s Chief Executive Officer Nicolas Finazzo noted, “We appreciate the Magistrate Judge’s well-reasoned report and recommendation in our favor. We are hopeful that the District Court will adopt the report and recommendation and enter judgment in AerSale’s favor on all of Jetaire’s claims against us.” About AerSafe® AerSafe® is a cost-saving solution that was designed by AerSale to meet the FAA’s latest fuel quantity indication system (FQIS) and fuel tank flammability mitigation requirements (FTFR). The system uses precision cut reticulated polyurethane foam blocks placed in an aircraft’s fuel tank. The AerSafe system works effectively by limiting the amount of available oxygen within the empty space of the fuel tank where fuel vapors are present and mitigates sparks or other ignition sources from initiating an explosion. AerSafe has been designed to optimize aircraft down time by arriving in pre-packaged, precision pre-cut foam blocks. There is no need for any on-site cutting or modiﬁcations, resulting in a process that is fast and efficient, requiring only 24 hours installation time. Additionally, given the simplicity of the system, no additional maintenance is required between heavy checks, making AerSafe the preeminent reticulated polyurethane foam Ignition Mitigation Means (IMM) solution. AerSafe is an approved method of compliance (MOC) and certified IMM that meets the requirements of 14 CFR 25.981 (a)(c)(d) and 121.1117.

(NYSE: CEE) and The New Germany Fund, Inc. (NYSE: GF) (each, a “Fund,” and, collectively, the “Funds”) announced today that the Annual Meeting of Stockholders for each Fund will be held at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time on June 27, 2024 at the offices of DWS Investment Management Americas, Inc., 875 Third Avenue, New York, New York 10022.

Important Information The Central and Eastern Europe Fund, Inc. is non-diversified and can take larger positions in fewer issues, increasing its potential risk. Investing in foreign securities presents certain risks, such as currency fluctuations, political and economic changes, and market risks. Emerging markets tend to be more volatile and less liquid than the markets of more mature economies, and generally have less diverse and less mature economic structures and less stable political systems than those of developed countries. Any fund that focuses in a particular segment of the market or region of the world will generally be more volatile than a fund that invests more broadly. This fund is non-diversified and can take larger positions in fewer issues, increasing its potential risk. The New Germany Fund, Inc. is diversified and primarily focuses its investments in Germany, thereby increasing its vulnerability to developments in that country. Investing in foreign securities, particularly of emerging markets, presents certain risks, such as currency fluctuations, and risks of currency and capital controls, political and economic changes, and market risks. Any fund that concentrates in a particular segment of the market or a particular geographical region will generally be more volatile than a fund that invests more broadly. War, terrorism, sanctions, economic uncertainty, trade disputes, public health crises and related geopolitical events have led, and, in the future, may lead to significant disruptions in US and world economies and markets, which may lead to increased market volatility and may have significant adverse effects on the funds and their investments. The European Union, the United States and other countries have imposed sanctions on Russia in response to Russian military and other actions in recent years. These sanctions have adversely affected Russian individuals, issuers and the Russian economy. Russia, in turn, has imposed sanctions targeting Western individuals, businesses and products. The various sanctions have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, not only the Russian economy, but also the economies of many countries in Europe, including countries in Central and Eastern Europe. In the case of the Central and Eastern Europe Fund, Inc., Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has materially adversely affected, and may continue to materially adversely affect, the value and liquidity of the Fund’s portfolio. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one-time public offering and once issued, shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to net asset value. The price of the fund’s shares is determined by a number of factors, several of which are beyond the control of the fund. Therefore, the fund cannot predict whether its shares will trade at, below or above net asset value. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer or solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the laws of such state or jurisdiction.

Es gibt jedoch keine Garantie für eine Genehmigung oder die Wiedererlangung der Compliance. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement from NLS Pharmaceutics regarding the potential delisting from Nasdaq due to non-compliance with the minimum bid price requirement is a concern for shareholders. If delisted, the liquidity and marketability of NLS stocks would be adversely affected, as over-the-counter markets are generally less liquid and companies may not garner the same investor attention. The bid price requirement ensures a modicum of investor confidence and corporate stability. The plan to regain compliance will likely involve measures to boost the stock price, such as reverse stock splits or operational improvements. However, investors should consider the inherent risks in such situations, including the possible perception that the company is underperforming. While this does not directly impact the company's operation, the stigma associated with delisting can affect investor sentiment and the company's ability to raise capital. Medical Research Analyst Investors should take into account the company's pipeline and current operational standing. A biopharmaceutical focusing on rare and complex CNS disorders could have significant upside potential if its therapies prove successful. However, research and development in this field are highly capital-intensive with a long road to commercialization, often fraught with regulatory hurdles. The risk of delisting could compound NLS's challenges by potentially reducing funding opportunities. Limited capital would hinder its ability to advance clinical trials or invest in new research, which could delay drug development and ultimately impact the company's growth prospects. For retail investors, it's important to balance the company's scientific promise against these financial and market-based risks. 04/19/2024 - 05:00 PM ZÜRICH, SWITZERLAND / ACCESSWIRE / April 19, 2024 / NLS Pharmaceutics Ltd. (NASDAQ:NLSP)(NASDAQ:NLSPW) (""NLS"" or the ""Company""), a Swiss clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative therapies for patients with rare and complex central nervous system disorders, announces that on April 17, 2024, it received a determination letter (the ""Letter"") from the staff (the ""Staff"") of the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq"") notifying the Company of the Staff's determination that, unless the Company timely requests a hearing before a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the ""Panel""), the Company's securities would be subject to delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market due to the Company's failure to maintain at least a $1 bid price per share over the course of 30 consecutive business days, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). Accordingly, the Company intends to timely request a hearing before the Panel. The hearing request will stay any suspension or delisting action pending the hearing and the expiration of any additional extension period granted by the Panel following the hearing.At the hearing, the Company intends to present a plan to achieve compliance with the bid price requirement, as well as any other applicable Nasdaq listing requirements, and to request that the Panel allow the Company additional time to regain such compliance. However, there can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company's request for an extension or that the Company will ultimately regain compliance with all applicable requirements for continued listing.About NLS Pharmaceutics Ltd.NLS Pharmaceutics Ltd. is a Swiss clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company led by an experienced management team with a track record of developing and repurposing product candidates to treat rare and complex central nervous system disorders. The Company's lead product candidate, Quilience®, is a proprietary extended-release formulation of Mazindol (Mazindol ER) and is being developed for the treatment of narcolepsy, and potentially other sleep-wake disorders such as idiopathic hypersomnia (IH), for which NLS recently obtained Orphan Disease Designation (ODD) from the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Mazindol is a triple monoamine reuptake inhibitor and partial Orexin-2 Receptor agonist, which was used for many years to treat patients diagnosed with narcolepsy in compassionate use programs. A Phase 2a multi-center U.S. clinical trial evaluating Quilience® in adult subjects suffering from narcolepsy met its primary endpoint with high statistical significance and demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile. NLS also successfully completed a Phase 2 study in the U.S. evaluating Nolazol® (Mazindol Controlled-Release) in adult subjects suffering from ADHD. The study met all primary and secondary endpoints and Nolazol® was well-tolerated. Quilience® has received Orphan Drug Designations both in the U.S. and in Europe for the treatment of narcolepsy. Up to 1/3 of narcoleptic patients are also diagnosed with ADHD.Safe Harbor StatementThis press release contains expressed or implied forward-looking statements pursuant to U.S. Federal securities laws.

Parke Bancorp, Inc. a annoncé ses résultats du premier trimestre 2024 avec un bénéfice net de 6,1 millions de dollars, un chiffre d'affaires de 30,5 millions de dollars et un total d'actifs de 2,01 milliards de dollars. Malgré une baisse du bénéfice net par rapport à l'année précédente, la société reste optimiste quant aux opportunités de croissance future. Parke Bancorp, Inc. hat seine Erträge für das erste Quartal 2024 bekanntgegeben, mit einem Nettogewinn von 6,1 Millionen Dollar, einem Umsatz von 30,5 Millionen Dollar und einer Gesamtbilanzsumme von 2,01 Milliarden Dollar. Trotz eines Rückgangs des Nettogewinns im Vergleich zum Vorjahr bleibt das Unternehmen optimistisch hinsichtlich zukünftiger Wachstumschancen. Positive Net income decreased by 44.8% to $6.1 million for Q1 2024 compared to Q1 2023. Net interest income decreased by 18.0% to $14.1 million for Q1 2024. Non-interest income decreased by 40.4% to $1.1 million for Q1 2024. Total assets decreased by 0.7% to $2.01 billion at March 31, 2024. Total loans decreased by 0.1% to $1.79 billion at March 31, 2024. Total deposits increased by 0.7% to $1.56 billion at March 31, 2024. Nonperforming loans decreased to $7.0 million at March 31, 2024, representing 0.39% of total loans. CEO remains cautiously optimistic about potential growth opportunities despite economic challenges. Negative Net income decreased significantly compared to the previous year. Net interest income and non-interest income saw substantial declines in Q1 2024. Total assets, total loans, and non-interest income all experienced decreases. Nonperforming loans and loans past due saw increases from the previous quarter. Despite the positive outlook, caution is advised due to ongoing economic challenges. Financial Analyst The release of Parke Bancorp, Inc.'s first-quarter earnings illustrates a mixed financial performance, with a notable decline in net income by 44.8% year-over-year. This drop is primarily attributed to a decrease in net interest income and an uptick in provisions for credit losses, which suggest a more conservative approach to potential loan defaults. Investors should be mindful of these factors as they may indicate a shift in the bank's risk profile and potential pressures on profitability.Furthermore, the reported increase in interest expense by 73.8% highlights the impact of rising market interest rates on the bank's cost of funds. This could potentially squeeze the net interest margin if loan yields do not keep pace with the cost of borrowings. The observed changes in the deposit mix, with a shift towards more money market deposits, reflect a reaction to the interest rate environment and may influence the bank's liquidity management strategies.From a balance sheet perspective, a slight decrease in total assets coupled with a marginal drop in total loans suggests conservative asset growth in a potentially volatile economic context. The cautious stance is reinforced by the stability of the bank's capital position, as reflected by a 1.4% increase in total equity. This prudence might be a strategic response to the CEO's comments on economic turmoil and interest rate uncertainty. Risk Management Analyst Parke Bancorp's provision for credit losses, which swung from a recovery to an expense, merits attention. The bank's decision to increase its provision for credit losses by $0.2 million indicates a more conservative view on potential loan defaults, particularly within the residential and multi-family loan portfolios. While the current ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total loans is relatively stable, maintaining a high ratio of allowance to non-performing loans (456.8%) reflects a strong buffer against potential credit losses.Moreover, the slight reduction in non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets to 0.42% is a positive sign. The increase in loans past due 30 to 89 days, however, requires monitoring as it might be an early indicator of future credit quality issues. Investors should consider the bank's credit risk profile and management's approach to provisioning as part of their evaluation of the bank's resilience to economic fluctuations. Market Analyst The CEO's commentary offers insights into the bank's operational environment, highlighting challenges such as economic turmoil and interest rate confusion. The reference to higher-than-expected inflation suggests a potentially prolonged period of elevated interest rates, which may affect borrowing costs and influence consumer and business lending activity.In response to these conditions, the bank's commitment to an improved net interest margin and tight expense control is a strategic approach that could support profitability. However, the bank's growth prospects appear contingent on the market's adjustment to higher interest rates and the ability to finance new projects. Investors should therefore weigh the bank's short-term caution against its potential to capitalize on market opportunities as economic conditions evolve. 04/19/2024 - 04:15 PM Highlights: Net Income: $6.1 million for Q1 2024 Revenue: $30.5 million for Q1 2024 Total Assets: $2.01 billion, decreased 0.7% from December 31, 2023 Total Loans: $1.79 billion, decreased 0.1% over December 31, 2023 Total Deposits: $1.56 billion, increased 0.7% from December 31, 2023 WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP, N.J., April 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Parke Bancorp, Inc. (""Parke Bancorp"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: ""PKBK""), the parent company of Parke Bank, announced its operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. Highlights for the three months ended March 31, 2024: Net income available to common shareholders was $6.1 million, or $0.51 per basic common share and $0.51 per diluted common share, for the three months ended March 31, 2024, a decrease of $5.0 million, or 44.8%, compared to net income available to common shareholders of $11.1 million, or $0.93 per basic common share and $0.92 per diluted common share, for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower net interest income, an increase in the provision for credit losses, and lower non-interest income.Net interest income decreased 18.0% to $14.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $17.1 million for the same period in 2023.Provision for credit losses was $0.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to a recovery for credit losses of $2.4 million for the same period in 2023.Non-interest income decreased $0.7 million, or 40.4%, to $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $1.8 million for the same period in 2023.Non-interest expense decreased $0.2 million, or 3.3%, to $6.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $6.8 million for the same period in 2023.The following is a recap of the significant items that impacted the three months ended March 31, 2024: Interest income increased $3.5 million for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in interest and fees on loans of $3.5 million to $28.1 million, a 14.4% increase, primarily driven by an increase in average outstanding loan balances and higher market interest rates. This was partially offset by a decrease in interest earned on average deposits held at the Federal Reserve Bank (""FRB"") of $0.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024, due to lower average balances being held on such deposits. Interest expense increased $6.5 million, or 73.8%, to $15.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher market interest rates, combined with changes in the mix of deposits and borrowings. The provision for credit losses was $0.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to a recovery of $2.4 million for the same period in 2023. The provision recovery for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was driven by a decrease in the construction loan portfolio post CECL implementation that resulted in the provision recovery, while the increase in provision expense during the three months ended March 31, 2024, was due to a change in the mix of the loan portfolio resulting in an increase in the qualitative loss factors, mainly attributed to the residential 1 - 4 family investment and multi-family loan portfolios. Non-interest income decreased $0.7 million, or 40.4%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily as a result of a decrease in service fees on deposit accounts of $0.8 million, partially offset by an increase in other loan fees $0.1 million. Non-interest expense decreased $0.2 million, or 3.3%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily driven by a decrease in compensation and benefits of $0.4 million, and a decrease in professional service fees of $0.1 million, partially offset by an increase in OREO expense of $0.2 million, and an increase in FDIC insurance assessments of $0.1 million. Income tax expense decreased $1.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was 26.6%, compared to 23.6% for the same period in 2023. March 31, 2024 discussion of financial condition Total assets decreased to $2.01 billion at March 31, 2024, from $2.02 billion at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $14.4 million, or 0.71%, primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents, net loans, and other assets.Cash and cash equivalents totaled $171.1 million at March 31, 2024, as compared to $180.4 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to a decrease in borrowings, partially offset by an increase in deposits.The investment securities portfolio decreased to $15.9 million at March 31, 2024, from $16.4 million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $0.5 million, or 2.9%, primarily due to pay downs of securities.Gross loans decreased $1.8 million or 0.1%, to $1.79 billion at March 31, 2024.Nonperforming loans at March 31, 2024 decreased to $7.0 million, representing 0.39% of total loans, a decrease of $0.3 million, or 3.8%, from $7.3 million of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2023. Other Real Estate Owned (""OREO"") at March 31, 2024 was $1.6 million, unchanged from December 31, 2023. Nonperforming assets (consisting of nonperforming loans and OREO) represented 0.42% and 0.44% of total assets at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Loans past due 30 to 89 days were $1.1 million at March 31, 2024, an increase of $0.9 million from December 31, 2023.The allowance for credit losses was $31.9 million at March 31, 2024, as compared to $32.1 million at December 31, 2023. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total loans was 1.79% and 1.80% at March 31, 2024 and at December 31, 2023, respectively. The ratio of allowance for credit losses to non-performing loans was 456.8% at March 31, 2024, compared to 442.5%, at December 31, 2023.Other assets decreased $2.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024, to $8.4 million at March 31, 2024 from $10.5 million at December 31, 2023, primarily driven by a decrease of $2.0 million in prepaid taxes.Total deposits were $1.56 billion at March 31, 2024, up from $1.55 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of $10.9 million or 0.7% compared to December 31, 2023. The increase in deposits was attributed to an increase in money market deposits of $77.0 million, and an increase in interest demand deposits of $4.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in non-interest demand deposits of $35.8 million, a decrease in time deposits of $23.3 million, and a decrease in savings deposits of $11.4 million.Total borrowings decreased $30.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024, to $138.2 million at March 31, 2024 from $168.1 million at December 31, 2023, driven by $30.0 million of FHLBNY term borrowing maturities.Total equity increased to $288.4 million at March 31, 2024, up from $284.3 million at December 31, 2023, an increase of $4.1 million, or 1.4%, primarily due to the retention of earnings, partially offset by the payment of $2.2 million of cash dividends. Tangible book value per common share at March 31, 2024 was $24.08, compared to $23.75 at December 31, 2023.CEO outlook and commentary Vito S. Pantilione, President and Chief Executive Officer of Parke Bancorp, Inc. and Parke Bank, provided the following statement: ""Economic turmoil and interest rate confusion continued in the first quarter of 2024. Subsequent to previous Fed comments indicating lowering interest rates in 2024, based on their belief that inflation was coming under control, reports came out indicating inflation is still higher than expected. It now appears that the Feds will need to push back their projected rate cuts. Increased funding costs continued to outpace the increase in the loan portfolio yield in the 1st quarter, reducing net interest income. Slow loan growth continued in the 1st quarter of 2024 as it was difficult to qualify new projects due to higher debt service caused by higher interest rates. However, we are seeing more activity in potential borrowers adjusting to the higher interest rates and beginning to pursue financing. We believe that there is potential to increase the rate of growth of our loan portfolio, although caution is still warranted."" ""Continued tight control of our expenses combined with an anticipated improved net interest margin supports projected profitability. The market turmoil dictates continued strength of our Allowance for Credit Losses, which is 1.79%. We are well structured with strong capital and reserves, allowing us to continue to be aware of opportunities in the market, and if positive, move forward while maintaining a safe and sound bank.""

Permianville Royalty Trust (NYSE : PVL) a annoncé le calcul de l'intérêt net des bénéfices pour avril 2024, révélant un déficit d'environ 1,9 million de dollars dû à des dépenses en capital élevées. En conséquence, aucune distribution mensuelle ne sera effectuée en mai 2024. Le Trust reprendra les distributions une fois que le déficit cumulé d'environ 4,5 millions de dollars sera éliminé. Les volumes de ventes enregistrés et les recettes en espèces ont augmenté de manière significative d'un mois à l'autre, entraînés par de nouveaux puits dans le Permien. Les dépenses d'exploitation totales accumulées et les dépenses en capital ont également enregistré des augmentations notables. Le sponsor a indiqué que le Trust devrait retourner à la génération de bénéfices nets positifs plus tard en 2024. Permianville Royalty Trust (NYSE: PVL) gab die Berechnung des Nettogewinnanteils für April 2024 bekannt und enthüllte ein Defizit von etwa 1,9 Millionen Dollar aufgrund hoher Kapitalausgaben. Folglich wird im Mai 2024 keine monatliche Ausschüttung erfolgen. Der Trust wird die Ausschüttungen wieder aufnehmen, sobald das kumulative Nettogewinndefizit von ungefähr 4,5 Millionen Dollar beseitigt ist. Die registrierten Verkaufsvolumina und Bareinnahmen stiegen deutlich von Monat zu Monat, angetrieben durch neue Permian-Bohrungen. Auch die gesamten aufgelaufenen Betriebsausgaben und Kapitalausgaben verzeichneten deutliche Zunahmen. Der Sponsor deutete an, dass erwartet wird, dass der Trust später im Jahr 2024 wieder positive Nettogewinne erzielen wird. Positive Recorded oil cash receipts totaled $7.8 million for the current month, up $5.5 million from the prior month. Natural gas cash receipts amounted to $1.1 million for the current month, up $0.7 million from the prior month. Total accrued operating expenses increased to $2.9 million, with a $0.4 million month-over-month increase. Capital expenditures rose to $8.5 million, a $6.6 million increase from the prior period. The Trust incurred a shortfall of approximately $1.9 million due to elevated capital expenditures, leading to no distribution in May 2024. The cumulative net profits shortfall amounts to approximately $4.5 million, which needs to be eliminated for distributions to resume. The Sponsor anticipates the Trust will return to generating positive net profits later in 2024. Negative Elevated capital expenditures led to a shortfall of approximately $1.9 million, impacting distributions to unitholders. The Trust incurred a significant total accrued operating expenses increase of $2.9 million. A notable increase in capital expenditures to $8.5 million was recorded. The cumulative net profits shortfall of approximately $4.5 million poses a challenge for future distributions. If the Trust's cash on hand is insufficient to cover expenses, no further distributions will be made to unitholders. The Trust's net profits interest will only receive proceeds once the cumulative net profits shortfall is eliminated. 04/19/2024 - 04:15 PM HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Permianville Royalty Trust (NYSE: PVL, the “Trust”) today announced the net profits interest calculation for April 2024. The net profits interest calculation represents reported oil production for the month of January 2024 and reported natural gas production during December 2023. The calculation includes accrued costs incurred in February 2024. As a result of the elevated capital expenditures recorded this month as described below, for which timing is not always ratable month-to-month, direct operating and development expenses exceeded cash receipts, leading to a shortfall of approximately $1.9 million this month. As a result, no monthly distribution will be paid in May 2024 to the Trust’s unitholders of record on April 30, 2024. Distributions to the Trust will resume once the cumulative net profits shortfall, which now totals approximately $4.5 million, is eliminated. The following table displays reported underlying oil and natural gas sales volumes and average received wellhead prices attributable to the current and prior month recorded net profits interest calculations. Underlying Sales Volumes Average Price Oil Natural Gas Oil Natural Gas Bbls Bbls/D Mcf Mcf/D (per Bbl) (per Mcf) Current Month 100,185 3,232 354,556 11,437 $ 78.32 $ 3.09 Prior Month 31,680 1,022 201,825 6,728 $ 72.37 $ 2.18 Recorded oil cash receipts from the oil and gas properties underlying the Trust (the “Underlying Properties”) totaled $7.8 million for the current month on realized wellhead prices of $78.32/Bbl, up $5.5 million from the prior month’s oil cash receipts. Oil production and oil cash receipts increased materially month-over-month partly because of the inclusion of 15 new Permian wells that have now either turned to sales or for which title work has been completed, thereby allowing production and revenues attributable to prior periods to be released by the operators of the Underlying Properties. Recorded natural gas cash receipts from the Underlying Properties totaled $1.1 million for the current month on realized wellhead prices of $3.09/Mcf, up $0.7 million from the prior month. The increase in natural gas production and cash receipts month-over-month was due in part to the 15 new Permian wells discussed above that featured production and revenues attributable to prior periods. Total accrued operating expenses for the period were $2.9 million, a $0.4 million increase month-over-month, due in part to the increase in reported production. Capital expenditures increased $6.6 million from the prior period to $8.5 million. COERT Holdings 1, LLC (the “Sponsor”) has indicated to the Trustee that this month’s capital expenditures were primarily from 18 new drilling projects, 15 of which were listed in the Capex Drilling Activity Update table presented in the Trust’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 22, 2024, with the remaining three representing new projects undertaken by an existing, large cap public operator of the Underlying Properties that were not previously scheduled. In addition, during the current month the Sponsor leased an aggregate of approximately $0.1 million in non-producing, non-cash-flowing acreage to two different private oil companies for upfront cash payments in addition to future royalty revenues if the properties eventually turn to sales. These properties remain burdened by the Trust’s net profits interest. The cumulative shortfall in net profits for the current month will be deducted from any net profits in next month’s net profits interest calculation. The Trust will not receive proceeds pursuant to its net profits interest until the cumulative net profits shortfall is eliminated. In addition, if the Trust’s cash on hand is not sufficient to pay ordinary course administrative expenses and the Trust borrows funds or draws on the letter of credit that has been provided to the Trust, or if the Sponsor advances funds to the Trust to pay such expenses, no further distributions will be made to Trust unitholders until such amounts borrowed or drawn, or advanced to the Trust, are repaid. At this time based on current commodity prices, the Sponsor anticipates that the Underlying Properties will return to generating positive net profits later in 2024. About Permianville Royalty Trust Permianville Royalty Trust is a Delaware statutory trust formed to own a net profits interest representing the right to receive 80% of the net profits from the sale of oil and natural gas production from certain, predominantly non-operated, oil and gas properties in the states of Texas, Louisiana and New Mexico. As described in the Trust’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), the amount of the periodic distributions is expected to fluctuate, depending on the proceeds received by the Trust as a result of actual production volumes, oil and gas prices, the amount and timing of capital expenditures, and the Trust’s administrative expenses, among other factors. Future distributions are expected to be made on a monthly basis. For additional information on the Trust, please visit www.permianvilleroyaltytrust.com. Forward-Looking Statements and Cautionary Statements This press release contains statements that are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements contained in this press release, other than statements of historical facts, are “forward-looking statements” for purposes of these provisions. These forward-looking statements include the amount and date of any anticipated distribution to unitholders and expectations regarding the future generation of net profits from the Underlying Properties. The anticipated distribution is based, in large part, on the amount of cash received or expected to be received by the Trust from the Sponsor with respect to the relevant period. The amount of such cash received or expected to be received by the Trust (and its ability to pay distributions) has been and will continue to be directly affected by the volatility in commodity prices, which can fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors that are beyond the control of the Trust and the Sponsor. Low oil and natural gas prices will reduce profits to which the Trust is entitled, which will reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to unitholders and in certain periods could result in no distributions to unitholders. Other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include expenses of the Trust, reserves for anticipated future expenses, and public health concerns, such as the COVID‑19 pandemic. In addition, future monthly capital expenditures may exceed the average levels experienced in 2023 and prior periods, which could reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to unitholders and in certain periods could result in no distributions to unitholders. Statements made in this press release are qualified by the cautionary statements made in this press release. Neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee intends, and neither assumes any obligation, to update any of the statements included in this press release. An investment in units issued by the Trust is subject to the risks described in the Trust’s filings with the SEC, including the risks described in the Trust’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 22, 2024.

Negative The termination of the CO2 Injection Agreement by Denbury, a subsidiary of ExxonMobil, could impact the company's revenue and future projects negatively. Financial Analyst The termination of the CO2 Injection Agreement by Denbury, a subsidiary of ExxonMobil, may have immediate financial implications for Biloxi Marsh Lands Corporation. Investors should pay close attention to the revenue streams from such contracts, as they often represent a significant portion of a company's projected earnings. With a dispute over payment, the stakeholder's concern may be around potential loss of income and the impact on the cash flow statements. The absence of this revenue could result in a reevaluation of the company's financial health, potentially affecting its stock value. Legal Expert The ongoing dispute presents possible legal ramifications. The specifics of the CO2 Injection Agreement and the nature of the disagreement over payments, could lead to a protracted legal dispute. It is critical to analyze the company's past legal expenditures and set them against the current situation to anticipate the potential financial burden. Moreover, this dispute with a subsidiary of a major oil company like ExxonMobil could potentially draw considerable legal resources from Biloxi Marsh Lands Corporation, thereby influencing their operational expenses and possibly diverting focus from other strategic initiatives. Market Research Analyst For retail investors, it’s important to assess the broader market implications of such a termination. The energy sector is often influenced by contractual agreements and their maintenance. Investors should monitor industry benchmarks regarding contract terminations and disputes to gauge the severity of this situation. Furthermore, the market's perception of Biloxi's ability to manage and sustain important contracts can affect investor confidence, thereby influencing stock volatility and trading volumes. 04/19/2024 - 05:00 PM METAIRIE, La.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Biloxi Marsh Lands Corporation has posted its unaudited results for the first quarter of 2024 on the Company’s website www.biloximarshlandscorp.com.

Such participation in the Offering constitutes a ""related party transaction"" as defined in Multilateral Instrument 61-101 - Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (""61-101""). The Offering is exempt from the formal valuation and minority shareholder approval requirements of 61-101 as neither the fair market value of the securities issued to related parties nor the consideration for such securities exceed 25% of the Company's market capitalization. The Company did not file a material change report 21 days prior to closing of the Offering as the participation of insiders of the Company in the Offering had not been confirmed at that time.A finder's fee of 6% cash totaling $33,120 was paid to certain finders.

Our 2024 program will continue as planned to test the Campbell shear structure some 600 metres below the existing working of the Con Mine which produced 5.1 Moz of gold at an average grade of 16 g/t.""The current drill program at the Con Mine is aimed at increasing our current Indicated and Inferred resource (MRE October 2022) near surface and south of the Con Mine, targeting the prolific Campbell Shear structure which produced 14 Moz of gold at an average grade of 16-22 g/t Au. The current drilling is targeting below the existing underground workings, where the potential exists to add significant free milling high grade ore. The Con Mine property has excellent infrastructure including the Robertson shaft, water treatment plan (2015), warehouse and offices, etc. The Con Mine closed in 2003, with approximately 650,000 ounces at 11-12 g/t Au in historic reserves and combined resources.

D., P. Geo., SGS Geological Services, which can be found on the Company's website at https://www.goldterracorp.com and on SEDAR at www.sedarplus.com.About Gold TerraThe Yellowknife Project (YP) encompasses 918 sq. km of contiguous land immediately north, south and east of the City of Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories. Through a series of acquisitions, Gold Terra controls one of the six major high-grade gold camps in Canada. Being within 10 kilometres of the City of Yellowknife, the YP is close to vital infrastructure, including all-season roads, air transportation, service providers, hydro-electric power, and skilled tradespeople. Gold Terra is currently focusing its drilling on the prolific Campbell Shear, where approximately 14 Moz of gold has been produced, (refer to Gold Terra Oct 21, 2022, Technical Report) and most recently on the Con Mine Option (CMO) property claims immediately south of the past producing Con Mine which produced 6.1 Moz between the Con, Rycon, and Campbell shear structures (1938-2003).The YP and CMO properties lie on the prolific Yellowknife greenstone belt, covering nearly 70 kilometres of strike length along the main mineralized shear system that hosts the former-producing high-grade Con and Giant gold mines. The Company's exploration programs have successfully identified significant zones of gold mineralization and multiple targets that remain to be tested which reinforces the Company's objective of re-establishing Yellowknife as one of the premier gold mining districts in Canada.Visit our website at www.goldterracorp.com.For more information, please contact:Gerald Panneton, Chairman & CEOgpanneton@goldterracorp.comMara Strazdins, Investor RelationsPhone: 1-778-897-1590 | 604-689-1749 ext 102strazdins@goldterracorp.comNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking InformationCertain statements made and information contained in this news release constitute ""forward-looking information"" within the meaning of applicable securities legislation (""forward-looking information"").

(the “Company” or “CIB Marine”) (OTCQX: CIBH), the holding company of CIBM Bank (the “Bank”), announced its unaudited results of operations and financial condition for the quarter and three months ended March 31, 2024. During the quarter, CIBM Bank’s loan portfolio growth slowed to $14 million and deposits grew $45 million, allowing the Bank to reduce borrowings by $45 million, improve its liquidity profile, and control cost of funds. The Mortgage Division improved its operating results versus the first quarter of 2023, but did have an operating loss as a result of the severe production environment created by higher interest rates and lack of housing supply. Income before tax was $0.2 million for the first quarter of 2024, nominally higher than the fourth quarter of 2023. Net income was $0.2 million for the first quarter of 2024 or $0.13 basic and $0.10 diluted net income per share, compared to a loss of $0.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2023 or $0.67 basic and $0.67 diluted net loss per share. Net income for the first quarter of 2023 was $0.2 million or $0.17 basic or $0.13 diluted net income per share. Financial highlights for the quarter include: CIBM Bank’s loan portfolio balances increased $14 million, primarily from funding prior commercial real estate construction loans and other new commercial segment loans. This is down from $33 million of growth in the fourth quarter of 2023. Loan portfolio growth is expected to continue to decline due to higher loan rates and balance sheet management. Deposits increased by $45 million, primarily in time deposits and money market accounts, as lower-cost fundings were used to reduce higher-cost short term borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago (“FHLB”). This helped to control some of the cost of funds pressures for the period and improved the Bank’s liquidity profile as the loan to deposit ratio declined from 98% at December 31, 2023, to 94% at March 31, 2024, and borrowing availability with the FHLB increased.As of March 31, 2024, non-performing assets, modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, and loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing to total assets and nonaccrual loans to total loans ratios were 0.89% and 0.48%, respectively, compared to 0.90% and 0.50%, respectively, on December 31, 2023, and 0.14% and 0.08%, respectively, on March 31, 2023. Also, as of March 31, 2024, the allowance for credit losses on loans (“ACLL”) to loans was 1.23% compared to an ACLL of 1.27% on December 31, 2023, and 1.51% on March 31, 2023. The ACLL qualitative factors, including in the assessment of the ACLL, include economic forecasts obtained from third parties. Over the course of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, gross domestic product and unemployment forecasts have improved with declining recession risk resulting in a lower ACLL to loans ratio.Net interest margin was down 12 basis points from the prior quarter as the increase in the cost of funds was more than the increase in the yields on earning assets. Although progress was made in controlling the cost of funds by reducing our high-cost borrowings and replacing them with lower cost deposits, this progress was offset by certain other deposit relationship cost increases and higher cost renewals of time deposits. Net interest income was down $0.2 million from the fourth quarter of 2023 and down $0.9 million from the first quarter of 2023.For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, Banking Division net income was $0.8 million, down $0.2 million from the same period in 2023, and Mortgage Division net loss was $0.3 million, improved by $0.2 million due to prior cost saving actions and certain new hire costs in 2023, despite the continued market challenges. The remaining $0.3 million net loss was from parent company sub-debt and administration expenses. Reflecting on the quarter, Mr. J. Brian Chaffin, CIB Marine’s President and CEO, commented, “We have had some real successes this past quarter in a number of areas. Our solid deposit growth has resulted in an improved liquidity profile and, based on current forecasts, we believe it will lead to improved net interest margins in the future. Our targeted cost controls from last year are in place and have offset some of the decline in revenues. “In this environment of constrained revenues, we continue to use balance sheet management to improve capital ratios in support of future preferred stock redemptions. Under this strategy, we expect slow – possibly even negative – loan growth in the foreseeable future, as well as possible asset sales, such as the sale of $2.7 million SBA 7(a) guaranteed loans for a gain of $0.2 million that we completed in the first quarter. “In addition, due to continued challenges in mortgage banking largely originating from a shortfall in housing supply and high interest rates, and after evaluating many options, we significantly reduced ongoing operating costs for future periods with reductions of operations and less productive sales staff, and adjusted certain fees and compensation arrangements at the end of the first quarter of 2024 to improve the range of potential outcomes to include a profitable year in the Mortgage Division.” He concluded, “We plan on covering a number of important topics related to our operating results and capital plans for our shareholders in more detail at the Annual Shareholder Meeting scheduled for Thursday, April 25th. We encourage shareholders to visit our website for additional details regarding our virtual shareholder meeting, and to review the meeting materials.” CIB Marine Bancshares, Inc. is the holding company for CIBM Bank, which operates nine banking offices in Illinois, Wisconsin, and Indiana, and has mortgage loan officers and/or offices in nine states.

Positive Park National (PRK) reported a 4.4% increase in net income to $35.2 million for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.06 per common share, payable on June 10, 2024. Park's total loans increased by 0.7% during the first quarter of 2024 and by 6.1% for the 12-month period ending March 31, 2024. Park National has $9.9 billion in total assets as of March 31, 2024, and operates through its subsidiary The Park National Bank. Park's focus on customer service and community impact is reflected in its consistent approach to building long-lasting relationships. Negative None. Financial Analyst In the financial quarter under scrutiny, Park National Corporation exhibited a 4.4 percent increase in net income, raising investor confidence in the company's profitability and hinting at operational efficiency. Notably, a dividend of $1.06 per common share has been announced, which signals a stable cash return to shareholders and underscores the firm's commitment to shareholder value. The growth in net income per diluted common share from $2.07 to $2.17 also points to robust earnings performance.From a loan portfolio perspective, the modest 0.7 percent uptick in total loans over the quarter, with a 6.1% increase year-over-year, may indicate cautious lending or market saturation. However, it does reflect a strategic approach to risk management, which could be appealing to risk-averse investors. The total asset valuation of $9.9 billion underlines the scale of Park's operations, solidifying its market position. Market Research Analyst The banking sector remains highly competitive and Park National Corporation's emphasis on customer service and community involvement positions it favorably in terms of brand loyalty and local market penetration. This relational approach is a significant differentiator, especially in an industry often criticized for lacking personal engagement. Their strategy potentially fosters long-term customer retention, which may lead to sustained loan and deposit growth, beneficial to the company's long-term health.However, the relatively flat loan growth could signal a challenge in expanding the bank's market share or potentially prudent lending in a fluctuating economic environment. Stakeholders should monitor how Park adapts to economic conditions and competitive pressures to maintain loan growth without compromising credit quality. 04/19/2024 - 04:15 PM NEWARK, Ohio, April 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Park National Corporation (Park) (NYSE American: PRK) today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2024.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Junee Limited's recent Initial Public Offering (IPO) represents a significant influx of capital, slated to bolster the company's operational capabilities. The $8 million raised, while modest by some industry standards, is indicative of investor confidence in Junee's market niche and growth trajectory. The success of this IPO hinges on the strategic use of this capital for service expansion, strategic investments and acquisitions, which can create an environment ripe for organic and inorganic growth.Investors should note that the firm commitment basis of the offering reflects underwriter confidence, a positive signal. The underwriters' option to purchase additional shares could further indicate market reception and potential upside. However, the dilutive effect of additional share distribution must be weighed against the potential capital benefits. Smart allocation of the raised funds towards the stated objectives will be key for future growth and return on investment. Market Research Analyst The interior design and maintenance sector in Hong Kong has seen steady demand, suggesting a favorable environment for Junee's entry into the public market. With a ticker symbol JUNE, the company has positioned itself well for brand recognition. However, market success will depend on Junee's ability to differentiate itself in a competitive landscape.Junee's strategic investments and potential acquisitions should be monitored closely for their alignment with the company's core competencies and the broader market trends. A key factor for investors to watch is how effectively Junee can leverage its IPO funds to gain market share and achieve economies of scale, which could lead to improved margins and profitability in the longer term. 04/19/2024 - 04:30 PM Hong Kong, April 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Junee Limited (the “Company” or “Junee”), a provider of interior design, fit-out and maintenance services in Hong Kong, today announced the closing of its initial public offering (the “Offering”) of 2,000,000 ordinary shares at a price of $4.00 per share.

Negative The company faces delisting from Nasdaq if it fails to appeal the determination by April 22, 2024, resulting in a suspension of securities and removal from listing and registration. Non-compliance with multiple Nasdaq listing rules poses a significant challenge for Warrantee Inc. Financial Analyst Warrantee Inc.'s recent notification from Nasdaq flags a critical issue for investors as it reflects fundamental challenges in maintaining compliance with market requirements. The failure to meet the minimum bid price is often a red flag, potentially indicative of low investor confidence or financial instability. The company's inability to file the required Form 6-K further compounds these concerns, signaling potential internal disarray or financial complications that could have far-reaching implications. For shareholders, these developments require close monitoring, especially considering the serious consequences of delisting, such as reduced liquidity and limited access to capital markets. Legal Analyst The procedural aspect of Warrantee Inc.'s situation, involving the appeal to a Nasdaq Hearings Panel, creates a situation laden with uncertainty. The appeal process, while offering a temporary reprieve, does not guarantee that the underlying issues leading to the initial delisting notice will be rectified. Delisting can have significant legal repercussions for a company, including potential investor lawsuits if shareholders feel misled or that the company did not adequately address the issues leading to delisting. Investors should be aware of these legal entanglements that could affect the company's future performance and its management's ability to navigate effectively through compliance challenges. Market Research Analyst In examining Warrantee Inc.'s strategic options such as a reverse stock split to counter the delisting threat, investors must consider the market perception of such actions. While a reverse stock split may technically elevate the share price above the minimum bid requirement, it does not inherently solve the underlying financial health issues. It's also a temporary solution that can often be viewed unfavorably by the market, as it can be perceived as a cosmetic fix rather than a substantive improvement in company performance or prospects. Investors will need to weigh any short-term gains from staying listed against the potential long-term impact on share value and corporate reputation. 04/19/2024 - 04:05 PM Tokyo, Japan, April 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Warrantee Inc. (Nasdaq: WRNT) (the “Company” or “Warrantee”), a Japanese marketing and market research technology company, today announced that the Company received a staff determination letter (the “Letter”), on April 15, 2024, from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that, due to the Company's failure to regain compliance with a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the ""Minimum Bid Requirement""), the Staff has determined (the “Determination”) that Company's securities will be scheduled for delisting from Nasdaq unless the Company requests an appeal of this determination to a Hearings Panel (the ""Panel""). On October 13, 2023, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq (the ""Notice""), notifying the Company that based upon the closing bid price of its securities for the last 30 consecutive business days preceding the Notice, the Company was not in compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement. In accordance with Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Notice provided the Company a period of 180 calendar days from the date of the Notice, or until April 10, 2024, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement. According to the Letter, the Company had not regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement as of April 10, 2024 and is not eligible for a second 180-day period. Specifically, the Company does not comply with the initial listing requirement of $5,000,000 minimum stockholders’ equity for The Nasdaq Capital Market, as contemplated for a second 180-day period. Further, on April 4, 2024, Nasdaq notified the Company that since the Company failed to file its Form 6-K containing an interim balance sheet and income statement for the six-month period ended September 30, 2023, it no longer complies with our Listing Rule 5250(c)(2). This matter serves as an additional and separate basis for delisting. Unless the Company requests an appeal of the Determination by April 22, 2024, the Company’s securities will be suspended at the opening of business on April 24, 2024, and a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which will remove the Company’s securities from listing and registration on Nasdaq. The Company plans to appeal the Determination to the Panel in due course. A hearing request will stay the suspension of the Company’s securities and the filing of Form 25-NSE pending the Panel’s decision. The Company is considering all options available to it, including a reverse stock split, and will provide its shareholders with material updates when they are available. About Warrantee Inc.

(NASDAQ: VSACU, VSAC, VSACW) (the “Company” or “VSAC”), a special purpose acquisition company, issues an update regarding the previously announced staff determination letter (the ""Letter"") received on January 17, 2024, from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq"") notifying the Company of the determination from the Nasdaq Staff (the ""Staff""). As stated, the Letter was issued to the Company as the Company is not in compliance with the market value requirement as set forth Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A) (the “Market Value Requirement”), and the minimum 400 total holders requirement, as is required by Listing Rule 5450(a)(2) (the “Total Holders Requirement”). The Letter also states that the Company has not yet filed its Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2023 (the “Filing”) and is therefore not in compliance with Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). On January 23, 2024, the Company submitted an appeal to the appeal Staff’s determination to a Hearings Panel (the “Panel”), pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5800 Series. This submission included a detailed Compliance Plan, to present to the Panel, to regain compliance with the Listing Rules and also requested a stay of the suspension of the Company’s securities. The Hearing request has stayed the suspension of the Company’s securities and the filing of the Form 25-NSE with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC""). On January 24, 2024, the Company was notified, by the Nasdaq Hearings Advisor, that the hearing is scheduled to be held on April 4, 2024. The Company's securities are still eligible to trade on Nasdaq. VSAC noted that the deficiencies related to the Market Value Requirement and the Total Holders Requirement are common for SPACs at the Company's current stage of completing a planned transaction. In its Compliance Plan submitted to Staff, VSAC has noted that the recently announced business combination with Mediforum Co., Ltd. (“Mediforum”) will automatically resolve these deficiencies. The Company also noted that, if necessary, it can also consider implementing alternative solutions to the deficiencies to regain compliance with (a) the Market Value Requirement, by converting its Series B shares into Series A shares coupled with moving the company’s listing to the Nasdaq Capital Market and (b) the Total Holders Requirement, by working with outside agencies to increase the number of Total Holders to above the minimum requirement. On, February 7, 2024, the Company filed the outstanding 10-Q and regained compliance with Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). On April 4, 2024, the Company met with the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (“Panel”) and the Company management addressed Staff’s concerns regarding timing issues in the business combination and presented a viable, concrete plan to regain compliance within the Panel’s discretionary period while continuing to pursue a business combination. On April 17, 2024, the Panel granted the request of VSAC to continue its listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market subject to the condition that on or before July 15, 2024, the Company will transfer its listing from the Nasdaq Global Market to the Nasdaq Capital Market and comply with all the applicable listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company must provide prompt notification of any significant events that occur during this period that may affect the Company’s compliance with the Nasdaq requirements, and the Nasdaq Hearing Panel reserves the right to reconsider the extension based on any event, condition or circumstance that exists or develops that would, in the opinion of the panel, make continued listing of the Company’s securities on Nasdaq inadvisable or unwarranted.

Kaman's common stock will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. The transaction was approved by Kaman shareholders on April 17, 2024. The acquisition aims to provide additional resources and expertise for Kaman to drive growth and innovation. Negative None. Financial Analyst The acquisition of Kaman Corporation by Arcline Investment Management represents a strategic move that significantly alters the financial landscape for the involved entities. The all-cash purchase price of $46.00 per share distributes a considerable sum of capital to the Kaman shareholders, which could imply an attractive exit multiple given the total enterprise value of $1.8 billion. This deal conveys a strong signal concerning the valuation of companies within this industrial sector. Post-acquisition, as Kaman transitions from a public to a private entity, it is essential for investors to consider the implications for liquidity. The cessation of trading and the delisting from the NYSE eliminate the ability to transact Kaman shares on a public market, which may affect shareholders who prefer or require the flexibility public markets offer. Additionally, the opportunity for Kaman to leverage Arcline’s resources for growth and innovation will likely reshape its operational strategies and market approach, potentially strengthening its positioning in the long term. Market Research Analyst Arcline's investment in Kaman underscores the importance of innovation and growth potential in the aerospace and defense sector, where Kaman has established a robust presence. Kaman's focus on engineered components and subsystems for mission-critical applications is a market niche with substantial barriers to entry due to the sophisticated technical requirements and rigorous regulatory landscape. By transitioning to a private structure, Kaman may benefit from more agile decision-making processes and a potentially enhanced ability to invest in long-term strategies without the quarterly earnings pressures faced by publicly traded entities. For industry observers and stakeholders, the key indicators to monitor will include the rate of new product development, market share expansion and operational efficiencies that can be harnessed post-acquisition. While the strategic realignment promises future growth, it's also vital to watch for the integration risks that often accompany such transactions. 04/19/2024 - 02:00 PM BLOOMFIELD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Kaman Corporation (“Kaman"" or the “Company”) today announced the completion of its acquisition by Arcline Investment Management, L.P. (""Arcline”) in an all-cash transaction with a total enterprise value of approximately $1.8 billion. The transaction was previously announced on January 19, 2024, and was approved by Kaman shareholders on April 17, 2024. With the completion of the transaction, Kaman shareholders will receive $46.00 per share in cash.

Negative None. 04/19/2024 - 02:14 PM MILAN--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Natuzzi chooses the stage of two among the most relevant global furniture events, High Point Market in North Carolina, and the Design Week in Milan, to unveil the dense program of events and projects that will mark the calendar of its 65th anniversary. Founded in 1959 by Pasquale Natuzzi, Natuzzi’s history has been, from its initial steps, marked by continuous innovation, while preserving its distinctive DNA that combines comfort, function and design to create harmonious living spaces. Natuzzi has influenced and inspired the furniture industry with its unique style and the introduction of colors in leather sofas since the early 70s. It is a story of success which led Natuzzi to the highest market share in the US for a non-American producer, and subsequently to the listing on Wall Street on May 13, 1993. Since the early 2000s, Natuzzi started a journey to become a globally recognized Brand. Today, 92.5% of sales comes from our Branded proposition and 63.5% from the retail channel. The Brand awareness, as validated by third party independent brand research institutes1, positions Natuzzi as the 1st Brand in the U.S., UK, and Spain, and the 2nd in China. This achievement has been cultivated over the years through an unwavering dedication to craftsmanship and design excellence. Pasquale Natuzzi, Chairman and founder of the Company, commented, ""When I founded this Company, I never dreamed we would achieve what we have achieved today with our team. Our transformation into a lifestyle brand, which began with a vision I initiated 20 years ago, has taken us far from our origins as a manufacturer. It gives me great emotion to see our stores globally bringing to life our Brand’s DNA. The quality of the projects we undertake for private residences around the world and our increasing presence in the hotels and hospitality sectors, with our newly established contract division, testify the legitimacy that our brands have achieved with designers and architects. Over the years, we have overcome challenges, like the one the world is facing these days, and embraced opportunities, always staying confident in the potential of our team and our vision. The Company has evolved and continues to evolve, but our values remain unchanged: a relentless pursuit of harmony, ethics in all forms, customer centricity, product innovation, respect and gratefulness for our artisans that, in our own Italian factories, manufacture our collections. All these elements contribute to make our vision come true: improve the lives of people around the world, one customer at the time, one city at the time. That vision led us to be now present in over 100 markets. As I sensed when I started the Company, I am convinced the best is yet to come. The network of our stores and galleries globally, the strength of our Brands, the retail and commercial tools we developed so far, the dealers and clients who have been trusting us for decades, are an incredible growth platform that, I am sure, our team now will leverage to accelerate our journey and bring our brands to the new heights it deserves.” High Point Market, (held from 13th to 17th April 2024) and Milano Design Week (held from 16th to 21st April 2024), the two most important furniture and design exhibitions in the world, have been the ideal venues to present the latest news regarding retail and product collections to clients, dealers and leading architects all over the world. Natuzzi presented 5 key commercial novelties to accelerate growth: Natuzzi Italia Store format evolution. Natuzzi presented an evolved version for its Natuzzi Italia store architecture, realized with particular attention to sustainability, modularity, ease of implementation, and cost efficiency, bringing collections to the center of the store experience. The Durini flagship store, at the heart of the Design District in Milan, has unveiled the new retail format which now becomes the reference for our 238 Natuzzi Italia stores globally. The evolution of the store format is part of our retail strategy for Natuzzi Italia, which aims to accelerate organic growth by creating an immersive customer experience. Natuzzi will also continue to look for opportunities to further expand its retail presence in key regions, beginning with the US. Natuzzi Italia Design Studio. The business with the Architects & Designers Community through total home design projects has become a key driver of growth for our retail. In the US, the Trade business accounts for 22% of total Natuzzi Italia turnover. Trade sale tickets are on average 43% higher than consumer ones. Trade has reached, in 2023, €0.3-0.4 million for individual residential projects. Our new Design Studio, which will be rolled-out in the key stores globally, is now the perfect hub for the creation of comprehensive interior design projects. Reimagined Gallery Project. Wholesale branded today is 40% of our business. A key aspect of our strategy is the upgrade of our 'gallery' format. We launched a “reimagined gallery format”: an enhanced store-in-store concept, where we meticulously curated merchandising to deliver an immersive brand experience. The “reimagined gallery” will be used now to standardize our brand gallery representation of Natuzzi within multi-brand environments. Natuzzi Italia COMFORTNESS Project. The 'Comfortness' collection stems from Natuzzi's DNA, combining two words: 'comfort' and 'wellness”. Each of the two words has held a profound meaning for Natuzzi since its origin. The 'Comfortness' collection presents products that blend Natuzzi style with motion and technological innovation to deliver tangible wellness benefits to the consumer, as the iconic Re-Vive chair, which celebrates 10 years from its introduction. The 2024 'Comfortness' collection marks an acceleration in terms of product innovation and technology contamination, with the introduction of the “Mindful” line. 'Mindful' is a game-changing sofa-system, that features a series of innovations such as the 'Zero-gravity reclining motion' and the '365 motion”, that provides dynamic comfort by synchronizing breathing and heartbeat while seated. The 'Comfortness' collection has been excitedly welcomed by the Natuzzi community of dealers and architects. New collections Natuzzi Italia launched 5 new models. Two of them were designed by our Natuzzi Design Center, where more than 70 people constantly work on innovation and design, a true asset of our Company, while 3 new models have been created with the collaboration of established international designers as part of the celebrations for the 65th anniversary of the Company. These three new designs, realized with Karim Rashid, Simone Bonanni, and Andrea Steidl, are an interpretation of the past, the present and the future of Natuzzi’s design ethos. Natuzzi Editions launched 6 new models all designed by our Natuzzi Design Center. “High Point and the Milan Design Week have been pivotal events for meeting our clients and dealers. These events contribute to fully unleash the potential of the new collections and improved retail format, accelerating our organic growth. The best tribute we can pay to Natuzzi, for its 65th anniversary, is to deliver the growth that the strengths of its brand, its heritage and partners deserve,” Antonio Achille, CEO of Natuzzi commented.

PETERSBURG, Fla., April 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The Arbor Day Foundation has recognized Duke Energy Florida for its tree care practices by naming the company a ""Tree Line USA"" utility for the 18th year in a row. Duke Energy achieved Tree Line USA status by meeting certain criteria such as following industry standards for quality tree care, including proper pruning, annually training employees and contractors in best practices, sponsoring tree plantings and public education programs, and participating in annual Arbor Day events. One such event is Duke Energy's annual tree giveaway in partnership with the Arbor Day Foundation's Energy-Saving Trees program. Each January, Duke Energy customers can order a free tree in honor of Florida Arbor Day. Since 2017, the company has given away more than 13,000 trees to customers throughout the state. The program helps customers conserve energy and reduce energy bills through strategic tree planting. The trees are shipped in 1-gallon buckets directly to customers' homes with planting and care instructions in time for National Arbor Day. ""Trees are a vital part of Florida's natural landscape, but they are also one of the leading causes of power outages, especially here in Florida, where high winds and hurricanes are common,"" said Melissa Seixas, Duke Energy Florida state president. ""Our crews and contractors work hard to balance aesthetics with our responsibility to protect the lines that deliver power to homes, businesses and critical services like hospitals, grocery stores and public safety facilities across the state."" Throughout the year, Duke Energy schedules periodic vegetation maintenance along power lines to minimize outages caused by trees in or near transmission and distribution rights of way. The company also performs additional maintenance ahead of hurricane season. Tree maintenance practices vary based on the voltage and type of line, as well as the type of tree and its proximity to the line. In some cases, the tree may need to be cut down to provide safe and reliable operation of the line. Trees located within the rights of way of high-voltage transmission lines are generally removed instead of pruned. ""We recognize that customers have concerns when trees are trimmed or removed in their neighborhoods,"" Seixas said. ""Know that we are following industry standards and federal requirements to ensure the health of the trees while also ensuring the integrity of power lines to continue providing the safe, reliable service we all depend on."" It is important to remember that customers, property owners and untrained contractors should not prune or cut trees and plants near power lines. In addition, when planting trees near power lines, be sure to select a low-growing variety to minimize impact to the lines. Also, contact Sunshine 811 before digging to locate any underground utilities, which are often located in utility easements.

This year, Terminix, a Rentokil Terminix company, has pledged to hit the streets of their communities, helping clean up the mess to prevent pests. As local communities gather together for Earth Day clean-up activities, it's crucial to ensure that our efforts to beautify and care for the environment do not inadvertently attract pests. To help keep pests from buzzing through community clean-up events, Terminix shared these tips: Dispose of Waste Properly: Ensure that all trash and debris collected during the clean-up are disposed of properly in sealed containers. Leaving trash bags lying around can attract pests like rodents, birds and insects. Avoid Food Waste: If organizing a clean-up event with food or snacks, be vigilant about cleaning up any food waste promptly. Food scraps are a magnet for pests, so dispose of them properly in sealed containers. Clean Up Standing Water: Pests, like mosquitoes, breed in standing water. After heavy rains or if working near bodies of water, be sure to clean up any standing water to prevent mosquito breeding grounds. Wear Protective Clothing: Consider lighter-colored clothing as lighter colors are less attractive to mosquitoes than darker colors. Long sleeves, pants and closed-toe shoes can help prevent insect bites and exposure to pests. Educate Participants: Educate volunteers and participants about the importance of proper waste disposal and hygiene to prevent attracting pests. Encourage everyone to be mindful of their surroundings and to report any pest sightings. Every piece of trash removed and every pest deterred will help bring communities closer to a healthier, more sustainable world. To join a local clean-up event near you please visit, earthday.org.

Katie McAlister, President of Cunard, said: ""We are so excited to welcome Queen Anne to our fleet as she completes a remarkable quartet alongside Queen Mary 2, Queen Elizabeth, and Queen Victoria – marking the first time since 1999 that Cunard will have four ships in simultaneous service. We are now fully focused on readying her to welcome guests for her maiden voyage on May 3 before she embarks on a historic British Isles Festival Voyage, including a momentous Naming Ceremony in Cunard's spiritual home of Liverpool on June 3.""

This beautiful and iconic ship testifies the longstanding partnership between our two companies, underscoring our shared commitment to excellence and tradition in the maritime industry. Queen Anne, as Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth, the other two ships we built for Cunard, proudly bear Fincantieri's signature, embodying our enduring expertise, reliability, and craftsmanship in shipbuilding. Constructing a liner for such a distinguished shipowner not only reconnects us to our origins but propels us towards the future with a determination to blend tradition and innovation. Fincantieri thus confirms its leadership in the cruise shipbuilding sector, a fundamental pillar of the company's business project, as both the Group's Business Plan and the vitality of the post-pandemic cruise sector clearly show.""

Net earnings for the first quarter of 2024, were $1.24 million, which represents an increase of $75.2 thousand or 6.4% in comparison with the same quarter last year. Net earnings per basic and diluted share were $0.39 for the first quarter of 2024 and $0.36 for the same quarter in 2023, respectively. Dann H. Bowman, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We are very pleased with the Bank’s performance in Q1’24. Loan quality remains very strong, with the Bank having only one delinquent loan at quarter-end, and no pending foreclosures, or OREO. Despite rising costs of doing business, so far, our small business customers have been able to adjust, and in several cases we have even seen improved financial performance. At this time the Bank has adequate capital and liquidity to continue to lend to its customers, and is expanding lending in the Inland Empire. In 2023 the Bank became a member of the Card Brand Association and began to directly process Merchant Services for its customers. Not only does this service introduce an additional non-interest source of revenue, but the Bank has also been able to provide significant savings and transparency to a number of our small business customers. Since the Pandemic of 2020, efficient and cost effective processing of electronic payments has become a very important part of managing cash flow and business operations. In the future we can envision expanding this service outside of our immediate market; and the revenue from this service becoming an increasingly important part of the Bank’s business model. In March, the Bank received preliminary approval from the OCC to open a new branch office in Corona. During March the Bank also completed the purchase of a commercial office building, at 1035 Montecito Avenue, Corona, CA, which will serve as the new Corona branch office. The Corona branch will be the Bank’s fifth location, and is expected to open in 4Q’24.” Financial Condition At March 31, 2024, total assets were $461.5 million, an increase of $15.1 million or 3.38% over $446.4 million at December 31, 2023.

Mergers & Acquisitions Analyst Indo Count's acquisition of WAMSUTTA, a brand with a significant heritage and a well-established customer base, indicates a strategic move to penetrate deeper into the premium segment of home fashions. This move may allow Indo Count to diversify its product offerings and enhance its market share, which can lead to revenue growth and improved profit margins due to the higher price points typically associated with luxury brands. Without the terms of the deal disclosed, investors should monitor future financial disclosures for the impact of this acquisition on Indo Count's balance sheet, particularly in terms of goodwill and intangible assets, which could affect financial leverage and return on investment metrics. Brand Strategy Analyst From a branding perspective, WAMSUTTA's heritage and reputation for luxury goods could greatly benefit Indo Count by expanding its reach into the higher-end market, which may result in increased brand equity. The key will be in the execution of integrating WAMSUTTA’s brand identity with Indo Count's operational excellence. Indo Count will need to maintain the brand's perceived value while leveraging economies of scale to maximize profitability. Consumer reception to this acquisition will be critical in assessing its success and investors should keep an eye on customer satisfaction metrics and market share data in subsequent quarters to gauge the effectiveness of the strategy. Textile Industry Analyst Within the textile industry, acquisitions can offer significant synergies including expansion of distribution networks, consolidation of supply chains and enhanced product development capabilities. With Indo Count being a large player in bed linen manufacturing, the absorption of WAMSUTTA provides an opportunity to fortify its global distribution footprint, leveraging WAMSUTTA's existing channels. However, challenges often arise in the form of cultural integration and streamlining of operations. Investors should look for indicators such as operational efficiency ratios post-acquisition and read through subsequent annual reports for signs of successful integration or potential difficulties. 04/19/2024 - 01:01 PM WAMSUTTA to elevate Indo Count’s brand portfolio and to have material impact on go-forward business NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Indo Count, the largest global bed linen manufacturer and exporter from India, announces its strategic acquisition of the international home fashions brand WAMSUTTA from Beyond, Inc.

Muchas felicidades to the selected students-each of our recipients is pursuing a technical degree and was awarded this scholarship based on their strong academic record, work in the community, leadership potential, and recommendations from professors. Get to know our impressive recipients in this short video and by reading more about their academic journeys below.Hear directly from the students as they dive into their personal experiences, post-graduation goals, and what drives them to shape the future of technology.Thank you to everyone who submitted applications this year. We hope to continue to reach STEM students from underrepresented groups with our upcoming scholarships. We also want to thank the talented individuals who were selected for sharing their inspiring stories and expressing how these programs have positively impacted their studies. We look forward to seeing where their passions take them next.Allison Delgado, Santa Clara University""As a child, I quickly noticed the stark difference in the availability of technology for the children in my mother's home country versus those around me in the United States. This imbalance of technology, crucial for medicine, education, and communication, made me realize that we are far from worldwide technological equity. This inspired me to study engineering so that I'd be able to share my perspectives and experiences to help bridge the technology access gap around the world.""Emily Grace Arana, University of California, Davis""Perseverance and energy conquers all! If you have a vision or a dream, it can be accomplished as long as you're willing to put in the time. Your goals may not be accomplished on your desired timeline, but if you want it bad enough, it doesn't matter how long it will take. Reach out to your network and consider all of your resources, there is help for you out there!""Jimena Noa-Guevara, Oregon State University""I am exploring the data science and human-computer interaction tracks within the computer science discipline. After graduating, I plan to enter the workforce for a few years and continue learning about how technology contributes to our world. However, the notion of ""why not?"" follows me everywhere, and I want to show people from diverse backgrounds that anything you put your mind to can be done. Thus, my end goal is to become the CEO of my own company, because: why not?!""Jose Guajardo, University of California, Berkeley""My first exposure to STEM was through a summer program that I attended at a local university in my hometown of Laredo, Texas. Over several summers in middle and high school, I learned fundamental math and science and was introduced to engineering through a LEGO Mindstorms project. Looking back, it's hard to imagine that such a program was available in my hometown, and I have no doubt that it planted a seed that grew into my interest in electrical engineering.""Rosalinda Garcia, Oregon State University""My advice to future STEM students is that community is key! Seeking out clubs or friends who understand your experiences is an important part of the support needed to persist and succeed. There are also folks in industry or with more experience who can relate to you and are more than happy to help you navigate toward your degree.""Sarah Barreto Ornellas, Massachusetts Institute of Technology""After graduation, I plan to focus on research and development of new medical devices, in either academic or private institutions. I hope to apply the knowledge gained during my graduate studies to the development of new biosensors that are less expensive to manufacture and that can collect important health-related data to help providers make informed decisions or enable new diagnostics or therapies.""Vinicius Cabral do Nascimento, Purdue University""You have the same potential as anyone else. You might have to work hard to catch up, but you are capable. Find student societies for underrepresented groups. Attend panels with professionals who are ahead in their careers and have gone through similar experiences. Their success will inspire, and their struggles are relatable. In the event of any friction, avoid assuming cultural differences are an irreparable alienating factor. Seek common ground, and don't put up barriers.""Xiomara Gonzalez, University of Texas at Austin""As a recipient of this scholarship, I will be able to participate in conferences and professional development opportunities related to my field of study. These events are crucial for learning about the evolving demands for technology and innovative approaches to address challenges that arise. They also offer a rich environment where I can share my research and hear about others' experiences.""Learn more about the Diversity in Technology Scholarship Program and check out our past recipients:2022 Latinx Students in Technology Recipients2021 Latinx Students in Technology Recipients2020 Latinx Students in Technology Recipients View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cadence Design Systems on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cadence Design SystemsWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cadence-design-systemsEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cadence Design SystemsView the original press release on accesswire.com What is the name of the scholarship for Latinx students in technology by Cadence in 2023?

Positive None. Negative None. Cybersecurity Expert The security breach at Caesars Rewards carries significant ramifications, both for the company's reputation and its operational stability. The sheer scale of this breach—impacting tens of millions—elevates the risk profile of Caesars Entertainment. Past cybersecurity incidents in the industry have shown that recovery costs can be substantial, as they often encompass enhancing security measures, legal fees and compensating affected parties. Moreover, the compromised data is particularly sensitive, including Social Security Numbers and government IDs, which heightens the risk of identity theft for individuals and consequently could lead to increased scrutiny from data protection authorities. Investors should be mindful of the potential for regulatory fines, legal challenges and a possible erosion of customer trust, all of which could affect the stock's performance in the midterm. Legal Expert Investigations by law firms into data breaches generally precede class-action lawsuits, which can result in significant financial settlements or judgements. While these investigations are common following a breach, they nonetheless signal potential legal headwinds for Caesars Entertainment. The legal outcomes could take years to materialize, but the immediate effect will likely be an increase in legal expenditures. Shareholders should consider the possible implications for future earnings, as litigation reserves may be established, impacting the company's financials. Furthermore, depending on the findings and the effectiveness of Caesars' data protection measures, there could be implications for the leadership's decision-making and governance practices. Financial Analyst The financial implications of a data breach of this magnitude cannot be overstated. It's not only the immediate clean-up costs but also the long-term reputational damage that could potentially lead to a decline in membership and spending within the Caesars Rewards ecosystem. The timing of the breach disclosure is also critical; coming out of a quarterly earnings period, any unexpected increase in operational expenses or legal provisions could disrupt the momentum of the stock price. Analyst estimates and investor sentiment might adjust to incorporate the perceived risks associated with the breach. Historically, companies that have experienced similar events have seen their valuations impacted by the market's assessment of management's response and the efficacy of remedial actions undertaken. 04/19/2024 - 12:15 PM NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / April 19, 2024 / On September 7, 2023, Caesars Rewards, a popular loyalty program run by Caesars Entertainment, Inc.

(NYSE: BWXT) announced today an investment to expand its Cambridge manufacturing plant. Already one of the largest nuclear commercial manufacturing facilities in North America, the site’s increased footprint will enable greater capacity to support ongoing and anticipated customers’ investments in Small Modular Reactors, traditional large-scale nuclear and advanced reactors, in Canada and around the world. The expansion, estimated to cost C$50 million, will increase the facility’s footprint 25 percent to 280,000 square feet. Additionally, over the next few years, BWXT will invest approximately C$30 million in advanced manufacturing equipment for the facility that has designed and manufactured hundreds of large nuclear components. This total estimated C$80 million investment will increase capacity significantly, improve productivity and create more than 200 long-term jobs for skilled workers, engineers and support staff in the area. John MacQuarrie, president of Commercial Operations, BWXT, stated, “Our expansion comes at a time when we’re supporting our customers in the successful execution of some of the largest clean nuclear energy projects in the world. At the same time, the global nuclear industry is increasingly being called upon to mitigate the impacts of climate change and increase energy security and independence. By investing significantly in our Cambridge manufacturing facility, BWXT is further positioning our business to serve our customers to produce more safe, clean and reliable electricity in Canada and abroad.” Construction for the BWXT Cambridge Expansion Project is expected to begin in the third quarter of 2024, adjacent to the existing plant, with no interruption to ongoing operations at the current facility. The project is estimated to be completed by the middle of 2026. Additionally, BWXT’s Projects and Field Services business will relocate to a stand-alone 150,000 square foot facility in Kitchener, Ont. The facility in Kitchener will be a state-of -the-art center for training, dynamic learning and technology development supporting the growth of the company’s nuclear business. Mike Rencheck, president and CEO of Bruce Power said, “The nuclear industry is powering Ontario’s economy, by supplying clean, reliable electricity, life-saving medical isotopes, and creating thousands of good jobs. We are supporting advanced manufacturing while providing a deeply decarbonized grid to attract new businesses to our province. The expansion at the BWXT facility in Cambridge is another great example of the positive impact our industry can have in communities all across the province. Clean air, cancer-fighting medical treatments, and economic expansion leading Ontario to a better future."" Ken Hartwick, president and CEO of Ontario Power Generation (OPG), said, “As we refurbish our existing nuclear facilities and build new, OPG is also generating jobs and economic activity in Ontario’s robust nuclear supply chain. BWXT’s planned expansion is a great example of how building out a system to meet Ontario’s increasing clean energy needs is also paying dividends for our province’s economy.” Recent announcements by provincial governments to increase emissions-free power generation have reinvigorated the nuclear industry in Canada. Within the last year, the Government of Ontario has announced support for building a total of four small modular reactors (SMRs) for Ontario Power Generation’s (OPG) Darlington New Nuclear Project; refurbishing OPG Pickering Nuclear Generating Station; and initiating pre-development work for siting up to 4,800 MWs of new nuclear power generation at Bruce Power. Premier of Ontario Doug Ford said, “We’re thrilled to see BWXT expand its footprint and create hundreds of new jobs in Cambridge. As our province continues to lead the future of nuclear energy, the company’s investment will help provide Ontario families and businesses with access to clean, reliable and affordable electricity for generations to come.” Todd Smith, Ontario Minister of Energy, said, “With shovels in the ground today on new nuclear generation, including the first small modular reactor in the G7, I’m so pleased to see global nuclear manufacturers like BWXT expanding their operations in Cambridge and hiring more Ontario workers. The benefits of Ontario’s nuclear industry reach far beyond the stations at Darlington, Pickering and Bruce, and this $80 million investment shows how all communities can help meet Ontario’s growing demand for clean energy, while also securing local investments and creating even more good-paying jobs.” BWXT is currently supporting nuclear plant life extension projects at OPG and Bruce Power. In 2023, BWXT was awarded the engineering contract for the BWRX-300 reactor pressure vessel for the OPG Darlington New Nuclear Project. As well, BWXT was awarded an engineering contract from TerraPower for the Natrium™ Demonstration Project underway in Kemmerer, Wyoming. Rex Geveden, president and Chief Executive Officer, BWXT, stated, “There is a sharp increase in government interest and funding for nuclear power, globally. BWXT is committed to bringing safe, clean and reliable electricity to businesses and communities, and this expansion will help us deliver on our commitment.” The Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, said, “Canada’s world-class manufacturing sector is supporting our global partners to build up net-zero technologies – including nuclear power plants.

The new programs are aligned with Expedia Group's Open World™ social impact and sustainability strategy and its commitment to building resilient prosperity for destinations across the world.""Responsible, sustainable travel means experiences that support local communities, while also protecting natural environments. Success requires collective effort - this is critical for the future of global travel,"" said Aditi Mohapatra, vice president of Global Social Impact and Sustainability at Expedia Group. ""Many DMOs are eager to take proactive actions on sustainability and social impact but may need initial support to get there. Expedia Group has invested in two new programs to further our destination partners' capabilities, to transform local travel offerings, and empower travelers to make more responsible travel choices.""Sustainability is a key value of travelers today. According to Expedia Group Media Solutions research, 90% of consumers already look for sustainable options when booking. And half of consumers would be willing to pay more for a trip if the travel options were more sustainable, meaning destination communities that offer more responsible tourism choices stand to enjoy economic benefits as well.[1]Taking Climate ActionExpedia Group has partnered with the Travel Foundation, a leading industry NGO, to launch a first-of-its kind educational program for DMOs called Destination Climate Champions. The online training course and peer learning network equips DMO staff with the knowledge and skills to serve as climate champions and incorporate a climate lens into their day-to-day work, while also creating a destination specific Climate Action Plan. The program further enables DMOs to communicate credibly with travelers about sustainable tourism in their destination and promote more eco-conscious travel.This program builds on Expedia Group's own commitment to greener travel and to reaching Net Zero emissions by 2040, all detailed in its Climate Action Plan released last year. Recognizing that many DMOs may lack the resources needed to create a tourism-specific Climate Action Plan, the course will help destinations better meet traveler expectations while building community and industry resilience to the impacts of climate change.The Destination Climate Champions program is being piloted with 30 destinations and three geographic cohorts across Europe, New Zealand, and the Northwest of the U.S. and Canada. The pilot cohorts began the training in February 2024 and the course will be available globally to additional DMOs later this year. There is no cost to participate; interested DMOs can register here.""We are excited to embark on this transformative journey and support our DMO partners in this space,"" said Rob Torres, senior vice president, Media Solutions at Expedia Group. ""We understand that for many of our partners, the topic of sustainability is an urgent issue to address, but is often complex, and it can be hard to know how to put words into meaningful action. Our partnership with Travel Foundation reflects our shared vision of a travel industry that prioritizes both people and the planet. We're providing DMOs with a step-by-step program that helps them to create a more environmentally-conscious approach to driving demand to their destinations.""Giving Back to the CommunityTo further support destinations and local communities, Expedia Group has launched the Destination Giveback Initiative. Expedia Group makes donations to local causes identified together with its DMO partner on behalf of both parties, and provides support to local communities where they need it most while driving tourism growth. Depending on the destination's overall level of partnership, the selected cause may also receive extra promotion across Expedia Group's global marketing channels.As an example, Destination Canada is one of Expedia Group's most valued destination partners and engaged with the Destination Giveback Initiative in 2023 as part of their overall partnership. Expedia Group made a one-time donation of $100,000 USD to The Indigenous Tourism Association of Canada (ITAC). The fund offers a unique opportunity for travelers, Indigenous businesses and non-Indigenous companies to actively participate in and support Indigenous tourism development.To learn more about the Destination Giveback Initiative, contact the Media Solutions team here.To learn more about the Destination Climate Champions program, please visit here.About Expedia GroupExpedia Group, Inc. brands power travel for everyone, everywhere through our global platform.

Wipro (WIT) a annoncé ses résultats financiers pour le trimestre et l'année se terminant le 31 mars 2024.

Les flux de trésorerie opérationnels ont été solides, atteignant 158,6% du résultat net annuel. Wipro (WIT) gab seine Finanzergebnisse für das Quartal und das am 31. März 2024 endende Jahr bekannt. Zu den Höhepunkten gehören eine Steigerung der Betriebsmarge im IT-Dienstleistungssegment um 40 Basispunkte im Vergleich zum Vorquartal, ein Anstieg des Nettogewinns um 5,2% im Vergleich zum Vorquartal und große Auftragsbuchungen in Höhe von 4,6 Milliarden Dollar, eine jährliche Steigerung von 17,4%. Die operativen Cashflows waren stark und erreichten 158,6% des Nettogewinns für das Jahr. Positive Increase in IT services segment operating margin by 40 bps QoQ. Net income increased by 5.2% QoQ. Large deal bookings at $4.6 billion, a YoY increase of 17.4%. Strong operating cash flows at 158.6% of net income for the year. Negative None. Financial Analyst The marginal improvement in IT services segment operating margin by 40 basis points (bps) quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) indicates a tighter control over costs or improved operational efficiency within Wipro's IT sector. Despite a flat gross revenue QoQ and a decline year-over-year (YoY), the uptick in operating margin is an indicator of potential resilience in the face of revenue pressures.Looking at net income, the 5.2% increase QoQ may be interpreted as a positive outcome from the firm's strategic initiatives, though the YoY decrease suggests that annual performance has faced headwinds. Notably, a standout figure is the operating cash flow standing at 158.6% of net income for the year, significantly above industry norms, which typically range closer to 100%. This could suggest that Wipro has managed its receivables exceptionally well, or has deferred some expenditures, which could have implications for future cash flow sustainability.For investors, the revenue guidance for the upcoming quarter with a potential decrease of up to 1.5% in constant currency terms should be considered within the context of the company's recent performance and broader industry trends. Market Research Analyst Wipro's large deal bookings have shown an impressive YoY increase of 17.4%, amounting to $4.6 billion. This metric is critical as it often serves as a leading indicator of future revenue and reflects the company's ability to secure substantial contracts. However, the total bookings have seen a decline of 5.5% YoY, potentially raising questions about the breadth of the deal pipeline and the company's market competitiveness.Focusing on the voluntary attrition rate of 14.2%, which is in line with the industry average for IT services, it reflects an ongoing challenge in talent retention and could impact operational stability and costs related to recruitment and training of new employees. The attrition rate should be monitored as it can affect customer service and project delivery in the future.The provided outlook suggests caution, which might be a reflection of the macroeconomic uncertainty cited by the CEO. Investors should weigh this alongside the company's robust cash flow when considering the stock's future performance. The mix of operational efficiencies with a cautious revenue outlook presents a nuanced picture of Wipro's positioning in a competitive and uncertain market. 04/19/2024 - 11:37 AM IT services segment operating margin increases 40 bps QoQ.

About Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release contains key metrics and non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G and Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K. Such non-GAAP financial measures are measures of our historical or future performance, financial position or cash flows that are adjusted to exclude or include amounts that are excluded or included, as the case may be, from the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS. The table at the end provides IT Services Revenue on a constant currency basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated by translating IT Services Revenue from the current reporting period into U.S. dollars based on the currency conversion rate in effect for the prior reporting period. We refer to growth rates in constant currency so that business results may be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Further, in the normal course of business, we may divest a portion of our business which may not be strategic. We refer to the growth rates in both reported and constant currency adjusting for such divestments in order to represent the comparable growth rates. Our key metrics and non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Our key metrics and non-GAAP financial measures are not comparable to, nor should be substituted for, an analysis of our revenue over time and involve estimates and judgments. In addition to our non-GAAP measures, the financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable IFRS financial measure should be carefully evaluated.

Das Unternehmen wird im Frühjahr die Speicherung maximieren, um den Wasserfluss im Sommer aufrechtzuerhalten und Dürrebedingungen zu mildern. Positive None. Negative None. 04/19/2024 - 11:39 AM CALGARY, Alberta, April 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TransAlta Corporation (“TransAlta” or the “Company”) (TSX: TA) (NYSE: TAC) announced today that it has signed onto a voluntary water-sharing memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) with over thirty other water licence holders in the Bow River Basin. Water-sharing MOUs have been initiated by the Government of Alberta, across Southern Alberta, to coordinate water needs in what is expected to be a lower water year. Due to its role managing water storage and water flows in the Bow River system for power generation, drought prevention and flood control, the Company is collaborating with other downstream water licence holders to manage water flows. TransAlta will contribute to this effort by maximizing storage of run-off in the spring and then use that water to manage river flows during the summer. The MOUs do not include TransAlta’s facilities on the North Saskatchewan River system. “TransAlta recognizes the unique role our Bow River system plays in managing water flows while also serving as a key component of Alberta’s electricity grid. We look forward to working with the Government and downstream licence holders to maximize water storage in the spring and sustain water flow during the summer months to help mitigate drought conditions, should they occur,” said Blain van Melle, Executive Vice President, Commercial and Customer Relations. TransAlta expects these water management efforts during the spring and summer seasons to align with its electricity generation objectives and practices. The Company does not expect this voluntary arrangement to have a material impact on the performance of TransAlta’s hydro fleet and hydro operations are expected to perform consistent with the Company's guidance range for 2024 based on current water forecasts. TransAlta continues to retain full capacity and capability to respond when these hydro facilities are needed by the electricity grid and will continue to meet environmental obligations.

The enterprise value of the Possible Offer is approximately $100.6 million. Negative Progress would assume potential liabilities of approximately $20 million if the acquisition of MariaDB is completed. Mergers & Acquisitions Analyst Progress Software Corp's interest in acquiring MariaDB plc indicates a strategic move that could potentially enhance its market position by expanding its database technology portfolio. The offer's premium over recent trading prices suggests Progress sees intrinsic value in MariaDB that is not currently reflected in its share price. When evaluating such a transaction, it's essential to consider the competitive landscape and the inherent synergies between the two companies. A successful acquisition could lead to cost savings, increased market share and revenue growth for Progress. However, as the deal is not yet final, there's a risk that terms may change or the offer might not proceed. Investors should watch for further developments, as an eventual agreement would likely have a material impact on both companies' financials and strategic trajectories. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the proposed offer for MariaDB at a premium indicates that Progress Software Corp is confident about the potential financial benefits of the acquisition. The offer would value MariaDB at an enterprise value that is twice its annual revenue, which is a key valuation metric. Moving forward, stakeholders should monitor how this acquisition could affect Progress's earnings and cash flow. The assumption of MariaDB's liabilities, which are estimated at about $20 million, would impact the firm's balance sheet. Thus, monitoring Progress's post-acquisition financial health will be important for investors considering the short-term liquidity impact and the long-term earnings potential. Legal & Compliance Analyst The announcement falls under Rule 2.4 of the Irish Takeover Rules, indicating that this is a preliminary stage where an official offer has not been committed. Investors need to be aware of the regulatory framework governing such transactions, which can affect the timeline and certainty of a deal's completion. Compliance with these rules is mandatory and any deviations could lead to delays or additional scrutiny. It's important for investors to keep an eye on further announcements that would move the offer from the 'possible' to the 'firm' category in accordance with Rule 2.7, as this would signal a higher likelihood that the acquisition will proceed. 04/19/2024 - 09:15 AM BURLINGTON, Mass., April 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NOT FOR RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION (IN WHOLE OR IN PART) IN, INTO OR FROM ANY JURISDICTION WHERE TO DO SO WOULD CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF THE RELEVANT LAWS OF SUCH JURISDICTION. THIS IS AN ANNOUNCEMENT UNDER RULE 2.4 OF THE IRISH TAKEOVER PANEL ACT, 1997, TAKEOVER RULES, 2022 (THE ""TAKEOVER RULES"") AND IS NOT AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF A FIRM INTENTION TO MAKE AN OFFER UNDER RULE 2.7 OF THE TAKEOVER RULES. THERE CAN BE NO CERTAINTY THAT ANY OFFER WILL BE MADE, NOR AS TO THE TERMS ON WHICH ANY SUCH OFFER WILL BE MADE. POSSIBLE CASH OFFER for MARIADB PLC by PROGRESS SOFTWARE CORP. Summary Further to the announcement made by Progress Software Corp. (“Progress”) on March 26, 2024 (the “March Possible Offer Announcement”), Progress is today announcing, under Rule 2.4 of the Irish Takeover Rules, that it is considering a possible offer (the “Possible Offer”) to acquire all of the debt and the entire issued and to be issued share capital of MariaDB plc (“MariaDB”).Under the Possible Offer, each MariaDB shareholder would be entitled to receive: $0.60 for each MariaDB share, payable in cash. The Possible Offer would represent a premium of approximately: 9 per cent. to the possible offer of $0.55 per share made by K1 Capital, announced on February 16, 2024;88 per cent. to MariaDB’s average closing share price on the last 30 trading days prior to the March Possible Offer Announcement; and216 per cent. to MariaDB’s closing share price on February 5, 2024, the last full trading day prior to the announcement by MariaDB of a forbearance agreement with RP Ventures LLC. The Possible Offer values MariaDB’s entire issued ordinary share capital at approximately $40.6 million.In addition, in connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Possible Offer, Progress proposes that it would complete the purchase or repayment of the Senior Secured Promissory Note issued by MariaDB to RP Ventures LLC (“RP Ventures”), a company associated with Runa Capital, Inc. (“Runa”), on October 10, 2023 (the “RP Note”), with RP Ventures being entitled to receive: $40 million in total with respect to the RP Note (but excluding any amounts attributable to ownership of MariaDB shares).This represents a premium of approximately 55 per cent. to the outstanding amount of the RP Note including the principal and accrued interest as of March 31, 2024 of approximately $25.9 million. The Possible Offer implies an enterprise value of approximately $100.6 million and a multiple of approximately 2 times MariaDB’s revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. Given the liquidity challenges faced by MariaDB, there are other potential outstanding liabilities, estimated to be approximately $20 million, which would be assumed by Progress should it complete an acquisition of MariaDB. Progress is engaging with stakeholders with a view towards making a firm offer, under Rule 2.7 of the Irish Takeover Rules, to acquire all of the debt and the entire issued and to be issued share capital of MariaDB (the “Firm Offer”) as quickly as possible.Commenting on today’s announcement, Yogesh Gupta, CEO of Progress, said: “Our ongoing due diligence of MariaDB’s business has continued to strengthen our belief that Progress is the ideal fit for the customers, shareholders, people and community members of MariaDB. We remain excited about a possible combination with MariaDB and look forward to continuing our engagement and rapidly bringing this matter to a mutually beneficial conclusion.” Progress Background to and Reasons for the Possible Offer Progress believes there is a compelling strategic and financial rationale for an acquisition of MariaDB by Progress, and believes that Progress is the ideal long-term partner for MariaDB.Progress believes the relational database management (RDBMS) product from MariaDB offers an attractive value proposition for its customers looking for a scalable, reliable open-source RDBMS and that it has a proven track record of both delivering mission-critical database management products and collaborating with and nurturing a vibrant open-source community.Progress believes that MariaDB would be an excellent addition to the Progress portfolio, by providing relational database capabilities to customers with applications built with a wide variety of languages and approaches. Progress has made other recent acquisitions to extend its database capabilities, and believes that the combination of data platforms provides the means for our customers to embrace AI, leveraging private information with LLMs using Retrieval Augmented Generation.Customer success, along with innovation and acquisition, is foundational to Progress’ strategy and is reflected by its high retention rates and customer satisfaction scores.

MariaDB’s financial position, Board composition and transaction structure Progress understands that the MariaDB Board has been placed in a difficult position because of its challenging financial position. Progress also understands that RP Ventures has the right to foreclose the RP Note, resulting in a potential liquidity issue, and that RP Ventures has de facto controlling rights over the Maria DB Board.In formulating the Possible Offer, Progress has balanced the requirement for the RP Note to be purchased or repaid at a significant premium and the interests of the MariaDB business, MariaDB shareholders and all other stakeholders.

On April 12, 2024, the Company announced the entry into an investors relations agreement with GSM Group to raise awareness of the Company’s shares among investors.

About GPAC Great Pacific Gold has a portfolio of high-grade gold projects in Papua New Guinea (“PNG”) and Australia. In PNG, Great Pacific Gold recently acquired a significant 2,166 sq. km mineral exploration land package in PNG. The land package comprises of exploration licenses (EL) and exploration license applications (ELA). It includes both early-stage and advanced-stage exploration targets with high-grade epithermal vein and porphyry-style mineralisation present. The Arau Project consists of two exploration licenses, located in the Kainantu region, and includes the Mt. Victor Prospect, where previous drilling found a multiple phase intrusion complex hosting copper and gold mineralisation. The Wild Dog Project consists of one granted exploration license, EL 2761, and one exploration license application, ELA 2516, located on the island of New Britain and about 50 km southwest of Rabaul and Kokopo, PNG. The Kesar Creek Project consists of one exploration license, EL 2711, and is contiguous with the K92 Mining Inc. tenements. In Australia, Great Pacific Gold began with two, 100% owned, high-grade gold projects called the Lauriston and Golden Mountain Projects, and has since acquired a large area of granted and application tenements containing further epizonal (low-temperature) high-grade gold mineralisation and associated intrusion-related gold mineralization all in the state of Victoria, Australia. The Great Pacific Gold land package, assembled over a multi-year period, notably includes the Lauriston Project which is a 535 sq. km property immediately to the south of and within the same geological framework that hosts Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd’s Fosterville Gold Mine and associated exploration tenements. The Golden Mountain Project is an intrusion-related gold project on the edge of the Strathbogie granite and occurs at the northern end of the Walhalla Gold Belt. The acquired projects include the epizonal gold Providence Project containing the Reedy Creek goldfield which adjoins the Southern Cross Gold’s Sunday Creek exploration project and a large group of recently consolidated granted tenements called the Walhalla Gold Belt Project, which contain a variety of epizonal and intrusion related style gold mineralisation. Additionally, Great Pacific Gold has another gold-focused project called the Moormbool project which has epizonal style gold mineralisation and associated potential intrusion-related gold mineralisation, as well as the Beechworth Project occurs in the northeast of the state and contains intrusion related and mesozonal gold mineralization. All GPAC’s properties in Australia are 100% owned and have had historical gold production from hard rock sources despite limited modern exploration and drilling.

While most want to live to 90-well past the average U.S. life expectancy of 77.5 years-nearly two-thirds (66%) would choose a shorter, healthier life over a longer one with health issues. These findings, from a survey conducted by global healthcare technology leader Medtronic with Morning Consult, highlight a gap between U.S. adults' desire to live healthier years and the opportunity for more people to improve their quality of life through healthcare technology.With almost limitless health-related information at our fingertips and new healthcare innovations emerging daily, the American dream of extending both our lifespan and quality of life seems possible. However, only 39% of U.S. adults say they are taking preventative health measures such as screenings and regular medical check-ups, and less than a third (29%) are discussing longevity with their doctor. Only about half are focused on eating healthy (53%) and exercising (51%), despite diet and physical inactivity being leading contributors to chronic disease. And while 80% of Americans believe healthcare technology can help them live longer and healthier, only 18% are taking advantage of it.""Health conditions can impact anyone at any age, so it's critical that we expand treatment options while also continuing to focus on prevention, so people can prioritize what's most important to them,"" said Dr. Laura Mauri, chief scientific, medical and regulatory officer at Medtronic. ""The role of technology in helping people live longer and better lives is accelerating. It's enabling more personalized treatments, quicker recoveries and earlier diagnosis. What's more, every day researchers are discovering new technologies that continue to improve longevity and quality of life.""Perhaps the greatest power of technology is the range of options - and hope - it can give people regardless of their current health status. Already, healthcare technology is helping catch cancer before it progresses, treat pain with less oral medication and reduce the burden from chronic diseases.""In my 19 years as a diabetic, I feel more supported by my diabetes technology than I ever have before,"" said Cameron Moore, who uses a Medtronic insulin pump with meal detection technology. ""It means I worry less about complications so I can focus on the here and now of life with my family and enjoy each day to the fullest.""There are steps people can take today to take charge of their health and live their best life. Follow the acronym T.E.C.H.:Talk to your doctor - Thanks to technologies like AI, there are new screening options that help detect and treat diseases earlier, including several common cancers and avoiding stroke. Ask your doctor what's available and how it might benefit you.Explore treatment options - No one wants to be defined by their disease or ailment. Technology is helping reduce the burden of living with chronic conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and neurologic disease and tech can also be an alternative to opioids for chronic pain.Check your assumptions - Some people delay getting treatment due to worry about a long hospitalization or recovery time. Non-invasive or minimally invasive surgery procedures are resulting in fewer complications, shorter hospital stays and faster return to normal activities.Honor your needs - Ensure your doctor knows what's important to you - attending a special event, continuing an activity you enjoy, or simplifying your care. This will help them develop a treatment plan with you that prioritizes your quality of life.For more information on how Medtronic is advancing healthcare through technology and helping people live longer and healthier, visit Medtronic.com.About the Consumer Perceptions of Longevity Survey The survey was conducted by decision intelligence company Morning Consult among a nationally representative sample of 2,200 adults in the U.S. from February 15-20, 2024, with an unweighted margin of error of +/- 2 percentage points.About Medtronic Bold thinking.

(NASDAQ:VINO), a company that includes a growing collection of e-commerce platforms with a concentration on fine wines, luxury real estate, and leather goods and accessories (the ""Company"" or ""Gaucho Holdings""), today announced its strategic response to recent economic developments in Argentina. As the gap between Argentina's parallel and official exchange rates narrows, creating a more stable economic environment, Gaucho Holdings projects significant positive impacts on its real estate operations in the region.Amid recent financial reports indicating a narrowing gap between the parallel and official exchange rates in Argentina, Gaucho Group Holdings, Inc. acknowledges the potential shifts in the economic landscape. Since peaking at AR$1,250 on December 23, 2023, two weeks after President Javier Milei took office, the blue rate has fallen significantly, bringing the gap with the official dollar rate (currently AR$869.7) to about 13%. In November 2023, the gap was close to 200%. With this potential impending parity, significant changes in the banking sector's approach to mortgages are anticipated.Gaucho Group Holdings' Chief Operating Officer (Argentina Operations), Sergio Manzur Odstrcil, shared his insights: ""We are observing crucial economic indicators that suggest a positive shift within the next 6 to 8 months. As inflation decreases, we anticipate the unification of the dollar value in the market, which we expect will prompt Argentine banks to reintroduce mortgage lending. This development could potentially invigorate the real estate sector, increasing both sales and property values. Our observations are aligned with broader financial trends where sustained inflation reduction and economic stabilization may soon facilitate the return of long-term mortgage loans, which have been absent for years.""Scott Mathis, CEO and Founder of Gaucho Group Holdings, commented on the real estate prospects: ""The alignment of decreasing inflation with the stabilization of Argentina's financial framework forms a favorable foundation for our real estate ventures. Particularly, our properties at Algodon Wine Estates, and others in San Rafael and Cordoba, are projected to fetch premiums well above current market rates in the coming months. This adjustment is supported by the anticipated increase in real estate activities and the potential shift in banking practices to offer more favorable lending rates. We are poised to significantly contribute to and benefit from these transformative developments in Argentina's economic landscape.""Gaucho Holdings remains committed to its strategic initiatives in Argentina, focusing on leveraging the emerging economic conditions to enhance value for its stakeholders and playing a pivotal role in the evolving market dynamics.About Gaucho Group Holdings, Inc.For more than ten years, Gaucho Group Holdings, Inc.'s (gauchoholdings.com) mission has been to source and develop opportunities in Argentina's undervalued luxury real estate and consumer marketplace.

More than 220,000 patients were involved in the INSPIRE Pneumonia and UTI Trials at 59 HCA Healthcare hospitals. Tailoring antibiotic prescriptions to individual patients can preserve healthy bacteria and reduce the risk of future antibiotic resistance. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst New findings in antibiotic stewardship based on algorithm-driven alerts are a testament to how technology can enhance healthcare outcomes. In particular, for companies operating within the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries, this signifies a move towards more personalized medicine, an area receiving considerable investment and interest. By tailoring antibiotic prescriptions to individual patients, healthcare providers are able to preserve the patient's healthy bacteria while mitigating the risk of antibiotic resistance, a prominent public health concern. The studies' ability to demonstrate improved clinical outcomes could lead to increased adoption of such technology-driven approaches in hospitals. Moreover, companies providing these technological solutions could see growth opportunities as the healthcare sector increasingly acknowledges the importance of combating antibiotic resistance. Healthcare Industry Analyst The ripple effect of improved antibiotic stewardship through algorithm-driven alerts in hospitals is likely to influence the broader healthcare market. As antibiotic resistance continues to challenge public health, strategies that enhance treatment efficacy and prevent resistance are in high demand. This could lead to an increased market for healthcare IT solutions that offer similar benefits. Investors might see potential in stocks of companies specializing in healthcare analytics and clinical decision support systems. Furthermore, long-term cost savings from reduced antibiotic resistance could positively impact healthcare providers' financial outcomes, potentially leading to more stable and lucrative healthcare investments. 04/19/2024 - 09:30 AM Algorithm driven alerts help identify best antibiotic for patients with common infections in two 59-hospital trials, with implications to reduce antibiotic resistance NASHVILLE, Tenn. & ORANGE, Calif. & ATLANTA & BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Two large multi-state studies uncovered a highly effective way to improve antibiotic selection for patients hospitalized with pneumonia or urinary tract infections (UTI), enabling better antibiotic stewardship in hospitals, according to research studies published today in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). Stewardship Prompts to Improve Antibiotic Selection for Pneumonia Stewardship Prompts to Improve Antibiotic Selection for Urinary Tract Infection The studies, led by Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute, HCA Healthcare and the University of California, Irvine, were funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Antibiotic resistance, which occurs when germs like bacteria and fungi mutate to defeat the drugs designed to kill them, is a major public health threat. Helping clinicians tailor antibiotic prescriptions to individual patients can improve patient outcomes by preserving healthy bacteria in the body and reducing the risk of future antibiotic resistance. The two newly published studies, the INSPIRE Pneumonia and UTI Trials, involved more than 220,000 patients with pneumonia or UTI in 59 HCA Healthcare hospitals. In half of the hospitals, clinicians were given algorithm driven computerized alerts with information about the best antibiotic match for an individual patient at the moment antibiotics were being prescribed. This resulted in a better match for 28% of pneumonia patients and 17% of patients with UTI when compared to hospitals where physicians were not provided with alerts according to the trials. The alerts used patient characteristics from the electronic medical record as well as hospital and location-specific data to determine the patient’s risk for an antibiotic-resistant infection. Assessment of risk was based on pre-trial data from more than 200,000 HCA Healthcare patients with pneumonia and UTI. Physicians treating patients with a low risk for antibiotic-resistant bacteria were prompted to give standard-spectrum antibiotics. “Pneumonia and urinary tract infections are two of the most common infections requiring hospitalization and a major reason for overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics,” said Sujan Reddy, MD, Medical Officer in the Epidemiology, Research and Innovations Branch of CDC’s Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion. “The INSPIRE trials have found a highly effective way to help physicians follow treatment recommendations to optimize antibiotic selection for each patient. These trials show the value of harnessing electronic health data to improve best practice.” Physicians often choose extended-spectrum antibiotics that cover a very broad range of bacteria out of concern that their patients could be sick with antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The INSPIRE trials identified patients with low risk for antibiotic resistance and prompted physicians to order standard-spectrum antibiotics if extended-spectrum antibiotics were being ordered. The trials found that giving physicians real-time information about their patients’ risk for antibiotic resistance worked significantly better to align antibiotic prescribing with current Infectious Diseases Society of America treatment recommendations. “The right information at the right time can improve physician antibiotic selection,” said Shruti Gohil, MD, MPH, Assistant Professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine. “Many different bacteria can cause pneumonia or UTI, and picking the best matched antibiotic can be a challenge. Results from these trials show that giving physicians an alert informing them of their patient’s actual risk for antibiotic resistance can help them choose the best antibiotic and reduce extended-spectrum antibiotic use.” The INSPIRE trials were ongoing when the COVID-19 pandemic began. The trials showed continued beneficial effects in antibiotic selection when other hospitals in the nation were reporting large increases in use of extended-spectrum antibiotics. Part of this benefit is attributed to having an automated prompt that continues to work when hospital resources and staff attention are diverted. The 59 participating community hospitals spanned 12 states and are part of HCA Healthcare, the largest private inpatient healthcare system in the U.S. The size of the studies involving a wide breadth of community hospitals supports the likelihood that results are applicable to hospitals across the country. “HCA Healthcare is committed to excellence and innovation in delivering high-quality healthcare, and we are honored to continue our longstanding collaboration with the CDC, Harvard and UCI to leverage our health system’s scale to answer clinical questions for the benefit of patients,” said Kenneth Sands, MD, MPH, chief epidemiologist at HCA Healthcare. “We began using this groundbreaking technology and workflow in the hospitals where we tested it, and have since implemented it across our entire system to improve care for individual patients while also contributing to our growing body of work supporting appropriate antibiotic use everywhere.” The studies were conducted through a scientific consortium including HCA Healthcare, Harvard Medical School’s Department of Population Medicine at the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute, the University of California, Irvine and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Delivering exceptional CX demands a multidimensional approach to holistic transformation amid profound shifts.

Rapidly advancing GenAI is poised to disrupt the industry. “Enterprises are seeking strategic partnerships to help successfully navigate the evolving contact center customer experience landscape,” said Iain Fisher, director, ISG Provider Lens Research. “Service providers are taking on substantial risks, while seeking greater rewards, investing in and expanding their portfolio of services and solutions to serve enterprise needs.” For the Contact Center - Customer Experience Services study, ISG has distributed surveys to 85 contact center service providers. Working in collaboration with ISG’s global advisors, the research team will produce four quadrants representing the digital services and products the typical enterprise is buying, based on ISG’s experience working with its clients. The four quadrants are: Digital Operations, evaluating service providers’ broad capabilities to address the end-to-end value chain of contact center services. Providers must offer consulting services; domain knowledge; maturity assessments; industry expertise; talent onboarding, training and retention, and technology know-how. Intelligent Agent Experience, assessing service providers’ abilities to ensure agents have the necessary infrastructure and programs for successful CX. This quadrant encompasses technological and non-technological aspects, including unified communications, AI-based agent assistance, gamification, training, curriculum and more.

MetroCity Bankshares, Inc. a déclaré un bénéfice net de 14,6 millions de dollars pour le premier trimestre de 2024, témoignant d'une croissance positive par rapport au trimestre précédent. Le retour annuel sur les actifs moyens et les capitaux propres s'est amélioré, tandis que le total des actifs et des dépôts a augmenté. La marge nette d'intérêt a également connu une hausse, renforçant la performance financière de l'entreprise. MetroCity Bankshares, Inc. meldete einen Nettogewinn von 14,6 Millionen Dollar für das erste Quartal 2024, was ein positives Wachstum gegenüber dem Vorquartal zeigt. Die annualisierte Rendite auf durchschnittliche Vermögenswerte und Eigenkapital verbesserte sich, während die gesamten Vermögenswerte und Einlagen zunahmen. Auch die Nettozinsmarge erhöhte sich, was die finanzielle Leistung des Unternehmens stärkte. Positive Net income increased by $3.3 million, or 28.9%, from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024. Annualized return on average assets improved to 1.65% in Q1 2024 from 1.29% in Q4 2023. Total assets increased by $144.4 million, or 4.1%, to $3.65 billion in Q1 2024. Efficiency ratio improved to 37.9% in Q1 2024 compared to 45.1% in Q4 2023. Noninterest income increased by $856,000, or 18.2%, from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst MetroCity Bankshares, Inc. experienced a significant rise in net income of $3.3 million for Q1 2024 compared to Q4 2023. This 28.9% increase was primarily influenced by a surge in net interest income and a decline in noninterest expenses, indicating efficient management of resources and cost control strategies. A focus on the 1.65% annualized return on average assets reveals an improvement from the previous quarter, suggesting that the company has utilized its assets more profitably. However, year-over-year, the net income dip of 7.0% warrants investor attention as it may reflect changing market conditions or operational challenges. Credit Analyst The slight decrease in net interest margin year-over-year to 3.24% may signal a competitive interest rate environment or cost pressures on deposit growth. However, the stability in the bank's asset quality, with the allowance for credit losses slightly up at 0.58% of total loans, is reassuring. MetroCity's strategic positioning, keeping nonperforming assets at 0.83% of total assets, can be perceived as a strength, contrasting with the increase from the previous year which may raise caution. Market Research Analyst MetroCity's asset growth, particularly a 4.1% quarter-over-quarter increase, is indicative of a proactive approach to business expansion. The bank's 3.0% deposit growth signifies a healthy liquidity position, which is important for continuing operations and funding future loan growth. It is also worth noting the shift in deposit composition, with noninterest-bearing deposits decreasing year-over-year, which might affect the net interest margin given the cost of funds. 04/19/2024 - 09:00 AM ATLANTA, April 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- MetroCity Bankshares, Inc. (""MetroCity"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: MCBS), holding company for Metro City Bank (the ""Bank""), today reported net income of $14.6 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $11.3 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2023, and $15.7 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2023.

Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Interest income totaled $52.4 million for the first quarter of 2024, an increase of $1.7 million, or 3.3%, from the previous quarter, primarily due to a 23 basis points increase in the loan yield and a $106.2 million increase in average loan balances.

Interest expense totaled $25.3 million for the first quarter of 2024, an increase of $724,000, or 2.9%, from the previous quarter, primarily due to a 35 basis points increase in time deposit costs and an 11 basis point increase in borrowings costs coupled with a $90.1 million increase in average interest-bearing liabilities. As compared to the first quarter of 2023, interest expense for the first quarter of 2024 increased by $5.5 million, or 28.1%, due to a 49 basis points increase in deposit costs and a 134 basis points increase in borrowing costs coupled with a $215.2 million increase in average interest-bearing deposits.

The weighted average pay rate for these interest rate derivatives is 2.29%. During the first quarter of 2024, we recorded a credit to interest expense of $4.1 million from the benefit received on these interest rate derivatives compared to a benefit of $3.1 million and $166,000 recorded during the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2023, respectively.

Noninterest Income Noninterest income for the first quarter of 2024 was $5.6 million, an increase of $856,000, or 18.2%, from the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher gains on sale of Small Business Administration (""SBA"") and residential mortgage loans, as well as higher SBA and mortgage servicing income, offset by lower mortgage loan fees, service charges on deposit accounts and other income. SBA and mortgage loan sales totaled $24.1 million and $21.9 million, respectively, during the first quarter of 2024. There were no SBA or mortgage loan sales during the fourth quarter of 2023.

Noninterest Expense Noninterest expense for the first quarter of 2024 totaled $12.4 million, a decrease of $1.6 million, or 11.2%, from $13.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2023.

Compared to the first quarter of 2023, noninterest expense during the first quarter of 2024 increased by $1.6 million, or 14.4%, primarily due to higher salary and employee benefits, occupancy expense, FDIC insurance premiums and professional fees, partially offset by lower loan and other real estate owned related expenses.

Uninsured deposits were 23.0% of total deposits at March 31, 2024, compared to 26.5% and 31.9% at December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively. As of March 31, 2024, we had $1.22 billion of available borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank ($694.9 million), Federal Reserve Discount Window ($480.8 million) and various other financial institutions (fed fund lines totaling $47.5 million). Asset Quality The Company recorded a credit provision for credit losses of $140,000 during the first quarter of 2024, compared to a provision for credit losses expense of $782,000 recorded during the fourth quarter of 2023. No provision for credit losses was recorded during the first quarter of 2023. The credit provision recorded during the first quarter of 2024 was primarily due the decrease in the general reserves allocated to our residential mortgage loan portfolio as a large amount of residential mortgage loans were moved from loans held for investment to loans held for sale during the quarter. Annualized net recoveries to average loans for the first quarter of 2024 was 0.00%, compared to a net charge-off of 0.04% for the fourth quarter of 2023 and a net recovery of 0.00% for the first quarter of 2023. Nonperforming assets totaled $30.3 million, or 0.83% of total assets, at March 31, 2024, a decrease of $8.1 million from $38.4 million, or 1.10% of total assets, at December 31, 2023, and an increase of $10.8 million from $19.5 million, or 0.57% of total assets, at March 31, 2023. The decrease in nonperforming assets at March 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 was due to a $1.4 million decrease in nonaccrual loans, a $6.7 million decrease in accruing restructured loans and a $14,000 decrease in other real estate owned. Allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.58% at March 31, 2024, compared to 0.57% at December 31, 2023 and 0.63% at March 31, 2023.

Forward-looking statements are not historical in nature and may be identified by references to a future period or periods by the use of the words ""believe,"" ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""estimate,"" ""project,"" ""outlook,"" or words of similar meaning, or future or conditional verbs such as ""will,"" ""would,"" ""should,"" ""could,"" or ""may."" The forward-looking statements in this press release should not be relied on because they are based on current information and on assumptions that we make about future events and circumstances that are subject to a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties that are often difficult to predict and beyond our control. As a result of those risks and uncertainties, and other factors, our actual financial results in the future could differ, possibly materially, from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this press release and could cause us to make changes to our future plans. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to: the impact of current and future economic conditions, particularly those affecting the financial services industry, including the effects of declines in the real estate market, high unemployment rates, inflationary pressures, elevated interest rates and slowdowns in economic growth, as well as the financial stress on borrowers as a result of the foregoing; potential impacts of adverse developments in the banking industry highlighted by high-profile bank failures, including impacts on customer confidence, deposit outflows, liquidity and the regulatory response thereto; risks arising from media coverage of the banking industry; risks arising from perceived instability in the banking sector; changes in the interest rate environment, including changes to the federal funds rate; changes in prices, values and sales volumes of residential and commercial real estate; developments in our mortgage banking business, including loan modifications, general demand, and the effects of judicial or regulatory requirements or guidance; competition in our markets that may result in increased funding costs or reduced earning assets yields, thus reducing margins and net interest income; interest rate fluctuations, which could have an adverse effect on the Company's profitability; legislation or regulatory changes which could adversely affect the ability of the consolidated Company to conduct business combinations or new operations; changes in tax laws; significant turbulence or a disruption in the capital or financial markets and the effect of a fall in stock market prices on our investment securities; the effects of war or other conflicts including the impacts related to or resulting from Russia's military action in Ukraine or the conflict in Israel and the surrounding region; and adverse results from current or future litigation, regulatory examinations or other legal and/or regulatory actions, including as a result of the Company's participation in and execution of government programs. Therefore, the Company can give no assurance that the results contemplated in the forward-looking statements will be realized.

In addition, our actual financial results in the future may differ from those currently expected due to additional risks and uncertainties of which we are not currently aware or which we do not currently view as, but in the future may become, material to our business or operating results. Due to these and other possible uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained in this press release or to make predictions based solely on historical financial performance. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by law.

Financial Analyst The announcement of the regulatory approval and the closing date for the merger between Burke & Herbert Financial Services Corp. and Summit Financial Group, Inc. signifies the culmination of a key strategic move which can potentially reshape both the competitive landscape and the operational synergy of the merging entities. From a financial perspective, the 'merger of equals' term suggests a deal designed to avoid a significant premium for either party, potentially leading to a more equitable distribution of merger benefits.Investors should consider how mergers can result in cost savings through economies of scale, revenue enhancement opportunities from cross-selling and expanded product lines and a stronger combined balance sheet. However, they should also be wary of the integration risks and potential cultural clashes that could offset these benefits. Given that the merger is slated for completion on May 3, 2024, shareholders would need to stay informed leading up to the annual shareholder meeting on July 15, which will likely shed more light on the merger's progression and future plans. Market Research Analyst Examining the regional banking industry in which Burke & Herbert and Summit operate, consolidation trends are prevalent, driven by a need for greater scale in the face of regulatory costs and technological investments. This merger could place the newly formed entity in a stronger competitive position against larger national banks. Additionally, it will be interesting for shareholders to monitor the post-merger market share and whether the combined bank can leverage its increased size for better loan pricing and deposit gathering.One aspect to watch is how the market reacts to the finalized merger terms. It's not uncommon to see fluctuations in stock prices as markets reevaluate the merged entity's value. For retail investors, analyzing how similar mergers have affected both short-term volatility and long-term performance in the sector can provide valuable context for this transaction. 04/19/2024 - 08:30 AM Burke & Herbert Annual Shareholder Meeting Date Established ALEXANDRIA, Va. and MOOREFIELD, W.Va., April 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Burke & Herbert Financial Services Corp.
